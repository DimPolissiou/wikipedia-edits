In conjunction with an international organisation, authorities sponsored and participated in trainings on victim identification and assistance for consular officials and law enforcement, regulation of marriage migration, and interagency implementation of the national referral mechanism. The Ministry of Public Security promulgated written instructions to law enforcement officers throughout the country with the aim of clarifying procedures for identifying victims among individuals in prostitution and those who may be subjected to exploitation via forced or fraudulent marriage. The government reported funding training in rural areas for court officials and prosecutors; however, it did not provide detailed information on these efforts. In addition, law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges attended trainings on trafficking organized by other countries and international organizations; when authorities participated in these trainings, the PRC sometimes provided speakers and venues, and funded lodging, transportation, and meals for some participants.The office to combat trafficking in persons developed and approved trafficking victim identification procedures and disseminated them to law enforcement officials throughout the country. The government acknowledged that victim identification procedures varied according to local officials' training and understanding of trafficking; this variation increased the risk that unidentified trafficking victims were detained and deported following arrest for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being subjected to human trafficking.<ref name=autogenerated7 />\n\n===Public education===\nPublic education about sex crimes in China exists but is insufficient.

In 2018, the Ministry of Public Security reportedly sent 350,000 police officers to public schools to educate children about the risks of exploitation. Article highlights announcement of rescued children on Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging platform, accompanied by photos of them. At the end of the article, tips and reminders are provided for readers on what to do if they suspect any instance of child trafficking or abduction.

They run annual campaigns that focus on school curricula, television ads and transportation hubs, especially around the time of the Spring Festival. \n\n===Reporting===\nGovernment websites provide list of relevant agencies and departments and their hotlines. Several of the most popular apps in China have the additional function of helping locate missing persons through localized push notifications. Scores of specialist apps for registering family members young and old or reporting suspected child trafficking have also been appearing in the country's app stores. The free, 24/7 dial 110 nationwide police calling system allows victims or witnesses to obtain assistance from the police.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\n==Government response problems==\nAccording to [[Human Rights Watch]], Chinese law enforcement officers in certain jurisdictions make little effort to save sex trafficking victims.<ref name=autogenerated12 />\n\nThere has been not been an increase in public reports of sexual slavery cases in recent years.

Country-specific Report, China.|date=2015|website=ECPAT Intercriminalovernational}}</ref>\n\nChina's highest-rated television channel ran broadcasts raising awareness on trafficking. The government  disseminates some anti-trafficking messages in train and bus stations and through media such as cell phones, television, and the internet. Through China's social media platforms, such as [[Sina Weibo]], the Ministry of Public Security reported using its official microblog to raise awareness of trafficking and receive information from the public regarding suspected trafficking cases. In 2018, the Ministry of Public Security reportedly sent 350,000 police officers to public schools to educate children about the risks of exploitation. Article highlights announcement of rescued children on Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging platform, accompanied by photos of them. At the end of the article, tips and reminders are provided for readers on what to do if they suspect any instance of child trafficking or abduction. A link is also provided to the National Abduction and Family Search Platform, which acts as a directory for abducted and trafficked children.<ref name=autogenerated10>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2019/data/country-data/china/|title=China Country Data|date=2019|website=Global Slavery Index}}</ref>\n\nThe two Women's Federations and the Publicity Department focus on raising awareness and provide assistance with victim support. They run annual campaigns that focus on school curricula, television ads and transportation hubs, especially around the time of the Spring Festival. \n\n===Reporting===\nGovernment websites provide list of relevant agencies and departments and their hotlines. Several of the most popular apps in China have the additional function of helping locate missing persons through localized push notifications. Scores of specialist apps for registering family members young and old or reporting suspected child trafficking have also been appearing in the country's app stores. The free, 24/7 dial 110 nationwide police calling system allows victims or witnesses to obtain assistance from the police.<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\n==Government response problems==\nAccording to [[Human Rights Watch]], Chinese law enforcement officers in certain jurisdictions make little effort to save sex trafficking victims.<ref name=autogenerated12 />\n\nThere has been not been an increase in public reports of sexual slavery cases in recent years. The Ministry of Public Security has not reported the number of investigations initiated into possible trafficking cases.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> \n\nThe reporting mechanisms (websites, hotline, etc.) do operate in multiple languages.<ref name=autogenerated10 />  \n\nTraining for first responders of trafficking crimes is not delivered systematically and at regular intervals. Reports suggest that screening procedures exist but it is unclear if these have been distributed to all first res ponders or concern both victim screening and identification.\n<ref name=autogenerated10 />\n\n==Corruption== \nSome government officials and police have been complicit in sex trafficking. Some police have demanded bribes in order to return victims to their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/thousands-of-myanmar-women-forced-into-marriages-in-china/a-46625465|title=Thousands of Myanmar women forced into marriages in China|date=July 12, 2018|website=DW News}}</ref>\n\n==Government human rights violations==\n{{Main|Human rights in China}}\nThe Chinese government's human rights violations have hampered anti-sex trafficking initiatives.<ref name=autogenerated9 /> Sustained attacks on organizations and lawyers have resulted in victims not being able to seek justice.<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\n==Anti-trafficking Organizations==\nThere are civil society organizations working to rescue women, but these organizations have limited resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/03/21/interview-why-brides-myanmar-are-trafficked-china#|title=Interview: Why \u2018Brides\u2019 From Myanmar Are Trafficked to China|date=March 21, 2019|website=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>\n\nChristian organizations save sex trafficked victims in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Vietnams-modern-sex-slaves-sold-in-China-as-prostitutes-or-brides-33361.html|title=Vietnam's \"modern sex slaves\" sold in China as prostitutes or brides|date=February 3, 2015|website=Asia News}}</ref>\n\n[[Agape International Missions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3006909/non-profit-group-which-helps-sex-trafficking-victims-seeks|title=Non-profit group, which helps sex-trafficking victims, seeks tie-ups with ethical business partners in Hong Kong|date=April 21, 2019|website=South China Morning Post}}</ref> and [[Blue Dragon Children's Foundation]] save victims of sex trafficking in China.<ref> [https://weblog.iom.int/migrant-hero-michael-brosowski Migrant Hero: Michael Brosowski June 26, 2015] [[International Organization for Migration]] Retrieved May 26, 2016 </ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{China topics}}\n{{Sex trafficking in East Asia|state=collapsed}}\n{{Sex trafficking|state=collapsed}}\n{{Prostitution in China}}\n{{Asia in topic|Sex trafficking in}}\n\n[[Category:Human trafficking in China]]\n[[Category:Human rights abuses in China]]\n[[Category:Child sexual abuse]]\n[[Category:Forced marriage]]\n[[Category:Forced prostitution]]\n[[Category:Organized crime activity]]\n[[Category:Chinese women]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in China]]\n[[Category:People's Republic of China society]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in China]]\n[[Category:Sex industry]]\n[[Category:Rape in China]]\n[[Category:Sex trafficking by country|China]]\n[[Category:Social issues in China]]\n[[Category:Slavery in China]]\n[[Category:Crimes against women]]\n[[Category:Violence against women in China]]\n[[Category:Women in China]]\n", "name_user": "Wikipedianuhai", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChina\u2013Mongolia border", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking_in_China"}

The former of the three is used as the standard measurement, and is noted by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] among [[Guinness World Records|others]] for the official record. How the record is taken though has been subject to controversy regarding various factors such as environmental conditions. For ninety years a former record that was measured in [[Libya]] had been in place until it was disproven in 2012. This finding has since raised questions about the legitimacy of the current record which was measured in [[Death Valley]]. The WMO has since stated that they would be willing to open an investigation into the matter as all \"available evidence\" points to its accuracy.

The former of the three is used as the standard measurement, and is noted by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] among [[Guinness World Records|others]] for the official record. How the record is taken though has been subject to controversy regarding various factors such as environmental conditions. For ninety years a former record that was measured in [[Libya]] had been in place until it was disproven in 2012. This finding has since raised questions about the legitimacy of the current record which was measured in [[Death Valley]]. The WMO has since stated that they would be willing to open an investigation into the matter as all \"available evidence\" points to its accuracy. While there have been higher reports through air readings, none of these have ever been verified.

There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=wright-07/>\n\n===Major fragments===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Fragment\n!Size [mm]\n!Weight [g]\n!Gears\n!Inscriptions\n!Notes\n|- align=center\n| A ||180&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;150 ||369.1 ||27 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on ''Fragment A''. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30&nbsp;mm thick at its thickest point.\n\nFragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions.\n|- align=center\n| B ||125&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60 ||99.4 ||1 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the [[Metonic cycle]]. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train.\n|- align=center\n| C ||120&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;110 ||63.8 ||1 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Contains parts of the upper right of the front dial face showing calendar and zodiac inscriptions.

Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading \"...&nbsp;76 years&nbsp;...\" which refers to the [[Callippic cycle]]. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|7}}\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of the arte<!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling -->fact's known mechanism]]\n\nInformation on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 ''Nature'' article.<ref name=\"freeth-06\" />\n\n===Operation===\nOn the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the [[ecliptic]], the twelve [[zodiac]]al signs marked off with equal 30-degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the [[constellation]] boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic [[Egyptian calendar]], twelve months of 30 days plus five [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the [[Greek alphabet]]. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a [[crown gear]] to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian [[ephemeris]] tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[Lunar phase|moon phase]], [[eclipse]], and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|planets]].<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThe operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a \"follower\" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n\n===Faces===\n[[File:Computer graphic for front of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model]]\n\n====Front face====\nThe front dial has two concentric circular scales that represent the path of the [[ecliptic]] through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day [[Egyptian civil calendar]]. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the [[Zodiac]], with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the [[Julian calendar]] reform, but the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic]] and [[Callippic cycle]]s had already pointed to a {{frac|365|1|4}}-day solar year, as seen in [[Ptolemy III]]'s [[Decree of Canopus|abortive calendrical reform]] of 238{{nbsp}}BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed [[leap day]] ([[Egyptian intercalary month|Epag.]] 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter-day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.\n\nThe position of the Sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the Moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well.\n\nThe following three [[Egyptian calendar#Months|Egyptian months]] are inscribed in [[History of the Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:<ref>{{citation |last=Jones |first=Alexander |title=A Portable Cosmos |p=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ&pg=PT97|date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780190618599 }}.</ref>\n* \u03a0\u0391\u03a7\u03a9\u039d ([[Pachon]])\n* \u03a0\u0391\u03a5\u039d\u0399 ([[Payni]])\n* \u0395\u03a0\u0399\u03a6\u0399 ([[Epiphi]])\n\nThe other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the five days of the Egyptian intercalary month.

indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the Moon, and a mean Sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The Moon position was not a simple mean Moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the Moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of [[epicyclic gearing]].\n\nIt also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88-year cycle. The mean Sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the Moon correct,<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|20, 24}} then there also was likely to have been a \"true sun\" pointer in addition to the mean Sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the Sun (the orbit of Earth around the Sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.<ref name=freeth-12 /> Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See [[#Proposed planet indication gearing schemes|Proposed planet indication gearing schemes]] below.\n\nFinally, mechanical engineer Michael Wright has demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.<ref name=wright-05 /> The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the Sun and Moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]], a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.\n\n====Rear face====\n[[File:Computer graphic for back of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated back panel]]\nIn July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showing that the mechanism not only tracked the [[Metonic calendar]] and predicted [[solar eclipses]], but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the [[Ancient Olympic Games]].<ref name=freeth-08/> Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and with the island of [[Corfu]], which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.<ref name=wilford-08/><ref name=connor-08/><ref>Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] and the [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]], and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,<ref name=freeth-08/> which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),<ref name=\"Paul Iversen 2017\"/> the [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]], and the [[Exeligmos]].<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|11}}\n\nThe Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]], which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the [[Hellenic calendars#Corinthian|Corinthian month names]].<ref name=freeth-08 /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Freeth | first1 = T | year = 2009 | title = Decoding an Ancient Computer | journal = Scientific American | volume = 301 | issue = 6| pages = 76\u201383 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1209-76 | pmid=20058643|bibcode = 2009SciAm.301f..76F }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-164.</ref>\n\n# \u03a6\u039f\u0399\u039d\u0399\u039a\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Phoinikaios)\n# \u039a\u03a1\u0391\u039d\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Kraneios)\n# \u039b\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a4\u03a1\u039f\u03a0\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Lanotropios)\n# \u039c\u0391\u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Machaneus, ''\"mechanic\"'', referring to [[Zeus]] the inventor)\n# \u0394\u03a9\u0394\u0395\u039a\u0391\u03a4\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Dodekateus)\n# \u0395\u03a5\u039a\u039b\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Eukleios)\n# \u0391\u03a1\u03a4\u0395\u039c\u0399\u03a3\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Artemisios)\n# \u03a8\u03a5\u0394\u03a1\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Psydreus)\n# \u0393\u0391\u039c\u0395\u0399\u039b\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Gameilios)\n# \u0391\u0393\u03a1\u0399\u0391\u039d\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Agrianios)\n# \u03a0\u0391\u039d\u0391\u039c\u039f\u03a3 (Panamos)\n# \u0391\u03a0\u0395\u039b\u039b\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Apellaios)\n\nThus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so.\n\nBased on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.<ref>Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 165\u2013185.</ref>\n\nThe Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle.

It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them&nbsp;\u2014 not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n* \u03a3 = \u03a3\u0395\u039b\u0397\u039d\u0397 (\"Selene\", Moon)\n* \u0397 = \u0397\u039b\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (\"Helios\", Sun)\n* H\\M = \u0397\u039c\u0395\u03a1\u0391\u03a3 (\"Hemeras\", of the day)\n* \u03c9\\\u03c1 = \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1 (\"hora\", hour)\n* N\\Y = \u039d\u03a5\u039a\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 (\"Nuktos\", of the night)\n\nThe glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour. Solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|6}} In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new [[full moon cycle]].

The [[Exeligmos]] cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n* Blank or o ?

On one of its fragments is written \"76 years, 19 years\" representing the [[Callippic]] and [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycles. Also written is \"223\" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written \"on the spiral subdivisions 235\" referring to the Metonic dial.\n\n===Gearing===\nThe mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThere is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for\u2014with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]], in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the Solar System; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.\n\nThe epicyclic Solar System of [[Ptolemy]] (c. 100 \u2013 170 AD) \u2013 still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanism \u2013 carried forward with more epicycles, and was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] (1473 \u2013 1543 AD), until [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] (1571 \u2013 1630 AD) introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.<ref name=amrp-07-2/>\n\nEvans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five [[classical planets]] would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the Sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe gear teeth were in the form of [[equilateral triangle]]s with an average circular pitch of 1.6&nbsp;mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2&nbsp;mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.<ref name=\"freeth-12\"/> Due to advances in imaging and [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray]] technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nA table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows.

The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the Moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).\n'''The Sun gear''' is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean Sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The Sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, \"true sun\" pointer that displayed the Sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The Moon train''' starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the Moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]]; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others.  Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, in consequence of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Position as a function of time|Kepler's second and third laws]]. The modelled rotational period of the Moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the [[moon]] of 8.85 years.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\nThe system also models the [[lunar phase|phases of the Moon]]. The Moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the Sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean Sun pointer or a hypothetical true Sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the Moon, but is also geared to the Sun&nbsp;\u2014 the effect is to perform a [[differential gear]] operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the Sun and Moon pointers.  The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the Moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] train''' is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Olympiad]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer.

The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n====Proposed gear schemes====\nBecause of the large space between the mean Sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean Sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.<ref name=freeth-12/> This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward.\n\n{{multiple image| direction = vertical| width = 150| image1 = Antikythera-proposed-4.svg| caption1  = Wright proposal| image2 = Antikythera-proposed-1.svg| caption2 = Evans et al. proposal| image3 = Antikythera-proposed-3.svg| caption3 = Freeth et al. proposal}}\n\n'''[[Michael T. Wright|Michael Wright]]''' was the first person to design and build a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eUibFQKJqI model] with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential [[planetarium]] system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the \"first anomaly\"). He included pointers for this \"true sun\", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known \"mean sun\" (current time) and lunar pointers.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n'''Evans, Carman, and Thorndike''' published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.<ref name=cte-10/> Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTheir proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nIn a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.<ref name=cte-12/>\n\n'''Freeth and Jones''' published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the Sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n[[Image:Gearing Relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal]]\n\nThe system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the Sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean Sun wheel turns.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe inferior planet mechanism includes the Sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.<ref name=freeth-12/> For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the Sun and all the planets\u2014excepting only the Moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe superior planet systems\u2014Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.<ref name=freeth-12/> Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.\n\nIn total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nOn the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus:\n\n{{quote|...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon.

This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather to inadequacies in the Greek theory of planetary movements. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his [[Almagest|Planetary Hypotheses]] in the second half of the second century AD (particularly adding the concept of the [[equant]] to his theory) and then finally by the introduction of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] in the early 17th century.<ref name=freeth-12 />\n\n{{quote|In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient world\u2014but it didn't really work very well!<ref name=freeth-12 />}}\n\nIn addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy.

They were both built by [[Archimedes]] and brought to Rome by the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the death of Archimedes at the [[Siege of Syracuse (214\u2013212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was placed in the [[Temple of Honor and Virtue|Temple of Virtue]]). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in the year 129 BC) saying that [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] (consul with [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC)|Marcellus's nephew]] in 166 BC, and credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a \"learned explanation\" and a working demonstration of the device.\n\n{{cquote|I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by [[Thales of Miletus]]. That afterwards [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a disciple of [[Plato]], had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions.\n\nWhen Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line&nbsp;... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.]<ref name=cicero/>}}\n\n[[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled ''On Sphere-Making''.<ref name=rorres-11/><ref name=fildes-10/> The surviving texts from ancient times describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his [[odometer]], the exact model later used by the Romans to place their [[mile marker]]s (described by [[Vitruvius]], [[Heron of Alexandria]] and in the time of Emperor [[Commodus]]).<ref name=needham/> The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.<ref name=sleeswyk-81/>\n\nIf Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the 3rd century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII''), [[Claudian]] (''In sphaeram Archimedes''), and [[Proclus]] (''Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry'') in the 4th and 5th centuries.\n\nCicero also said that another such device was built \"recently\" by his friend [[Posidonius]], \"... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens&nbsp;...\"<ref name=cicero-1/>\n\nIt is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.\n\nThis evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic worlds]], where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=charette-06/> Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the 5th or 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]], have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.<ref name=madison-85/> In the Islamic world, [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]]'s ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices|Kitab al-Hiyal]]'', or ''Book of Ingenious Devices'', was commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in [[Monastery|monasteries]]. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist [[al-Biruni]] around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century [[astrolabe]] also contains a similar clockwork device.<ref name=madison-85/> It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.<ref name=marchant-06/>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nOn 17 May 2017, [[Google]] marked the 115th anniversary of the discovery with a [[Google Doodle|Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff |title=115 Anniversary of the Antikythera Mechanism Discovery |url=https://www.google.com/doodles/115th-anniversary-of-the-antikythera-mechanisms-discovery |date=17 May 2017 |work=[[Google]] |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Reiss |title=What is the Antikythera mechanism?

Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F came to light in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=wright-07/>\n\n===Major fragments===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Fragment\n!Size [mm]\n!Weight [g]\n!Gears\n!Inscriptions\n!Notes\n|- align=center\n| A ||180&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;150 ||369.1 ||27 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on ''Fragment A''. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30&nbsp;mm thick at its thickest point.\n\nFragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions.\n|- align=center\n| B ||125&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60 ||99.4 ||1 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the [[Metonic cycle]]. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train.\n|- align=center\n| C ||120&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;110 ||63.8 ||1 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Contains parts of the upper right of the front dial face showing calendar and zodiac inscriptions.

Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading \"...&nbsp;76 years&nbsp;...\" which refers to the [[Callippic cycle]]. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|7}}\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of the arte<!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling -->fact's known mechanism]]\n\nInformation on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 ''Nature'' article.<ref name=\"freeth-06\" />\n\n===Operation===\nOn the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the [[ecliptic]], the twelve [[zodiac]]al signs marked off with equal 30-degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the [[constellation]] boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic [[Egyptian calendar]], twelve months of 30 days plus five [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the [[Greek alphabet]]. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a [[crown gear]] to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian [[ephemeris]] tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[Lunar phase|moon phase]], [[eclipse]], and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|planets]].<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThe operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a \"follower\" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n\n===Faces===\n[[File:Computer graphic for front of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model]]\n\n====Front face====\nThe front dial has two concentric circular scales that represent the path of the [[ecliptic]] through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day [[Egyptian civil calendar]]. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the [[Zodiac]], with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the [[Julian calendar]] reform, but the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic]] and [[Callippic cycle]]s had already pointed to a {{frac|365|1|4}}-day solar year, as seen in [[Ptolemy III]]'s [[Decree of Canopus|abortive calendrical reform]] of 238{{nbsp}}BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed [[leap day]] ([[Egyptian intercalary month|Epag.]] 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter-day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.\n\nThe position of the Sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the Moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well.\n\nThe following three [[Egyptian calendar#Months|Egyptian months]] are inscribed in [[History of the Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:<ref>{{citation |last=Jones |first=Alexander |title=A Portable Cosmos |p=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ&pg=PT97|date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780190618599 }}.</ref>\n* \u03a0\u0391\u03a7\u03a9\u039d ([[Pachon]])\n* \u03a0\u0391\u03a5\u039d\u0399 ([[Payni]])\n* \u0395\u03a0\u0399\u03a6\u0399 ([[Epiphi]])\n\nThe other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the five days of the Egyptian intercalary month.

indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the Moon, and a mean Sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The Moon position was not a simple mean Moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the Moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of [[epicyclic gearing]].\n\nIt also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88-year cycle. The mean Sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the Moon correct,<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|20, 24}} then there also was likely to have been a \"true sun\" pointer in addition to the mean Sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the Sun (the orbit of Earth around the Sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.<ref name=freeth-12 /> Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See [[#Proposed planet indication gearing schemes|Proposed planet indication gearing schemes]] below.\n\nFinally, mechanical engineer Michael Wright has demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.<ref name=wright-05 /> The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the Sun and Moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]], a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.\n\n====Rear face====\n[[File:Computer graphic for back of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated back panel]]\nIn July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showing that the mechanism not only tracked the [[Metonic calendar]] and predicted [[solar eclipses]], but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the [[Ancient Olympic Games]].<ref name=freeth-08/> Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and with the island of [[Corfu]], which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.<ref name=wilford-08/><ref name=connor-08/><ref>Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] and the [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]], and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,<ref name=freeth-08/> which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),<ref name=\"Paul Iversen 2017\"/> the [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]], and the [[Exeligmos]].<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|11}}\n\nThe Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]], which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the [[Hellenic calendars#Corinthian|Corinthian month names]].<ref name=freeth-08 /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Freeth | first1 = T | year = 2009 | title = Decoding an Ancient Computer | journal = Scientific American | volume = 301 | issue = 6| pages = 76\u201383 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1209-76 | pmid=20058643|bibcode = 2009SciAm.301f..76F }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-164.</ref>\n\n# \u03a6\u039f\u0399\u039d\u0399\u039a\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Phoinikaios)\n# \u039a\u03a1\u0391\u039d\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Kraneios)\n# \u039b\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a4\u03a1\u039f\u03a0\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Lanotropios)\n# \u039c\u0391\u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Machaneus, ''\"mechanic\"'', referring to [[Zeus]] the inventor)\n# \u0394\u03a9\u0394\u0395\u039a\u0391\u03a4\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Dodekateus)\n# \u0395\u03a5\u039a\u039b\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Eukleios)\n# \u0391\u03a1\u03a4\u0395\u039c\u0399\u03a3\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Artemisios)\n# \u03a8\u03a5\u0394\u03a1\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Psydreus)\n# \u0393\u0391\u039c\u0395\u0399\u039b\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Gameilios)\n# \u0391\u0393\u03a1\u0399\u0391\u039d\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Agrianios)\n# \u03a0\u0391\u039d\u0391\u039c\u039f\u03a3 (Panamos)\n# \u0391\u03a0\u0395\u039b\u039b\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Apellaios)\n\nThus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so.\n\nBased on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.<ref>Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 165\u2013185.</ref>\n\nThe Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle.

It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them&nbsp;\u2014 not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n* \u03a3 = \u03a3\u0395\u039b\u0397\u039d\u0397 (\"Selene\", Moon)\n* \u0397 = \u0397\u039b\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (\"Helios\", Sun)\n* H\\M = \u0397\u039c\u0395\u03a1\u0391\u03a3 (\"Hemeras\", of the day)\n* \u03c9\\\u03c1 = \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1 (\"hora\", hour)\n* N\\Y = \u039d\u03a5\u039a\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 (\"Nuktos\", of the night)\n\nThe glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour. Solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|6}} In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new [[full moon cycle]]. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.<ref>Carman, Christi\u00e1n C.; Evans, James (15 November 2014). \"On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor\".

The [[Exeligmos]] cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n* Blank or o ? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed)\n* H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display\n* I\u03db (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display\n\nThus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Doors===\nThe mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions.<ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=freeth-06-1/> The back door appears to be the \"instruction manual\". On one of its fragments is written \"76 years, 19 years\" representing the [[Callippic]] and [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycles. Also written is \"223\" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written \"on the spiral subdivisions 235\" referring to the Metonic dial.\n\n===Gearing===\nThe mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThere is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for\u2014with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]], in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the Solar System; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.\n\nThe epicyclic Solar System of [[Ptolemy]] (c. 100 \u2013 170 AD) \u2013 still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanism \u2013 carried forward with more epicycles, and was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] (1473 \u2013 1543 AD), until [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] (1571 \u2013 1630 AD) introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.<ref name=amrp-07-2/>\n\nEvans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five [[classical planets]] would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the Sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe gear teeth were in the form of [[equilateral triangle]]s with an average circular pitch of 1.6&nbsp;mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2&nbsp;mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.<ref name=\"freeth-12\"/> Due to advances in imaging and [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray]] technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nA table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)<ref name=freeth-08/> and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.<ref name=freeth-12/> The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios.

The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the Moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).\n'''The Sun gear''' is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean Sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The Sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, \"true sun\" pointer that displayed the Sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The Moon train''' starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the Moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]]; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others.  Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, in consequence of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Position as a function of time|Kepler's second and third laws]]. The modelled rotational period of the Moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the [[moon]] of 8.85 years.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\nThe system also models the [[lunar phase|phases of the Moon]]. The Moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the Sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean Sun pointer or a hypothetical true Sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the Moon, but is also geared to the Sun&nbsp;\u2014 the effect is to perform a [[differential gear]] operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the Sun and Moon pointers.  The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the Moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] train''' is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Olympiad]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer.  It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly four years, as expected. Incidentally, it is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates counter-clockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Exeligmos]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\nApparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n====Proposed gear schemes====\nBecause of the large space between the mean Sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean Sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.<ref name=freeth-12/> This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward.\n\n{{multiple image| direction = vertical| width = 150| image1 = Antikythera-proposed-4.svg| caption1  = Wright proposal| image2 = Antikythera-proposed-1.svg| caption2 = Evans et al. proposal| image3 = Antikythera-proposed-3.svg| caption3 = Freeth et al. proposal}}\n\n'''[[Michael T. Wright|Michael Wright]]''' was the first person to design and build a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eUibFQKJqI model] with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential [[planetarium]] system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the \"first anomaly\"). He included pointers for this \"true sun\", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known \"mean sun\" (current time) and lunar pointers.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n'''Evans, Carman, and Thorndike''' published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.<ref name=cte-10/> Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTheir proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nIn a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.<ref name=cte-12/>\n\n'''Freeth and Jones''' published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the Sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n[[Image:Gearing Relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal]]\n\nThe system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the Sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean Sun wheel turns.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe inferior planet mechanism includes the Sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.<ref name=freeth-12/> For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the Sun and all the planets\u2014excepting only the Moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe superior planet systems\u2014Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.<ref name=freeth-12/> Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.\n\nIn total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nOn the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus:\n\n{{quote|...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon.

This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather to inadequacies in the Greek theory of planetary movements. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his [[Almagest|Planetary Hypotheses]] in the second half of the second century AD (particularly adding the concept of the [[equant]] to his theory) and then finally by the introduction of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] in the early 17th century.<ref name=freeth-12 />\n\n{{quote|In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient world\u2014but it didn't really work very well!<ref name=freeth-12 />}}\n\nIn addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy.

They were both built by [[Archimedes]] and brought to Rome by the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the death of Archimedes at the [[Siege of Syracuse (214\u2013212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was placed in the [[Temple of Honor and Virtue|Temple of Virtue]]). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in the year 129 BC) saying that [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] (consul with [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC)|Marcellus's nephew]] in 166 BC, and credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a \"learned explanation\" and a working demonstration of the device.\n\n{{cquote|I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by [[Thales of Miletus]]. That afterwards [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a disciple of [[Plato]], had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions.\n\nWhen Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line&nbsp;... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.]<ref name=cicero/>}}\n\n[[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled ''On Sphere-Making''.<ref name=rorres-11/><ref name=fildes-10/> The surviving texts from ancient times describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his [[odometer]], the exact model later used by the Romans to place their [[mile marker]]s (described by [[Vitruvius]], [[Heron of Alexandria]] and in the time of Emperor [[Commodus]]).<ref name=needham/> The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.<ref name=sleeswyk-81/>\n\nIf Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the 3rd century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII''), [[Claudian]] (''In sphaeram Archimedes''), and [[Proclus]] (''Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry'') in the 4th and 5th centuries.\n\nCicero also said that another such device was built \"recently\" by his friend [[Posidonius]], \"... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens&nbsp;...\"<ref name=cicero-1/>\n\nIt is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.\n\nThis evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic worlds]], where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=charette-06/> Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the 5th or 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]], have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.<ref name=madison-85/> In the Islamic world, [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]]'s ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices|Kitab al-Hiyal]]'', or ''Book of Ingenious Devices'', was commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in [[Monastery|monasteries]].

The song was written by [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] and [[Harry Vanda]] and was released in February 1975 as the lead single from Young's debut studio album, ''[[Hero (John Paul Young album)|Hero]]'' (1975).\n\nThe song became a worldwide hit, peaking at No. 8 in Australia, No. 1 in South Africa and No. 41 in the United States.\n\n== Overview ==\n\"Yesterday's Hero\" is a song about the fleeting nature of pop stardom.
