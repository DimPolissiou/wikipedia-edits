Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.  While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn\u2019t release oxygen to the organs and tissues.<ref name=\"Bernard2013 \"> {{cite journal  | authors= Forget B and Bunn H|title= Classification of the Disorders of Hemoglobin |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|volume= 3 |date= 2013|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a011684}}</ref> The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions. \n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used.

This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin.

As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin.

As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.
