They range from dualistic devotional theism to monistic meditative discovery of Shiva within oneself. Within each of these theologies, there are two sub-groups. One sub-group is called Vedic-Puranic, who use the terms such as \"Shiva, Mahadeva, Maheshvara and others\" synonymously, and they use iconography such as the [[Linga]], [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], [[Trishula]] (trident), as well as anthropomorphic statues of Shiva in temples to help focus their practices.<ref name=\"Michaels2004p215\"/> Another sub-group is called esoteric, which fuses it with abstract ''Sivata'' (feminine energy) or ''Sivatva'' (neuter abstraction), wherein the theology integrates the goddess (Shakti) and the god (Shiva) with Tantra practices and Agama teachings. There is a considerable overlap between these Shaivas and the Shakta Hindus.<ref name=\"Michaels2004p215\">{{cite book|author=Axel Michaels|title=Hinduism: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jID3TuoiOMQC|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08952-3|pages=215\u2013217}}</ref>\n\n===Vedic, Puranik, and esoteric Shaivism===\nScholars such as Alexis Sanderson discuss Shaivism in three categories: Vedic, Puranik and non-Puranik (esoteric, tantric).{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660-704}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}} They place Vedic and Puranik together given the significant overlap, while placing Non-Puranik esoteric sub-traditions as a separate category.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n[[File:Female Ascetics (Yoginis) LACMA M.2011.156.4 (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|Two female Shaiva ascetics (18th century painting)]]\n* ''Vedic-Puranik''. The majority within Shaivism follow the Vedic-Puranik traditions. They revere the Vedas, the Puranas and have beliefs that span dualistic theism style Shiva [[Bhakti]] (devotionalism) to monistic non-theism dedicated to yoga and meditative lifestyle sometimes with renouncing householder life for monastic pursuits of spirituality.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=205\u2013207, 215\u2013221}} The Yoga practice is particularly pronounced in nondualistic Shaivism, with the practice refined into a methodology such as four-fold ''upaya'': being pathless (anupaya, iccha-less, desire-less), being divine (sambhavopaya, ''jnana'', knowledge-full), being energy (saktopaya, ''kriya'', action-full) and being individual (anavopaya).{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}{{refn|group=note|There is an overlap in this approach with those found in non-puranik tantric rituals.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}}}\n* ''Non-Puranik''.

Their goals vary, ranging from liberation in current life (''mukti'') to seeking pleasures in higher worlds (''bhukti''). Their means also vary, ranging from meditative ''atimarga'' or \"outer higher path\" versus those whose means are recitation-driven ''mantras''. The ''atimarga'' sub-traditions include Pashupatas and Lakula. According to Sanderson, the Pashupatas{{refn|group=note|Pashupatas have both Vedic-Puranik and non-Puranik sub-traditions.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}}} have the oldest heritage, likely from the 2nd century CE, as evidenced by ancient Hindu texts such as the [[Shanti Parva]] book of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic.{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660\u2013704}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}} The tantric sub-tradition in this category is traceable to post-8th to post-11th century depending on the region of Indian subcontinent, paralleling the development of Buddhist and Jain tantra traditions in this period.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208\u2013209}} Among these are the dualistic Saiva Siddhanta and Bhairava Shaivas (non-Saiddhantika), based on whether they recognize any value in Vedic orthopraxy.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=210\u2013213}} These sub-traditions cherish secrecy, special symbolic formulae, initiation by a teacher and the pursuit of ''siddhi'' (special powers).

The path started as a life near a Shiva temple and silent meditation, then a stage when the ascetic left the temple and did karma exchange (be cursed by others, but never curse back). He then moved to the third stage of life where he lived like a loner in a cave or abandoned places or Himalayan mountains, and towards the end of his life he moved to a cremation ground, surviving on little, peacefully awaiting his death.{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=664\u2013665}}\n\nThe Pashupatas have been particularly prominent in [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Kashmir]] and [[Nepal]].

They revere the Vedas, the Puranas and have beliefs that span dualistic theism style Shiva [[Bhakti]] (devotionalism) to monistic non-theism dedicated to yoga and meditative lifestyle sometimes with renouncing householder life for monastic pursuits of spirituality.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=205\u2013207, 215\u2013221}} The Yoga practice is particularly pronounced in nondualistic Shaivism, with the practice refined into a methodology such as four-fold ''upaya'': being pathless (anupaya, iccha-less, desire-less), being divine (sambhavopaya, ''jnana'', knowledge-full), being energy (saktopaya, ''kriya'', action-full) and being individual (anavopaya).{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}{{refn|group=note|There is an overlap in this approach with those found in non-puranik tantric rituals.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=221\u2013223}}}}\n* ''Non-Puranik''. These are esoteric, minority sub-traditions wherein devotees are initiated (''{{IAST|d\u012bk\u1e63a}}'') into a specific cult they prefer. Their goals vary, ranging from liberation in current life (''mukti'') to seeking pleasures in higher worlds (''bhukti''). Their means also vary, ranging from meditative ''atimarga'' or \"outer higher path\" versus those whose means are recitation-driven ''mantras''. The ''atimarga'' sub-traditions include Pashupatas and Lakula. According to Sanderson, the Pashupatas{{refn|group=note|Pashupatas have both Vedic-Puranik and non-Puranik sub-traditions.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}}}} have the oldest heritage, likely from the 2nd century CE, as evidenced by ancient Hindu texts such as the [[Shanti Parva]] book of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic.{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660\u2013704}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=206\u2013207}} The tantric sub-tradition in this category is traceable to post-8th to post-11th century depending on the region of Indian subcontinent, paralleling the development of Buddhist and Jain tantra traditions in this period.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208\u2013209}} Among these are the dualistic Saiva Siddhanta and Bhairava Shaivas (non-Saiddhantika), based on whether they recognize any value in Vedic orthopraxy.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=210\u2013213}} These sub-traditions cherish secrecy, special symbolic formulae, initiation by a teacher and the pursuit of ''siddhi'' (special powers). Some of these traditions also incorporate theistic ideas, elaborate geometric yantra with embedded spiritual meaning, mantras and rituals.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208\u2013209}}{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=660\u2013663, 681\u2013690}}{{sfn| Sanderson|1988|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n===Shaivism versus other Hindu traditions===\n\nShaivism sub-traditions subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others.
