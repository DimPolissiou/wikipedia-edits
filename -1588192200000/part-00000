Photo courtesy of the School of Chemistry, University of Manchester]]\nRona Robinson was born on 26 June 1884.  She was the youngest child of Jessie and Fred (Alfred) Robinson, both of her parents originating from the Manchester area, from Chorlton-on-Medlock and Cheetham Hill respectively.  She was from a working-class background, her father is listed as cotton goods traveller.<ref>1881 Census</ref>  Robinson's childhood was spent in the Gorton and Withington areas of Manchester, growing up with her sister Lilian (b. 1880) and brother Andrew (b. 1882).  Her father died when Robinson was young and her mother took in lodgers to make ends meet. In the 1891 census, Jessie is registered as a widow and lodging house keeper living with her three children and two visitors, one from Liverpool and one from Syria.<ref>1891 census</ref>\n\nRobinson attended one of the Manchester Central Schools.<ref>Manchester Central Schools. Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 21 July 1905</ref>  In 1900, at the age of 15, she was awarded a junior science exhibition to the value of \u00a315 per annum by [[Lancashire County Council]], this funding allowed her to continue studying well beyond the traditional [[School-leaving age|school leaving age]].\n\nRobinson gained a scholarship to study at [[Owens College, Manchester]] (incorporated into the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in 1904), matriculating in 1902.  Here she excelled; appearing in the list of first class students for the Owens College examinations sessions of 1902\u201303 (her first year) as 3rd equal in her class in organic chemistry.<ref>Owens College examinations sessions 1902-3. Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 27 June 1903.</ref>  She graduated with a first class honours degree in chemistry, the LeBlanc medal and a Mercer scholarship (for the best final year student entering research) in 1905.  She was the first woman in the United Kingdom to gain a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class degree]] in [[chemistry]].\n\nRobinson continued at Manchester, working for her research MSc during which she published a paper entitled ''3-Hydroxyphthalic and 3-methoxyphthalic acids and their derivatives'' with William Henry Bentley and [[Chaim Weizmann|Charles (Chaim) Weitzmann]].<ref>'''''J.
