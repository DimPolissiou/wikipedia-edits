It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty.

The [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) refers to the pattern as '''Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990'''. Its components are a known [[standardization|standard]]. Comparing it as received to the known standard gives video engineers an indication of how an NTSC video [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] has been altered by recording or transmission and what adjustments must be made to bring it back to specification. It is also used for setting a television monitor or receiver to reproduce NTSC [[chrominance]] and [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] information correctly.\n\nThe pattern was originally conceived by Norbert D. Larky and David D. Holmes of RCA Laboratories and first published in RCA Licensee Bulletin LB-819 on February 7, 1951. U.S. patent 2,742,525 Color Test Pattern Generator was awarded on April 17, 1956 to Norbert D. Larky and David D.

In order from left to right, the colors are [[white]], [[yellow]], [[cyan]], [[green]], [[magenta]], [[red]], and [[blue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.smpte.org/content/eg-1-1990/SEC1.abstract.html?ijkey=98efca5000a1e6d09f037857ce82d60dbcfd0ce6&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |title=EG 1:1990 Alignment Color Bar Test Signal for Television Picture Monitors}}</ref> This sequence runs through all seven possible combinations that use at least one of the three basic color components of green, red, and blue, with blue cycling on and off between every bar, red cycling on and off every two bars, and green on for the leftmost four bars and off for the rightmost three. Because green contributes the largest share of luminance, followed by red, then blue, this sequence of bars thus appears on a [[waveform monitor]] in luminance mode as a downward staircase from left to right. The [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] of a [[vectorscope]] is etched with boxes showing the permissible regions where the traces from these seven bars are supposed to fall if the signal is properly adjusted. \n\nBelow the main set of seven bars is a strip of [[blue]], [[magenta]], [[cyan]], and [[white]] castellations. When a television receiver is set to filter out all colors except for blue, these castellations, combined with the main set of color bars, are used to properly adjust the color controls; they appear as four solid blue bars, with no visible distinction between the bars and the castellations, if the color controls are properly adjusted.\n\nThe bottom section contains a square of 100% intensity white and a rectangle of 7.5% intensity black, for use in setting the luminance range. More modern versions of the pattern feature a \"[[pluge]] pulse.\" The white square lines up so that it is below the yellow and cyan bars, on a waveform monitor this will show up with the white bar overlapping the peak of the yellow and cyan chroma at 100 IRE units. The pluge (short for \"Picture Line-Up Generation Equipment\") pulse is positioned within the black rectangle, below the red bar (it is present in the illustration but may be hard to see). It comprises three small vertical bars, a rightmost one with intensity 4% above black level (11.5 IRE), a middle one with intensity exactly equal to black (7.5 IRE), and a leftmost one with intensity 4% below black (super-black or \"blacker than black\", 3.5 IRE). The pluge pulse aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into the signal clipping that occurs a small distance below the black level (known as \"crushing the blacks\"). When a monitor is properly adjusted, the rightmost pluge bar should be just barely visible, while the left two should appear indistinguishable from each other and completely black. Also in the bottom section are two sections that contain -In-phase and +Quadrature signals (see [[YIQ]]), centered on black level and having the same gain as the color burst signal; these show up on the pattern as a square of very dark blue, and a square of very dark purple. On a vectorscope, they appear as two short lines ninety degrees apart. These are used to ensure that the television receiver is properly demodulating the 3.58 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[NTSC#Chrominance subcarrier|color subcarrier]] portion of the signal. The vectors for the -I and +Q blocks should fall exactly on the I and Q axes on the vectorscope if the chrominance signal is demodulated properly.\n\n[[File:SMPTE bars and tone.ogv|thumb|250px|right|SMPTE color bars with 1kHz [[sine wave]] tone.]]\nThese bars give rise to the former portion of the casual term \"bars and tone\". Typically, a [[television network]], [[TV station]], or other originator of video programming transmits SMPTE color bars together with a continuous 1000 [[Hertz|Hz]] [[Audio frequency|audio]] [[Pitch (music)|tone]] before sending program material, in order to assert ownership of the transmission line or medium, and so that receiving stations and intermediary telecommunications providers may adjust their equipment. Likewise, producers of television programs typically record \"bars and tone\" at the beginning of a videotape or other recording medium so that the playback equipment can be [[calibration|calibrated]]. Often, the name or [[callsign]] of the TV station, other information such as a real-time clock, or another signal source is graphically superimposed over the bars. \n\nAn alternate form of color bars is the 100% Color Bars pattern, or RGB pattern (sometimes called full field bars), which consists of eight vertical bars of 100% intensity, and does not include the castellation or luminance patterns. Like the SMPTE standard (\"75%\") pattern, the color order is white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue, but with an additional column of saturated black. This pattern is used to check peak color levels and color saturation as well as color alignment. The 100% pattern is not as common or as useful as the SMPTE standard 75% pattern, but many pieces of test equipment generate both patterns, and can be selected to generate either one. Many professional cameras can be set to generate a 100% pattern for calibration to broadcast or recording equipment, especially in a multi-camera installation where all camera signals must match. There is another 75% pattern that consists of the same eight columns as the 100% pattern, but at 75% intensity. This pattern is very seldom used.\n\nAlthough color bars were originally designed to calibrate analog NTSC equipment, they remain widely used within modern digital television facilities. Color bars are used to maintain accurate chroma and luminance levels in CRT, LCD, plasma, and other video displays, as well as duplication, television and webcast equ\u0131pment.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) refers to the pattern as '''Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990'''. Its components are a known [[standardization|standard]]. Comparing it as received to the known standard gives video engineers an indication of how an NTSC video [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] has been altered by recording or transmission and what adjustments must be made to bring it back to specification. It is also used for setting a television monitor or receiver to reproduce NTSC [[chrominance]] and [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] information correctly.\n\nThe pattern was originally conceived by Norbert D. Larky and David D. Holmes of RCA Laboratories and first published in RCA Licensee Bulletin LB-819 on February 7, 1951.

On February 18, 2010, Lee was announced as the new Co-Publisher of DC Comics with [[Dan DiDio]], both replacing [[Paul Levitz]]. Upon DiDio's departure from the company in February 2020, Lee became the sole Publisher of DC Comics. \n\nAside from illustrating comics, he has done work as a designer or creative director on other DC products, such as action figures, video games, branded automobiles and backpacks. Outside of the comics industry, Lee has also designed album covers, and one of [[General Mills]]' [[monster-themed cereals]] for its 2014 Halloween edition.\n\n==Early life==\nJim Lee was born on August 11, 1964 in [[Seoul]], South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=John Jackson |url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays |work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218031356/http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |archivedate=February 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/stars/jim-lee|title= About This Person: Jim Lee|publisher= [[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140119201325/http://www.ign.com/stars/jim-lee|archivedate=January 19, 2014 |url-status=live|accessdate= January 18, 2013}}</ref> He grew up in [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=stlmag>{{cite news|url=http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/July-2010/Comic-Genius/ |title= Comic Genius |first= Byron |last= Kerman|newspaper=[[St. Louis Magazine]]|date=July 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110807171733/http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/July-2010/Comic-Genius/|archivedate= August 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Icons>{{cite book|last1 = Lee|first1 = Jim|last2 = Baker|first2 = Bill|title = Icons: The DC Comics & WildStorm Art of Jim Lee|publisher = [[Titan Books]]|year = 2010|pages = 8 and 10|isbn = 978-1845765194}}</ref> where he lived a \"typical middle-class childhood\".<ref name=Icons/> Though given a Korean name at birth, he chose the name Jim when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen at age 12.<ref>Lee, Jim (November 14, 2017).

Having had to learn English when he first came to the U.S. presented the young Lee with the sense of being an outsider, as did the \"preppy, upper-class\" atmosphere of Country Day. As a result, on the rare occasions that his parents bought him comics, Lee's favorite characters were the [[X-Men]], because they were outsiders themselves. Lee says that he benefited as an artist by connecting with characters that were themselves disenfranchised, like [[Spider-Man]], or who were born of such backgrounds, such as [[Superman]], who was created by two Jewish men from Cleveland to lift their spirits during the Depression. His classmates predicted in his senior yearbook that he would found his own comic book company.<ref name=stlmag/><ref name=Icons/> Despite this, Lee was resigned to following his father's career in medicine, attending [[Princeton University]] to study [[psychology]], with the intention of becoming a medical doctor.<ref name=Icons/><ref name=CBR2006>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523 |title=New York Comic Con, Day One: Jim Lee Spotlight |author=Tantimedh, Adi|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 25, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131227231842/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523|archivedate= December 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Comics career==\n===Rise to fame at Marvel Comics===\nIn 1986, as he was preparing to graduate, Lee took an art class that reignited his love of drawing, and led to his rediscovery of comics at a time when seminal works such as [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' spurred a renaissance within the American comics industry.<ref name=Icons/> After obtaining his psychology degree,<ref name=CBR2006/> he decided to postpone applying to medical school, and earned the reluctant blessing of his parents by allotting himself one year to succeed, vowing that he would attend medical school if he did not break into the comic book industry in that time.

Goodwin invited Lee to Marvel Comics, where the aspiring artist received his first assignment by editor [[Carl Potts]], who hired him to pencil the mid-list series ''[[Alpha Flight]]'', segu\u00e9ing from that title in 1989 to ''[[Punisher: War Journal]]''.<ref name=Icons/><ref name=\"Gaffney\">Gaffney, Suzanne. \"Co-Conspirators Talk\".

The other major series of the initial years of Wildstorm, for which Lee either created characters, co-plotted or provided art for, included ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]]'' and ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]''.\n\nIn 1993, Lee and his friend, [[Valiant Comics]] publisher Steve Massarsky, arranged a Valiant-Image Comics crossover miniseries called ''[[Deathmate]]'', in which the Valiant characters would interact with those of WildStorm, and of Lee's fellow Image partner, [[Rob Liefeld]]. The miniseries would consist of four \"center books\" (each one denoted by a color rather than an issue number), two each produced by the respective companies, plus a prologue and epilogue book. Wildstorm produced ''Deathmate Black'', with Lee himself contributing to the writing. He illustrated the covers for that book, the ''Deathmate Tourbook'' and the prologue book, as well as contributing to the prologue's interior inks.\n\nWildStorm would expand its line to include other ongoing titles whose creative work was handled by other writers and artists, some of which were spinoffs of the earlier titles, or properties owned by other creators, such as [[Whilce Portacio]]'s ''[[Wetworks]]''. As publisher, Lee later expanded his comics line creating two publishing imprints of WildStorm, [[Homage Comics|Homage]] and [[Cliffhanger (comics)|Cliffhanger]] (that years later merged and were replaced by a single WildStorm Signature imprint), to publish creator-owned comics by some selected creators of the US comics industry.\n\nLee and [[Rob Liefeld]], another Marvel-illustrator-turned-Image-founder, returned to Marvel in 1996 to participate in a [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of several classic characters; the project was known as [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]. While Liefeld reworked ''[[Captain America]]'' and ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', Lee plotted ''[[Iron Man]]''<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: \"Part of the 'Heroes Reborn' event, Iron Man was relaunched into a new universe courtesy of writers Scott Lobdell and Jim Lee, with pencils by Whilce Portacio.\"</ref> and plotted and illustrated ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' issues #1-6.<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: \"Jim Lee both wrote and drew this Heroes Reborn relaunch title with the help of fellow scripter Brandon Choi.\"</ref> Halfway through the project, Lee's studio took over Liefeld's two titles, finishing all four series. According to Lee, Marvel proposed continuing the Heroes Reborn lineup indefinitely, but under the condition that Lee would draw at least one of them himself, which he refused to do. Instead, he accepted an offer to re-imagine and relaunch (in the role of editor) three mainstream Marvel Universe titles: ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', and ''[[Nick Fury]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = McLauchlin | first= Jim | date = August 1997 | title = Lee Extends 'Reborn' Run | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 18\u201319}}</ref> Though scheduled to debut in December 1997, these three relaunches never appeared.\n\nLee returned to WildStorm, where he would publish series such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', as well as [[Alan Moore]]'s imprint, [[America's Best Comics]].

There is no emotional investment...I look at Jim Lee's work, and the guy's learning how to draw. He has some craft to what he does...I don't think it has even crossed their minds that comic books can be a medium for intimate self-expression.\" ''The Comics Journal'' publisher [[Gary Groth]] concurred, stating \"Lee's work is obviously more technically accomplished than Liefeld's, but otherwise it's conceptually comparable.\" Windsor-Smith added that he believed in the [[Image Comics]]' founders' exodus from Marvel Comics as an important step for creator autonomy and creator rights, and was angered when they returned to Marvel to do \"[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last = Groth|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Groth|title = The Barry Windsor-Smith Interview|journal = [[The Comics Journal]]|issue = 190|pages = |publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = September 1996|location= Seattle, Washington|url = http://www.tcj.com/the-barry-windsor-smith-interview/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131227160504/http://www.tcj.com/the-barry-windsor-smith-interview/|archivedate= December 27, 2013|url-status=live|accessdate = July 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nLee is married to Carla Michelle Lee<ref name=ComicsBeat>[[MacDonald, Heidi]] (August 2, 2013).

Lee purchased the art at a [[Sotheby's]] auction via Barry Geller, the producer of the faux film, who was selling it to help pay for his child's college tuition. Although the CIA operation that rescued the Americans remained classified for another 17 years, and thus Lee had no idea of the pages' historical significance, nor did Geller know their true monetary value when he sold them to help pay his son's college tuition (with Kirby's permission). Both Lee and Geller learned of the true story behind the art years later with the rest of the public. In August 2013, four of Lee's children were headed for college, and he and Carla decided to auction off the art through [[Heritage Auctions]] in order to pay for their education.<ref

([[Korean language|Korean]] \uc774\uc6a9\ucca0; born August 11, 1964) is a [[Korean American]] comic-book artist, writer, editor, and publisher. He is currently the Publisher and [[Chief creative officer|Chief Creative Officer]] of [[DC Comics]]. In recognition of his work, Lee has received a [[Harvey Award]], [[Inkpot Award]] and three [[Wizard Fan Award]]s.\n\nHe entered the industry in 1987 as an artist for [[Marvel Comics]], illustrating titles such as ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' and ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'', before gaining popularity on ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]''. ''X-Men'' #1, the 1991 spin-off series premiere that Lee penciled and co-wrote with [[Chris Claremont]], remains the best-selling comic book of all time, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. His style was later used for the designs of ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]''.<ref name=CBR.com>{{cite web|author=Nolan, L.D.|title=Jim Lee Launches Kickstarter for Comic Art Backpacks|publisher=[[CBR.com]]|url=https://www.cbr.com/jim-lee-kickstarter-comic-art-backpacks-hex/|date=|accessdate=June 28, 2019|archivedate=June 8, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608003150/https://www.cbr.com/jim-lee-kickstarter-comic-art-backpacks-hex/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Lee and several other artists formed their own publishing company, [[Image Comics]], to publish their creator-owned titles, with Lee publishing titles such as ''[[WildC.A.T.s]]'' and ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]'' through his studio [[WildStorm Productions]].\n\nFinding that the role of publisher reduced the amount of time he was able to devote to illustration, Lee sold WildStorm in 1998 to [[DC Comics]], where he continued to run it as a DC imprint until 2010, as well as illustrating successful titles set in [[DC Universe|DC's main fictional universe]], such as the year-long \"[[Batman: Hush]]\" and \"[[Superman: For Tomorrow]]\" storylines, and books including ''[[Superman Unchained]]'' and the [[New 52]] run of ''[[Justice League]]''. On February 18, 2010, Lee was announced as the new Co-Publisher of DC Comics with [[Dan DiDio]], both replacing [[Paul Levitz]]. Upon DiDio's departure from the company in February 2020, Lee became the sole Publisher of DC Comics. \n\nAside from illustrating comics, he has done work as a designer or creative director on other DC products, such as action figures, video games, branded automobiles and backpacks. Outside of the comics industry, Lee has also designed album covers, and one of [[General Mills]]' [[monster-themed cereals]] for its 2014 Halloween edition.\n\n==Early life==\nJim Lee was born on August 11, 1964 in [[Seoul]], South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=John Jackson |url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays |work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218031356/http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |archivedate=February 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/stars/jim-lee|title= About This Person: Jim Lee|publisher= [[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140119201325/http://www.ign.com/stars/jim-lee|archivedate=January 19, 2014 |url-status=live|accessdate= January 18, 2013}}</ref> He grew up in [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=stlmag>{{cite news|url=http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/July-2010/Comic-Genius/ |title= Comic Genius |first= Byron |last= Kerman|newspaper=[[St. Louis Magazine]]|date=July 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110807171733/http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/July-2010/Comic-Genius/|archivedate= August 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Icons>{{cite book|last1 = Lee|first1 = Jim|last2 = Baker|first2 = Bill|title = Icons: The DC Comics & WildStorm Art of Jim Lee|publisher = [[Titan Books]]|year = 2010|pages = 8 and 10|isbn = 978-1845765194}}</ref> where he lived a \"typical middle-class childhood\".<ref name=Icons/> Though given a Korean name at birth, he chose the name Jim when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen at age 12.<ref>Lee, Jim (November 14, 2017).

Having had to learn English when he first came to the U.S. presented the young Lee with the sense of being an outsider, as did the \"preppy, upper-class\" atmosphere of Country Day. As a result, on the rare occasions that his parents bought him comics, Lee's favorite characters were the [[X-Men]], because they were outsiders themselves. Lee says that he benefited as an artist by connecting with characters that were themselves disenfranchised, like [[Spider-Man]], or who were born of such backgrounds, such as [[Superman]], who was created by two Jewish men from Cleveland to lift their spirits during the Depression. His classmates predicted in his senior yearbook that he would found his own comic book company.<ref name=stlmag/><ref name=Icons/> Despite this, Lee was resigned to following his father's career in medicine, attending [[Princeton University]] to study [[psychology]], with the intention of becoming a medical doctor.<ref name=Icons/><ref name=CBR2006>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523 |title=New York Comic Con, Day One: Jim Lee Spotlight |author=Tantimedh, Adi|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 25, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131227231842/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523|archivedate= December 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Comics career==\n===Rise to fame at Marvel Comics===\nIn 1986, as he was preparing to graduate, Lee took an art class that reignited his love of drawing, and led to his rediscovery of comics at a time when seminal works such as [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' spurred a renaissance within the American comics industry.<ref name=Icons/> After obtaining his psychology degree,<ref name=CBR2006/> he decided to postpone applying to medical school, and earned the reluctant blessing of his parents by allotting himself one year to succeed, vowing that he would attend medical school if he did not break into the comic book industry in that time. He submitted samples to various publishers, but did not find success.<ref name=Icons/> When Lee befriended St. Louis-area comics artists Don Secrease and [[Rick Burchett]], they convinced him he needed to show his portfolio to editors in person, prompting Lee to attend a New York comics convention,<ref name=stlmag/> where he met editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]]. Goodwin invited Lee to Marvel Comics, where the aspiring artist received his first assignment by editor [[Carl Potts]], who hired him to pencil the mid-list series ''[[Alpha Flight]]'', segu\u00e9ing from that title in 1989 to ''[[Punisher: War Journal]]''.<ref name=Icons/><ref name=\"Gaffney\">Gaffney, Suzanne. \"Co-Conspirators Talk\".

The other major series of the initial years of Wildstorm, for which Lee either created characters, co-plotted or provided art for, included ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]]'' and ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]''.\n\nIn 1993, Lee and his friend, [[Valiant Comics]] publisher Steve Massarsky, arranged a Valiant-Image Comics crossover miniseries called ''[[Deathmate]]'', in which the Valiant characters would interact with those of WildStorm, and of Lee's fellow Image partner, [[Rob Liefeld]]. The miniseries would consist of four \"center books\" (each one denoted by a color rather than an issue number), two each produced by the respective companies, plus a prologue and epilogue book. Wildstorm produced ''Deathmate Black'', with Lee himself contributing to the writing. He illustrated the covers for that book, the ''Deathmate Tourbook'' and the prologue book, as well as contributing to the prologue's interior inks.\n\nWildStorm would expand its line to include other ongoing titles whose creative work was handled by other writers and artists, some of which were spinoffs of the earlier titles, or properties owned by other creators, such as [[Whilce Portacio]]'s ''[[Wetworks]]''. As publisher, Lee later expanded his comics line creating two publishing imprints of WildStorm, [[Homage Comics|Homage]] and [[Cliffhanger (comics)|Cliffhanger]] (that years later merged and were replaced by a single WildStorm Signature imprint), to publish creator-owned comics by some selected creators of the US comics industry.\n\nLee and [[Rob Liefeld]], another Marvel-illustrator-turned-Image-founder, returned to Marvel in 1996 to participate in a [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of several classic characters; the project was known as [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]].

According to Lee, Marvel proposed continuing the Heroes Reborn lineup indefinitely, but under the condition that Lee would draw at least one of them himself, which he refused to do. Instead, he accepted an offer to re-imagine and relaunch (in the role of editor) three mainstream Marvel Universe titles: ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', and ''[[Nick Fury]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = McLauchlin | first= Jim | date = August 1997 | title = Lee Extends 'Reborn' Run | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 18\u201319}}</ref> Though scheduled to debut in December 1997, these three relaunches never appeared.\n\nLee returned to WildStorm, where he would publish series such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', as well as [[Alan Moore]]'s imprint, [[America's Best Comics]].

{"title_page": "Ryanggang explosion", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{original research|date=January 2008}}\n}}\n\n{{DPRK WMD}}\nThe '''Ryanggang explosion''' was a large [[explosion]] that took place in [[North Korea]] on 9 September 2004 in the northern [[Administrative divisions of North Korea|province]] of [[Ryanggang]]. The nature and cause of the suspected explosion is the subject of speculation. No neighboring nations have claimed any detection of radioactive isotopes characteristic of a nuclear explosion.\n\n==The suspected explosion==\nThe suspected explosion occurred near W\u014fltan Workers' District (''W\u014fltal-lodongjagu'') (41\u00b019'47\"N 127\u00b005'02\"E) in the county of [[Kimhyongjik County|Kimhy\u014fngjik]] in [[Ryanggang Province]], a mountainous region, about 1.5&nbsp;km above sea level. The explosion was about 30&nbsp;km from the border with [[China]]. The area contains several [[military]] installations, including [[munition]]s [[factory|factories]] and a secret underground military base suspected to contain a [[uranium]] [[isotope separation|enrichment]] plant.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nEarly reports stated that [[seismic]] activity had been detected early on 9 September 2004, and this was correlated with a \"strangely shaped cloud\", suspected to be a [[mushroom cloud]]. Together these would indicate a large explosion. The date, 9 September 2004, the 56th [[Day of the Foundation of the Republic (North Korea)|anniversary of the formation of North Korea]], was taken as significant because North Korea has a history of making grand military gestures on significant dates. However, the original reports have been contradicted by later reports denying that there was any explosion.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-09/17/content_375526.htm South Korea: No big blast in North Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922050811/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-09/17/content_375526.htm |date=2004-09-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nThe incident was not reported internationally until 12 September 2004, when the [[South Korea]]n news agency [[Yonhap]] cited a source in [[Beijing]], [[China]], which said a [[mushroom cloud]] had been observed. In addition, suspicion was raised by the fact that there was no mention of the explosion on internal North Korean [[Mass media|media]]. However, North Korean news is usually a method employed by governing figures to make the ruling party's decisions more favourable to the people (national and internationally), therefore unfavourable stories are commonly not broadcast. The [[Ryongchon disaster]] earlier in 2004 was reported only several days after the event.\n\nThere was immediate popular speculation that the explosion was [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] in origin.  [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] said there was \"no indication\" that it was nuclear, and [[South Korea]] similarly said that it did not appear to be nuclear. It would be some days before the effects of a nuclear explosion would be unequivocally visible to apolitical authorities. It would not be possible to hide the nuclear nature of such an explosion for long, as the [[radioactive]] [[isotopes]] created by a nuclear explosion would be detectable to outside observers around the world.\n\n===From North Korea===\nNorth Korea initially denied that the explosion was nuclear. When prompted for an explanation, North Korea's [[foreign minister]], [[Paek Nam-sun]], officially stated that the explosion \"was in fact the deliberate [[demolition]] of a [[mountain]] as part of a huge [[hydroelectric]] project\". North Korea announced on 13 September 2004 that the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[ambassador]], [[David Slinn]], would be permitted to visit the site. Diplomats from the United Kingdom, [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] and [[Mongolia]] visited what was purported to be the site on 16 September 2004, and reported having seen a hydroelectric project under construction. However, South Korea said the diplomats had not been in the correct location and were about 100&nbsp;km (62 mi) from the suspected explosion site.\n\n===From South Korea===\nOn 17 September 2004, South Korean Vice Minister of Unification [[Rhee Bong-jo]] claimed that there was no explosion at all at the purported site, saying the supposed mushroom cloud was a natural cloud formation (mushroom clouds form from many types of large explosions, not only nuclear detonations). On the same day the [[Korea Earthquake Research Center]] reported that the only seismic activity in Ryanggang province in the period in question was at 23:24 [[Korea Standard Time]] ([[UTC]] +9) on 8 September 2004 at [[Mount Baekdu]], about 100&nbsp;km from the suspected blast site.\n\n== North Korean disarmament talks ==\n{{See also|North Korea nuclear weapons program}}\nAt the time of the blast, North Korea was under pressure to again resume [[Six-party talks|six-way diplomatic talks]] concerning its nuclear program with the [[United States]], [[South Korea]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Russia]], and [[Japan]]. North Korea was insisting on a delay before a fourth round of talks, citing recently revealed [[South Korean nuclear research programs]]. On 14 September 2004, a British envoy said that North Korea was still committed to the talks, but on 27 September 2004, the [[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]], North Korea's state news agency, reported that resumption of the talks was out of the question until the [[United States]] made certain concessions.\n\nSince the initial days, there has been essentially no follow-up reporting in Western media.\n\nOn 28 September, [[North Korea]]n Vice Foreign Minister [[Choi Su-heon]] announced at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] that it had turned plutonium from 8,000 spent fuel rods into nuclear weapons as a deterrent against the US nuclear threat.

As of this date, analysts believed North Korea had ruled out further talks until after the [[2008 United States presidential election|United States presidential election]] in November 2008.\n\nSince then, North Korea has conducted [[List of North Korean nuclear tests|multiple nuclear weapons tests]] and issued several threats of war on South Korea.

The nature and cause of the suspected explosion is the subject of speculation. No neighboring nations have claimed any detection of radioactive isotopes characteristic of a nuclear explosion.\n\n==The suspected explosion==\nThe suspected explosion occurred near W\u014fltan Workers' District (''W\u014fltal-lodongjagu'') (41\u00b019'47\"N 127\u00b005'02\"E) in the county of [[Kimhyongjik County|Kimhy\u014fngjik]] in [[Ryanggang Province]], a mountainous region, about 1.5&nbsp;km above sea level. The explosion was about 30&nbsp;km from the border with [[China]]. The area contains several [[military]] installations, including [[munition]]s [[factory|factories]] and a secret underground military base suspected to contain a [[uranium]] [[isotope separation|enrichment]] plant.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nEarly reports stated that [[seismic]] activity had been detected early on 9 September 2004, and this was correlated with a \"strangely shaped cloud\", suspected to be a [[mushroom cloud]]. Together these would indicate a large explosion. The date, 9 September 2004, the 56th [[Day of the Foundation of the Republic (North Korea)|anniversary of the formation of North Korea]], was taken as significant because North Korea has a history of making grand military gestures on significant dates.

{"title_page": "Territorial evolution of the United States", "text_new": "The [[United States|United States of America]] was created on July 4, 1776, with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen]] [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] colonies. In the [[Lee Resolution]] of July 2, 1776, the colonies resolved that they were free and independent states. Their independence was recognized by Great Britain in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783, which concluded the [[American Revolutionary War]]. This effectively doubled the size of the colonies, now able to stretch west past the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation Line]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. This land was organized into territories and then states, though there remained some conflict with the sea-to-sea grants claimed by some of the original colonies. In time, these grants were [[state cessions|ceded]] to the federal government.\n\nThe first great expansion of the country came with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, which doubled the country's territory, although the southeastern border with [[Spanish Florida]] was the subject of much dispute until it too was acquired in 1821. The [[Oregon Country]] gave the United States access to the [[Pacific Ocean]], though it was shared for a time with the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"vz-1818\" /> The annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845 led directly to the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], after which the victorious United States obtained the northern half of [[Mexico]]'s territory, including what was quickly made the state of [[California]].<ref name=\"vz-ca\" /> However, as the development of the country moved west, the question of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] became too much to ignore, as there was a struggle to keep the number of northern free states equal to the number of southern slave states, with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the [[Missouri Compromise]] and [[Bleeding Kansas]]. This came to a head in 1860 and 1861, when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the [[Confederate States of America]]. The [[American Civil War]] led to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 and the eventual readmission of the states to the [[United States Congress]].\n\nThe country's expansion beyond North America began in 1856 with the passage of the [[Guano Islands Act]], causing many small and uninhabited, but economically important, islands in the Pacific Ocean and [[Caribbean Sea]] to be claimed.<ref name=\"guano\" /> Most of these claims were eventually abandoned due to competing claims from other countries or the guano having been mined out. The Pacific expansion culminated in the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in 1893 and its annexation in 1898. [[Alaska]], the last major acquisition in North America, was [[Alaska Purchase|purchased]] from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1867.\n\nDesires for expansion into Spanish territories like [[Cuba]] led to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898, in which the United States gained [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Philippines]], and occupied Cuba for several years. [[American Samoa]] was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the [[Second Samoan Civil War]].<ref>Ryden, George Herbert. ''The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa''. New York: Octagon Books, 1975.</ref> The United States purchased the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] from Denmark in 1917.<ref>http://www.vinow.com/general_usvi/history/ Vinow.com. Virgin Islands History. Retrieved January 18, 2018.</ref> Guam and Puerto Rico remain territories; the Philippines became independent in 1946, after being a major theater of [[World War II]]. Following the war, [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|many islands]] were [[United Nations Trust Territories|entrusted]] to the U.S. by the [[United Nations]],<ref name=\"ttpi\" /> and while the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] remain a U.S. territory, the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], and [[Palau]] emerged from the trust territory as independent nations. The last major international change was the acquisition in 1904, and return to [[Panama]] in 1979, of the [[Panama Canal Zone]], a region of American sovereignty to build and run the [[Panama Canal]]. The final cession of power over the region was made to Panama in 1999.\n\nRegarding internal borders, while territories could shift wildly in size, once established states have generally retained their initial borders. Only four states \u2013 [[Maine]], [[Kentucky]], [[Vermont]], and [[West Virginia]] \u2013 have been created from land claimed by another state; all of the others were created from territories or directly from acquisitions.

During their ownership of [[West Florida]], the British had moved its border north, and the cession to Spain appeared to apply to the full extent of the British colony. However, the British-American treaty granted the extension of West Florida to the United States, where it enlarged [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] south to [[31st parallel north|31\u00b0 north]], indicating that only the original definition of West Florida was to be ceded to Spain. The local Spanish governors also made a move to occupy forts along the [[Mississippi River]], with claims to everything south of the [[Tennessee River]]; it is unknown how official or strong these claims were, and they are not mapped as they are in conflict with the other Spanish claim involving the border of West Florida.<ref>{{cite book |

a land border redefined how the border between the [[Lake of the Woods]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] should be considered; previously, the border followed the curve of the parallel between each border monument, while the treaty changed this to straight lines between each monument. Through this, the United States netted a gain of between 30 and 35 acres of land. Due to the extremely small shift, the lack of specific documentation of where the changes occurred, and the lack of any human impact, this change is not mapped. There was also a change to the border in the [[Lake of the Woods]]; due to a surveying anomaly, the previous border intersected itself several times in the lake, creating enclaves of United States water surrounded by Canadian water. The treaty changed the border to use the southernmost intersection as the [[northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods]]. Finally, the maritime border in the [[Bay of Fundy]] was adjusted, netting Canada roughly 9 acres of water.\n|align=\"center\"|''too small to map''\n|-\n!scope=row|March 1, 1926\n|The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] resolved the conflict between [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] in the favor of [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=\"wi-vs-mi\">{{ussc|name=Wisconsin v.

In the [[Lee Resolution]] of July 2, 1776, the colonies resolved that they were free and independent states. Their independence was recognized by Great Britain in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1783, which concluded the [[American Revolutionary War]]. This effectively doubled the size of the colonies, now able to stretch west past the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation Line]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. This land was organized into territories and then states, though there remained some conflict with the sea-to-sea grants claimed by some of the original colonies. In time, these grants were [[state cessions|ceded]] to the federal government.\n\nThe first great expansion of the country came with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, which doubled the country's territory, although the southeastern border with [[Spanish Florida]] was the subject of much dispute until it too was acquired in 1821. The [[Oregon Country]] gave the United States access to the [[Pacific Ocean]], though it was shared for a time with the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"vz-1818\" /> The annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845 led directly to the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], after which the victorious United States obtained the northern half of [[Mexico]]'s territory, including what was quickly made the state of [[California]].<ref name=\"vz-ca\" /> However, as the development of the country moved west, the question of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] became too much to ignore, as there was a struggle to keep the number of northern free states equal to the number of southern slave states, with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the [[Missouri Compromise]] and [[Bleeding Kansas]]. This came to a head in 1860 and 1861, when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the [[Confederate States of America]]. The [[American Civil War]] led to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 and the eventual readmission of the states to the [[United States Congress]].\n\nThe country's expansion beyond North America began in 1856 with the passage of the [[Guano Islands Act]], causing many small and uninhabited, but economically important, islands in the Pacific Ocean and [[Caribbean Sea]] to be claimed.<ref name=\"guano\" /> Most of these claims were eventually abandoned due to competing claims from other countries or the guano having been mined out. The Pacific expansion culminated in the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in 1893 and its annexation in 1898. [[Alaska]], the last major acquisition in North America, was [[Alaska Purchase|purchased]] from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1867.\n\nDesires for expansion into Spanish territories like [[Cuba]] led to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898, in which the United States gained [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Philippines]], and occupied Cuba for several years. [[American Samoa]] was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the [[Second Samoan Civil War]].<ref>Ryden, George Herbert. ''The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa''. New York: Octagon Books, 1975.</ref> The United States purchased the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] from Denmark in 1917.<ref>http://www.vinow.com/general_usvi/history/ Vinow.com. Virgin Islands History. Retrieved January 18, 2018.</ref> Guam and Puerto Rico remain territories; the Philippines became independent in 1946, after being a major theater of [[World War II]]. Following the war, [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|many islands]] were [[United Nations Trust Territories|entrusted]] to the U.S. by the [[United Nations]],<ref name=\"ttpi\" /> and while the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] remain a U.S. territory, the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], and [[Palau]] emerged from the trust territory as independent nations. The last major international change was the acquisition in 1904, and return to [[Panama]] in 1979, of the [[Panama Canal Zone]], a region of American sovereignty to build and run the [[Panama Canal]]. The final cession of power over the region was made to Panama in 1999.\n\nRegarding internal borders, while territories could shift wildly in size, once established states have generally retained their initial borders. Only four states \u2013 [[Maine]], [[Kentucky]], [[Vermont]], and [[West Virginia]] \u2013 have been created from land claimed by another state; all of the others were created from territories or directly from acquisitions. Four states \u2013 [[Louisiana]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], and [[Pennsylvania]] \u2013 have  expanded significantly by acquiring additional federal territory after their initial admission to the Union.

During their ownership of [[West Florida]], the British had moved its border north, and the cession to Spain appeared to apply to the full extent of the British colony. However, the British-American treaty granted the extension of West Florida to the United States, where it enlarged [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] south to [[31st parallel north|31\u00b0 north]], indicating that only the original definition of West Florida was to be ceded to Spain. The local Spanish governors also made a move to occupy forts along the [[Mississippi River]], with claims to everything south of the [[Tennessee River]]; it is unknown how official or strong these claims were, and they are not mapped as they are in conflict with the other Spanish claim involving the border of West Florida.<ref>{{cite book |

a land border redefined how the border between the [[Lake of the Woods]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] should be considered; previously, the border followed the curve of the parallel between each border monument, while the treaty changed this to straight lines between each monument. Through this, the United States netted a gain of between 30 and 35 acres of land. Due to the extremely small shift, the lack of specific documentation of where the changes occurred, and the lack of any human impact, this change is not mapped. There was also a change to the border in the [[Lake of the Woods]]; due to a surveying anomaly, the previous border intersected itself several times in the lake, creating enclaves of United States water surrounded by Canadian water. The treaty changed the border to use the southernmost intersection as the [[northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods]]. Finally, the maritime border in the [[Bay of Fundy]] was adjusted, netting Canada roughly 9 acres of water.\n|align=\"center\"|''too small to map''\n|-\n!scope=row|March 1, 1926\n|The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] resolved the conflict between [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] in the favor of [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=\"wi-vs-mi\">{{ussc|name=Wisconsin v.
