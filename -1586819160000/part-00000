The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden, with death often occurring within hours. Its cause remains unknown, although it has been suggested that an unknown species of [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome|hantavirus]] was responsible.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n[[John Caius]] was a practising physician in Shrewsbury in 1551, when an outbreak occurred, and he described the symptoms and signs of the disease in ''A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse'' (1552), which is the main historical source of knowledge of the disease. It began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great exhaustion. The cold stage might last from half an hour to three hours, after which the hot and sweating stage began. The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. A sense of heat, headache, [[delirium]], rapid pulse, and intense thirst accompanied the sweat. Palpitation and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms, as well. No skin eruptions were noted by observers, including Caius.  In the final stages, there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought was fatal if the patient were permitted to give way to it. One attack did not produce immunity, and some people suffered several bouts before dying.<ref name=Heyman2014>{{cite journal|authors=Heyman P. & Simons L. & Cochez, C. |title=Were the English Sweating Sickness and the Picardy Sweat Caused by Hantaviruses?|journal= Viruses|date= 2014|volume=6|number=1|pages=151\u2013171|doi=10.3390/v6010151|pmid=24402305 |pmc=3917436}}</ref> The disease tended to occur in summer and early autumn.\n\n== Cause ==\nThe cause is the most mysterious aspect of the disease. Commentators then and now put much blame on the sewage, generally poor sanitation, and contaminated water supplies of the time, which might have harboured the source of infection.

The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden, with death often occurring within hours. Its cause remains unknown, although it has been suggested that an unknown species of [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome|hantavirus]] was responsible.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n[[John Caius]] was a practising physician in Shrewsbury in 1551, when an outbreak occurred, and he described the symptoms and signs of the disease in ''A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse'' (1552), which is the main historical source of knowledge of the disease. It began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great exhaustion. The cold stage might last from half an hour to three hours, after which the hot and sweating stage began. The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. A sense of heat, headache, [[delirium]], rapid pulse, and intense thirst accompanied the sweat. Palpitation and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms, as well. No skin eruptions were noted by observers, including Caius.  In the final stages, there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought was fatal if the patient were permitted to give way to it.

Walker's reign was to prove the most successful period in the club's history.<ref>Price, P12</ref> Walker was always quick to acknowledge the contribution made by McLean and his fatherly interest in the welfare and development of the players. The important foundations Walker inherited from McLean included the ''Terrible Trio'' forwards, the full back pair of [[Bobby Parker (footballer, born 1925)|Bobby Parker]] and [[Tam McKenzie]] and half backs [[Bobby Dougan]] and [[Davie Laing]]. To this established core [[John Cumming (footballer)|John Cumming]] had recently broken through to the first team in the left half position he was to dominate for many years. [[Freddie Glidden]] was already at Tynecastle but yet to first team debut as was the then schoolboy [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]]. Walker made Parker the team Captain.<ref name = hist44-54/><ref name = hall/>\n\nMackay's key signing as a professional was under Walker in 1952 (initially part-time whilst also working as a joiner). Mackay's pairing with Cumming at wing half was to become the nucleus of the team in the middle of the pitch. Mackay was a supremely talented all round player of ferocious tackling, endless running and sublime ball control. Cumming's ''Iron Man'' nickname says much of his fearless determination. Despite his commitment he retained control of his temper and was never booked in his career. Cumming was the only player to collect medals for all seven of the trophies Hearts won under Walker. \"He never had a bad game. It was either a fairly good game or an excellent game,\" said Mackay later of his former teammate.<ref name=cummingobit>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/16/john-cumming-obituary|title=Obituary: John Cumming|first=Ewan|last=Murray|date=16 December 2008|website=the Guardian|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> Both went on to become full Scotland internationalists while playing for Hearts.<ref name = hist44-54/><ref name = hall/>\n\nBauld's value to the team was underlined in 1952/53, when he missed eight vital league games through ankle injuries. Hearts were struggling, but with Bauld's return to full fitness came a change in fortunes. From the bottom half of the league they surged up the table to finish in fourth place (as they had the two previous seasons). That resurgence also took them to a [[1952\u201353 Scottish Cup]] semi final against Rangers before 116,262 fans at Hampden Park in Glasgow. Wardhaugh scored in the 2\u20131 defeat.

The title hinged on Rangers visit to Tynecastle on 13 April. A capacity crowd watched a tense game in which Rangers keeper, [[George Niven]], was man of the match. Hearts could not beat him and the only goal came from [[Billy Simpson]] of Rangers who scored on the break in 35 minutes.

Conn suffered a serious ankle injury meaning he only played in five league games all season. Injury hit Conn left Hearts for [[Raith Rovers]] in September 1958 just two years after his 1956 zenith. He did so after 408 first team games and 221 goals.<ref name = hall/> With an injury hit Bauld only playing nine times in the league title win a new Hearts attacking trio were dominant. For a third time Wardhaugh was the League's top marksman with 28 strikes. This was one ahead of [[Jimmy Murray (footballer born 1933)|Jimmy Murray]]'s 27 and four more than Young's 24. Mackay, now Captain, was fourth in Hearts' league scoring charts with 12. Hearts won that [[Scottish football champions|League title]] in [[1957\u201358 in Scottish football|1957\u201358]] with record-breaking points, goals scored and goal difference. Their record from 34 league games of 62 points out of a maximum possible 68 was 13 more than their nearest rival. They scored 132 goals (still the Scottish top tier record) with only 29 against for a record net difference of +103. This was Hearts' greatest ever league side. Murray and Mackay both played for Scotland at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] where Murray scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Yugoslavia. Parker was a fringe player in the league winning season, his last season as a Hearts player.

Young and Thomson departed for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in November 1960. At Everton Young was known as ''The Golden Vision'' and became another from the Walker production line of full Scotland internationalists. Smith had an injury hit season leading to his joining Dundee (who became the third club with whom he won the Scottish title). Hearts signed further future full internationalists in [[William Wallace (footballer)|Willie Wallace]] and [[David Holt (footballer, born 1936)|David Holt]]. Hearts lost the [[1961 Scottish League Cup Final]] after a replay. Cumming scored a deserved equalising penalty for Hearts in the first game 1\u20131 draw they largely dominated against the Scot Symon managed Rangers. [[Norrie Davidson]] scored a then equalising Hearts goal when they lost in the 3\u20131 replay defeat.<ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nBauld left Hearts in 1962 with 355 goals from 510 first team appearances.<ref name = hall/> Another future internationalist, [[Willie Hamilton (footballer)|Willie Hamilton]], joined for the run culminating in the [[1962 Scottish League Cup Final]] win. Hearts won the trophy for a fourth time with a 1\u20130 final win over [[Willie Waddell]]'s fine Kilmarnock side of that era. Davidson's goal this time proved decisive. Like in the 1954\u201355 win Hearts eliminated Celtic in that [[1962-63 Scottish League Cup]] group stage.<ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] Hearts fought out a championship title race with Waddell's Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with Dundee United meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post.

The players of greatest note in the late sixties were [[Jim Cruickshank]], [[Alan Anderson (footballer)|Alan Anderson]] and [[Donald Ford]] with [[Drew Busby]] joining the three in the 1970s. The high point of the 1970s was another run to the Scottish Cup Final. In 1975\u201376 they again lost 3\u20131 in the final this time to Rangers. After the advent of the ten team Premier Division in 1975, Hearts were subsequently relegated for the first time in [[1976\u201377 in Scottish football|1977]]. This began a sequence of [[yo-yo club|yo-yoing]] between the Premier League and First Division six times in seven seasons.\n\nOn 25 May 1981, 34 year old [[Wallace Mercer]] became chairman after buying a controlling interest in Hearts for \u00a3265,000.<ref name =mercer>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12442782.Wallace_Mercer_Businessman_and_former_chairman_of_Hearts_FC/|title=Wallace Mercer Businessman and former chairman of Hearts FC|website=HeraldScotland|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> Hearts had just been relegated from the top flight for the third time in five seasons. The following December (1981), Mercer promoted [[Alex MacDonald (footballer, born 1948)|Alex MacDonald]] to be Player-Manager. At the end of the 1982\u201383 season Hearts were promoted back to the top flight. This marked an upturn in their fortunes to rejoin the more competitive clubs in Scotland's top flight. The 1985\u201386 season was their best since 1965. The league campaign started with the loss of five of the first eight games. From there the club went on a 27-game unbeaten league run, reaching the top of the league on 21 December after a 1\u20130 win at St Mirren. Hearts needed a draw from the last game of the season away to [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on 3 May 1986 to win the Scottish league title. Before that final game they were two points ahead of Celtic and with a superior goal difference of four goals. However, this strong statistical position was undermined in the run up to the game when several players in the Hearts squad were hit by a viral infection. [[Craig Levein]] failed to recover to make the game in Dundee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hearts/5363880/What-a-heartbreaker-How-Hearts-lost-the-Scottish-title-to-Celtic-in-1986.html|title=How Hearts lost the Scottish title to Celtic in 1986|first=Roddy|last=Forsyth|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=27 July 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZFezYotlVk#t=380.218895|title=That was The Team That Was Part2|last=Subtitledvideos4|date=20 December 2010|accessdate=27 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nCeltic were 4\u20130 up away at St Mirren at half time in their final fixture. Thus, at half time the players knew that they would have to deliver a result at [[Dens Park]]. Substitute [[Albert Kidd]] forced Hearts to concede a corner kick with seven minutes remaining. The in-swinging corner was touched on and fell to Kidd who put Dundee ahead. This was the first goal Hearts had conceded from a corner all season. Hearts now needed an equaliser to win the title. However, Kidd went on a run with the ball from the halfway line down the right wing beating two Hearts players. After then playing a one-two with a teammate on the edge of the Hearts box he finished to score a second with four minutes left.

After MacDonald's summer 1990 departure the club struggled to settle on a manager. Within a two-year period, [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]], [[Sandy Clark]] and [[Tommy McLean]] were all sacked. From April 1989 to April 1994 Hearts went on a run of 22 games in a row without defeat against arch-rivals [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the [[Edinburgh Derby]].\n\nIn 1994 Mercer sold his shares in Hearts to Chris Robinson and Leslie Deans. Under Mercer Hearts finished second in the Scottish top tier three times and once in the Scottish Cup. Mercer's time at the club though was without senior silverware. His personal influence at the club is perhaps best remembered with an attempted merger with Hibs in 1990. Seen by Hibs fans as an attempted take over to liquidate their club, Mercer's attempts were met with bitterness and acrimony before he backed away.<ref name =mercer/>\n\nIn [[1997\u201398 in Scottish football|1998]], Hearts beat Rangers 2\u20131 to lift the Scottish Cup under the management of ex Hearts player, [[Jim Jefferies (footballer)|Jim Jefferies]]. [[Colin Cameron (footballer)|Colin Cameron]] scored a first-minute penalty and [[Stephane Adam]] added after half time.

He was a regular first team player by [[1933\u201334 in Scottish football|1933\u201334]] but despite some emphatic victories, inconsistent form limited Hearts to a sixth-place finish.\n\nDespite Walker scoring 192 league goals for Hearts and playing in sides boasting numerous internationals, such as Scots [[David McCulloch|Dave McCulloch]], [[Barney Battles, Jr.|Barney Battles]], [[Andrew Anderson (footballer)|Andy Anderson]] and [[Alex Massie]], [[Wales|Welshman]] Freddie Warren and Irishman Willie Reid, Walker was destined not to win a major honour as a player at [[Tynecastle Park|Tynecastle]].

He took the role of player-assistant to manager McLean. McLean's intention was that Walker would be a steadying influence in a developing young team. However, after a single appearance at right-half in a 1\u20130 home defeat by [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], Walker retired to concentrate fully on learning the managerial ropes.<ref>Price, P10</ref> Tangible progress was made in the League Championship in 1949\u201350 when Hearts finished third.

Walker's reign was to prove the most successful period in the club's history.<ref>Price, P12</ref> Walker was always quick to acknowledge the contribution made by McLean and his fatherly interest in the welfare and development of the players. The important foundations Walker inherited from McLean included the ''Terrible Trio'' forwards, the full back pair of [[Bobby Parker (footballer, born 1925)|Bobby Parker]] and [[Tam McKenzie]] and half backs [[Bobby Dougan]] and [[Davie Laing]]. To this established core [[John Cumming (footballer)|John Cumming]] had recently broken through to the first team in the left half position he was to dominate for many years. [[Freddie Glidden]] was already at Tynecastle but yet to first team debut as was the then schoolboy [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]]. Walker made Parker the team Captain.<ref name = hist44-54/><ref name = hall/>\n\nMackay's key signing as a professional was under Walker in 1952 (initially part-time whilst also working as a joiner). Mackay's pairing with Cumming at wing half was to become the nucleus of the team in the middle of the pitch. Mackay was a supremely talented all round player of ferocious tackling, endless running and sublime ball control. Cumming's ''Iron Man'' nickname says much of his fearless determination. Despite his commitment he retained control of his temper and was never booked in his career. Cumming was the only player to collect medals for all seven of the trophies Hearts won under Walker. \"He never had a bad game. It was either a fairly good game or an excellent game,\" said Mackay later of his former teammate.<ref name=cummingobit>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/16/john-cumming-obituary|title=Obituary: John Cumming|first=Ewan|last=Murray|date=16 December 2008|website=the Guardian|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> Both went on to become full Scotland internationalists while playing for Hearts.<ref name = hist44-54/><ref name = hall/>\n\nBauld's value to the team was underlined in 1952/53, when he missed eight vital league games through ankle injuries. Hearts were struggling, but with Bauld's return to full fitness came a change in fortunes. From the bottom half of the league they surged up the table to finish in fourth place (as they had the two previous seasons). That resurgence also took them to a [[1952\u201353 Scottish Cup]] semi final against Rangers before 116,262 fans at Hampden Park in Glasgow. Wardhaugh scored in the 2\u20131 defeat. Hearts were now though on an upward trajectory.<ref name = hist44-54/><ref name = hall/>\n\nIn [[1953\u201354 in Scottish football|1953\u201354]], Wardhaugh became the [[Scottish Football League|A Division]]'s top scorer with 27 goals as Hearts appeared set to win the [[Scottish football champions|League championship]]. However, on 13 March 1954 in the Scottish Cup quarter final 3\u20130 defeat away to Aberdeen, Parker broke his jaw, Conn injured his back, and Wardhaugh collected a serious shin bone injury. Dougan already had a lengthy knee injury meaning 9 November 1953 was his last competitive Hearts first team game (Dougan only subsequently played for Hearts in friendlies). Walker immediately tried Glidden to cover and he took over the centre half berth from Dougan. A stuttering end to their season saw [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] overtake them.<ref name=bauldbio2>{{cite web|url=http://www.williebauldmc.co.uk/html/biograph2.html|title=Biograph2|website=Williebauldmc.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> The young Mackay was given his first team debut on 7 November of that 1953\u201354 season one week before his nineteenth birthday. Naturally more left sided than right, Mackay played in the number six jersey normally associated with the absent Cumming. Mackay's next two appearances though weren't until mid March immediately after the Aberdeen cup defeat when again he played in Cumming's position. It wasn't until 17 April 1954 in a 1\u20130 win at Clyde that Walker first selected Mackay, Glidden and Cumming in the numbers four, five and six.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/195404171.html#team|title=1954-04-17 Sat Clyde 0 Hearts 1|website=Londonhearts.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref name = hist44-54/><ref name = hall/>\n\nThe team was boosted by the signing of [[Ian Crawford (footballer)|Ian Crawford]] in August 1954. Mackay was given his extended place in the team in the 1954\u201355 season immediately after Laing's 5 September transfer to Clyde.

Marshall, a future England under 23 internationalist, became a Hearts goalkeeping regular until 1963. Hearts led the Scottish League for most of the 1956\u201357 season. The title hinged on Rangers visit to Tynecastle on 13 April. A capacity crowd watched a tense game in which Rangers keeper, [[George Niven]], was man of the match. Hearts could not beat him and the only goal came from [[Billy Simpson]] of Rangers who scored on the break in 35 minutes. Rangers had games in hand which they won to overtake Hearts and lift the trophy.<ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nWalker completed the set of having won all three major Scottish football trophies with the League Championship in [[1957\u201358 in Scottish football|1957\u201358]]. Conn suffered a serious ankle injury meaning he only played in five league games all season. Injury hit Conn left Hearts for [[Raith Rovers]] in September 1958 just two years after his 1956 zenith. He did so after 408 first team games and 221 goals.<ref name = hall/> With an injury hit Bauld only playing nine times in the league title win a new Hearts attacking trio were dominant. For a third time Wardhaugh was the League's top marksman with 28 strikes. This was one ahead of [[Jimmy Murray (footballer born 1933)|Jimmy Murray]]'s 27 and four more than Young's 24. Mackay, now Captain, was fourth in Hearts' league scoring charts with 12. Hearts won that [[Scottish football champions|League title]] in [[1957\u201358 in Scottish football|1957\u201358]] with record-breaking points, goals scored and goal difference. Their record from 34 league games of 62 points out of a maximum possible 68 was 13 more than their nearest rival. They scored 132 goals (still the Scottish top tier record) with only 29 against for a record net difference of +103. This was Hearts' greatest ever league side. Murray and Mackay both played for Scotland at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] where Murray scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Yugoslavia. Parker was a fringe player in the league winning season, his last season as a Hearts player. He moved to the club coaching staff before joining the Board of Directors where he also had a spell as chairman.<ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nIn the [[1958\u201359 Scottish League Cup]] group stage Hearts eliminated Rangers. That October [[1958 Scottish League Cup Final]] was won with a heavy 5\u20131 defeat of [[Partick Thistle]]. Bauld and Murray each scored two and [[Johnny Hamilton (footballer, born 1935)|Johnny Hamilton]] netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5\u20130 with all goals in the first 35 minutes.

That League Cup win was also Glidden's last trophy as a recurring back injury that season numbered his playing days at Tynecastle. 36 year old MacKenzie left in 1959 as did Wardhaugh. He scored 206 goals in 304 league games and a total of 376 goals in 518 games for Hearts.<ref name = hall/><ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nAfter collecting three Scottish championships and 19 full Scotland caps at Hibernian, [[Gordon Smith (1924-2004)|Gordon Smith]] had a recurring ankle injury leading to his [[free transfer (football)|free transfer]] in 1959. Smith believed that an operation could cure the injury<ref name=\"montford\">[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1964/0222/Pg004.html], ''[[Irish Times]]''.</ref> and paid for an operation on the offending ankle himself.

[[Third Lanark]] were beaten 2\u20131. 1960 ended with Walker being awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to football.<ref name=\"walkerobit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12626976.Tommy_Walker_dies_at_77/|title=Tommy Walker dies at 77|website=HeraldScotland|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nThe 1960s saw Hearts fortunes fluctuate as Walker attempted to adapt to football's tactical changes by implementing a 4\u20132\u20134 formation. Young and Thomson departed for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in November 1960. At Everton Young was known as ''The Golden Vision'' and became another from the Walker production line of full Scotland internationalists. Smith had an injury hit season leading to his joining Dundee (who became the third club with whom he won the Scottish title). Hearts signed further future full internationalists in [[William Wallace (footballer)|Willie Wallace]] and [[David Holt (footballer, born 1936)|David Holt]]. Hearts lost the [[1961 Scottish League Cup Final]] after a replay. Cumming scored a deserved equalising penalty for Hearts in the first game 1\u20131 draw they largely dominated against the Scot Symon managed Rangers. [[Norrie Davidson]] scored a then equalising Hearts goal when they lost in the 3\u20131 replay defeat.<ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nBauld left Hearts in 1962 with 355 goals from 510 first team appearances.<ref name = hall/> Another future internationalist, [[Willie Hamilton (footballer)|Willie Hamilton]], joined for the run culminating in the [[1962 Scottish League Cup Final]] win. Hearts won the trophy for a fourth time with a 1\u20130 final win over [[Willie Waddell]]'s fine Kilmarnock side of that era. Davidson's goal this time proved decisive. Like in the 1954\u201355 win Hearts eliminated Celtic in that [[1962-63 Scottish League Cup]] group stage.<ref name = hist54-64/><ref name = hall/>\n\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] Hearts fought out a championship title race with Waddell's Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with Dundee United meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post. The 2\u20130 defeat meant Hearts lost the title by an average of 0.042 goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://footballpink.net/2013/09/22/killies-final-day-victory-breaks-hearts/|title=Killie's final day victory breaks Hearts|date=22 September 2013|website=Footballpink.net|accessdate=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030142924/https://footballpink.net/2013/09/22/killies-final-day-victory-breaks-hearts/|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/196504241.html|title=1965-04-24 Sat Hearts 0 Kilmarnock 2|website=Londonhearts.com|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-93_7Gz5FTQ|title=Hearts 0 Killie 2 (24/04/1965)|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=27 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Subsequently, Hearts were instrumental in pushing through a change to use goal difference to separate teams level on points.

Under his management Hearts had won 7 senior trophies and been runners up in five others. Cumming left the playing staff a year later and joined the coaching team.<ref name = hist64-74/><ref name = hall/>\n\n=== Latter 20th century ===\nThe highlight of the late 60s was the run to the 1968 Scottish Cup Final when they lost 3\u20131 to [[George Farm]]'s [[Dunfermline Athletic]]. The players of greatest note in the late sixties were [[Jim Cruickshank]], [[Alan Anderson (footballer)|Alan Anderson]] and [[Donald Ford]] with [[Drew Busby]] joining the three in the 1970s. The high point of the 1970s was another run to the Scottish Cup Final. In 1975\u201376 they again lost 3\u20131 in the final this time to Rangers. After the advent of the ten team Premier Division in 1975, Hearts were subsequently relegated for the first time in [[1976\u201377 in Scottish football|1977]]. This began a sequence of [[yo-yo club|yo-yoing]] between the Premier League and First Division six times in seven seasons.\n\nOn 25 May 1981, 34 year old [[Wallace Mercer]] became chairman after buying a controlling interest in Hearts for \u00a3265,000.<ref name =mercer>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12442782.Wallace_Mercer_Businessman_and_former_chairman_of_Hearts_FC/|title=Wallace Mercer Businessman and former chairman of Hearts FC|website=HeraldScotland|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref> Hearts had just been relegated from the top flight for the third time in five seasons. The following December (1981), Mercer promoted [[Alex MacDonald (footballer, born 1948)|Alex MacDonald]] to be Player-Manager. At the end of the 1982\u201383 season Hearts were promoted back to the top flight. This marked an upturn in their fortunes to rejoin the more competitive clubs in Scotland's top flight. The 1985\u201386 season was their best since 1965. The league campaign started with the loss of five of the first eight games. From there the club went on a 27-game unbeaten league run, reaching the top of the league on 21 December after a 1\u20130 win at St Mirren. Hearts needed a draw from the last game of the season away to [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on 3 May 1986 to win the Scottish league title. Before that final game they were two points ahead of Celtic and with a superior goal difference of four goals. However, this strong statistical position was undermined in the run up to the game when several players in the Hearts squad were hit by a viral infection. [[Craig Levein]] failed to recover to make the game in Dundee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hearts/5363880/What-a-heartbreaker-How-Hearts-lost-the-Scottish-title-to-Celtic-in-1986.html|title=How Hearts lost the Scottish title to Celtic in 1986|first=Roddy|last=Forsyth|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=27 July 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZFezYotlVk#t=380.218895|title=That was The Team That Was Part2|last=Subtitledvideos4|date=20 December 2010|accessdate=27 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nCeltic were 4\u20130 up away at St Mirren at half time in their final fixture. Thus, at half time the players knew that they would have to deliver a result at [[Dens Park]]. Substitute [[Albert Kidd]] forced Hearts to concede a corner kick with seven minutes remaining. The in-swinging corner was touched on and fell to Kidd who put Dundee ahead. This was the first goal Hearts had conceded from a corner all season. Hearts now needed an equaliser to win the title. However, Kidd went on a run with the ball from the halfway line down the right wing beating two Hearts players. After then playing a one-two with a teammate on the edge of the Hearts box he finished to score a second with four minutes left. Dundee won 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCjEsN4E85s|title=Dundee V Hearts 1986 Albert Kidd|last=DeeLicious|date=19 March 2007|accessdate=27 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> This combined with Celtic winning 5\u20130 against St Mirren meant the top two clubs finished the season on the same number of points. Hearts lost out to Celtic by a goal difference of three. Had goal difference been the rule in 1965 Hearts would have been champions; had goal average still applied in 1986, they would have won the league. Hearts lobbying after the league loss in 1965 cost them the title in 1986.\n\nHearts had been chasing a League and Scottish Cup double. After eliminating Rangers and [[Jim McLean]]'s Dundee United they faced [[Alex Ferguson]]'s Aberdeen in the final. Aberdeen won 3\u20130 meaning Hearts finished runners up as they had in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2015/may/01/albert-kidd-day-hearts-dundee-hibs-celtic-1986|title=How Albert Kidd became a Hibs and Celtic legend without playing for them|first=Steven|last=Pye|date=1 May 2015|website=the Guardian|accessdate=27 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nHearts finished league runners-up again in 1988 and 1992. The club reached the quarter-finals of the [[1988\u201389 UEFA Cup]] losing out to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2\u20131 on aggregate. After MacDonald's summer 1990 departure the club struggled to settle on a manager. Within a two-year period, [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]], [[Sandy Clark]] and [[Tommy McLean]] were all sacked. From April 1989 to April 1994 Hearts went on a run of 22 games in a row without defeat against arch-rivals [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the [[Edinburgh Derby]].\n\nIn 1994 Mercer sold his shares in Hearts to Chris Robinson and Leslie Deans. Under Mercer Hearts finished second in the Scottish top tier three times and once in the Scottish Cup. Mercer's time at the club though was without senior silverware. His personal influence at the club is perhaps best remembered with an attempted merger with Hibs in 1990. Seen by Hibs fans as an attempted take over to liquidate their club, Mercer's attempts were met with bitterness and acrimony before he backed away.<ref name =mercer/>\n\nIn [[1997\u201398 in Scottish football|1998]], Hearts beat Rangers 2\u20131 to lift the Scottish Cup under the management of ex Hearts player, [[Jim Jefferies (footballer)|Jim Jefferies]]. [[Colin Cameron (footballer)|Colin Cameron]] scored a first-minute penalty and [[Stephane Adam]] added after half time. This was Hearts' first senior trophy win since the 1962\u201363 League Cup won in the Tommy Walker era.\n\n=== Into the 21st century ===\nHearts finished third in 2003 and 2004, and reached the inaugural group stages of the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2004\u201305, but finished bottom of their group, despite [[Robbie Neilson]]'s goal giving a 2\u20131 victory over [[FC Basel]]. During the 2004\u201305 season, they finished fifth in the league.\n\nIn 2004, then club CEO Chris Robinson announced plans to sell Tynecastle, which he claimed was \"not fit for purpose\", and instead have Hearts rent [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] from the [[Scottish Rugby Union]].<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=1455932004 Tynecastle architect says \u00a3100,000 to fix stadium], ''[[The Scotsman]]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110132123/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=1455932004 |date=10 November 2005 }}</ref> This move was deemed necessary due to the club's increasingly large debt.

With no match day income coming in and a lack of finance from owner Romanov, the club were left in a position where they had to put their whole squad up for sale.\n\nOn 17 June 2013, Heart of Midlothian began the process of entering into [[administration (law)|administration]] with debts of \u00a325&nbsp;million, owing recently bankrupt [[Ukio bankas]] \u00a315&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hearts: SPL side to enter administration |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22944291 |accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 June 2013, a Scandinavian consortium offered to pay the club \u00a3500,000 immediately in return for a share of any future transfer income from up to 12 players; this was rejected by Hearts. The process of entering administration began on 19 June 2013 when the club's parent company, Ukio Bankas Investment Group (UBIG), filed papers at the Court of Session on Edinburgh for accountancy firm [[BDO International|BDO]] to be named as administrators.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22963110 Hearts rejected investment offer before administration application], BBC Sport, 18 June 2013</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22953448 Hearts placed into administration and deducted 15 points], BBC Sport, 19 June 2013</ref>\n\n===Administration===\nOn 17 June 2013 Hearts announced that they had lodged court papers stating their intention to enter administration, and on 19 June 2013 the administrators BDO were appointed to run the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/bdo-appointed-to-run-hearts-in-administration.1371649500|title=BDO appointed to run Hearts in administration|work=Herald Scotland}}</ref> This meant that the club was unable to register players over 21 until February 2014 at the earliest.

During this period the BDO administrator Trevor Birch pleaded with Hearts fans to purchase season tickets and stated that they needed to sell at least another 3000 season tickets to raise another \u00a3800,000 to keep the club running and avoiding liquidation.
