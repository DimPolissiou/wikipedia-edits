This assumes the content manager has applied an organized [[Conceptualization (information science)|conceptualization]] to the underlying content (A poor conceptualization can make single-source publishing less useful).<ref name=petra/> Single-source publishing is sometimes used synonymously with '''multi-channel publishing''' though whether or not the two terms are synonymous is a matter of discussion.<ref name=mek>[http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards Single-Source & Multi-Channel Publishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406072258/http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards |date=2010-04-06 }}. \u00a9 2013 Mekon, accessed 23 June 2013.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nWhile there is a general definition of single-source publishing, there is no single official delineation between single-source publishing and multi-channel publishing, nor are there any official governing bodies to provide such a delineation. Single-source publishing is most often understood as the creation of one source document in an authoring tool and converting that document into different [[file format]]s or human [[language]]s (or both) multiple times with minimal effort. Multi-channel publishing can either be seen as synonymous with single-source publishing, or similar in that there is one source document but the process itself results in more than a mere reproduction of that source.<ref name=mek/>\n\n==History==\nThe origins of single-source publishing lie, indirectly, with the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990.<ref name=bob162>Bob Boiko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6nUDn3ZaBoC&pg=PA162&dq=Single+source+publishing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Single%20source%20publishing&f=false Content Management Bible], pg. 162. [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]: [[John Wiley & Sons]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780764583643}}</ref> With the eclipsing of [[MS-DOS]] by [[graphical user interface]]s, help files went from being unreadable text along the bottom of the screen to hypertext systems such as [[WinHelp]]. On-screen help interfaces allowed software companies to cease the printing of large, expensive help manuals with their products, reducing costs for both producer and consumer. This system raised opportunities as well, and many developers fundamentally changed the way they thought about publishing. Writers of [[software documentation]] did not simply move from being writers of traditional bound books to writers of [[electronic publishing]], but rather they became authors of central documents which could be reused multiple times across multiple formats.<ref name=bob162/>\n\nThe first single-source publishing project was started in 1993 by Cornelia Hofmann at [[Schneider Electric]] in [[Seligenstadt]], using software based on [[Interleaf]] to automatically create paper documentation in multiple languages based on a single original source file.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=inCeft4AkXcC&pg=PA65&dq=single+source+publishing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=single%20source%20publishing&f=false Translating Into Success: Cutting-edge Strategies for Going Multilingual in a Global Age], pg. 227.

The concept behind this usage was that complex, hierarchical content that did not lend itself to discrete componentization could be used across a variety of requirements by tagging the differences within a single document using the capabilities built into SGML and XML.\nFord, for example, was able to tag its single owner's manual files so that 12 model years could be generated via a resolution script running on the single completed file.

This assumes the content manager has applied an organized [[Conceptualization (information science)|conceptualization]] to the underlying content (A poor conceptualization can make single-source publishing less useful).<ref name=petra/> Single-source publishing is sometimes used synonymously with '''multi-channel publishing''' though whether or not the two terms are synonymous is a matter of discussion.<ref name=mek>[http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards Single-Source & Multi-Channel Publishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406072258/http://www.mekon.com/index.php/pages/knowledge_zone/single-sourcing-multi-channel-publishing/technology_standards |date=2010-04-06 }}. \u00a9 2013 Mekon, accessed 23 June 2013.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nWhile there is a general definition of single-source publishing, there is no single official delineation between single-source publishing and multi-channel publishing, nor are there any official governing bodies to provide such a delineation. Single-source publishing is most often understood as the creation of one source document in an authoring tool and converting that document into different [[file format]]s or human [[language]]s (or both) multiple times with minimal effort. Multi-channel publishing can either be seen as synonymous with single-source publishing, or similar in that there is one source document but the process itself results in more than a mere reproduction of that source.<ref name=mek/>\n\n==History==\nThe origins of single-source publishing lie, indirectly, with the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990.<ref name=bob162>Bob Boiko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6nUDn3ZaBoC&pg=PA162&dq=Single+source+publishing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CUiqU6LEDaLV0QXd44CQDw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Single%20source%20publishing&f=false Content Management Bible], pg. 162.

On-screen help interfaces allowed software companies to cease the printing of large, expensive help manuals with their products, reducing costs for both producer and consumer. This system raised opportunities as well, and many developers fundamentally changed the way they thought about publishing. Writers of [[software documentation]] did not simply move from being writers of traditional bound books to writers of [[electronic publishing]], but rather they became authors of central documents which could be reused multiple times across multiple formats.<ref name=bob162/>\n\nThe first single-source publishing project was started in 1993 by Cornelia Hofmann at [[Schneider Electric]] in [[Seligenstadt]], using software based on [[Interleaf]] to automatically create paper documentation in multiple languages based on a single original source file.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=inCeft4AkXcC&pg=PA65&dq=single+source+publishing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rRehU_TxFs2W0QXT6YCQAQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=single%20source%20publishing&f=false Translating Into Success: Cutting-edge Strategies for Going Multilingual in a Global Age], pg. 227.

She is now distraught over her husband's neglect of her family. Often involved in some adventure, he rarely visits them. She sends their son [[Hyllus]] to find him, as she is concerned over prophecies about Heracles and the land he is currently in. After Hyllus sets off, a messenger arrives with word that Heracles, victorious in his recent battle, is making offerings on Cape [[Cenaeum]] and coming home soon to [[Trachis]].\n\n[[Lichas]], a herald of Heracles, brings in a procession of captives. He tells Deianeira a false story of why Heracles had laid siege to the city of Oechalia (in [[Euboea]]). He claimed [[King Eurytus of Oechalia|Eurytus]], the city's king, was responsible for Heracles being enslaved, and therefore Heracles vowed revenge against him and his people. Among the captured girls is [[Iole]], daughter of Eurytus. Deianeira soon learns that in truth Heracles laid siege to the city just to obtain Iole, whom he has taken as a lover.\n\nUnable to cope with the thought of her husband falling for this younger woman, she decides to use a love charm on him, a magic potion that will win him back.  When she was younger, she had been carried across a river by the [[centaur]], [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]. Halfway through he made a grab at her, but Heracles came to her rescue and quickly shot him with an arrow.

Scholars such as T.F. Hoey believe the play was written relatively early in Sophocles' career, around 450 BC.<ref name=hoey>{{cite journal|title=The Date of the ''Trachiniae''|author=Hoey, T.F.|pages=220, 232|journal=Phoenix|volume=33|issue=3|year=1979|jstor= 1087433|doi=10.2307/1087433}}</ref>  Often cited as evidence for an early date is the fact that the dramatic form of ''Women of Trachis'' is not as developed as those of Sophocles' other surviving works, advancing the belief that the play comes from a younger and less skilled Sophocles.<ref name=hoey/> Additionally, the plot of the play is similar to a story related by [[Bacchylides]] in Bacchylides XVI, but in some respects significantly different from earlier known versions of Bacchylides' story.<ref name=hoey/> From this, Hoey and others have argued that Sophocles' interpretation was more likely to have influenced Bacchylides than vice versa.<ref name=hoey/> Serving as further evidence is the relationship between the character of Deianeira and that of [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'', first produced in 458.<ref name=hoey/> In earlier known versions of this story, Deianeira has several masculine qualities, similar to those of Clytemnestra \u2013 who, in the ''Oresteia'', purposely kills her husband [[Agamemnon]]. In ''Women of Trachis'', however, Deianeira's character is softer and more feminine, and she is only inadvertently responsible for her husband's death.<ref name=hoey/> According to some scholars, Deianeira's character in ''Women of Trachis'' is intended as a commentary on Aeschylus' treatment of Clytemnestra; if so, ''Women of Trachis'' was probably produced reasonably soon after the ''Oresteia'', although it is also possible that such commentary was triggered by a later revival of Aeschylus' trilogy.<ref name=hoey/> Hoey also sees echoes of Aeschylus' ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', particularly in the relevance of ''Women of Trachis'' to debates that were occurring during the 450s on the \"relationship between knowledge and responsibility.\"<ref name=hoey/>\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Cedric H.

She is now distraught over her husband's neglect of her family. Often involved in some adventure, he rarely visits them. She sends their son [[Hyllus]] to find him, as she is concerned over prophecies about Heracles and the land he is currently in. After Hyllus sets off, a messenger arrives with word that Heracles, victorious in his recent battle, is making offerings on Cape [[Cenaeum]] and coming home soon to [[Trachis]].\n\n[[Lichas]], a herald of Heracles, brings in a procession of captives. He tells Deianeira a false story of why Heracles had laid siege to the city of Oechalia (in [[Euboea]]). He claimed [[King Eurytus of Oechalia|Eurytus]], the city's king, was responsible for Heracles being enslaved, and therefore Heracles vowed revenge against him and his people. Among the captured girls is [[Iole]], daughter of Eurytus. Deianeira soon learns that in truth Heracles laid siege to the city just to obtain Iole, whom he has taken as a lover.\n\nUnable to cope with the thought of her husband falling for this younger woman, she decides to use a love charm on him, a magic potion that will win him back.  When she was younger, she had been carried across a river by the [[centaur]], [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]. Halfway through he made a grab at her, but Heracles came to her rescue and quickly shot him with an arrow. As he died, he told her his blood, now mixed with the poison of the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in which Heracles' arrow had been dipped, would keep Heracles from loving any other woman more than her, if she follows his instructions. Deianeira dyes a robe with the blood and has Lichas carry it to Heracles with strict instructions that (a) no one else is to wear it, and (b) it is to be kept in the dark until he puts it on.\n\nAfter the gift is sent, she begins to have a bad feeling about it. She throws some of the left-over material into sunlight and it reacts like boiling acid. Nessus had lied about the love charm. Hyllus soon arrives to inform her that Heracles lies dying due to her gift. He was in such pain and fury that he killed Lichas, the deliverer of the gift: \"he made the white brain to ooze from the hair, as the skull was dashed to splinters, and blood scattered therewith\" (as translated by [[Sir Richard C. Jebb]]).\n\nDeianeira feels enormous shame for what she has done, amplified by her son's harsh words, and kills herself.  Hyllus discovers soon after that it wasn't actually her intention to kill her husband. The dying Heracles is carried to his home in horrible pain and furious over what he believes was a murder attempt by his wife. Hyllus explains the truth, and Heracles realizes that the prophecies about his death have come to pass: He was to be killed by someone who was already dead, and it turned out to be Nessus.\n\nIn the end, he is in so much pain that he is begging for someone to finish him off. In this weakened state, he says he is like a woman. He makes a final wish, which Hyllus promises to obey (under protest), that Hyllus is to marry Iole.

The line has [[#Project Evergreen 3|undergone a major upgrade]] which has seen much of the line cleared for 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) running, resulting in significant reductions in journey times from 2013. The line is not [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]], although electrification is an aspiration.<ref name=\"shooter\"/>\n\nThe line forms part of the [[Urban rail in the United Kingdom|suburban rail networks]] in both cities. The majority of towns towards the London end of the route are prosperous suburbs or commuter-belt towns, such as [[Ruislip]], [[Gerrards Cross]] and [[Beaconsfield]]. These have a journey time of 30 minutes or less to [[Marylebone station|London Marylebone]]. In the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] it is one of the [[Snow Hill Lines]].

Being circuitous, it could not compete with the [[London and North Western Railway]]'s London-Rugby-Birmingham route on journey times.\n\nThe only open segments of the Chiltern Main Line were the Aynho\u2013Banbury\u2013Leamington\u2013Birmingham route and the single-track Wycombe Railway between Princes Risborough and High Wycombe; the latter continued south via [[Bourne End railway station|Bourne End]] to [[Maidenhead railway station|Maidenhead]] on the Great Western Main Line.\n\n===GW/GC Joint Line===\nIn an attempt to compete with the LNWR's London\u2013Birmingham route and speed up goods traffic between London and the west-coast port at [[Birkenhead]], the GWR took advantage of its partnership with the [[Great Central Railway]] (GCR) to build a new, direct [[Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway]] (the companies were already working together on a link between [[Woodford Halse railway station|Woodford Halse station]] and Banbury). This enabled the GCR to run faster services than had been possible on the [[Metropolitan Railway]] route through Aylesbury and Amersham, which was congested with stopping trains.\n\nThe Joint line started at Northolt Junction in [[Middlesex]], from which two lines ran southward:\n\n*the direct \"New North Main Line\" (present-day [[Acton\u2013Northolt line]]) towards London Paddington via [[Greenford]] and [[Old Oak Common]], built by the GWR. This included a triangular junction at Greenford, providing access to the Great Western Main Line via [[Castle Bar Park railway station|Castle Bar Park]];\n*a line via [[South Harrow]] and [[Wembley]] to the GCR at [[Neasden Junction]], near [[Neasden tube station|Neasden station]] on what is now the Jubilee line, used by almost all Chiltern trains. It was authorised by a GCR Act of 12 August 1898,<ref>{{cite book|last=Dow |first=George|authorlink=George Dow|title=Great Central, Volume Two: Dominion of Watkin, 1864-1899|year=1962|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|location=Shepperton|isbn=0-7110-1469-8|pages=302, 306|ref=harv}}</ref> being opened on 2 April 1906.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dow|first=George|authorlink=George Dow|title=Great Central, Volume Three: Fay Sets the Pace, 1900-1922|year=1965|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|location=Shepperton|isbn=0-7110-0263-0|page=107|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marylebone Station geograph-2358841-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Robinson A5 steam locomotives operated GCR (later LNER) local services to High Wycombe, Princes Risborough and Aylesbury]]\nThe Joint line ran northwest via [[Gerrards Cross]] to High Wycombe, where it met the [[Wycombe Railway]]'s single-track branch from [[Maidenhead]] to Aylesbury via Princes Risborough. North of High Wycombe this line was followed, with significant upgrading of the formation, including dualling and a new alignment for the up line north of [[Saunderton]]. The original route, now the down line, has a gradient of 1 in 88, which was too steep for the heavy [[coal]] trains run by the GCR. As a result, the two tracks are horizontally and vertically separated, with the down line crossing the [[Chiltern Hills]] at the Risborough gap and the up line passing through an {{convert|88|yd|m|adj=on}} tunnel on a flatter gradient.\n\nOn reaching Princes Risborough, new construction started. The station was already a major junction, with the single-track line dividing into three branches: to Chinnor and [[Watlington, Oxfordshire|Watlington]] (which survives in part as the [[Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway]]); to Thame, [[Wheatley, Oxfordshire|Wheatley]] and Oxford; and to Aylesbury. The joint line was constructed in the '[[V]]' formed by the two latter branches, and ran north west to [[Ashendon Junction|Ashendon]] (not yet a junction), where the line curved north to join the GCR's pre-1906 main line at [[Grendon Underwood|Grendon Underwood Junction]] in Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe Joint Line was completed in 1906 (with portions opening earlier) by the GWR and immediately benefited both parties. The GCR, unable to secure adequate access to its route via Aylesbury, Amersham and [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], gained a new and fast bypass route for its express passenger and freight trains between London and the East Midlands, while the GWR gained a faster route for its Birmingham trains, from Paddington via [[Gerrards Cross]] and Princes Risborough and then temporarily (1906\u20131910) on to the [[Wycombe Railway]] via Thame to regain their original route at Oxford, pending the opening of the Bicester cut-off to Banbury (see next subsection). GCR expresses non-stop between London and Rugby could now use either the Metropolitan route or the Joint Line, while the Joint Line was used by GWR expresses from Paddington to Birmingham and Wolverhampton and on to Shrewsbury and Mid/North Wales, Chester and Birkenhead.\n\n===The Bicester cut-off===\nFour years later, in 1910, the GWR completed a line from what became [[Ashendon Junction]] (a [[flying junction]]) north west via Bicester to meet the line from Oxford at [[Aynho Junction]]. This meant that the Joint Line from Ashendon Junction to Grendon Underwood became GCR-only, and was sold to the GCR. The cut-off gave the GWR a faster route between London and Birmingham, avoiding Oxford; the final saving in distance was about {{convert|20|mi}}.\n\n===Heyday, decline and rationalisation===\n[[File:Seer Green geograph-2456422-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Ex-''GWR [[GWR 6000 Class|King Class]] locomotive 6008 ''King James II'' hauling a Paddington to {{rws|Birkenhead Woodside}} express in 1950]]\n[[File:Seer Green station geograph-2400005-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{brc|52}} hauling an express from Paddington to Birkenhead Woodside near {{rws|Seer Green}} in 1962]]\nDuring the heyday of the route, many prestigious trains ran from Paddington to the northwest of England via the Joint Line, reaching Wolverhampton, {{rws|Shrewsbury}}, {{rws|Wrexham General}}, {{rws|Chester}} and {{rws|Birkenhead Woodside}}. Various through services from Marylebone to the GCR network also ran via the Joint Line between London and Ashendon Junction.\n\nAt [[Transport Act 1947|nationalisation in 1948]], the line passed to the [[Western Region of British Railways]], which continued to operate Paddington \u2013 Birmingham \u2013 Wolverhampton - Birkenhead fast trains through the 1950s in competition with the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region's]] (LMR) from {{rws|Euston}} via the [[West Coast Main Line]] (WCML).\n\nThe Paddington \u2013 Birmingham \u2013 Wolverhampton - Birkenhead fast service was sharply increased in frequency to up to 15 trains a day each way from the 1959\u201360 timetable to compensate for the withdrawal of most LMR trains during electrification of the WCML.<ref>{{cite news |title=The winter timetables of British Railways: Western Region|work=[[Trains Illustrated]]|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|location=Hampton Court|date=December 1959|page=584}}</ref> For the same reason, the Chiltern line was used by many trains between Paddington and Birkenhead from 1965.\n\nAll local trains were diverted to Marylebone in 1963 and operated by four-car [[British Rail Class 115|Class 115]] DMUs, and the main-line platforms at Greenford on the New North route between Old Oak Common and Northolt Junction were closed.\n\nAfter the GCR main line was closed between {{rws|Calvert}} and {{rws|Rugby Central}} in September 1966, some trains from the South Coast were diverted north of Banbury via the route.  These became the forerunners of today's [[CrossCountry]] services between Birmingham and {{rws|Bournemouth}}.\n[[File:Crowcombe Heathfield railway station MMB 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Class 115 DMUs operated Marylebone - Banbury local services between 1960 and 1992]]\nOn 6 March 1967,<ref name=rcw>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=Rail Centres: Wolverhampton|publisher=Ian Allan|location=[[London]]|year=1990|isbn=978-0-7110-1892-1}}</ref> after completion of the WCML electrification, express trains from Paddington to Birmingham/Wolverhampton/Birkenhead were discontinued under ''[[Beeching Axe|The Reshaping of British Railways]]''.  The route was downgraded to secondary status and subsequently single-tracked between Princes Risborough and Aynho Junction, which remained a [[flying junction]], with a crossing loop at Bicester not normally used. Through lines were removed from most of those stations which had them, such as Denham in 1965, Beaconsfield in 1973 and Gerrards Cross in 1989 and the relief lines were lifted between Lapworth and Tyseley. The tunnel between Birmingham Moor Street and Snow Hill closed on 2 March 1968.<ref name=rcw/> Local services from Leamington and Stratford terminated at Moor Street, and the remaining services from Paddington and the South Coast were diverted into New Street. Snow Hill closed completely, along with most of the line to Wolverhampton, on 4 March 1972.<ref name=rcw/>\n\nAlthough a two-hourly locomotive-hauled semi-fast service from Paddington to Birmingham continued via High Wycombe, Princes Risborough, Bicester, Banbury, Leamington and Solihull, in the early 1970s all but one daily peak-hour return journey were diverted via {{rws|Reading}} and Oxford, and later via {{rws|Coventry}}, and in the 1980s that was truncated to run to Banbury only. All other passenger services were operated by DMUs to and from Marylebone, extended from High Wycombe to Banbury (for connections to Birmingham), on a two-hourly frequency.\n\nOn 24 March 1974 the line from Marylebone to Banbury transferred from the Western Region to the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]] and all stations between South Ruislip and Bicester were also transferred to LMR giving LMR the responsibility of all passenger services out of Marylebone. \n\nIn 1977 the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification of more of the rail network]], and by 1979 BR presented a range of options to electrify numerous routes by 2000.<ref name=\"BR-CPU\">{{cite book|author=Anonymous|title=Railway Electrification|date=Winter 1979|publisher=[[British Railways Board]] (Central Publicity Unit)|pages=0\u20132, 8}}</ref> Some of these options included the Banbury \u2014 Birmingham section of the line, plus the [[Cherwell Valley Line]] and the [[Coventry to Leamington line]].<ref name=\"BR-CPU\"/> Under the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|1979\u201390 Conservative governments]] that succeeded the [[Callaghan ministry|1976\u201379 Labour government]] the proposals were not implemented.\n\nThe route was considered for partial closure in the 1980s. All services would have run to Paddington via the New North route, and Marylebone station and all lines leading to it would have been closed. Services to and from Aylesbury would have run via Princes Risborough. However, Marylebone was formally reprieved in 1986 and the closure proposals rescinded.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1992 [[British Rail]] carried out a [[total route modernisation]] which included resignalling from Marylebone to Aynho Junction, and both Marylebone to Aylesbury routes, from the new Marylebone [[Integrated Electronic Control Centre|Integrated Control Centre]]. This was combined with track rationalisation that removed most of the vestigial traces of main-line heritage from the line, downgrading it to a purely commuter line with a minimal infrastructure.  Until then, much of the four-track section between Northolt Junction and West Ruislip had survived, and High Wycombe station had retained almost all of its original track layout, though the other major stations on the line had already been downgraded with their through lines removed. At the same time, the New North route between Old Oak Common and Northolt Junction was singled between Old Oak Common and [[Park Royal]] and between Greenford and Northolt Junction. In 1992, the [[signal box]] at Aynho Junction was closed and replaced with modern signalling controlled from Banbury South signal box; the box was demolished in 2002. As part of these renovations, BR installed the advanced [[Automatic Train Protection]] (ATP) system, mainly as a trial with a view to rolling it out nationwide.  However, privatisation intervened, and the Great Western Main Line was the only other line to be so equipped.\n\n===Rejuvenation===\n[[File:Paddington Station. - geograph.org.uk - 123729.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{brc|165}} DMUs were introduced to the Chiltern Main Line by Network SouthEast]]\nWith Sectorisation of British Rail in the mid-1980s, operations south of Banbury fell under the control of [[Network SouthEast]] in 1986, under the Thames & Chiltern sub-sector, later split into two constituent parts. In 1987 a new station was opened at [[Haddenham & Thame Parkway railway station|Haddenham & Thame Parkway]]. Birmingham Snow Hill reopened in 1987 on a much smaller scale than the original, beneath a [[multi-storey car park]], with its tunnel reinstated and new platforms on the through lines at Moor Street, where the terminus was taken out of use, with Leamington/Stratford services diverted to Snow Hill.\n\nThe opening of the extension of the parallel [[M40 motorway]] from Oxford to Birmingham in 1991 spawned development in towns along the northern section of the route, notably [[Bicester]], Banbury, Leamington Spa and Warwick. This generated additional patronage for train services in the corridor.\n\nClass 165 Turbo trains were introduced in 1991, initially between Marylebone and Banbury. These improved passenger comfort and enabled journey times to be reduced; frequencies were increased, with an hourly stopping service to/from High Wycombe and hourly semi-fast service to/from Banbury. In 1993, Marylebone-Banbury services were extended to Snow Hill, calling at Leamington Spa, Warwick, Solihull and Moor Street, initially on a two-hourly frequency, increased to hourly the following year, when a Dorridge call was added. In 1995 the [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|Jewellery Line]] was re-opened to allow Worcester line services to be diverted from New Street to Snow Hill; this allowed some of Chiltern's weekday peak-period services to be extended beyond Snow Hill, first to Stourbridge Junction and then to Kidderminster.\n\n===Chiltern Railways era===\nUpon rail privatisation in 1996, the [[Chiltern Railways]] franchise was won by [[Chiltern Railways#History|M40 Trains]], a consortium of a management buyout, Laing Rail (a subsidiary of construction company and [[Private finance initiative|PFI]] specialist [[John Laing plc]]), and venture capitalist [[3i]], and in 1998 the line between Princes Risborough and Bicester North was redoubled by the company. This included the total reconstruction of [[Haddenham and Thame Parkway railway station|Haddenham and Thame Parkway]] at platform level, with two side platforms instead of the single platform constructed in 1987, and a new down platform at Princes Risborough, together with the raising of the speed limit. Also in 1998 the first Class 168 Clubman trains with a {{convert|100|mph|kph|adj=on}} maximum speed were introduced to reduce journey times.\n[[File:168107 A London Marylebone.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Chiltern Railways ordered 19 {{brc|168}} DMUs for its Marylebone - Birmingham services]]\nIn 2000 Chiltern Railways opened a new station at [[Warwick Parkway railway station|Warwick Parkway]], to the west of the town next to the [[A46 road|A46]] and close to [[M40 motorway|M40]] Junction 15. This was intended to be a railhead for nearby towns without a station such as [[Kenilworth]], and for towns south of Birmingham close to the [[M42 motorway|M42]] with no direct rail link to London, such as [[Redditch]] and [[Bromsgrove]]. Construction was funded by Chiltern Railways with some support from [[Warwickshire County Council]]. At first only Chiltern services called there but it is now also served by London Midland.\n\nIn 2002, after Chiltern won its 20-year [[exclusive right|franchise]], the line between Bicester North and Aynho Junction was also redoubled. Chiltern took over Hatton to Stratford-upon-Avon services from [[Thames Trains]] and [[Central Trains]], with direct services between Marylebone (rather than Paddington) and Stratford. Also at this time Chiltern took over the operation of [[Leamington Spa railway station|Leamington Spa]], [[Warwick railway station|Warwick]], [[Hatton railway station (Warwickshire)|Hatton]] and [[Lapworth railway station|Lapworth]] stations from Central Trains, as the latter's services (now operated by London Midland) no longer operated beyond Dorridge except during weekday peak periods.\n\nJohn Laing plc acquired 84% ownership of M40 Trains in 1999, buying out 3i, and was itself bought out by [[Henderson Group|Henderson Investments]] in 2006, resulting in the sale of Laing Rail to the German national railway operator [[Deutsche Bahn]] in 2007.\n\nThe [[Cherwell Valley]] line between Banbury and Leamington Spa was resignalled during 2004, with the closure of [[Fenny Compton]] signal box and the removal of its remaining semaphore signals. The new signalling and the existing signalling in the Leamington Spa station area is controlled from the box at Leamington via a new Westcad workstation.  More recently the Leamington to Birmingham section has been resignalled and is controlled from the new [[West Midlands ICC]] at [[Saltley]] (taking over the old signalling centre at Saltley) with new 4-aspect LED signals throughout.  However, the manual signal boxes at Banbury North and South remained, along with some GWR lower-quadrant signals controlling the bay platforms and sidings at the station.  In 2016 the station was re-modelled and re-signalled, being incorporated into the West Midlands  ICC take over control as Oxford (exclusive) in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.networkrail.co.uk/feeds/orange-army-upgrades-railway-and-keeps-customers-moving-in-2016/|title=Orange army upgrades railway and keeps customers moving in 2016|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nMost of the route from Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton is now used by the [[Midland Metro]] light-rail system, which diverges from Network Rail's Jewellery Line at The Hawthorns.\n\nThe route between Marylebone and Leamington/Bordesley was used by [[open access operator]] [[Wrexham & Shropshire]]'s services from London to Wrexham via Tame Bridge, Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury, which comprised three [[British Rail Mark 3|Mk3 coaches]] hauled by [[British Rail Class 67|Class 67]] diesel locomotives. Since these were neither Sprinters nor HSTs, they were restricted to lower line speeds, e.g. {{convert|60|mph|kph}} between Princes Risborough and Bicester, and {{convert|70|mph|kph}} between Leamington and Bordesley, although they were permitted to travel at {{convert|85|mph|kph}} between Bicester and Aynho.  Wrexham & Shropshire had negotiated with Network Rail to allow its trains to travel at higher speeds on these sections, which required it to show that they had sufficient brake force to stop from such speeds within the signal spacings.\n\nOnly the little-used line from Northolt Junction to Paddington has not been improved.\n\nIn September 2006, Chiltern completed its \"Evergreen 2\" upgrade project, carried out by [[Carillion]], which realigned the track through [[Beaconsfield railway station (Buckinghamshire)|Beaconsfield]] to increase non-stop speeds from {{convert|40|to|75|mph|kph}}, installed additional [[Railway signal|signals]] between High Wycombe and Bicester North and between Princes Risborough and Aylesbury, and added two platforms (Nos 5 and 6) at Marylebone, on the site of the daytime carriage sidings, replaced by the new Wembley Light Maintenance Depot, just south and west of [[Wembley Stadium station]]. The new platforms and partial resignalling of the station throat make it possible to run 20 trains per hour in and out of the station.\n\nAt weekends during 2008, when major engineering works were taking place on the WCML, the line was used by Virgin Trains' {{Stnlnk|London Euston}} - {{Stnlnk|Birmingham International}} \"Blockade Buster\" service via Willesden, Acton Main Line, Ealing Broadway, Greenford, High Wycombe, Banbury and Coventry, using pairs of five-car class 221 sets.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Tunnels and viaducts ===\n[[File:Give Peas a chance!

The infrastructure upgrade was carried out by main contractor [[BAM Nuttall]], in partnership with [[Jarvis plc|Jarvis]] and [[WS Atkins]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ '''Fastest Peak Time from London''' (mins)\n|-\n!\n!

Commuter trains operated by [[West Midlands Trains]] run between [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]], {{rws|Solihull}} and {{rws|Leamington Spa}}, also to [[Stratford-upon-Avon railway station|Stratford-upon-Avon]].\n\n==Map==\n[[File:Chiltern Main Line map.svg|700px|center|Map of the Chiltern Main Line]]\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Early history===\nThe original [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) line from {{Stnlnk|London Paddington}} to Birmingham was completed in 1852; in 1854 it was extended to [[Wolverhampton Low Level railway station|Wolverhampton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=MacDermot|first=E.T.|year=1927|title=History of the Great Western Railway, volume I 1833-1863|location=London|publisher=Great Western Railway; Reprinted 1982, Ian Allan|isbn=0-7110-0411-0 |pages=327, 336}}</ref> It ran via the [[Great Western Main Line]] to {{stnlink|Didcot}} and then via {{Stnlnk|Oxford}} and {{stnlink|Leamington Spa}}. Being circuitous, it could not compete with the [[London and North Western Railway]]'s London-Rugby-Birmingham route on journey times.\n\nThe only open segments of the Chiltern Main Line were the Aynho\u2013Banbury\u2013Leamington\u2013Birmingham route and the single-track Wycombe Railway between Princes Risborough and High Wycombe; the latter continued south via [[Bourne End railway station|Bourne End]] to [[Maidenhead railway station|Maidenhead]] on the Great Western Main Line.\n\n===GW/GC Joint Line===\nIn an attempt to compete with the LNWR's London\u2013Birmingham route and speed up goods traffic between London and the west-coast port at [[Birkenhead]], the GWR took advantage of its partnership with the [[Great Central Railway]] (GCR) to build a new, direct [[Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway]] (the companies were already working together on a link between [[Woodford Halse railway station|Woodford Halse station]] and Banbury). This enabled the GCR to run faster services than had been possible on the [[Metropolitan Railway]] route through Aylesbury and Amersham, which was congested with stopping trains.\n\nThe Joint line started at Northolt Junction in [[Middlesex]], from which two lines ran southward:\n\n*the direct \"New North Main Line\" (present-day [[Acton\u2013Northolt line]]) towards London Paddington via [[Greenford]] and [[Old Oak Common]], built by the GWR. This included a triangular junction at Greenford, providing access to the Great Western Main Line via [[Castle Bar Park railway station|Castle Bar Park]];\n*a line via [[South Harrow]] and [[Wembley]] to the GCR at [[Neasden Junction]], near [[Neasden tube station|Neasden station]] on what is now the Jubilee line, used by almost all Chiltern trains. It was authorised by a GCR Act of 12 August 1898,<ref>{{cite book|last=Dow |first=George|authorlink=George Dow|title=Great Central, Volume Two: Dominion of Watkin, 1864-1899|year=1962|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|location=Shepperton|isbn=0-7110-1469-8|pages=302, 306|ref=harv}}</ref> being opened on 2 April 1906.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dow|first=George|authorlink=George Dow|title=Great Central, Volume Three: Fay Sets the Pace, 1900-1922|year=1965|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|location=Shepperton|isbn=0-7110-0263-0|page=107|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marylebone Station geograph-2358841-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Robinson A5 steam locomotives operated GCR (later LNER) local services to High Wycombe, Princes Risborough and Aylesbury]]\nThe Joint line ran northwest via [[Gerrards Cross]] to High Wycombe, where it met the [[Wycombe Railway]]'s single-track branch from [[Maidenhead]] to Aylesbury via Princes Risborough. North of High Wycombe this line was followed, with significant upgrading of the formation, including dualling and a new alignment for the up line north of [[Saunderton]]. The original route, now the down line, has a gradient of 1 in 88, which was too steep for the heavy [[coal]] trains run by the GCR. As a result, the two tracks are horizontally and vertically separated, with the down line crossing the [[Chiltern Hills]] at the Risborough gap and the up line passing through an {{convert|88|yd|m|adj=on}} tunnel on a flatter gradient.\n\nOn reaching Princes Risborough, new construction started. The station was already a major junction, with the single-track line dividing into three branches: to Chinnor and [[Watlington, Oxfordshire|Watlington]] (which survives in part as the [[Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway]]); to Thame, [[Wheatley, Oxfordshire|Wheatley]] and Oxford; and to Aylesbury. The joint line was constructed in the '[[V]]' formed by the two latter branches, and ran north west to [[Ashendon Junction|Ashendon]] (not yet a junction), where the line curved north to join the GCR's pre-1906 main line at [[Grendon Underwood|Grendon Underwood Junction]] in Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe Joint Line was completed in 1906 (with portions opening earlier) by the GWR and immediately benefited both parties. The GCR, unable to secure adequate access to its route via Aylesbury, Amersham and [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], gained a new and fast bypass route for its express passenger and freight trains between London and the East Midlands, while the GWR gained a faster route for its Birmingham trains, from Paddington via [[Gerrards Cross]] and Princes Risborough and then temporarily (1906\u20131910) on to the [[Wycombe Railway]] via Thame to regain their original route at Oxford, pending the opening of the Bicester cut-off to Banbury (see next subsection). GCR expresses non-stop between London and Rugby could now use either the Metropolitan route or the Joint Line, while the Joint Line was used by GWR expresses from Paddington to Birmingham and Wolverhampton and on to Shrewsbury and Mid/North Wales, Chester and Birkenhead.\n\n===The Bicester cut-off===\nFour years later, in 1910, the GWR completed a line from what became [[Ashendon Junction]] (a [[flying junction]]) north west via Bicester to meet the line from Oxford at [[Aynho Junction]]. This meant that the Joint Line from Ashendon Junction to Grendon Underwood became GCR-only, and was sold to the GCR. The cut-off gave the GWR a faster route between London and Birmingham, avoiding Oxford; the final saving in distance was about {{convert|20|mi}}.\n\n===Heyday, decline and rationalisation===\n[[File:Seer Green geograph-2456422-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Ex-''GWR [[GWR 6000 Class|King Class]] locomotive 6008 ''King James II'' hauling a Paddington to {{rws|Birkenhead Woodside}} express in 1950]]\n[[File:Seer Green station geograph-2400005-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{brc|52}} hauling an express from Paddington to Birkenhead Woodside near {{rws|Seer Green}} in 1962]]\nDuring the heyday of the route, many prestigious trains ran from Paddington to the northwest of England via the Joint Line, reaching Wolverhampton, {{rws|Shrewsbury}}, {{rws|Wrexham General}}, {{rws|Chester}} and {{rws|Birkenhead Woodside}}. Various through services from Marylebone to the GCR network also ran via the Joint Line between London and Ashendon Junction.\n\nAt [[Transport Act 1947|nationalisation in 1948]], the line passed to the [[Western Region of British Railways]], which continued to operate Paddington \u2013 Birmingham \u2013 Wolverhampton - Birkenhead fast trains through the 1950s in competition with the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region's]] (LMR) from {{rws|Euston}} via the [[West Coast Main Line]] (WCML).\n\nThe Paddington \u2013 Birmingham \u2013 Wolverhampton - Birkenhead fast service was sharply increased in frequency to up to 15 trains a day each way from the 1959\u201360 timetable to compensate for the withdrawal of most LMR trains during electrification of the WCML.<ref>{{cite news |title=The winter timetables of British Railways: Western Region|work=[[Trains Illustrated]]|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|location=Hampton Court|date=December 1959|page=584}}</ref> For the same reason, the Chiltern line was used by many trains between Paddington and Birkenhead from 1965.\n\nAll local trains were diverted to Marylebone in 1963 and operated by four-car [[British Rail Class 115|Class 115]] DMUs, and the main-line platforms at Greenford on the New North route between Old Oak Common and Northolt Junction were closed.\n\nAfter the GCR main line was closed between {{rws|Calvert}} and {{rws|Rugby Central}} in September 1966, some trains from the South Coast were diverted north of Banbury via the route.  These became the forerunners of today's [[CrossCountry]] services between Birmingham and {{rws|Bournemouth}}.\n[[File:Crowcombe Heathfield railway station MMB 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Class 115 DMUs operated Marylebone - Banbury local services between 1960 and 1992]]\nOn 6 March 1967,<ref name=rcw>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Paul|title=Rail Centres: Wolverhampton|publisher=Ian Allan|location=[[London]]|year=1990|isbn=978-0-7110-1892-1}}</ref> after completion of the WCML electrification, express trains from Paddington to Birmingham/Wolverhampton/Birkenhead were discontinued under ''[[Beeching Axe|The Reshaping of British Railways]]''.  The route was downgraded to secondary status and subsequently single-tracked between Princes Risborough and Aynho Junction, which remained a [[flying junction]], with a crossing loop at Bicester not normally used. Through lines were removed from most of those stations which had them, such as Denham in 1965, Beaconsfield in 1973 and Gerrards Cross in 1989 and the relief lines were lifted between Lapworth and Tyseley. The tunnel between Birmingham Moor Street and Snow Hill closed on 2 March 1968.<ref name=rcw/> Local services from Leamington and Stratford terminated at Moor Street, and the remaining services from Paddington and the South Coast were diverted into New Street. Snow Hill closed completely, along with most of the line to Wolverhampton, on 4 March 1972.<ref name=rcw/>\n\nAlthough a two-hourly locomotive-hauled semi-fast service from Paddington to Birmingham continued via High Wycombe, Princes Risborough, Bicester, Banbury, Leamington and Solihull, in the early 1970s all but one daily peak-hour return journey were diverted via {{rws|Reading}} and Oxford, and later via {{rws|Coventry}}, and in the 1980s that was truncated to run to Banbury only. All other passenger services were operated by DMUs to and from Marylebone, extended from High Wycombe to Banbury (for connections to Birmingham), on a two-hourly frequency.\n\nOn 24 March 1974 the line from Marylebone to Banbury transferred from the Western Region to the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]] and all stations between South Ruislip and Bicester were also transferred to LMR giving LMR the responsibility of all passenger services out of Marylebone. \n\nIn 1977 the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification of more of the rail network]], and by 1979 BR presented a range of options to electrify numerous routes by 2000.<ref name=\"BR-CPU\">{{cite book|author=Anonymous|title=Railway Electrification|date=Winter 1979|publisher=[[British Railways Board]] (Central Publicity Unit)|pages=0\u20132, 8}}</ref> Some of these options included the Banbury \u2014 Birmingham section of the line, plus the [[Cherwell Valley Line]] and the [[Coventry to Leamington line]].<ref name=\"BR-CPU\"/> Under the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|1979\u201390 Conservative governments]] that succeeded the [[Callaghan ministry|1976\u201379 Labour government]] the proposals were not implemented.\n\nThe route was considered for partial closure in the 1980s. All services would have run to Paddington via the New North route, and Marylebone station and all lines leading to it would have been closed. Services to and from Aylesbury would have run via Princes Risborough. However, Marylebone was formally reprieved in 1986 and the closure proposals rescinded.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1992 [[British Rail]] carried out a [[total route modernisation]] which included resignalling from Marylebone to Aynho Junction, and both Marylebone to Aylesbury routes, from the new Marylebone [[Integrated Electronic Control Centre|Integrated Control Centre]]. This was combined with track rationalisation that removed most of the vestigial traces of main-line heritage from the line, downgrading it to a purely commuter line with a minimal infrastructure.  Until then, much of the four-track section between Northolt Junction and West Ruislip had survived, and High Wycombe station had retained almost all of its original track layout, though the other major stations on the line had already been downgraded with their through lines removed. At the same time, the New North route between Old Oak Common and Northolt Junction was singled between Old Oak Common and [[Park Royal]] and between Greenford and Northolt Junction. In 1992, the [[signal box]] at Aynho Junction was closed and replaced with modern signalling controlled from Banbury South signal box; the box was demolished in 2002. As part of these renovations, BR installed the advanced [[Automatic Train Protection]] (ATP) system, mainly as a trial with a view to rolling it out nationwide.  However, privatisation intervened, and the Great Western Main Line was the only other line to be so equipped.\n\n===Rejuvenation===\n[[File:Paddington Station. - geograph.org.uk - 123729.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{brc|165}} DMUs were introduced to the Chiltern Main Line by Network SouthEast]]\nWith Sectorisation of British Rail in the mid-1980s, operations south of Banbury fell under the control of [[Network SouthEast]] in 1986, under the Thames & Chiltern sub-sector, later split into two constituent parts. In 1987 a new station was opened at [[Haddenham & Thame Parkway railway station|Haddenham & Thame Parkway]]. Birmingham Snow Hill reopened in 1987 on a much smaller scale than the original, beneath a [[multi-storey car park]], with its tunnel reinstated and new platforms on the through lines at Moor Street, where the terminus was taken out of use, with Leamington/Stratford services diverted to Snow Hill.\n\nThe opening of the extension of the parallel [[M40 motorway]] from Oxford to Birmingham in 1991 spawned development in towns along the northern section of the route, notably [[Bicester]], Banbury, Leamington Spa and Warwick. This generated additional patronage for train services in the corridor.\n\nClass 165 Turbo trains were introduced in 1991, initially between Marylebone and Banbury. These improved passenger comfort and enabled journey times to be reduced; frequencies were increased, with an hourly stopping service to/from High Wycombe and hourly semi-fast service to/from Banbury. In 1993, Marylebone-Banbury services were extended to Snow Hill, calling at Leamington Spa, Warwick, Solihull and Moor Street, initially on a two-hourly frequency, increased to hourly the following year, when a Dorridge call was added. In 1995 the [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|Jewellery Line]] was re-opened to allow Worcester line services to be diverted from New Street to Snow Hill; this allowed some of Chiltern's weekday peak-period services to be extended beyond Snow Hill, first to Stourbridge Junction and then to Kidderminster.\n\n===Chiltern Railways era===\nUpon rail privatisation in 1996, the [[Chiltern Railways]] franchise was won by [[Chiltern Railways#History|M40 Trains]], a consortium of a management buyout, Laing Rail (a subsidiary of construction company and [[Private finance initiative|PFI]] specialist [[John Laing plc]]), and venture capitalist [[3i]], and in 1998 the line between Princes Risborough and Bicester North was redoubled by the company. This included the total reconstruction of [[Haddenham and Thame Parkway railway station|Haddenham and Thame Parkway]] at platform level, with two side platforms instead of the single platform constructed in 1987, and a new down platform at Princes Risborough, together with the raising of the speed limit. Also in 1998 the first Class 168 Clubman trains with a {{convert|100|mph|kph|adj=on}} maximum speed were introduced to reduce journey times.\n[[File:168107 A London Marylebone.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Chiltern Railways ordered 19 {{brc|168}} DMUs for its Marylebone - Birmingham services]]\nIn 2000 Chiltern Railways opened a new station at [[Warwick Parkway railway station|Warwick Parkway]], to the west of the town next to the [[A46 road|A46]] and close to [[M40 motorway|M40]] Junction 15. This was intended to be a railhead for nearby towns without a station such as [[Kenilworth]], and for towns south of Birmingham close to the [[M42 motorway|M42]] with no direct rail link to London, such as [[Redditch]] and [[Bromsgrove]]. Construction was funded by Chiltern Railways with some support from [[Warwickshire County Council]]. At first only Chiltern services called there but it is now also served by London Midland.\n\nIn 2002, after Chiltern won its 20-year [[exclusive right|franchise]], the line between Bicester North and Aynho Junction was also redoubled. Chiltern took over Hatton to Stratford-upon-Avon services from [[Thames Trains]] and [[Central Trains]], with direct services between Marylebone (rather than Paddington) and Stratford. Also at this time Chiltern took over the operation of [[Leamington Spa railway station|Leamington Spa]], [[Warwick railway station|Warwick]], [[Hatton railway station (Warwickshire)|Hatton]] and [[Lapworth railway station|Lapworth]] stations from Central Trains, as the latter's services (now operated by London Midland) no longer operated beyond Dorridge except during weekday peak periods.\n\nJohn Laing plc acquired 84% ownership of M40 Trains in 1999, buying out 3i, and was itself bought out by [[Henderson Group|Henderson Investments]] in 2006, resulting in the sale of Laing Rail to the German national railway operator [[Deutsche Bahn]] in 2007.\n\nThe [[Cherwell Valley]] line between Banbury and Leamington Spa was resignalled during 2004, with the closure of [[Fenny Compton]] signal box and the removal of its remaining semaphore signals. The new signalling and the existing signalling in the Leamington Spa station area is controlled from the box at Leamington via a new Westcad workstation.  More recently the Leamington to Birmingham section has been resignalled and is controlled from the new [[West Midlands ICC]] at [[Saltley]] (taking over the old signalling centre at Saltley) with new 4-aspect LED signals throughout.  However, the manual signal boxes at Banbury North and South remained, along with some GWR lower-quadrant signals controlling the bay platforms and sidings at the station.  In 2016 the station was re-modelled and re-signalled, being incorporated into the West Midlands  ICC take over control as Oxford (exclusive) in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.networkrail.co.uk/feeds/orange-army-upgrades-railway-and-keeps-customers-moving-in-2016/|title=Orange army upgrades railway and keeps customers moving in 2016|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nMost of the route from Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton is now used by the [[Midland Metro]] light-rail system, which diverges from Network Rail's Jewellery Line at The Hawthorns.\n\nThe route between Marylebone and Leamington/Bordesley was used by [[open access operator]] [[Wrexham & Shropshire]]'s services from London to Wrexham via Tame Bridge, Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury, which comprised three [[British Rail Mark 3|Mk3 coaches]] hauled by [[British Rail Class 67|Class 67]] diesel locomotives. Since these were neither Sprinters nor HSTs, they were restricted to lower line speeds, e.g. {{convert|60|mph|kph}} between Princes Risborough and Bicester, and {{convert|70|mph|kph}} between Leamington and Bordesley, although they were permitted to travel at {{convert|85|mph|kph}} between Bicester and Aynho.  Wrexham & Shropshire had negotiated with Network Rail to allow its trains to travel at higher speeds on these sections, which required it to show that they had sufficient brake force to stop from such speeds within the signal spacings.\n\nOnly the little-used line from Northolt Junction to Paddington has not been improved.\n\nIn September 2006, Chiltern completed its \"Evergreen 2\" upgrade project, carried out by [[Carillion]], which realigned the track through [[Beaconsfield railway station (Buckinghamshire)|Beaconsfield]] to increase non-stop speeds from {{convert|40|to|75|mph|kph}}, installed additional [[Railway signal|signals]] between High Wycombe and Bicester North and between Princes Risborough and Aylesbury, and added two platforms (Nos 5 and 6) at Marylebone, on the site of the daytime carriage sidings, replaced by the new Wembley Light Maintenance Depot, just south and west of [[Wembley Stadium station]]. The new platforms and partial resignalling of the station throat make it possible to run 20 trains per hour in and out of the station.\n\nAt weekends during 2008, when major engineering works were taking place on the WCML, the line was used by Virgin Trains' {{Stnlnk|London Euston}} - {{Stnlnk|Birmingham International}} \"Blockade Buster\" service via Willesden, Acton Main Line, Ealing Broadway, Greenford, High Wycombe, Banbury and Coventry, using pairs of five-car class 221 sets.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Tunnels and viaducts ===\n[[File:Give Peas a chance!
