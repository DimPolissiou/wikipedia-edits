With a line-up comprising [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], they sparked the \"[[Beatlemania]]\" phenomenon in 1963, gained international stardom in 1964, and remained active until their [[break-up of the Beatles|break-up in 1970]]. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society's developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], [[Britishness|British identity]], popular music's [[Art music#Popular music|evolution into an art form]], and their unprecedented following.\n\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to national prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to [[social mobility]], teenagers' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists' global dominance of [[rock and roll]] to British acts (known in the US as the [[British Invasion]]) and inspired many young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the group had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks, and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks.  In 1965, they were awarded [[MBE]]s, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were \"[[more popular than Jesus]] now\".\n\nThe Beatles often incorporated [[classical music|classical]] elements, [[traditional pop]] forms and unconventional [[Recording practices of the Beatles|recording techniques]] in innovative ways, especially with the albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the [[LP record|album]] to become the dominant form of record consumption over [[Single (music)|singles]], a wider interest in [[psychedelic drug]]s and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. The band also pioneered with their [[record sleeve]]s and [[music video]]s, as well as informed music styles such as [[jangle]], [[folk rock]], [[power pop]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[progressive rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. By the end of the decade, the group were seen as an embodiment of the era's sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\".\n\nOver the 1960s as a whole, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and continue to enjoy a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" [[List of artists who have covered The Beatles|exceeding in the thousands]].

Pepper''.{{sfn|Morgan|Wardle|2015|pp=147, 179}} The design for ''Revolver'' was markedly different from LP covers of 1966,{{sfn|Turner|2016|p=210}} particularly in its eschewing of vibrant psychedelic colours for black-and-white;{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=157}} in Gould's view, it supported the aesthetic of the music and the Beatles' determination to reinvent themselves on record.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} Created by [[Klaus Voormann]], the band's friend from their [[The Beatles in Hamburg|years in Hamburg]], the cover combined line-drawing caricatures of the Beatles' faces with a collage of older photos.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=156\u201357}}{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=209\u201310}} In the line drawings, Voormann drew inspiration from the work of the nineteenth-century illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]],{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} who was the subject of a long-running exhibition at London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and highly influential on fashion and design themes of the time.{{sfn|Turner|2016|p=210}}{{sfn|Glynn|2013|p=134}} Voormann placed the various photos within the tangle of hair connecting the four faces,{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} thereby, in Rodriguez's description, capturing both the long hair synonymous with the band's public image and \"the explosion of ideas that were pouring out of their heads\".{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=157, 158\u201359}}\n\nAccording to author Ian Inglis, the cover for ''Sgt. Pepper'' is widely recognised for demonstrating an \"unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space\", and it initiated an acceptance of album artwork as an \"integral component\" of the listening experience.{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101}} The LP's gatefold packaging included cardboard cutouts and, for the first time in a pop album, printed lyrics.{{sfn|Larkin|2006|p=487}} The inclusion of the lyrics infuriated sheet music publishers, who lost the revenue from sales of the songs' sheet music.{{sfn|Miles|Morgan|2005|p=50}} In the late 1990s, the BBC included the ''Sgt.

Each copy was individually numbered on the cover, thereby lending a uniqueness to each one and reflecting a tenet of [[conceptual art]].{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=113}}\n\n===Film and music videos===\n''A Hard Day's Night'' broke new ground in the field of British and American musical feature films,{{sfn|Simonelli|2013|p=93}} particularly in its abandoning of the genre's standard rags-to-riches premise for a comedic presentation of the artists playing themselves.{{sfn|Marwick|2012|pp=426\u201327}} Film historian Stephen Glynn describes it as \"the canonical pop music film\".{{sfn|Glynn|2013|p=82}} He highlights the innovative techniques Lester uses in the sequence for \"Can't Buy Me Love\",{{sfn|Glynn|2013|p=92}} as does Saul Austerlitz, who deems it the precursor to the modern [[music video]].{{sfn|Austerlitz|2007|pp=17\u201318}} Lester's use of devices from the European art-house tradition, combined with the film's comedic and satirical qualities, ensured that ''A Hard Day's Night'' defied easy categorisation and won critical recognition for the rock music film. [[Andrew Sarris]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called it \"the ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of jukebox musicals\".{{sfn|Romanowski|2006|p=218}}\n\n[[File:TrailerUSHelp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=The Beatles performing music in a field.

With a line-up comprising [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], they sparked the \"[[Beatlemania]]\" phenomenon in 1963, gained international stardom in 1964, and remained active until their [[break-up of the Beatles|break-up in 1970]]. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society's developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], [[Britishness|British identity]], popular music's [[Art music#Popular music|evolution into an art form]], and their unprecedented following.\n\nMany cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to national prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to [[social mobility]], teenagers' commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists' global dominance of [[rock and roll]] to British acts (known in the US as the [[British Invasion]]) and inspired many young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the group had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks, and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks.  In 1965, they were awarded [[MBE]]s, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were \"[[more popular than Jesus]] now\".\n\nThe Beatles often incorporated [[classical music|classical]] elements, [[traditional pop]] forms and unconventional [[Recording practices of the Beatles|recording techniques]] in innovative ways, especially with the albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the [[LP record|album]] to become the dominant form of record consumption over [[Single (music)|singles]], a wider interest in [[psychedelic drug]]s and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. The band also pioneered with their [[record sleeve]]s and [[music video]]s, as well as informed music styles such as [[jangle]], [[folk rock]], [[power pop]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[progressive rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. By the end of the decade, the group were seen as an embodiment of the era's sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\".\n\nOver the 1960s as a whole, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and continue to enjoy a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" [[List of artists who have covered The Beatles|exceeding in the thousands]]. As of 2009, they were the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling band]] in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"RooneySmith/CNN\">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/04/news/companies/beatles_video_game/|first1=Ben|last1=Rooney|first2=Aaron|last2=Smith|title=Beatles' remastered box set, video game out|date=9 September 2009|publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]]|accessdate=23 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915183858/https://money.cnn.com/2009/09/04/news/companies/beatles_video_game/|archive-date=15 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"hotten1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19800654|title=The Beatles at 50: From Fab Four to fabulously wealthy|last=Hotten|first=Russell|date=4 October 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312172123/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19800654|archive-date=12 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included them in [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|its list of the twentieth century's 100 most important people]].{{sfn|Loder|1998}}\n\n==Scope==\nThe Beatles formed in [[Liverpool]] in 1960; as a foursome comprising [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], they gained international stardom in 1964, and remained active until their [[Break-up of the Beatles|break-up in 1970]].

resembled \"a one-way mirror that offered the world a clearer, more intimate picture of a celebrity than it had ever before known on such a scale\".{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=106}} Harrison also issued

to influence by association.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=195}} Until the label's closure in the mid 1970s, Apple had the highest success rate of any British record company with regard to UK chart

It marks the end of the year's fieldwork and harvest. It involves much music, dancing, and the sacrifice of many goats. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical homeland of the Kalash, ''Tsyam'' (Tsiyam, ts\u00edam), for the duration of the feast. Food sacrifices are offered at the clans' Jeshtak shrines, dedicated to the ancestors.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt ''Chaumos'', impure and uninitiated persons are not admitted; they must be purified by waving a fire brand over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving juniper brands over the men. The 'old rules' of the gods (Devalog, dewal\u014dk) are no longer in force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. The main Chaumos ritual takes place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra's place, \"indrunkot\", or \"indr\u00e9yin\". Indrunkot is sometimes believed to belong to Balumain's brother, In(dr), lord of cattle.<ref name=Witzel/> Ancestors, impersonated by young boys (\u014dnje\u1e63\u1e6da 'pure'), are worshipped and offered bread; they hold on to each other and form a chain (cf. the Vedic anv\u0101rambha\u1e47a) and snake through the village.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe men must be divided into two parties: the pure ones have to sing the well-honored songs of the past, but the impure sing wild, passionate, and obscene songs, with an altogether different rhythm. This is accompanied by a 'sex change': men dress as women, women as men (Balumain also is partly seen as female and can change between both forms at will).<ref name=Witzel />\n\nThis includes the Festival of the Budulak (bu\u1e0d\u00e1\u1e37ak, the 'shepherd king'). In this festival, a strong prepubescent boy is sent up into the mountains to live with the goats for the summer. He is supposed to get fat and strong from the [[goat milk]]. When the festival comes he is allowed for a 24-hour period only to have sexual intercourse with any woman he wants, including even the wife of another man, or a young virgin. Any child born of this 24-hour period is considered to be blessed. The Kalash claim to have abolished this practice in recent years due to negative worldwide publicity.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt this crucial moment the pure get weaker, and the impure try to take hold of the (very pure) boys, pretend to mount them \"like a hornless ram\", and proceed in snake procession. At this point, the impure men resist and fight. When the \"nagayr\u014d\" song with the response \"han sar\u00edas\" (from *samr\u012byate 'flows together', CDIAL 12995) is voiced, Balumain showers all his blessings and disappears. He gives his blessings to seven boys (representing the mythical seven of the eight Devalog who received him on arrival), and these pass the blessings on to all pure men.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nIn myth, Mahandeu had cheated Balumain from superiority, when all the gods had slept together (a euphemism) in the Shawalo meadow; therefore, he went to the mythical home of the Kalash in Tsiyam (ts\u00edam), to come back next year like the Vedic Indra ([[Rigveda]] 10.86). If this had not happened, Balumain would have taught humans how to have sex as a sacred act. Instead, he could only teach them fertility songs used at the Chaumos ritual. He arrives from the west, the [[Bashgal Valley|Bashgal valley]], in early December, before solstice, and leaves the day after. He was at first shunned by some people, who were annihilated. He was, however, received by seven Devalog and they all went to several villages, such as Batrik village, where seven pure, young boys received him whom he took with him. Therefore, nowadays, one only sends men and older boys to receive him. Balumain is the typical culture hero. He told people about the sacred fire made from junipers, about the sowing ceremony for wheat that involved the blood of a small goat, and he asked for wheat tribute (hushak) for his horse. Finally, Balumain taught how to celebrate the winter festival. He was visible only during his first visit, now he is just felt to be present.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nDuring the winter the Kalash play an inter-village tournament of Chikik Gal (ball game) in which villages compete against each other to hit a ball up and down the valley in deep snow.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Kalash-Frau.jpg|thumb|A Kalash woman in traditional costume]]\nThe Kalash people are divided equally between the adherents of Islam,{{efn|<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/>}}<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/> and those that practice the traditional Kalash religion, which some observers label as [[animism]],<ref name=\"Searle2013\"/><ref name=\"Camerapix1998\"/><ref name=\"Sheehan1993\"/><ref name=\"Pelton1997\">{{cite book|author=Robert Young Pelton|title=Fielding's the World's Most Dangerous Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVY1qg1hiNYC|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Fielding Worldwide|isbn=978-1-56952-140-3|quote=.The Kalash (which means black because of the black garments they wear) are an animist tribe who live in a region sometimes called Kafiristan.}}</ref> but other academics as \"a form of [[ancient Hinduism]]\".<ref name=\"West2010\"/><ref name=\"Bezhan2017\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1324805|title=Peshawar High Court orders govt to include Kalasha religion in census|last=Akbar|first=Ali|date=4 April 2017|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|language=English|accessdate=11 July 2017|quote=Kalasha, the religion followed by Kalash community, lies between Islam and an ancient form of Hinduism.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sanskrit]] linguist [[Michael Witzel]], the traditional Kalash religion shares \"many of the traits of myths, ritual, society, and echoes many aspects of [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [religion]\" but not of the post-Rigvedic religion that later developed in other parts of India.<ref name=Witzel>{{citation |first=Michael |last=Witzel |authorlink=Michael Witzel |chapter=Kalash Religion (extract from 'The \u1e5agvedic Religious System and its Central Asian and Hindukush Antecedents') |editor1=A.

Importantly, the division between two groups of deities ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devalog]]) and their intermarriage (Imra's mother is a 'giant') has been preserved, and this dichotomy is still re-enacted in rituals and festivals, especially the Chaumos. Ritual still is of IIr.type: Among the Kalash it is basically, though not always, temple-less, involving fire, sacred wood, three circumambulations, and the *[[hot\u1e5b]].

Balumain is a culture hero who taught how to celebrate the Kalash winter festival (Chaumos). He is connected with ''Tsyam'', the mythological homeland of the Kalash.

It marks the end of the year's fieldwork and harvest. It involves much music, dancing, and the sacrifice of many goats. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical homeland of the Kalash, ''Tsyam'' (Tsiyam, ts\u00edam), for the duration of the feast. Food sacrifices are offered at the clans' Jeshtak shrines, dedicated to the ancestors.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt ''Chaumos'', impure and uninitiated persons are not admitted; they must be purified by waving a fire brand over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving juniper brands over the men. The 'old rules' of the gods (Devalog, dewal\u014dk) are no longer in force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. The main Chaumos ritual takes place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra's place, \"indrunkot\", or \"indr\u00e9yin\". Indrunkot is sometimes believed to belong to Balumain's brother, In(dr), lord of cattle.<ref name=Witzel/> Ancestors, impersonated by young boys (\u014dnje\u1e63\u1e6da 'pure'), are worshipped and offered bread; they hold on to each other and form a chain (cf. the Vedic anv\u0101rambha\u1e47a) and snake through the village.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe men must be divided into two parties: the pure ones have to sing the well-honored songs of the past, but the impure sing wild, passionate, and obscene songs, with an altogether different rhythm. This is accompanied by a 'sex change': men dress as women, women as men (Balumain also is partly seen as female and can change between both forms at will).<ref name=Witzel />\n\nThis includes the Festival of the Budulak (bu\u1e0d\u00e1\u1e37ak, the 'shepherd king'). In this festival, a strong prepubescent boy is sent up into the mountains to live with the goats for the summer. He is supposed to get fat and strong from the [[goat milk]]. When the festival comes he is allowed for a 24-hour period only to have sexual intercourse with any woman he wants, including even the wife of another man, or a young virgin. Any child born of this 24-hour period is considered to be blessed. The Kalash claim to have abolished this practice in recent years due to negative worldwide publicity.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt this crucial moment the pure get weaker, and the impure try to take hold of the (very pure) boys, pretend to mount them \"like a hornless ram\", and proceed in snake procession. At this point, the impure men resist and fight. When the \"nagayr\u014d\" song with the response \"han sar\u00edas\" (from *samr\u012byate 'flows together', CDIAL 12995) is voiced, Balumain showers all his blessings and disappears. He gives his blessings to seven boys (representing the mythical seven of the eight Devalog who received him on arrival), and these pass the blessings on to all pure men.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nIn myth, Mahandeu had cheated Balumain from superiority, when all the gods had slept together (a euphemism) in the Shawalo meadow; therefore, he went to the mythical home of the Kalash in Tsiyam (ts\u00edam), to come back next year like the Vedic Indra ([[Rigveda]] 10.86). If this had not happened, Balumain would have taught humans how to have sex as a sacred act. Instead, he could only teach them fertility songs used at the Chaumos ritual. He arrives from the west, the [[Bashgal Valley|Bashgal valley]], in early December, before solstice, and leaves the day after. He was at first shunned by some people, who were annihilated. He was, however, received by seven Devalog and they all went to several villages, such as Batrik village, where seven pure, young boys received him whom he took with him. Therefore, nowadays, one only sends men and older boys to receive him. Balumain is the typical culture hero. He told people about the sacred fire made from junipers, about the sowing ceremony for wheat that involved the blood of a small goat, and he asked for wheat tribute (hushak) for his horse. Finally, Balumain taught how to celebrate the winter festival. He was visible only during his first visit, now he is just felt to be present.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nDuring the winter the Kalash play an inter-village tournament of Chikik Gal (ball game) in which villages compete against each other to hit a ball up and down the valley in deep snow.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Kalash-Frau.jpg|thumb|A Kalash woman in traditional costume]]\nThe Kalash people are divided equally between the adherents of Islam,{{efn|<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/>}}<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/> and those that practice the traditional Kalash religion, which some observers label as [[animism]],<ref name=\"Searle2013\"/><ref name=\"Camerapix1998\"/><ref name=\"Sheehan1993\"/><ref name=\"Pelton1997\">{{cite book|author=Robert Young Pelton|title=Fielding's the World's Most Dangerous Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVY1qg1hiNYC|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Fielding Worldwide|isbn=978-1-56952-140-3|quote=.The Kalash (which means black because of the black garments they wear) are an animist tribe who live in a region sometimes called Kafiristan.}}</ref> but other academics as \"a form of [[ancient Hinduism]]\".<ref name=\"West2010\"/><ref name=\"Bezhan2017\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1324805|title=Peshawar High Court orders govt to include Kalasha religion in census|last=Akbar|first=Ali|date=4 April 2017|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|language=English|accessdate=11 July 2017|quote=Kalasha, the religion followed by Kalash community, lies between Islam and an ancient form of Hinduism.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sanskrit]] linguist [[Michael Witzel]], the traditional Kalash religion shares \"many of the traits of myths, ritual, society, and echoes many aspects of [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [religion]\" but not of the post-Rigvedic religion that later developed in other parts of India.<ref name=Witzel>{{citation |first=Michael |last=Witzel |authorlink=Michael Witzel |chapter=Kalash Religion (extract from 'The \u1e5agvedic Religious System and its Central Asian and Hindukush Antecedents') |editor1=A.

Importantly, the division between two groups of deities ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devalog]]) and their intermarriage (Imra's mother is a 'giant') has been preserved, and this dichotomy is still re-enacted in rituals and festivals, especially the Chaumos. Ritual still is of IIr.type: Among the Kalash it is basically, though not always, temple-less, involving fire, sacred wood, three circumambulations, and the *[[hot\u1e5b]].

Balumain is a culture hero who taught how to celebrate the Kalash winter festival (Chaumos). He is connected with ''Tsyam'', the mythological homeland of the Kalash.
