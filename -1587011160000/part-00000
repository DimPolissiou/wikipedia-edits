It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batwoman]] and shares continuity with the other television series in the [[Arrowverse]]. The series premiered on [[The CW]] on October 6, 2019, and is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, with location filming in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. ''Batwoman'' follows Kate Kane overcoming her demons and past to become Gotham City's new symbol of hope as the vigilante Batwoman.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Batwoman would appear in \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the Arrowverse series' 2018 crossover, with an announcement two months later that a series centered on the character was in development from Dries. [[Ruby Rose]] was cast in the title role in August of the same year. In January 2019, the series received a pilot order from the CW, to be considered for a series order in the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 television season]]. The show was picked up to series in May 2019 and in October 2019 a full season of 22 episodes was ordered. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a second season. Production was delayed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] so the remaining episodes were not finished.\n\n== Premise ==\nThree years after billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego [[Batman]] disappeared,{{efn|It is stated by Kate Kane in the ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' crossover that both Batman and Bruce Wayne have \"gone missing.\"}} his cousin Kate Kane sets out to overcome her demons and become a symbol of hope by protecting the streets of [[Gotham City]] as [[Batwoman]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |title=Batwoman trailer reveals origin of Ruby Rose's LGBTQ+ superhero |date=May 16, 2019 |work=Digital Spy |access-date=June 3, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034728/https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |archive-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BatwomanSeries\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--Can someone split the character section when Season Two begins?-->\n=== Main ===\n<!--Main cast order is according to original broadcasting credits (the pilot episode).

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batwoman]] and shares continuity with the other television series in the [[Arrowverse]]. The series premiered on [[The CW]] on October 6, 2019, and is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, with location filming in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. ''Batwoman'' follows Kate Kane overcoming her demons and past to become Gotham City's new symbol of hope as the vigilante Batwoman.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Batwoman would appear in \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the Arrowverse series' 2018 crossover, with an announcement two months later that a series centered on the character was in development from Dries. [[Ruby Rose]] was cast in the title role in August of the same year. In January 2019, the series received a pilot order from the CW, to be considered for a series order in the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 television season]]. The show was picked up to series in May 2019 and in October 2019 a full season of 22 episodes was ordered. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a second season. Production was delayed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] so the remaining episodes were not finished.\n\n== Premise ==\nThree years after billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego [[Batman]] disappeared,{{efn|It is stated by Kate Kane in the ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' crossover that both Batman and Bruce Wayne have \"gone missing.\"}} his cousin Kate Kane sets out to overcome her demons and become a symbol of hope by protecting the streets of [[Gotham City]] as [[Batwoman]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |title=Batwoman trailer reveals origin of Ruby Rose's LGBTQ+ superhero |date=May 16, 2019 |work=Digital Spy |access-date=June 3, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034728/https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |archive-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BatwomanSeries\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--Can someone split the character section when Season Two begins?-->\n=== Main ===\n<!--Main cast order is according to original broadcasting credits (the pilot episode).

Barney decides to \"develop Willie's love of true nature\" by [[gardening]], but Willie pours Quick-Grow Plant Food on the two trees that Barney's [[hammock]] is tied to and they grow very tall and Barney lands in a barrel of [[tar]] which Willie [[wheelbarrow]]s him down to a clothes washing machine. Barney then tries to \"give him a hobby\" through [[photography]] but Willie slips a giant bullet into the camera and turns it around, making Barney fire himself. Barney then tries \"winning his undying attention\" by baking him a cake but Willie puts a [[gas]][[hose]] into the cake, which turns into a bomb cake that explodes when Barney lights the candle.

Also, the code may perform dynamics by considering the classical (i.e. point-particle) approximation for the nuclei. These dynamics may be non-adiabatic, since the system evolves following the Ehrenfest path. It is, however, a mean-field approach.\n* Regarding TDDFT, one can use three different approaches:\n** the standard TDDFT-based linear-response theory of Casida, which provides the excitation energies and oscillator strengths for ground-state to excited-state transitions.\n** the explicit time-propagation of the TDDFT equations, which allows for the use of large external potentials, well beyond the range of validity of [[perturbation theory]].\n** the Sternheimer equation (density-functional perturbation theory) in the frequency domain, using only occupied states.\n\n==Methodology==\n\n* As numerical representation, the code works without a [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]], relying on numerical meshes. Nevertheless, auxiliary basis sets ([[plane wave]]s, [[atomic orbital]]s) are used when necessary. Recently, the code offers the possibility of working with non-uniform grids, which adapt to the inhomogeneity of the problem, and of making use of multigrid techniques to accelerate the calculations.\n* For most calculations, the code relies on the use of [[pseudopotential]]s<ref>{{cite journal | last=Pickett | first=Warren E. | title=Pseudopotential methods in condensed matter applications | journal=Computer Physics Reports | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=9 | issue=3 | year=1989 | issn=0167-7977 | doi=10.1016/0167-7977(89)90002-6 | pages=115\u2013197}}</ref> of two types: Troullier-Martins,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Troullier | first=N. | last2=Martins | first2=Jos\u00e9 Luriaas | title=Efficient pseudopotentials for plane-wave calculations | journal=Physical Review B | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=43 | issue=3 | date=1991-01-15 | issn=0163-1829 | doi=10.1103/physrevb.43.1993 | pages=1993\u20132006}}</ref> and Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hartwigsen | first=C. | last2=Goedecker | first2=S. | last3=Hutter | first3=J. | title=Relativistic separable dual-space Gaussian pseudopotentials from H to Rn | journal=Physical Review B | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=58 | issue=7 | date=1998-08-15 | issn=0163-1829 | doi=10.1103/physrevb.58.3641 | pages=3641\u20133662| arxiv=cond-mat/9803286 }}</ref>\n* In addition to being able to treat systems in the standard 3 dimensions, 2D and 1D modes are also available. These are useful for studying, e.g., the two-dimensional electron gas that characterizes a wide class of quantum dots.\n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n* The code has been designed with emphasis on parallel scalability. In consequence, it allows for multiple task divisions, this utilises mesh division software, [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] and [[OpenMP]]\n* The language of most of the code is [[Fortran]] 90 (almost 50.000 lines at present).

It is, however, a mean-field approach.\n* Regarding TDDFT, one can use three different approaches:\n** the standard TDDFT-based linear-response theory of Casida, which provides the excitation energies and oscillator strengths for ground-state to excited-state transitions.\n** the explicit time-propagation of the TDDFT equations, which allows for the use of large external potentials, well beyond the range of validity of [[perturbation theory]].\n** the Sternheimer equation (density-functional perturbation theory) in the frequency domain, using only occupied states.\n\n==Methodology==\n\n* As numerical representation, the code works without a [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]], relying on numerical meshes. Nevertheless, auxiliary basis sets ([[plane wave]]s, [[atomic orbital]]s) are used when necessary. Recently, the code offers the possibility of working with non-uniform grids, which adapt to the inhomogeneity of the problem, and of making use of multigrid techniques to accelerate the calculations.\n* For most calculations, the code relies on the use of [[pseudopotential]]s<ref>{{cite journal | last=Pickett | first=Warren E. | title=Pseudopotential methods in condensed matter applications | journal=Computer Physics Reports | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=9 | issue=3 | year=1989 | issn=0167-7977 | doi=10.1016/0167-7977(89)90002-6 | pages=115\u2013197}}</ref> of two types: Troullier-Martins,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Troullier | first=N. | last2=Martins | first2=Jos\u00e9 Luriaas | title=Efficient pseudopotentials for plane-wave calculations | journal=Physical Review B | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=43 | issue=3 | date=1991-01-15 | issn=0163-1829 | doi=10.1103/physrevb.43.1993 | pages=1993\u20132006}}</ref> and Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hartwigsen | first=C. | last2=Goedecker | first2=S. | last3=Hutter | first3=J. | title=Relativistic separable dual-space Gaussian pseudopotentials from H to Rn | journal=Physical Review B | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=58 | issue=7 | date=1998-08-15 | issn=0163-1829 | doi=10.1103/physrevb.58.3641 | pages=3641\u20133662| arxiv=cond-mat/9803286 }}</ref>\n* In addition to being able to treat systems in the standard 3 dimensions, 2D and 1D modes are also available.

The daughter of King [[Stanislaus I of Poland]] and [[Catherine Opali\u0144ska]], her 42-year service was the longest of any queen in French history.

Ironically, the hopeless political career of king Stanislaus was eventually the reason why his daughter Maria was chosen as the bride of King [[Louis XV of France]]. Devoid of political connections, his daughter was viewed by the French as being free from the burden of international alliances.\n\nShe was born in [[Trzebnica]] ({{lang-de|Trebnitz}}) in [[Lower Silesia]], the year before her father was made king of Poland by [[Charles XII of Sweden]], who had invaded the country in 1704. In 1709, her father was deposed when the Swedish army lost the military upper hand in Poland, and the family was granted refuge by Charles XII in the Swedish city of [[Kristianstad]] in [[Scania]].<ref name=\"lundh\">Lundh-Eriksson, Nanna: Hedvig Eleonora. Wahlstr\u00f6m & Widstrand (1947)</ref> During the escape, Marie was separated from the rest of her family; she was later found with her nurse hiding in a crib in a stable, although another version claims it was actually a cave in an old mineshaft.<ref name=\"lundh\" /> In Sweden, the family was welcomed by the queen dowager [[Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp]] and became popular members of society life on the estates of the nobility around Kristianstad. In 1712, they made an official visit to [[Medevi]], the spa of the Queen Dowager.<ref name=\"lundh\" /> During this period in her life, Marie began speaking [[Swedish language|Swedish]], with a [[Scania]]n accent. As Queen of France, she was known to welcome Swedish ambassadors to France with the phrase \"Welcome, Dearest Heart!\" in Swedish.\n\nIn 1714, Charles XII gave them permission to live in his fiefdom of [[Zweibr\u00fccken]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], where they were supported by the income of Zweibr\u00fccken: they lived there until the death of Charles XII in 1718.<ref name=\"lundh\" /> Zweibr\u00fccken then passed to a cousin of his.  These lands were parallel to the confiscated Polish properties of Stanislaus. Stanislaus appealed to the Regent of France, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, and the Duke of Lorraine for help, with the Queen of Sweden acting as his mediator.<ref name=\"orr\">Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660-1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004)</ref>\n\nIn 1718, with the support of the Duke of Lorraine, the family was allowed to settle in [[Wissembourg]] in the province of [[Alsace]], which had been annexed by France, a place suggested by [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], a nephew of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[R\u00e9gence|Regent of the Kingdom of France]] during [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s minority. The family lived a modest life in a large town house at the expense of the French Regent.\n\nTheir lifestyle in Wissembourg was regarded as very below standard for a royal at that time; they lived in a small house, and could not pay the salary of their small retinue from which a few \"served as an apology for a guard of honour\", and the jewels of the former queen Catherine were reportedly held as security by a moneylender.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\">{{cite book |last=Latour |first=Louis Therese |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.66391/ |title=Princesses Ladies and Salonni\u00e8res of the Reign of Louis XV |year=1927 |translator-first=Ivy E. |translator-last=Clegg |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.}}</ref>\n\nWhile her mother and grandmother [[Anna Leszczy\u0144ska (1660\u20131727)]] reportedly suffered from a certain degree of bitterness over their exile and loss of position which worsened their relationship with Stanislaus, whom they occasionally blamed for their exile, Marie, on contrast, was close to her father and spent a lot of time conversing with him, though she was evidently of a more rational nature: evidently, Marie \"possessed the gift of suffering in silence and of never wearying others with her troubles\", and was said to have developed \"a profound and intense piety\" which gave \"to her youthful mind the maturity of a woman who no longer demands happiness\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n==Marriage==\n\n===Early negotiations===\n\nMarie was not described as a beauty; instead her characteristics in the marriage market were stated as those of being pleasant, well-educated, and graceful in manner and movement.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In 1720, she was suggested as a bride to [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis Henri de Bourbon]], [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|Prince of Cond\u00e9]], (who preferred being and was known as the Duke of Bourbon, rather than Prince of Cond\u00e9) but her intended mother-in-law refused to give her consent.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The cavalry regiment provided by the Regent for the protection of the family included the officer Marquis de Courtanvaux, who fell in love with Marie and asked the Regent to be created a duke in order to ask for her hand; but when the Regent refused, the marriage became impossible because of his lack of rank.<ref name=\"orr\" /> [[Louis George, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] as well as the third Prince of Baden were suggested, but these negotiations fell through because of her insufficient dowry. Stanislaus unsuccessfully tried to arrange a marriage for her with the Count of Charolais, brother of the Duke of Bourbon.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In 1724, she was suggested by Count d'Argensson as a bride for the new Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, but her intended mother-in-law wished for a dynastic match with political advantage.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n[[File:Jeton de la reine Marie Leszczynska.jpg|thumb|Marie Leszczynska on coin.]]\n[[File:Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, by Jean-Baptiste van Loo.jpg|thumb|Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, by Jean-Baptiste van Loo]]\n[[File:Marie_Leczsinska.png|thumb|Coat of Arms of Marie as Queen of France]]\n\nIn 1723, the Duke of Bourbon had become the Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. The Regent was highly dominated by his lover, Madame de Prie. There were long-ongoing negotiations of a marriage between Marie and the now widowed Duke of Bourbon: Madame de Prie favored the match, as she did not perceive the reputedly unattractive Marie as a threat to her.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The marriage negotiations, however, were soon overshadowed when a marriage for King Louis XV was given priority. That same year, the young king fell ill and, fearing the consequences of the unmarried king dying without an heir, the Duc suggested getting the young King married as soon as possible.  Louis XV was already engaged, to [[Infante|Infanta]] [[Mariana Victoria of Spain]], who had been brought to France as his future queen some years earlier and was referred to as the Infanta-Queen.  However the Infanta was still a child, and could not be expected to conceive for several years; while Louis XV, being fifteen, had already hit puberty.<ref name=\"orr\" /> After Louis fell seriously ill, there was a great fear that he would die before he had time to have an heir to the throne.  Should that happen, the throne would pass to the Orl\u00e9ans line. This was an undesirable prospect for the Duke of Bourbon, who himself would in fact have preferred that the throne should pass to the Spanish line rather than to the Orl\u00e9ans line.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The engagement between Louis XV and the Spanish Infanta was broken, and the latter was sent back to Spain, much to the chagrin of the Spanish.  The Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie began negotiations for the immediate marriage of the King to Marie.\n\n===Negotiations for marriage to the king===\n\nMarie was on a list of 99 eligible European princesses to marry the young king. She was not the first choice on the list. She had been placed there initially because she was a Catholic princess and therefore fulfilled the minimum criteria, but was removed early on when the list was reduced from 99 to 17, for being too poor.<ref name=\"orr\" /> However, when the list of 17 (including [[Barbara of Portugal]], [[Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark]], [[Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine]] and [[Enrichetta d'Este]]) was further reduced to four, the preferred choices presented numerous problems.   [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]] and [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]] of Great Britain, who were considered with the understanding that they would convert to the Catholic faith upon marriage, were favored by the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie because it was supported by their political financiers, the firm of Paris Brothers [[Joseph Paris Duverney]].  [[Cardinal Fleury]] easily prevented the British match because of religious reasons.  The last two were the sisters of the Duke of Bourbon, [[Henriette Louise de Bourbon|Henriette-Louise]] and [[\u00c9lisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon|Therese-Alexandrine]], whom the King himself refused to marry because of the disapproval of [[Cardinal Fleury]].<ref name=\"orr\" /> Cardinal Fleury himself favored a match with [[Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg|Princess Charlotte of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg]], which was supported by the grandfather of Louis XV, the King of Savoy, through his spy the [[Princess of Carignan]], [[Maria Vittoria of Savoy]].\n\nIn these complicated disputes over the choice of a royal marriage partner, Marie Leszczy\u0144ska eventually emerged as a choice acceptable to both the party of the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie, as well as the party of Cardinal Fleury, mainly because she was politically uncontroversial and lacked any of the alliances which could harm either party.<ref name=\"orr\" /> At this point, there were already negotiations of marriage between Marie and the Duke of Bourbon. The Duke of d'Argensson had already left a favorable report of her, and the groundwork had been done.  Cardinal Fleury accepted the choice as Marie posed no threat to him because of her lack of connections, while the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie, precisely because she lacked any personal power base, expected her to be indebted to them for her position. Marie was, finally, chosen because she was a healthy adult Catholic princess ready to procreate immediately after the wedding.  Reportedly, Madame de Prie had a flattering portrait painted of Marie, in which she was deliberately made to look like the King's favorite portrait of his mother, and when he was shown it, he was impressed and exclaimed: \"she is the loveliest of them all!\", and became enthusiastic of the match, an episode which attracted some attention.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:MariaLeszczynska02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maria Leszczy\u0144ska in 1730, by [[Alexis Simon Belle]].]]\n\nThe formal proposal was made on 2 April 1725. The announcement of the wedding was not received well at the royal court. Marie's father Stanislaus had been a monarch for only a short time and she was thought to be a poor choice of inferior status not worthy of being queen of France.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The Dowager Duchess of Lorraine, sister of the former Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, was also insulted that her own daughter Elisabeth-Therese had not been chosen. The nobility and the court looked upon the future queen as an upstart intruder, the ministers as a cause to diplomatic trouble with Spain and Russia, whose princesses had been refused in favor of Marie, and the general public was also reportedly initially dissatisfied with the fact that France would gain \"from this marriage neither glory nor honor, riches nor alliances.\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> There were rumors before the wedding that the bride was ugly, epileptic and sterile. The 6 May 1725, Marie was forced to undergo a medical examination, which ruled out epilepsy and also gave reassuring reports about her menstruation and ability to procreate.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In the marriage contract, the same terms were given to her as was previously to the Spanish Infanta, and she was thus guaranteed fifty thousand crowns for rings and jewelry, two hundred and fifty thousand crowns upon her wedding, and the further guarantee of an annual widow allowance of twenty thousand crowns.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n===Private relationship to Louis XV===\n\nThe marriage by proxy took place on 15 August 1725 in the [[Strasbourg Cathedral|Cathedral of Strasbourg]], Louis XV represented by his cousin the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, [[Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|''Louis le Pieux'']]. Upon her marriage, Maria's Polish name was modified into French as ''Marie''. Furthermore, despite her surname being difficult to spell or to pronounce for the French, it was still commonly used by commoners. She was escorted on her way by Mademoiselle de Clermont, seven ladies-in-waiting, two maids-of-honour and numerous equerries and pages in a long train of coaches; however, she was not welcomed by triumphal entries, diplomatic greetings or the other official celebrations, as was normally the custom upon the arrival of a foreign princess upon a royal marriage.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Marie made a good impression upon the public from the beginning, such as when she handed out ''largesse'' on her way to her wedding in [[Fontainebleau]].\n\nLouis and Marie first met on the eve of their wedding, which took place on 5 September 1725, at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]]. Marie was twenty-two years old and Louis fifteen. The young couple was reported to have fallen in love at first sight. The relationship between Marie and Louis was initially described as a happy one, and for the first eight years of the marriage, Louis XV was faithful to her. Louis XV had been very impatient to marry her, was reportedly flattered to have a twenty two-year old wife at his age, and refused to allow any criticism of her appearance.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In August 1727, Marie gave birth to her first children, twins named [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]] and [[Princess Henriette of France|Anne Henriette]], at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The king was reportedly delighted, stating that after it had been said that he could not be a father, he had suddenly become the father of two. Cardinal Fleury, however, was much more displeased, and decided that until the queen had given birth to a son, she would not be allowed to accompany the king on his trips but stay at Versailles.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> A year later, another daughter, [[Princess Louise of France|Marie Louise]] was born, much to the disappointment of the King. The long-awaited [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729\u20131765)|Louis]], was born on 4 September 1729 to the immense relief of the country, whose royal family had a history of failing to establish a secure male line of succession. In all, Marie had 10 live children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. Her children all regarded her as a role model of virtue, particularly the daughters, though Marie herself reportedly was not noted to show much affection toward them, being phlegmatic in her nature.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nThough not regarded as ugly, Marie was seen as plain with not much more than her fresh and healthy complexion in her favor; this faded due to her many pregnancies, but her piety prevented her from consenting to indulge in vanity in order make herself attractive.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In her behavior she was described as incurably shy and timid of her husband; she considered it her duty to show him grateful reverence and was not able to relax enough to entertain him or flirt with him.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Once, for example, she could find no other way to entertain him than to suggest him to kill the flies in the window panes.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Louis XV, who suffered from restlessness and needed to be entertained, eventually became more inclined to listen when Marie was unfavorably compared to other women, and Cardinal Fleury, who wished to prevent Marie from eventually getting any influence over the king, favored the idea of the king taking a mistress as long as she was apolitical.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:Maria Leszczynska c.jpg|thumb|Maria Leszczynska with her son.]]\n\nLouis XV eventually became a notorious womaniser.  In 1733, he entered into his first infidelity, with [[Louise Julie de Mailly]]; until 1737, this relationship was not official, and she was known at court as the ''Fair Unknown''.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> These years, Marie unsuccessfully tried to find out who the mistress was and did display her displeasure over the state of affairs, but the adultery had the support of Cardinal Fleury, because de Mailly was not interested in politics, and after the first years of the king's adultery, Marie became resigned to it.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nAfter the difficult birth of Princess [[Princess Louise of France (1737\u20131787)|Louise]] in 1737, which nearly took her life, Marie was advised by the doctors that another pregnancy may end her life, and from 1738, she refused Louis entrance to her bedroom.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nIn parallel with this, Louise Julie de Mailly was officially recognized as the king's royal mistress and favorite at court, and the relationship between the king and queen discontinued in all but name; though they continued to perform their ceremonial roles side by side, the king paid only purely ceremonial visits to her rooms and no longer participated in her card games, and the court, wary of her loss of the king's affections, only attended to her when court representation required.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nLouise Julie de Mailly was followed by [[Pauline F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Mailly]] (1739), [[Marie Anne de Mailly]] (1742) and [[Diane Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Mailly]] (1742). During the serious illness of Louis XV in Metz in August 1744, when he was believed to be dying, Marie was given his permission to join him, and was cheered by the supporting public along her journey, but when she arrived, he no longer wished to see her.<ref name=\"orr\" /> She and the clergy supported the idea of the king exiling his mistress [[Marie Anne de Mailly]] and her sister and the idea that the king should make a public regret for his adultery, but this did not improve their marriage.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nFinally, [[Madame de Pompadour]] was presented at court in 1745, and was given such an important and influential position at court until her death in 1764, that she somewhat eclipsed the queen. The lovers of Louis were often given positions in the court of Marie, in order for them to have a permanent access and official excuse to remain at court, which placed Marie in a difficult position. She regarded the first official mistress, [[Louise Julie de Mailly]], as the most hurtful because she was the first one, but she disliked [[Marie Anne de Mailly]] on a more personal level because Marie Anne was haughty and insolent.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In contrast to the other official mistresses, Marie had a moderately friendly and cordial relationship to Madame de Pompadour, who always treated the Queen with deference and respect, though Marie did (unsuccessfully) oppose Pompadour's appointment as a lady-in-waiting in 1756.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In contrast, Marie herself seems never to have had extramarital relations. During this time France was a powerful nation and often in conflict with Austria; the Austrian ambassador to France, [[Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau]], was said to have been romantically involved with the Queen, but this seems highly unlikely and was disregarded as court gossip.\n\n==Queen==\n===Political role===\nQueen Marie never managed to develop political influence. After her marriage, her appointed court consisted of a great number of followers of the Duke of Bourbon, among them Madame de Prie herself, the Duchess de B\u00e9thune, and the Marquise de Matignon, who were among her twelve ladies-in-waiting or ''dame du palais''; the Duke's own sister, [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1697\u20131741)]], became her ''Surintendante'' or Mistress of the Robes, and Paris de Verney was appointed as her secretary.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Cardinal de Fleury, who had been Louis's tutor, was appointed her [[Grand Almoner of France|grand almoner]].<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, Queen of France - Louis Tocqu\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|1740 portrait by Louis Tocqu\u00e9]]\n\nMarie had been given advice by her father to always loyally stand by the Duke of Bourbon, to whom she owed her marriage and position, and it was a favor to the Duke that Marie made her first attempt to interfere in politics.<ref name=\"orr\" /> On 17 December 1725, the Duke of Bourbon, Madame de Prie, and Paris de Verney attempted to banish Cardinal de Fleury through a plot.  On their instruction, the queen called on the king to come to her chambers, where the Duke de Bourbon was present.  The doors were locked to ensure secrecy and the duke presented the king with a report from their ambassador in Rome which blamed Fleury for the French failure in a dispute with the Pope.  Bourbon asked the king if they should write a reply, which the King refused without the presence of Fleury.  Meanwhile, Cardinal Fleury learned of the plot to discredit him and left the palace.  The Duke and de Prie planned to use the absence of Fleury to have him confined to an abbey, and gave Marie the task of informing Louis XV that the absent Fleury wished to enter an Abbey and leave his position at court.<ref name=\"orr\" />\nThis led to a crisis, when the king gave Bourbon the choice to either expel Madame de Prie and Paris de Verney or be removed from his post of prime minister.<ref name=\"orr\" /> This incident led to Cardinal Fleury categorizing queen Marie as his opponent, and his decision to oust the ministry of the Duke of Bourbon. Cardinal Fleury warned the king that no woman should be allowed to participate in state affairs, and that listening to women's advises would lead to disaster.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nIn June 1726, Fleury convinced the king to deprive the Duke of Bourbon of his ministry. Madame de Prie immediately enlisted the queen to speak to the king in favor of Bourbon.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She protested but agreed and reportedly spoke passionately about the affair to the king, but she was unable to succeed, as the king reacted very negatively to her attempt to interfere in politics after the preparation from Fleury that women should not be allowed to participate in state affairs.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nThey day following the fall of the Duke de Bourbon's ministry, Louis XV stated to queen Marie that he demanded of her to let herself be directed by Cardinal Fleury in the future with the words: \n:\"I beg, Madame, and, if necessary, I order you to place credence in everything that the former Archbishop of Frejus tells you on my behalf, as though he were I \u2013 Louis\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nMarie's attempt to participate in state affairs during the events of 1726 resulted in a crisis in her relationship with Louis XV, and she sought advice on how to behave from [[Maria Vittoria of Savoy|the Princess of Carignano]], whom unbeknownst to her was a spy in service of Savoy.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The princess' advice was that as Queen of France, it was Marie's duty was not to involve herself in political intrigues and plots, but to act as an example of virtue and piety and a role model of a \"Catholic consort of the [[Most Christian King]]\".<ref name=\"orr\" /> Queen Marie accepted the advice and followed it for the rest of her life, as she was never again involved in any political activity.<ref name=\"orr\" /> After the 1726 crisis and until the birth of a dauphin in 1729, Cardinal Fleury and the [[Maria Vittoria of Savoy|Princess of Carignano]] made long running preparations to replace Marie, preferably with [[Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg|Charlotte of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg]], if she should die in childbirth.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, reine de France (original copy) by Jean-Marc Nattier.png|thumb|right|Queen Marie in 1748]]\n\nMarie reconciled with Cardinal Fleury, whom she kept contact with through letters and humbly entrusted to advise her how to behave in order to please the king.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Fleury and Marie developed a cordial relationship, and he often granted her his support when he estimated that her request to the king was harmless; such as in 1742, when the Cardinal, on her request, persuaded the king to allow her to appoint her personal friend [[Amable-Gabrielle de Villars]] as ''[[Dame d'atour]]s''.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Her political activity after 1726 was limited to asking Louis XV to grant a pension or a promotion to a friend, and she often used Cardinal Fleury as a mediator to achieve this.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\nDespite her lack of influence, she did have political views, and also some indirect political importance.  During the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733\u20131736, she supported her father's candidacy to the Polish throne, and upon her father's demand,<ref name=\"orr\" /> she did her best to encourage Cardinal Fleury to support her father's candidacy, though she herself expressed to the Cardinal that she had never wished for the war and that she was an innocent cause of it because the French wished to enhance her dynastic status.<ref name=\"orr\" /> After the war, her father was given the Duchy of Lorraine because he was the father-in-law of the king of France, and the Duchy became part of France after the death of her father who became Duke of Lorraine, thus making herself indirectly useful in the political arena.  As a devout Catholic, queen Marie gave her passive support to the so-called [[D\u00e9vots]] party at court, supported the bishops in their conflicts with the [[Parliament of Paris]], and expressed sympathy for the Jesuit order in their conflict with the crown.<ref name=\"orr\" /> It was also a fact, that if the king should die before his son was an adult, then she would in accordance with custom have become regent of France until his 13th birthday, which made Marie a potential regent from the birth of the dauphin until his 13th-birthday,<ref name=\"orr\" /> a fact which would have been well known at court.\n\n===Role as queen===\n\nQueen Marie was initially not respected by the royal court, where she was regarded as low-born.  Her lack of dynastic status and lack of connections left her without a political power base, and she did not manage to acquire any personal or political influence.  She was not credited with any personal significance and not given much personal attention outside of her ceremonial role as queen.\n\nAs queen, Marie Leszczy\u0144ska performed her ceremonial role in strict accordance with formal court etiquette and regularly and punctually fulfilled all representational duties that the court life at Versailles demanded of her.  She valued the ritualized pomp and court presentations in order to increase her dignity and win the respect of the court nobility, which was necessary because she had no prestigious dynastic connections of birth and was thus initially seen as low born by them:<ref name=\"orr\" /> her successor as queen, Marie Antoinette, was to ignore many of these rules, and once pointed out, that in contrast to her predecessor queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, it was not necessary for her to enhance her status and dignity, since her dynastic status was evident by birth, and that she could therefore afford to relax etiquette without losing respect.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\nMarie was given an allowance of 100.000 [[French livres|livres]] for pleasure, charity and gambling, a sum which was in reality often irregularly paid and also insufficient, as she was often in debt.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Though she had simple habits - her apartments at Versailles were not redecorated after 1737 - her favorite game, ''[[Biribi|cavagnole]]'', often placed her in debt, and the King was normally unwilling to pay these off for her.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\nShe accepted that her courtiers were appointed because of rank rather than personal preference, and conversed politely with those who were in attendance.<ref name=\"orr\" /> However, though she was careful to always fulfill her representational role, she never participated in court life outside of what was necessary to fulfill her ceremonial duties, and when they were done she preferred to retire to her private apartments with an intimate circle of friends.  Among her own private friends were her ''grand almoner'' Cardinal de Luynes, Duke [[Charles Philippe d'Albert de Luynes]] and her '' [[Premi\u00e8re dame d'honneur|Dame d'honneur]]'' [[Marie Br\u00fblart]].  Her other favorite lady in waiting was her ''[[Dame d'atour]]'', [[Fran\u00e7oise de Mazarin]], who supported Marie during the affair between her cousin, [[Louise Julie de Mailly]], and the king.  Marie's private circle of friends was completed with the addition of [[Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9nault|President H\u00e9nault]] (her ''Surintendant'' since 1753) and [[Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|Comte d'Argenson]], whom she had asked not to address her with her title and with whom she also consulted when she wished to have a pension or a promotion given to a proteg\u00e9.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Like her mother, Marie maintained a political correspondence with [[Margareta Gyllenstierna]], the spouse of [[Arvid Horn]], after she had made her acquaintance during her stay in Sweden.<ref>Norrhem, Svante (2007). Kvinnor vid maktens sida : 1632-1772. (Women alongside power: 1632-1772) Lund: Nordic Academic Press. Libris 10428618. {{ISBN|978-91-89116-91-7}} (Swedish)</ref>\n\nQueen Marie eventually did manage to win the respect of the court nobility by her strict adherence to court etiquette, which made her opinion at least formally important.  In 1747, [[Voltaire]] was banished from the royal court through her influence.  The reason were two incidents, both of which insulted the queen: During one long night of gambling, Voltaire's lover, [[Emilie du Chatelet]], lost a fortune at the queen's gambling table, during which Voltaire whispered to her in English that she had been cheated.  This was regarded as an insult to the queen, because it denounced her guests as cheats; Voltaire could have been arrested for his ill-timed remark.<ref>David Bodanis: Passionate Minds: Emilie du Chatelet, Voltaire, and the Great Love Affair of the Enlightenment (2007)</ref> Shortly afterward, Voltaire wrote a poem in honor of his patron, the royal mistress [[Madame de Pompadour]], in which he alluded to the sexual relationship between Pompadour and the king.  This insulted the queen and led to the banishment of Voltaire from court.<ref>Alexander J. Nemeth: Voltaire's Tormented Soul. A Psychobiographic Inquiry (2010)</ref>\n\n[[File:La reine Marie Leszczynska en costume de religieuse devant la Maison Royale de Saint-Cyr par Santerre.jpg|thumb|Marie Leszczynska dressed as a nun.]]\n\nWhen her first daughter-in-law died in 1746, the queen, very fond and loving of her only son, opposed the selection of his next spouse, the [[Duchess Marie-Jos\u00e8phe of Saxony]], because she was the daughter of her father's rival, Frederick Augustus Wettin of Saxony, King [[August III of Poland]].  Her dislike of the match was known but ignored, as she had no dynastic connections.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Initially, this issue caused some friction between the queen and her new daughter-in-law.  However, the friction was soon overcome, reportedly because Marie-Jos\u00e8phe was an admirer of the Queen's father. In honour of him, several of the queen's grandsons received the name Stanislaus (or Stanislas in French) at their christening.\n\nMarie played some part as a cultural patron.  Marie was the benefactor of the painter [[Jean-Marc Nattier]], whom she commissioned in 1748 to paint the last portrait she ever sat for, an unusual one as it was informal.  It was a success, was printed and sold in prints. It was also her favorite portrait, which she had reproduced to give to friends.  She was a great lover of music and painting and the promoter of many artists. She met the [[castrato]] [[Farinelli]] in 1737, and the young [[Mozart]] in 1764, whom she found very charming.  During his visit to Versailles, she acted as an interpreter for her spouse and family who did not understand German. Her major contribution to life at Versailles was the weekly Polish choral concerts.\n\nQueen Marie maintained the role and reputation of a simple and dignified Catholic queen.  She functioned as an example of Catholic piety and was famed for her generosity to the poor and needy through her philanthropy, which made her very popular among the public her entire life as queen.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n==Death==\nMarie Leszczy\u0144ska died on 24 June 1768 at the age of 65. She enjoyed great popularity among the public, and her death deprived the French monarchy of one of its then greatest propaganda assets. She was buried at the [[Basilica of St Denis]], and her heart was entombed at the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (Lorraine).\n\n==Issue==\n*[[Louise Elisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]] (14 August 1727 &ndash; 6 December 1759), Duchess of Parma, had issue\n*[[Henriette of France (1727\u20131752)|Anne Henriette]] (14 August 1727 &ndash; 10 February 1752)\n*[[Marie Louise of France (1728\u20131733)|Marie Louise]] (28 July 1728 &ndash; 19 February 1733)\n*[[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]] (4 September 1729 &ndash; 20 December 1765), married to [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]] and had issue, then married to [[Duchess Marie-Jos\u00e8phe of Saxony]] and had issue\n*[[Philippe, Duke of Anjou]] (30 August 1730 &ndash; 17 April 1733)\n*[[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France (1732\u20131800)|Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]] (23 March 1732 &ndash; 27 February 1800)\n*[[Victoire of France (1733\u20131799)|Victoire Louise Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]] (11 May 1733 &ndash; 7 June 1799)\n*[[Sophie of France (1734\u20131782)|Sophie Philippine \u00c9lisabeth Justine]] (27 July 1734 &ndash; 3 March 1782)\n*[[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France (1736\u20131744)|Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se F\u00e9licit\u00e9]] (16 May 1736 &ndash; 28 September 1744)\n*[[Louise of France (1737\u20131787)|Louise Marie]] (15 July 1737 &ndash; 23 December 1787)\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|last=\u017bychli\u0144ski|first=Teodor|title=Z\u0142ota ksi\u0119ga szlachty polski\u00e9j: Rocznik IVty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zihbCxb9xpQC&pg=PT1|accessdate=1 August 2018|year=1882|publisher=Jaros\u0142aw Leitgeber|language=pl|page=1}}</ref>\n|title=Ancestors of Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

Ironically, the hopeless political career of king Stanislaus was eventually the reason why his daughter Maria was chosen as the bride of King [[Louis XV of France]]. Devoid of political connections, his daughter was viewed by the French as being free from the burden of international alliances.\n\nShe was born in [[Trzebnica]] ({{lang-de|Trebnitz}}) in [[Lower Silesia]], the year before her father was made king of Poland by [[Charles XII of Sweden]], who had invaded the country in 1704. In 1709, her father was deposed when the Swedish army lost the military upper hand in Poland, and the family was granted refuge by Charles XII in the Swedish city of [[Kristianstad]] in [[Scania]].<ref name=\"lundh\">Lundh-Eriksson, Nanna: Hedvig Eleonora. Wahlstr\u00f6m & Widstrand (1947)</ref> During the escape, Marie was separated from the rest of her family; she was later found with her nurse hiding in a crib in a stable, although another version claims it was actually a cave in an old mineshaft.<ref name=\"lundh\" /> In Sweden, the family was welcomed by the queen dowager [[Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp]] and became popular members of society life on the estates of the nobility around Kristianstad. In 1712, they made an official visit to [[Medevi]], the spa of the Queen Dowager.<ref name=\"lundh\" /> During this period in her life, Marie began speaking [[Swedish language|Swedish]], with a [[Scania]]n accent. As Queen of France, she was known to welcome Swedish ambassadors to France with the phrase \"Welcome, Dearest Heart!\" in Swedish.\n\nIn 1714, Charles XII gave them permission to live in his fiefdom of [[Zweibr\u00fccken]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], where they were supported by the income of Zweibr\u00fccken: they lived there until the death of Charles XII in 1718.<ref name=\"lundh\" /> Zweibr\u00fccken then passed to a cousin of his.  These lands were parallel to the confiscated Polish properties of Stanislaus. Stanislaus appealed to the Regent of France, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, and the Duke of Lorraine for help, with the Queen of Sweden acting as his mediator.<ref name=\"orr\">Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660-1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004)</ref>\n\nIn 1718, with the support of the Duke of Lorraine, the family was allowed to settle in [[Wissembourg]] in the province of [[Alsace]], which had been annexed by France, a place suggested by [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], a nephew of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[R\u00e9gence|Regent of the Kingdom of France]] during [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s minority. The family lived a modest life in a large town house at the expense of the French Regent.\n\nTheir lifestyle in Wissembourg was regarded as very below standard for a royal at that time; they lived in a small house, and could not pay the salary of their small retinue from which a few \"served as an apology for a guard of honour\", and the jewels of the former queen Catherine were reportedly held as security by a moneylender.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\">{{cite book |last=Latour |first=Louis Therese |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.66391/ |title=Princesses Ladies and Salonni\u00e8res of the Reign of Louis XV |year=1927 |translator-first=Ivy E. |translator-last=Clegg |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.}}</ref>\n\nWhile her mother and grandmother [[Anna Leszczy\u0144ska (1660\u20131727)]] reportedly suffered from a certain degree of bitterness over their exile and loss of position which worsened their relationship with Stanislaus, whom they occasionally blamed for their exile, Marie, on contrast, was close to her father and spent a lot of time conversing with him, though she was evidently of a more rational nature: evidently, Marie \"possessed the gift of suffering in silence and of never wearying others with her troubles\", and was said to have developed \"a profound and intense piety\" which gave \"to her youthful mind the maturity of a woman who no longer demands happiness\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n==Marriage==\n\n===Early negotiations===\n\nMarie was not described as a beauty; instead her characteristics in the marriage market were stated as those of being pleasant, well-educated, and graceful in manner and movement.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In 1720, she was suggested as a bride to [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis Henri de Bourbon]], [[Princes of Cond\u00e9|Prince of Cond\u00e9]], (who preferred being and was known as the Duke of Bourbon, rather than Prince of Cond\u00e9) but her intended mother-in-law refused to give her consent.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The cavalry regiment provided by the Regent for the protection of the family included the officer Marquis de Courtanvaux, who fell in love with Marie and asked the Regent to be created a duke in order to ask for her hand; but when the Regent refused, the marriage became impossible because of his lack of rank.<ref name=\"orr\" /> [[Louis George, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] as well as the third Prince of Baden were suggested, but these negotiations fell through because of her insufficient dowry. Stanislaus unsuccessfully tried to arrange a marriage for her with the Count of Charolais, brother of the Duke of Bourbon.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In 1724, she was suggested by Count d'Argensson as a bride for the new Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, but her intended mother-in-law wished for a dynastic match with political advantage.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n[[File:Jeton de la reine Marie Leszczynska.jpg|thumb|Marie Leszczynska on coin.]]\n[[File:Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, by Jean-Baptiste van Loo.jpg|thumb|Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, by Jean-Baptiste van Loo]]\n[[File:Marie_Leczsinska.png|thumb|Coat of Arms of Marie as Queen of France]]\n\nIn 1723, the Duke of Bourbon had become the Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. The Regent was highly dominated by his lover, Madame de Prie. There were long-ongoing negotiations of a marriage between Marie and the now widowed Duke of Bourbon: Madame de Prie favored the match, as she did not perceive the reputedly unattractive Marie as a threat to her.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The marriage negotiations, however, were soon overshadowed when a marriage for King Louis XV was given priority. That same year, the young king fell ill and, fearing the consequences of the unmarried king dying without an heir, the Duc suggested getting the young King married as soon as possible.  Louis XV was already engaged, to [[Infante|Infanta]] [[Mariana Victoria of Spain]], who had been brought to France as his future queen some years earlier and was referred to as the Infanta-Queen.  However the Infanta was still a child, and could not be expected to conceive for several years; while Louis XV, being fifteen, had already hit puberty.<ref name=\"orr\" /> After Louis fell seriously ill, there was a great fear that he would die before he had time to have an heir to the throne.  Should that happen, the throne would pass to the Orl\u00e9ans line. This was an undesirable prospect for the Duke of Bourbon, who himself would in fact have preferred that the throne should pass to the Spanish line rather than to the Orl\u00e9ans line.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The engagement between Louis XV and the Spanish Infanta was broken, and the latter was sent back to Spain, much to the chagrin of the Spanish.  The Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie began negotiations for the immediate marriage of the King to Marie.\n\n===Negotiations for marriage to the king===\n\nMarie was on a list of 99 eligible European princesses to marry the young king. She was not the first choice on the list. She had been placed there initially because she was a Catholic princess and therefore fulfilled the minimum criteria, but was removed early on when the list was reduced from 99 to 17, for being too poor.<ref name=\"orr\" /> However, when the list of 17 (including [[Barbara of Portugal]], [[Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark]], [[Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine]] and [[Enrichetta d'Este]]) was further reduced to four, the preferred choices presented numerous problems.   [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]] and [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]] of Great Britain, who were considered with the understanding that they would convert to the Catholic faith upon marriage, were favored by the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie because it was supported by their political financiers, the firm of Paris Brothers [[Joseph Paris Duverney]].  [[Cardinal Fleury]] easily prevented the British match because of religious reasons.  The last two were the sisters of the Duke of Bourbon, [[Henriette Louise de Bourbon|Henriette-Louise]] and [[\u00c9lisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon|Therese-Alexandrine]], whom the King himself refused to marry because of the disapproval of [[Cardinal Fleury]].<ref name=\"orr\" /> Cardinal Fleury himself favored a match with [[Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg|Princess Charlotte of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg]], which was supported by the grandfather of Louis XV, the King of Savoy, through his spy the [[Princess of Carignan]], [[Maria Vittoria of Savoy]].\n\nIn these complicated disputes over the choice of a royal marriage partner, Marie Leszczy\u0144ska eventually emerged as a choice acceptable to both the party of the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie, as well as the party of Cardinal Fleury, mainly because she was politically uncontroversial and lacked any of the alliances which could harm either party.<ref name=\"orr\" /> At this point, there were already negotiations of marriage between Marie and the Duke of Bourbon. The Duke of d'Argensson had already left a favorable report of her, and the groundwork had been done.  Cardinal Fleury accepted the choice as Marie posed no threat to him because of her lack of connections, while the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie, precisely because she lacked any personal power base, expected her to be indebted to them for her position. Marie was, finally, chosen because she was a healthy adult Catholic princess ready to procreate immediately after the wedding.  Reportedly, Madame de Prie had a flattering portrait painted of Marie, in which she was deliberately made to look like the King's favorite portrait of his mother, and when he was shown it, he was impressed and exclaimed: \"she is the loveliest of them all!\", and became enthusiastic of the match, an episode which attracted some attention.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:MariaLeszczynska02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maria Leszczy\u0144ska in 1730, by [[Alexis Simon Belle]].]]\n\nThe formal proposal was made on 2 April 1725. The announcement of the wedding was not received well at the royal court. Marie's father Stanislaus had been a monarch for only a short time and she was thought to be a poor choice of inferior status not worthy of being queen of France.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The Dowager Duchess of Lorraine, sister of the former Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, was also insulted that her own daughter Elisabeth-Therese had not been chosen. The nobility and the court looked upon the future queen as an upstart intruder, the ministers as a cause to diplomatic trouble with Spain and Russia, whose princesses had been refused in favor of Marie, and the general public was also reportedly initially dissatisfied with the fact that France would gain \"from this marriage neither glory nor honor, riches nor alliances.\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> There were rumors before the wedding that the bride was ugly, epileptic and sterile. The 6 May 1725, Marie was forced to undergo a medical examination, which ruled out epilepsy and also gave reassuring reports about her menstruation and ability to procreate.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In the marriage contract, the same terms were given to her as was previously to the Spanish Infanta, and she was thus guaranteed fifty thousand crowns for rings and jewelry, two hundred and fifty thousand crowns upon her wedding, and the further guarantee of an annual widow allowance of twenty thousand crowns.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n===Private relationship to Louis XV===\n\nThe marriage by proxy took place on 15 August 1725 in the [[Strasbourg Cathedral|Cathedral of Strasbourg]], Louis XV represented by his cousin the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, [[Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|''Louis le Pieux'']]. Upon her marriage, Maria's Polish name was modified into French as ''Marie''. Furthermore, despite her surname being difficult to spell or to pronounce for the French, it was still commonly used by commoners. She was escorted on her way by Mademoiselle de Clermont, seven ladies-in-waiting, two maids-of-honour and numerous equerries and pages in a long train of coaches; however, she was not welcomed by triumphal entries, diplomatic greetings or the other official celebrations, as was normally the custom upon the arrival of a foreign princess upon a royal marriage.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Marie made a good impression upon the public from the beginning, such as when she handed out ''largesse'' on her way to her wedding in [[Fontainebleau]].\n\nLouis and Marie first met on the eve of their wedding, which took place on 5 September 1725, at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]]. Marie was twenty-two years old and Louis fifteen. The young couple was reported to have fallen in love at first sight. The relationship between Marie and Louis was initially described as a happy one, and for the first eight years of the marriage, Louis XV was faithful to her. Louis XV had been very impatient to marry her, was reportedly flattered to have a twenty two-year old wife at his age, and refused to allow any criticism of her appearance.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In August 1727, Marie gave birth to her first children, twins named [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]] and [[Princess Henriette of France|Anne Henriette]], at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The king was reportedly delighted, stating that after it had been said that he could not be a father, he had suddenly become the father of two. Cardinal Fleury, however, was much more displeased, and decided that until the queen had given birth to a son, she would not be allowed to accompany the king on his trips but stay at Versailles.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> A year later, another daughter, [[Princess Louise of France|Marie Louise]] was born, much to the disappointment of the King. The long-awaited [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729\u20131765)|Louis]], was born on 4 September 1729 to the immense relief of the country, whose royal family had a history of failing to establish a secure male line of succession. In all, Marie had 10 live children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. Her children all regarded her as a role model of virtue, particularly the daughters, though Marie herself reportedly was not noted to show much affection toward them, being phlegmatic in her nature.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nThough not regarded as ugly, Marie was seen as plain with not much more than her fresh and healthy complexion in her favor; this faded due to her many pregnancies, but her piety prevented her from consenting to indulge in vanity in order make herself attractive.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In her behavior she was described as incurably shy and timid of her husband; she considered it her duty to show him grateful reverence and was not able to relax enough to entertain him or flirt with him.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Once, for example, she could find no other way to entertain him than to suggest him to kill the flies in the window panes.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Louis XV, who suffered from restlessness and needed to be entertained, eventually became more inclined to listen when Marie was unfavorably compared to other women, and Cardinal Fleury, who wished to prevent Marie from eventually getting any influence over the king, favored the idea of the king taking a mistress as long as she was apolitical.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:Maria Leszczynska c.jpg|thumb|Maria Leszczynska with her son.]]\n\nLouis XV eventually became a notorious womaniser.  In 1733, he entered into his first infidelity, with [[Louise Julie de Mailly]]; until 1737, this relationship was not official, and she was known at court as the ''Fair Unknown''.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> These years, Marie unsuccessfully tried to find out who the mistress was and did display her displeasure over the state of affairs, but the adultery had the support of Cardinal Fleury, because de Mailly was not interested in politics, and after the first years of the king's adultery, Marie became resigned to it.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nAfter the difficult birth of Princess [[Princess Louise of France (1737\u20131787)|Louise]] in 1737, which nearly took her life, Marie was advised by the doctors that another pregnancy may end her life, and from 1738, she refused Louis entrance to her bedroom.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nIn parallel with this, Louise Julie de Mailly was officially recognized as the king's royal mistress and favorite at court, and the relationship between the king and queen discontinued in all but name; though they continued to perform their ceremonial roles side by side, the king paid only purely ceremonial visits to her rooms and no longer participated in her card games, and the court, wary of her loss of the king's affections, only attended to her when court representation required.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nLouise Julie de Mailly was followed by [[Pauline F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Mailly]] (1739), [[Marie Anne de Mailly]] (1742) and [[Diane Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Mailly]] (1742). During the serious illness of Louis XV in Metz in August 1744, when he was believed to be dying, Marie was given his permission to join him, and was cheered by the supporting public along her journey, but when she arrived, he no longer wished to see her.<ref name=\"orr\" /> She and the clergy supported the idea of the king exiling his mistress [[Marie Anne de Mailly]] and her sister and the idea that the king should make a public regret for his adultery, but this did not improve their marriage.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nFinally, [[Madame de Pompadour]] was presented at court in 1745, and was given such an important and influential position at court until her death in 1764, that she somewhat eclipsed the queen. The lovers of Louis were often given positions in the court of Marie, in order for them to have a permanent access and official excuse to remain at court, which placed Marie in a difficult position. She regarded the first official mistress, [[Louise Julie de Mailly]], as the most hurtful because she was the first one, but she disliked [[Marie Anne de Mailly]] on a more personal level because Marie Anne was haughty and insolent.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In contrast to the other official mistresses, Marie had a moderately friendly and cordial relationship to Madame de Pompadour, who always treated the Queen with deference and respect, though Marie did (unsuccessfully) oppose Pompadour's appointment as a lady-in-waiting in 1756.<ref name=\"orr\" /> In contrast, Marie herself seems never to have had extramarital relations. During this time France was a powerful nation and often in conflict with Austria; the Austrian ambassador to France, [[Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau]], was said to have been romantically involved with the Queen, but this seems highly unlikely and was disregarded as court gossip.\n\n==Queen==\n===Political role===\nQueen Marie never managed to develop political influence. After her marriage, her appointed court consisted of a great number of followers of the Duke of Bourbon, among them Madame de Prie herself, the Duchess de B\u00e9thune, and the Marquise de Matignon, who were among her twelve ladies-in-waiting or ''dame du palais''; the Duke's own sister, [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1697\u20131741)]], became her ''Surintendante'' or Mistress of the Robes, and Paris de Verney was appointed as her secretary.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Cardinal de Fleury, who had been Louis's tutor, was appointed her [[Grand Almoner of France|grand almoner]].<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, Queen of France - Louis Tocqu\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|1740 portrait by Louis Tocqu\u00e9]]\n\nMarie had been given advice by her father to always loyally stand by the Duke of Bourbon, to whom she owed her marriage and position, and it was a favor to the Duke that Marie made her first attempt to interfere in politics.<ref name=\"orr\" /> On 17 December 1725, the Duke of Bourbon, Madame de Prie, and Paris de Verney attempted to banish Cardinal de Fleury through a plot.  On their instruction, the queen called on the king to come to her chambers, where the Duke de Bourbon was present.  The doors were locked to ensure secrecy and the duke presented the king with a report from their ambassador in Rome which blamed Fleury for the French failure in a dispute with the Pope.  Bourbon asked the king if they should write a reply, which the King refused without the presence of Fleury.  Meanwhile, Cardinal Fleury learned of the plot to discredit him and left the palace.  The Duke and de Prie planned to use the absence of Fleury to have him confined to an abbey, and gave Marie the task of informing Louis XV that the absent Fleury wished to enter an Abbey and leave his position at court.<ref name=\"orr\" />\nThis led to a crisis, when the king gave Bourbon the choice to either expel Madame de Prie and Paris de Verney or be removed from his post of prime minister.<ref name=\"orr\" /> This incident led to Cardinal Fleury categorizing queen Marie as his opponent, and his decision to oust the ministry of the Duke of Bourbon. Cardinal Fleury warned the king that no woman should be allowed to participate in state affairs, and that listening to women's advises would lead to disaster.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nIn June 1726, Fleury convinced the king to deprive the Duke of Bourbon of his ministry. Madame de Prie immediately enlisted the queen to speak to the king in favor of Bourbon.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She protested but agreed and reportedly spoke passionately about the affair to the king, but she was unable to succeed, as the king reacted very negatively to her attempt to interfere in politics after the preparation from Fleury that women should not be allowed to participate in state affairs.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nThey day following the fall of the Duke de Bourbon's ministry, Louis XV stated to queen Marie that he demanded of her to let herself be directed by Cardinal Fleury in the future with the words: \n:\"I beg, Madame, and, if necessary, I order you to place credence in everything that the former Archbishop of Frejus tells you on my behalf, as though he were I \u2013 Louis\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nMarie's attempt to participate in state affairs during the events of 1726 resulted in a crisis in her relationship with Louis XV, and she sought advice on how to behave from [[Maria Vittoria of Savoy|the Princess of Carignano]], whom unbeknownst to her was a spy in service of Savoy.<ref name=\"orr\" /> The princess' advice was that as Queen of France, it was Marie's duty was not to involve herself in political intrigues and plots, but to act as an example of virtue and piety and a role model of a \"Catholic consort of the [[Most Christian King]]\".<ref name=\"orr\" /> Queen Marie accepted the advice and followed it for the rest of her life, as she was never again involved in any political activity.<ref name=\"orr\" /> After the 1726 crisis and until the birth of a dauphin in 1729, Cardinal Fleury and the [[Maria Vittoria of Savoy|Princess of Carignano]] made long running preparations to replace Marie, preferably with [[Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg|Charlotte of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg]], if she should die in childbirth.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, reine de France (original copy) by Jean-Marc Nattier.png|thumb|right|Queen Marie in 1748]]\n\nMarie reconciled with Cardinal Fleury, whom she kept contact with through letters and humbly entrusted to advise her how to behave in order to please the king.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Fleury and Marie developed a cordial relationship, and he often granted her his support when he estimated that her request to the king was harmless; such as in 1742, when the Cardinal, on her request, persuaded the king to allow her to appoint her personal friend [[Amable-Gabrielle de Villars]] as ''[[Dame d'atour]]s''.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Her political activity after 1726 was limited to asking Louis XV to grant a pension or a promotion to a friend, and she often used Cardinal Fleury as a mediator to achieve this.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\nDespite her lack of influence, she did have political views, and also some indirect political importance.  During the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733\u20131736, she supported her father's candidacy to the Polish throne, and upon her father's demand,<ref name=\"orr\" /> she did her best to encourage Cardinal Fleury to support her father's candidacy, though she herself expressed to the Cardinal that she had never wished for the war and that she was an innocent cause of it because the French wished to enhance her dynastic status.<ref name=\"orr\" /> After the war, her father was given the Duchy of Lorraine because he was the father-in-law of the king of France, and the Duchy became part of France after the death of her father who became Duke of Lorraine, thus making herself indirectly useful in the political arena.  As a devout Catholic, queen Marie gave her passive support to the so-called [[D\u00e9vots]] party at court, supported the bishops in their conflicts with the [[Parliament of Paris]], and expressed sympathy for the Jesuit order in their conflict with the crown.<ref name=\"orr\" /> It was also a fact, that if the king should die before his son was an adult, then she would in accordance with custom have become regent of France until his 13th birthday, which made Marie a potential regent from the birth of the dauphin until his 13th-birthday,<ref name=\"orr\" /> a fact which would have been well known at court.\n\n===Role as queen===\n\nQueen Marie was initially not respected by the royal court, where she was regarded as low-born.  Her lack of dynastic status and lack of connections left her without a political power base, and she did not manage to acquire any personal or political influence.  She was not credited with any personal significance and not given much personal attention outside of her ceremonial role as queen.\n\nAs queen, Marie Leszczy\u0144ska performed her ceremonial role in strict accordance with formal court etiquette and regularly and punctually fulfilled all representational duties that the court life at Versailles demanded of her.  She valued the ritualized pomp and court presentations in order to increase her dignity and win the respect of the court nobility, which was necessary because she had no prestigious dynastic connections of birth and was thus initially seen as low born by them:<ref name=\"orr\" /> her successor as queen, Marie Antoinette, was to ignore many of these rules, and once pointed out, that in contrast to her predecessor queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, it was not necessary for her to enhance her status and dignity, since her dynastic status was evident by birth, and that she could therefore afford to relax etiquette without losing respect.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\nMarie was given an allowance of 100.000 [[French livres|livres]] for pleasure, charity and gambling, a sum which was in reality often irregularly paid and also insufficient, as she was often in debt.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Though she had simple habits - her apartments at Versailles were not redecorated after 1737 - her favorite game, ''[[Biribi|cavagnole]]'', often placed her in debt, and the King was normally unwilling to pay these off for her.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\nShe accepted that her courtiers were appointed because of rank rather than personal preference, and conversed politely with those who were in attendance.<ref name=\"orr\" /> However, though she was careful to always fulfill her representational role, she never participated in court life outside of what was necessary to fulfill her ceremonial duties, and when they were done she preferred to retire to her private apartments with an intimate circle of friends.  Among her own private friends were her ''grand almoner'' Cardinal de Luynes, Duke [[Charles Philippe d'Albert de Luynes]] and her '' [[Premi\u00e8re dame d'honneur|Dame d'honneur]]'' [[Marie Br\u00fblart]].  Her other favorite lady in waiting was her ''[[Dame d'atour]]'', [[Fran\u00e7oise de Mazarin]], who supported Marie during the affair between her cousin, [[Louise Julie de Mailly]], and the king.  Marie's private circle of friends was completed with the addition of [[Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9nault|President H\u00e9nault]] (her ''Surintendant'' since 1753) and [[Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|Comte d'Argenson]], whom she had asked not to address her with her title and with whom she also consulted when she wished to have a pension or a promotion given to a proteg\u00e9.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Like her mother, Marie maintained a political correspondence with [[Margareta Gyllenstierna]], the spouse of [[Arvid Horn]], after she had made her acquaintance during her stay in Sweden.<ref>Norrhem, Svante (2007).

In 1747, [[Voltaire]] was banished from the royal court through her influence.  The reason were two incidents, both of which insulted the queen: During one long night of gambling, Voltaire's lover, [[Emilie du Chatelet]], lost a fortune at the queen's gambling table, during which Voltaire whispered to her in English that she had been cheated.  This was regarded as an insult to the queen, because it denounced her guests as cheats; Voltaire could have been arrested for his ill-timed remark.<ref>David Bodanis: Passionate Minds: Emilie du Chatelet, Voltaire, and the Great Love Affair of the Enlightenment (2007)</ref> Shortly afterward, Voltaire wrote a poem in honor of his patron, the royal mistress [[Madame de Pompadour]], in which he alluded to the sexual relationship between Pompadour and the king.  This insulted the queen and led to the banishment of Voltaire from court.<ref>Alexander J. Nemeth: Voltaire's Tormented Soul. A Psychobiographic Inquiry (2010)</ref>\n\n[[File:La reine Marie Leszczynska en costume de religieuse devant la Maison Royale de Saint-Cyr par Santerre.jpg|thumb|Marie Leszczynska dressed as a nun.]]\n\nWhen her first daughter-in-law died in 1746, the queen, very fond and loving of her only son, opposed the selection of his next spouse, the [[Duchess Marie-Jos\u00e8phe of Saxony]], because she was the daughter of her father's rival, Frederick Augustus Wettin of Saxony, King [[August III of Poland]].  Her dislike of the match was known but ignored, as she had no dynastic connections.<ref name=\"orr\" /> Initially, this issue caused some friction between the queen and her new daughter-in-law.  However, the friction was soon overcome, reportedly because Marie-Jos\u00e8phe was an admirer of the Queen's father. In honour of him, several of the queen's grandsons received the name Stanislaus (or Stanislas in French) at their christening.\n\nMarie played some part as a cultural patron.  Marie was the benefactor of the painter [[Jean-Marc Nattier]], whom she commissioned in 1748 to paint the last portrait she ever sat for, an unusual one as it was informal.  It was a success, was printed and sold in prints. It was also her favorite portrait, which she had reproduced to give to friends.  She was a great lover of music and painting and the promoter of many artists. She met the [[castrato]] [[Farinelli]] in 1737, and the young [[Mozart]] in 1764, whom she found very charming.  During his visit to Versailles, she acted as an interpreter for her spouse and family who did not understand German. Her major contribution to life at Versailles was the weekly Polish choral concerts.\n\nQueen Marie maintained the role and reputation of a simple and dignified Catholic queen.  She functioned as an example of Catholic piety and was famed for her generosity to the poor and needy through her philanthropy, which made her very popular among the public her entire life as queen.<ref name=\"orr\" />\n\n==Death==\nMarie Leszczy\u0144ska died on 24 June 1768 at the age of 65. She enjoyed great popularity among the public, and her death deprived the French monarchy of one of its then greatest propaganda assets. She was buried at the [[Basilica of St Denis]], and her heart was entombed at the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (Lorraine).\n\n==Issue==\n*[[Louise Elisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]] (14 August 1727 &ndash; 6 December 1759), Duchess of Parma, had issue\n*[[Henriette of France (1727\u20131752)|Anne Henriette]] (14 August 1727 &ndash; 10 February 1752)\n*[[Marie Louise of France (1728\u20131733)|Marie Louise]] (28 July 1728 &ndash; 19 February 1733)\n*[[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]] (4 September 1729 &ndash; 20 December 1765), married to [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]] and had issue, then married to [[Duchess Marie-Jos\u00e8phe of Saxony]] and had issue\n*[[Philippe, Duke of Anjou]] (30 August 1730 &ndash; 17 April 1733)\n*[[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France (1732\u20131800)|Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]] (23 March 1732 &ndash; 27 February 1800)\n*[[Victoire of France (1733\u20131799)|Victoire Louise Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]] (11 May 1733 &ndash; 7 June 1799)\n*[[Sophie of France (1734\u20131782)|Sophie Philippine \u00c9lisabeth Justine]] (27 July 1734 &ndash; 3 March 1782)\n*[[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France (1736\u20131744)|Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se F\u00e9licit\u00e9]] (16 May 1736 &ndash; 28 September 1744)\n*[[Louise of France (1737\u20131787)|Louise Marie]] (15 July 1737 &ndash; 23 December 1787)\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|last=\u017bychli\u0144ski|first=Teodor|title=Z\u0142ota ksi\u0119ga szlachty polski\u00e9j: Rocznik IVty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zihbCxb9xpQC&pg=PT1|accessdate=1 August 2018|year=1882|publisher=Jaros\u0142aw Leitgeber|language=pl|page=1}}</ref>\n|title=Ancestors of Marie Leszczy\u0144ska\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

The cartridges are shaped differently for different regions; North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/snesfaq.txt|archive-url= https://archive.is/20070518023014/http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/snesfaq.txt|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2007-05-18|title=Super Nintendo/Famicom F.A.Q.|accessdate=2007-04-14|author= Lou Cassaniti |publisher=Gamers Graveyard|date=1999-03-03}}</ref> Internally, a regional lockout chip within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console, although hardware in later games can detect this situation.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the Super NES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= 2007-04-14 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=1997-12-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=2003-01-21}}</ref>\n\nOf the console's '''{{#expr:{{table row counter|id=softwarelist|ignore=2}}}}''' official releases, 717 were released in North America plus 4 championship cartridges, 521 in Europe, 1,448 in Japan, 231 on [[Satellaview]], and 13 on [[Sufami Turbo]]. 294 releases are common to all regions, 148 were released in Japan and the US only, 165 in Europe and the US, and 28 in Japan and Europe.

The cartridges are shaped differently for different regions; North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/snesfaq.txt|archive-url= https://archive.is/20070518023014/http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/snesfaq.txt|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2007-05-18|title=Super Nintendo/Famicom F.A.Q.|accessdate=2007-04-14|author= Lou Cassaniti |publisher=Gamers Graveyard|date=1999-03-03}}</ref> Internally, a regional lockout chip within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console, although hardware in later games can detect this situation.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the Super NES/Super Famicom \"Lockout Chip\"|accessdate= 2007-04-14 |author=Mark Knibbs|date=1997-12-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121165526/http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |archivedate=2003-01-21}}</ref>\n\nOf the console's '''{{#expr:{{table row counter|id=softwarelist|ignore=2}}}}''' official releases, 717 were released in North America plus 4 championship cartridges, 521 in Europe, 1,448 in Japan, 231 on [[Satellaview]], and 13 on [[Sufami Turbo]]. 294 releases are common to all regions, 148 were released in Japan and the US only, 165 in Europe and the US, and 28 in Japan and Europe.

{"title_page": "Free indirect speech", "text_new": "'''Free indirect speech''' is a style of [[Third-person narrative|third-person narration]] which uses some of the characteristics of third-person along with the essence of [[Grammatical person|first-person]] direct speech; it is also referred to as '''free indirect discourse''', '''free indirect style''', or, in [[French language|French]], '''''discours indirect libre'''''.\n\nFree indirect discourse can be described as a \"technique of presenting a character's voice partly mediated by the voice of the author\" (or, reversing the emphasis, \"that the character speaks through the voice of the narrator\") with the voices effectively merged.<ref name=Modernist/>  This effect is partially accomplished by eliding direct speech attributions, such as \"he said\" or \"she said\". \n\nThe following is an example of sentences using direct, indirect and free indirect speech:\n* '''Quoted''' or '''[[direct speech]]''': ''He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. \"And just what pleasure have I found, since I came into this world?\" he asked.''\n* '''Reported''' or normal '''[[indirect speech]]''': ''He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. He asked himself what pleasure he had found since he came into the world.''\n* '''Free indirect speech''': ''He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. And just what pleasure had he found, since he came into this world?''\n\nAccording to British philologist Roy Pascal, [[Goethe]] and [[Jane Austen]] were the first novelists to use this style consistently<ref name=Pascal77/> and 19th-century French novelist [[Flaubert]] was the first to be aware of it as a style.\n\n== Naming ==\nRandall Stevenson suggests that the term free indirect discourse \"is perhaps best reserved for instances where words have actually been spoken aloud\" and that cases \"where a character's voice is probably the silent inward one of thought\" should be described as free indirect style.<ref>''Modernistic Fiction: An Introduction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p.12.</ref>\n\n==Comparison of styles ==\nWhat distinguishes free indirect speech from normal indirect speech is the lack of an introductory expression such as \"he said\" or \"he thought\". It is as if the [[subordinate clause]] carrying the content of the indirect speech were taken out of the [[main clause]] which contains it, becoming the [[main clause]] itself. Using free indirect speech may convey the character's words more directly than in normal indirect, as devices such as interjections and psycho-ostensive expressions like curses and swearwords can be used that cannot be normally used within a subordinate clause. Deictic pronouns and adverbials refer to the coordinates of the originator of the speech or thought, not of the narrator.\n\nFree indirect discourse can also be described as a \"technique of presenting a character's voice partly mediated by the voice of the author\", or, in the words of the French narrative theorist [[G\u00e9rard Genette]], \"the narrator takes on the speech of the character, or, if one prefers, the character speaks through the voice of the narrator, and the two instances then are ''merged''\".<ref name=Modernist>Randell Stevenson, ''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction'', p.32.</ref>\n\n==Use in literature==\nRoy Pascal cites [[Goethe]] and [[Jane Austen]] as the first novelists to use this style consistently.<ref name=Pascal77>Roy Pascal, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBgNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA31&dq=free+indirect+speech&hl=en&ei=gEshTaTwDo-WsgPlv8WOCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false The Dual Voice]\", Manchester University Press, 1977, page 34</ref>\nHe says the nineteenth century French novelist [[Flaubert]] was the first to be aware of it as a style.  This style would be widely imitated by later authors, called in [[French language|French]] ''discours indirect libre''. It is also known as ''estilo indirecto libre'' in Spanish, and is often used by Latin American writer [[Horacio Quiroga]].\n\nIn [[German literature]], the style, known as ''erlebte Rede'' (experienced speech), is perhaps most famous in the works of [[Franz Kafka]], blurring the subject's first-person experiences with a grammatically third-person narrative perspective.\n\nIn [[Danish literature]], the style is attested since [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]] (1621\u20131698) (and is, outside literature, even today common in colloquial Danish speech).\n\n===English, Irish and Scottish literature===\nAs stated above, Austen was one of its first practitioners. The Irish author [[James Joyce]] also used free indirect speech in works such as \"The Dead\" (in ''[[Dubliners]]''), ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', and ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. \nScottish author [[James Kelman]] uses the style extensively, most notably in his [[Booker Prize]] winning novel ''[[How Late It Was, How Late]]'', but also in many of his short stories and some of his novels, most of which are written in [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian speech patterns]]. [[Virginia Woolf]] in her novels ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' and ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' frequently relies on free indirect discourse to take us into the minds of her characters. Another [[modernist]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], also makes frequent use of a free indirect style in \"transcribing unspoken or even incompletely verbalized thoughts\". Woolf most often uses free indirect speech, a literary technique that describes the interior thoughts of the characters using third-person singular pronouns ('he' and 'she') in both ''[[The Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Women in Love]]''.<ref>''Modernistic Fiction: An Introduction'', p.32.</ref> According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, [[Elmore Leonard]]'s mastery of free indirect discourse \"is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include [[Jane Austen]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] in the mix.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last = Rzepka| first = Charles|title = ''Being Cool: The Work of Elmore Leonard''|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2013|location= Baltimore| page= [https://archive.org/details/beingcoolworkofe0000rzep/page/21 21]|url=https://archive.org/details/beingcoolworkofe0000rzep|url-access = registration}}</ref>\n\nSome argue that free indirect discourse was also used by [[Chaucer]] in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref>E.g.

Released with the movie ''[[6,000 Enemies]]'' by MGM on June 10, [[1939]], the short is notable for featuring the first appearance of Barney Bear. Ising created the character Barney Bear in the late 1930s for MGM at this time, basing the sleepy-eyed character partially on himself.\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[autumn]] draws to a close, and the first gentle blanket of snow covers the great brown forest, Barney Bear happily prepares for his nice long winter's [[hibernation]]. But water leaks, a loose shutter, a noisy fire, a teakettle left on, and some stray embers all get in the way and keep him up until spring.\n\nAfter Barney puts a \"Do Not Disturb until Spring\" sign on his front door, he locks it and sets his alarm to go off at Spring. When he finally heads to bed, he ties up a leaking root but his [[hot water bottle]] starts leaking as well. Before he is able to cry about it, the leaky root he tied up also bursts, pouring water all over him. Soon afterwards his window bursts open, thanks to the wind, and blows a bunch of snow all over him. Barney finally boards the window up, and tries to go to sleep until the fireplace cracks and makes the kettle whistle. \nBarney pulls it from the fire, and the whine dies down, but when he looks at the kettle, it whines again and shoots him in the face with a puff of steam.\n\nHe turns to set the kettle down, but a pair of coals pop and dance into his pajama bottoms. He returns to bed, and whenever the coals pop inside his pants, he looks back at the fire angrily to try and hush it. He climbs into bed, entirely unaware of the smoke pouring out of his bottom. But, soon enough, he starts to sniff and smell the smoke, and after a good doubletake, he finally understands it is coming from him. However, he is too late, and the coals pop loudly and sharply under his backside, and he is sent flying in a cloud of smoke towards the ceiling, and then back down roughly onto his bed. He runs to find some way to put out the fire as alarms blare on the soundtrack, and finally, he decides to unlock his front door, and then zips to the nearest snowhill and soothes his burnt rear in the calming snow.\n\nAll better now, with the fire put out for good, Barney can only watch helplessly as the wind not only shuts his front door with him on the outside of it, but fate smacks him, too, by allowing the locks to engage themselves on its closure. Barney remembers his window, but does not remember the barricade that he built inside of it, and when he tries to dive through it, his progress is painfully impeded by the wall of furniture and household goods. Barney takes two casual steps back, and after pausing briefly, turns into a whirlwind of fury and smashes clean through the barricade! As the camera strolls through his cave, the destruction is almost total: every piece of anything inside Barney domicile is smashed to bits, and as he stares in numb shock at the camera, a spring from his bed pops up and smacks him in the chin.\n\nBarney crashes through his boarded up window and is still [[insomnia]]c, mainly because of his record player which he destroys in seconds.\n \nAfter tapping his foot and staring at the ticking clock, Barney lies back down and tries counting sheep. His rough, exhausted voice counts out each number as he keeps a deathgrip on his pillow, his reddened eyes droopy and filled with spidery cracks. As he counts, the ticking of the clock grows louder, and the eerie faces of baaing sheep and lambs are superimposed over closeups of clock gears, springs and alarm bells. Barney count reaches the 500's, and then he ends up at \"one million, nine hundred and seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and nine-nine\", and when he is shown in his bed, he is half in and half out of his dream of vast crowds of cute, baaing lambs. He finally falls into snoring, but just as he does, Barney awakens to the clanging of his month alarm, and spies with horror that a little buzzer announcing the arrival of Spring has gone off, as well. He hears the happy chirping of a bluebird outside his home, and he sticks his head out of his window to see its beauty. Shocked, he says simply and wearily, \"Spring...\" but then is hit in the head with more drops of water. He looks up, and discovers it is the melting snow from his roof, as the bluebird chirps us through iris out.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* '''[[Brahms's Lullaby|Lullaby (Cradle Song)]]'''\nWritten by [[Johannes Brahms]]<br />\nPlayed in the [[Film score|score]]\n* '''[[Fr\u00fchlingslied (Mendelssohn)|Fr\u00fchlingslied]] (Spring Song) Op.62 #6''' (1842)\nWritten by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]]<br />\nIn the score for the spring sign<br />\nReprised when spring arrives\n* '''[[My Grandfather's Clock]]'''\nWritten by [[Henry Clay Work]]<br />\nPlayed in the score\n* '''[[Sleep, Baby, Sleep]]'''\nMusic by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]<br />\nPlayed and sung on a record\n* '''[[Sleepy Head]]'''\nMusic by [[Walter Donaldson]]<br>Lyrics by [[Gus Kahn]]<br />\nPlayed in the score\n* '''[[Boola Boola]]'''\nWritten by [[Allan M.
