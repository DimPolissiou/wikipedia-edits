The [[carnival]] has traditions that date back to the 19th century. Four days before Holy Week, Barranquilla decks itself out to receive national and foreign tourists and joins together with the city's inhabitants to enjoy four days of intense festivities. During the carnival, [[Barranquilla]]'s normal activities are paralyzed because the city gets busy with street dances, musical and masquerade parades. Barranquilla's Carnival includes dances such as the Spanish paloteo, African [[Soukous|Congo]], and indigenous mico y micas.  Many styles of [[music of Colombia|Colombian music]] are also performed, most prominently [[cumbia]], and instruments include drums and wind ensembles. \nThe Carnival of Barranquilla was proclaimed a Cultural Masterpiece of the Nation by Colombia's National Congress in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historia y Origen|url=http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/Carnaval|publisher=Fundacion Carnaval de Barranquilla|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\nAlso the [[UNESCO]], in Paris on November 7, 2003, declared it one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]], and it was during Olga Lucia Rodriquez Carnival Queen year.\n\nThe Carnival starts on the Saturday before the [[Ash Wednesday]] with the Battle of the Flowers (La Batalla de Flores), which is considered one of the main activities. Then, The Great Parade (La Gran Parada) on Sunday and Monday is marked by an Orchestra Festival with Caribbean and Latin bands. Tuesday signals the end of the carnival, announced by the burial of Joselito Carnaval, who is mourned by everyone.\n\nThe Barranquilla Carnival has been claimed to be the second largest carnival in the world, surpassed only by [[Rio Carnival|Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2015/02/05/second-biggest-carnaval-after-rio-is-in-barranquilla-colombia-a-terrific-surprise/#796281fa2617</ref>\n\nBarranquilla's Carnival slogan is: Those who live it are those who enjoy it (Quien lo vive, es quien lo goza).\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nVery little is known about exactly how and why this carnival began. There are many theories; the most popular belief is that the carnival is the welcoming of spring and a celebration of birth and renewal. The carnival originates from a combination of pagan ceremonies, catholic beliefs and ethnic diversity and is a mixture of the European, African and Indian traditions, dances and music. It was at first a holiday for slaves, and grew to be a celebration of the region.\n\nLocal beliefs date it back seven centuries and it is known that a great deal of the traditions were brought to America by the Spanish and Portuguese. The first notable date in the Carnival's history is 1888, when a figure known as [[King Momo]] appeared in the documented history of the Carnival. In 1903, the first known battle of the flowers was recorded, apparently to recover a long lost carnival tradition and, fifteen years later, the first Barranquilla's Carnival's queen was chosen to preside over the festivities of the carnival, which was later institutionalised in 1923. In the years that followed the carnival grew and so did the traditions, including the integration of the great parade.\n\n===  Chronology ===\n* 1888: King Momo emerged as one of the main characters.\n* 1899: The first President of the Carnival and the first Board of directors were elected.\n* 1903: The first Battle of Flowers parade ''(Spanish: Batalla de las Flores)'' (due to Heriberto Bengoechea's initiative in order to recover the carnival tradition of the previous years, as well as to celebrate the end of the One Thousand Days War ''( Spanish: [[:es:Guerra de los mil dias|Guerra de los Mil Dias]])''.)\n* 1918:  Alicia Lafaurie Roncallo elected as the first Carnival Queen.\n* 1923: The Carnival was institutionalised, since the queen contest had been cancelled for the 5 previous years.\n* 1967: The Great Parade event was introduced. It now takes place on the second day of the carnival, usually on Sundays.\n* 1969: The Orchestra Festival was created, which is a musical competition ranging over various genres.\n* 1974: The first Guacherna took place due to [[:es:Esther Forero|Esther Forero's]] initiative. The Guacherna is now celebrated on the previous week Friday before the carnival formally starts.\n* 2002: The Carnival was declared as a National Culture Heritage by the Colombian Senate\n* 2003: The Carnival was proclaimed by UNESCO on November 7, as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].\n\n== Pre-Carnivals ==\n[[file:Congo en carnaval.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Congo dancing group.]]\n\n[[File:Carnival de barranquilla colombia.jpg|thumb|A costume.]]\nThe festivities, which are presided over by both the [[:es:Reina del Carnaval de Barranquilla|carnival queen]] and the Momo King elected the previous year, starts non-officially just after the New Year's Eve. The pre-carnival events begins officially with the Lectura del Bando (The reading of the Carnival Proclamation), followed by la toma de la ciudad (The taking Of the city), the crowning of the Carnival Queen and the Momo King, the children parade, the gay parade and finally La Guacherna, a nocturnal parade regarded as the most important pre-carnival event.\n\n===The Reading of the Carnival Proclamation ===\n\nThe reading of the Carnival Proclamation is one of the most important Barranquilla's pre-Carnival events, because it officially marks the beginning of the pre-Carnivals. In this act, which takes place traditionally at La Paz Square, the current Barranquilla mayor symbolically grants the keys of the city to the carnival queen, hence \"ceding\" their power to her for as long as the carnival season lasts. This proclamation may be seen as a \"decree\" divided into paragraphs that explains what is permitted and what is forbidden for the attendants during the period of celebration. Each paragraph includes recent and gripping happenings of the city that incentivise the revelry. It is read publicly by the queen during a folkloric act accompanied by the Momo King, the children kings and displays of folkloric dance groups.\n\n[[file:RemoPlazaPaz2.JPG|thumb|300px|La Paz Square, where traditionally the Carnival proclamation is carried out.]]\n\n=== The Crowning of the Carnival Queen ===\nIt is carried out on the previous Thursday to the Battle of flowers parade. During this show, the previous carnival queen crowns the current carnival queen, amid a party with full of dancing and music. It is currently held at the Romelio Martinez Stadium. Nevertheless, the crowning act dates back from 1918 when the first carnival queen, Alicia Lafaurie Roncallo, was crowned at the disappeared Barranquilla Club.  Ever since the tradition of electing the carnival queen among upper-class young women of the city to preside over the festivities have been maintained, which has made commonplace to see, read and hear how the crown has been only rotated among a few families: Gerlein, Donado, Vengoechea, Lafaurie o Abuchaibe. This tradition is mainly because a large part of the spendings, for instance those related to the attire worn by the queen during her crowning, are paid by the queen's family. This undoubtedly has been criticised since non-upper-class young women cannot aspire to hold the queen title due to the astronomically high sums of money that costs to be the carnival queen. Nevertheless, according to the official call statement, the candidate crowned as the carnival queen is that one showing excellent dancing skills, charisma and carnival spirit to the 11 members of the carnival board, who privately meet annually and elect the queen six months before the beginning of the carnival.\n\nAs for the show, it is a marathon of dancing styles, and it has become the most demanding test for the carnival queen over time, because during which the carnival queen has to demonstrate  her dancing skills by gracefully dancing a myriad of musical genres, such as [[cumbia]], [[salsa music|salsa]], [[merengue music|merengue]], [[champeta]], [[mapal\u00e9]], etc. This show is accompanied by members from some of the most important dancing groups participating in the carnival and by national and international singers, as the Dominican [[Juan Luis Guerra]] who made part of it in the 2014 carnivals. Also, during this event, the official song of the carnival queen is presented. By the way, the Carnival Queen is usually selected in October so that she has enough time to prepare for the Carnival.\n\n=== The Children Parade  ===\nDesfile del Carnaval de Los Ni\u00f1os is a parade for children in which school and community dancing groups participate as well as the children kings. In this parade, mini-floats adapted to the size of the children are seen.\n\n=== La Guacherna ===\n[[File:Bq - 9 sept 2007 030.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Esther Forero|Esthercita Forero]]'s statue, who recovered the La Guacherna's Tradition.]]\nLa Guacherna is a nocturnal parade and is considered as the most important pre-carnival event. It takes place on the previous week Friday before the beginning of the carnival. Many folkloric groups, cumbiambas, tamboras, disguises to the light of candles and people holding color lanterns participate in it.\n\nLa Guacherna unofficially started as early as the beginnings of the 20th century in [[barrio]] Abajo. In its beginnings, during the pre-carnival days, people used to call others by playing a [[Guache (percusi\u00f3n)|guache]] (percussion instrument producing a similar sound to that of a [[maraca]]) to signal the commencement of dancing, which was accompanied by tamboras and [[Ca\u00f1a de millo|flauta de millo]] as well as by candles to illuminate the night, making the surrounding people joyful. In 1974, this tradition was recovered thanks to the music composer [[Esther Forero|Esthercita Forero]]'s initiative, who, along with Alicia de Andr\u00e9is, achieved to make the carnival board introduce it in the carnival program. This parade did not exist formally until that year and it was named as La Guacherna after its creator, Esther forero.\n\nThe idea of bringing about such a nocturnal parade in the Barranquilla's Carnival dates back to a night in 1958, when Esther forero was at a nocturnal parade in [[Santiago de Cuba]], prompting her to ask around among folklorists about it the following days and hence learning that the parade, named as La Conga Parade, came to existence after many small groups had been gathering from across [[Santiago de Cuba Province]] over time. She then remembered that her city, Barranquilla, did not have a nocturnal parade in its carnivals, therefore as soon as she came back to her city, she decided to achieve to bring about a similar parade and then named it as La Guacherna - that name originated from a memory she had back her childhood of when cumbia groups would go out on the streets to rehearse their rhythms and the surrounding people would say a Guacherna was passing by. In short, that great nocturnal parade was created in 1974 and still exists as a great and brightly nocturnal parade.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Oviedo |first1=\u00c1lvaro |title=NOCHE DE GUACHERNA |url= http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-867618 |accessdate=24 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe insignia song of this date is the merengue song with the same name \"''La Guacherna''\", a composition by Esthercita Forero herself, and whose most known version is that of the Dominican [[Milly Quezada]].\n\n== Events ==\nThe carnival is celebrated during the four days before the [[ash wednesday]]. People party widely and get disguised as an act of fun and a lack of inhibition.<ref name=\"historia\">{{cite news |url=http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/previo/tradicion.html |title=Historia |accessdate=17 March 2017 |author=Fundaci\u00f3n Carnaval de Barranquilla |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100208082232/http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/previo/tradicion.html |archivedate=8 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During this time, Barranquilla people and foreigners coming in the city submerse themselves in the collective joy, drinking and dancing.\n\n=== Saturday of Carnival ===\n[[File:Carnaval_de_B.quilla..jpg|thumb|left|300px|The carnival queen during the Battle of Flowers.]]\nIt is the first day of Carnival. The celebration starts off firmly with the Battle of Flowers, which is the most important and most expected event. It is a great parade of floats, headed by the Carnival queen and followed by folkloric groups, disguises, cumbia groups and other dancing groups, winners of the last carnival's competitions. The Battle of Flowers is the oldest parade carried out in the Barranquilla Carnival, and was organised for the first time in 1903 following the general Heriberto Arturo Vengoechea's initiative, who was looking for a way to celebrate the end of the 1000 days war. With this event, the carnival resumed as it had been suspended since 1900.\n\nInitially, the Battle of Flowers was a stroll along the old \"Camell\u00f3n Abello\", now [[Paseo de Bol\u00edvar (Barranquilla)|Paseo de Bol\u00edvar]], that opened two groups of people formed by members of rich families on carriages decorated with flowers.<ref>{{cite news |last= Candela |first= Mariano |title= ''D\u00edas de carnaval.

This battle finished with a peace gesture when both groups reconciled and went on to celebrate at Emiliano Vengoeachea theatre. Its success was such that the same battle was repeated the next year.<ref>{{cite news |last=De la Espriella|first=Alfredo|title=Carnaval de Barranquilla: centenario de la Batalla de Flores (1903-2003)|year=2003|publisher=Mejoras|location=Barranquilla}}</ref>\n\nIt has been taking place along the Via 40 avenue since 1991, after having taken place along Olaya Herrera avenue, the 43 road and el paseo de Bol\u00edvar avenue. The floats now are equipped with loudspeakers and boarded by international and national singers who invites the spectators to celebrate and dance. Although the spectators are now accommodated in palcos (boxes), from where they watch the spectacle, they used to watch it on foot.\n\n=== Sunday of Carnival===\n\nIt is the second day of Carnival. The most important event carried out on this day is: The great tradition and folklore parade (Gran parada de tradici\u00f3n y folclore).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://medellinguru.com/carnaval-de-barranquilla/ | title=Carnaval de Barranquilla 2019: Second Largest Carnival in the World}}</ref>\n\nThis parade, commonly called as the great parade, is carried out on the second day of Carnival and was introduced in 1967. Only traditional folkloric groups, cumbia groups, and dancing groups participate in it. Also, it takes place along the V\u00eda 40 avenue too, but there are no floats participating in it. This parade shows the dance and the music in their more traditional essence since there are no floats neither high loudspeakers present in it.\nFor the year of 2013, around 300 dancing groups were counted as participants. The dancing groups participating in this parade are the ones called as popular dancing groups, such as \nCaim\u00e1n Cienaguero, Negritas Puloy and others as that of the devil harlequins. The music also, therefore, shows its most conservative facet, being cumbias, chand\u00e9s - associated with the Garabato dancing group- and fandangos -associated with the Marimondas dancing group-, the musical genres most heard.\n\n=== Monday Of Carnival ===\n\nIt is the third day of Carnival. The two most important events carried out on this day are: The Great Fantasy Parade and the Orchestras Festival.\n;The Great Fantasy Parade\n[[File:Comparsa del C. de B.quilla.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Fantasy dancing group parading.]]\n\nIt therefore shows innovating choreographic mixtures fluctuating from the most traditional, through the local, to the international by blending international rhythms, such as samba, salsa, reggaeton, champeta and electronic music with other local ones such as cumbia, porro, mapal\u00e9 and merecumb\u00e9. This event attracts renewing proposals searching for an space in the carnival. The success of a fantasy dancing group could have a renewing meaning to the carnival itself, enriching it and helping in its development. Over time, this parade has become one of the most attended events of the carnival.\n\n;Orchestras Festival\n[[File:Festival de Orquestas 2007 Barranquilla.jpg|thumb|300px|Orchestras Festival 2007. [[Richie Ray]] and [[Bobby Cruz]] Presentation.]]\n\nIt is a concert featuring many national and international musical ensembles, and was created in 1969. It normally starts at the early Monday afternoon lasting until the early Tuesday morning. In this festival, the participating musical ensembles compete for the coveted award called Congo De Oro in different categories. As a rule, each musical ensembles should perform three songs and at least one of them should be dedicated, in their content, to the city of Barranquilla. This event currently takes place at the Romelio Mart\u00ednez Stadium.\nThe following are the categories in which the musical ensembles vie for obtaining the Congo de Oro prize:\n\n* '''Tropical'''. Generic term referring to musical ensembles with both a popular orchestra format and a folkloric format that perform typical musical genres from the Caribbean region and the Barranquilla's Carnival such as [[cumbia]], [[porro]], [[fandango]], [[chalupa]], [[mapal\u00e9]] and others.\n* '''Vallenato'''.  Term referring to musical ensembles performing [[Vallenato]] and its many variations (Paseo, Son, Merengue, Puya, new trending ones), played with [[accordion]], [[caja vallenata|caja]] and [[guacharaca]] as main instruments.\n* '''Salsa'''. Term referring to musical ensembles performing the diverse West Indian musical genres such [[son cubano]], [[son montuno]], [[pachanga]], [[guaguanc\u00f3]], [[boogaloo]], [[Bomba (Ecuador)|bomba]], [[plena]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]], [[latin jazz]] and others.\n* '''Merengue'''. Term referring to musical ensembles performing musical genres coming out of [[Dominican Republic]] and the Caribbean such as [[merengue music|merengue]], [[House music|house]], [[ragga]], and others.\n* '''Urban music'''. Term referring to musical ensembles performing \"new styles\" of urban music, such as [[champeta]],  [[reggaet\u00f3n]], [[hip hop]], [[rap]], [[dancehall]] and others.\n* '''Rescuing the ours'''. Generic term referring to musical ensembles performing typical folkloric music such as [[cumbia]], [[porro]], [[fandango]], [[chalupa]], [[mapal\u00e9]] and others.\n\nLikewise,  special prizes are given to the best instrumentalists and the best singers of the contest.\n\n=== Tuesday of Carnival===\nThis the fourth and the last day of Carnival. It is marked by the death of Joselito. As a closing way, the burial of Joselito Carnaval is carried out, which symbolises the end of the festivities. On this day, many funny burials of Joselito are carried out across the city. This character symbolises the joy of the carnival. It is said that this character \"resuscitate\" the Saturday of Carnival and \"dies\" the last day, tired and drunken, to again resuscitate the next carnival. In this way, thousands of Barranquilla persons go out on the streets to cry the deceased with play-acting. Joselito Carnaval may be either a real person or a dummy, and it is used to be transported either within a coffin or stretches decorated with flowers and surrounded by its crying widows \u2013 these crying widows may be men disguised as women \u2013. In addition to widows, there may be seen other characters as priests and orphans. It is uncertain of this character's origins. Since 1999, The Barranquilla Carnaval Foundation celebrates the \"Joselito se va con las cenizas\" contest to encourage more groups to join in this celebration and in which the best portrayal is awarded.\n\nIn the night, a jocose meeting is celebrated either at Abajo neighborhood or at La Paz square, in which litanies, with simple verses and their characteristic intonation, are recited with the aim of making either a comment or a critique on the current affairs.\n\n== Venues ==\n\n[[File:Verbena en el Carnaval de Barranquilla.JPG|400px|thumb|right|Verbena at the Barranquilla's Carnival]]\nThe main Venue of the Carnival is the V\u00eda 40, which is an industrial avenue where the Battle of Flowers (Saturday), the Great Parade (Sunday) and The Great Fantasy Parade (Monday) take place. Other venues are the 17 road (The King Momo Parade), the 44 road (Guacherna), the [[Romelio Mart\u00ednez stadium]] (Orchestras festival, The queen crowning), La Paz square (the Proclamation reading), as well as verbenas and closed dancing rooms featuring live music, to which a ticket must be bought for accessing. Most of the parades can be viewed for free, but it's a good idea to buy a ticket to one of the bleacher seats for better views.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rove.me/to/colombia/barranquilla-carnival | title=Barranquilla Carnival}}</ref>\n\n=== Verbenas ===\n\nThey are open, free-access spaces, where people can dance, eat and enjoy themselves with different activities. Verbenas are presumed to have appeared as early as the beginnings of the 20th century when surprise-visiting a residence by friends was a common activity. These surprise-visits should be assumed completely and without any hesitation by the owner of the residence as a rendezvous point for making a party. These carnival dancing encounters were commonplace in the middle-upper and upper class and were a spread activity until the official appearance of dancing rooms hosted by nightclubes and hotels.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/el-swing-de-los-tiempos-de-la-verbena-99468 |title=El \u2018swing\u2019 de los tiempos de la verbena {{!}} Revistas|accessdate=2017-02-03 |language=Spanish |website= revistas.elheraldo.co}}</ref> Some popular verbenas are:<ref>{{cite news |last1= Stevenson Samper |first1=Adlai |title= El \u2018swing\u2019 de los tiempos de la verbena |url= http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/el-swing-de-los-tiempos-de-la-verbena-99468|language=Spanish |accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n*''El Bamb\u00fa'', at the Olaya neighborhood, .\n*''Polvor\u00edn'', at the San Jos\u00e9 neighborhood.\n*''A Pleno Sol'', at the La Uni\u00f3n neighborhood.\n*''La Gustadera'', at the Las Nieves neighborhood.\n*''La Puya loca'', at the Los Pinos neighborhood.\n\n=== Donkey Rooms ===\n\nThese were semi-open, free access rooms where people met to dance and enjoy themselves. That particular, curious name came from the fact people used to leave their donkeys tied to a post outside the room just before entering.\n\n==Music and Dancing==\n<!--[[File:El Mapal\u00e9 dancer Carnival de Barranquilla Colombia.jpg|thumb|An El Mapal\u00e9 dancer. The [[El Mapal\u00e9]] is a traditional dance originating with African slaves in Colombia.]]-->\nThe music consists of a mixture of [[cumbia]], [[porro]], [[mapale]], [[gaita (bagpipe)|gaita]], [[chand\u00e9]], [[Culoepuya|puya]], [[fandango]], and fantastic [[merecumb\u00e9s]]. These are examples of many styles of [[Colombian music]]. It is a party that gathers up tradition based on the creativity of the Colombian people, being expressed by a lot of forms of dancing, music, and by donning different costumes. This diversity gives it a character of unique, unrivalled party, in which the people are the main protagonists. Every dance, every [[folkloric]] group, and every custome plays different roles to make it the best show on earth.\n\nThe Barranquilla Carnival  is multicultural, diverse, and rich in different cultural expressions. There are traditional dances, choreographic dances; Comparsas (a form of live music), with which the choreography and creativity of dances are expressed; Comedies, like litany are traditional and folkloric popular theater, these are traditional groups that sing in groups ; These can be individual, or collectives, [[structural]], and dramatic.\n\n==Costumes and dances==\nThe ''Marimondas'', which are hooded figures with long noses, floppy ears and bright trousers and vests, are the most popular costume.\n\nOther traditional costumes are ''El Garabato, El Africano, Dr\u00e1cula, El Torito, El Congo, El Monocuco, Los Cabezones, Las Mu\u00f1econas'', and ''El Tigrillo''. Each costume represents something, and were originated with authenticity, some are based on other costumes around the world but mostly they all have Colombian roots and have a meaning for the barranquilleros specially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carnaval de Barranquilla|url=http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/DanzasExpresiones|publisher=Fundacion Carnval de Barranquilla|accessdate=20 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223001526/http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/DanzasExpresiones|archivedate=23 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Carnival's dances are: [[:es:Cumbia|La Cumbia]], [[:es:Danza del Garabato|El Garabato]], El Son de Negro, El Congo, [[:es:Mapal\u00e9|El Mapal\u00e9]], El Caiman, El Paloteo, El Gusano, Las Farotas, De Relacion and Las Pilanderas.\n\n\"The cumbia, a good example of the fusion of Indian, Black and White elements that simulates a couple courting and is characterized by the elegance and subtle movements of the woman's hips to the rhythm of a drum and flute.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Barranquilla Carnival: The Most Colorful Carnival in the World|url=http://www.colombia.travel/en/international-tourist/sightseeing-what-to-do/history-and-tradition/fairs-and-festivals/february/the-barranquilla-carnival|publisher=Colombia Travel|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> Another of the main dances is the Garabato, which represents a mystical battle between life and death.

[[folkloric]] celebrations, and one of the biggest carnival in the world. The [[carnival]] has traditions that date back to the 19th century. Four days before Holy Week, Barranquilla decks itself out to receive national and foreign tourists and joins together with the city's inhabitants to enjoy four days of intense festivities. During the carnival, [[Barranquilla]]'s normal activities are paralyzed because the city gets busy with street dances, musical and masquerade parades. Barranquilla's Carnival includes dances such as the Spanish paloteo, African [[Soukous|congo]], and indigenous mico y micas.  Many styles of [[music of Colombia|Colombian music]] are also performed, most prominently [[cumbia]], and instruments include drums and wind ensembles. \nThe Carnival of Barranquilla was proclaimed a Cultural Masterpiece of the Nation by Colombia's National Congress in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historia y Origen|url=http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/Carnaval|publisher=Fundacion Carnaval de Barranquilla|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\nAlso the [[UNESCO]], in Paris on November 7, 2003, declared it one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]], and it was during Olga Lucia Rodriquez Carnival Queen year.\n\nThe Carnival starts on the Saturday before the [[Ash Wednesday]] with the Battle of the Flowers (La Batalla de Flores), which is considered one of the main activities. Then, The Great Parade (La Gran Parada) on Sunday and Monday is marked by an Orchestra Festival with Caribbean and Latin bands. Tuesday signals the end of the carnival, announced by the burial of Joselito Carnaval, who is mourned by everyone.\n\nThe Barranquilla Carnival has been claimed to be the second largest carnival in the world, surpassed only by [[Rio Carnival|Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2015/02/05/second-biggest-carnaval-after-rio-is-in-barranquilla-colombia-a-terrific-surprise/#796281fa2617</ref>\n\nBarranquilla's Carnival slogan is: Those who live it are those who enjoy it (Quien lo vive, es quien lo goza).\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nVery little is known about exactly how and why this carnival began. There are many theories; the most popular belief is that the carnival is the welcoming of spring and a celebration of birth and renewal. The carnival originates from a combination of pagan ceremonies, catholic beliefs and ethnic diversity and is a mixture of the European, African and Indian traditions, dances and music. It was at first a holiday for slaves, and grew to be a celebration of the region.\n\nLocal beliefs date it back seven centuries and it is known that a great deal of the traditions were brought to America by the Spanish and Portuguese. The first notable date in the Carnival's history is 1888, when a figure known as [[King Momo]] appeared in the documented history of the Carnival. In 1903, the first known battle of the flowers was recorded, apparently to recover a long lost carnival tradition and, fifteen years later, the first Barranquilla's Carnival's queen was chosen to preside over the festivities of the carnival, which was later institutionalised in 1923. In the years that followed the carnival grew and so did the traditions, including the integration of the great parade.\n\n===  Chronology ===\n* 1888: King Momo emerged as one of the main characters.\n* 1899: The first President of the Carnival and the first Board of directors were elected.\n* 1903: The first Battle of Flowers parade ''(Spanish: Batalla de las Flores)'' (due to Heriberto Bengoechea's initiative in order to recover the carnival tradition of the previous years, as well as to celebrate the end of the One Thousand Days War ''( Spanish: [[:es:Guerra de los mil dias|Guerra de los Mil Dias]])''.)\n* 1918:  Alicia Lafaurie Roncallo elected as the first Carnival Queen.\n* 1923: The Carnival was institutionalised, since the queen contest had been cancelled for the 5 previous years.\n* 1967: The Great Parade event was introduced. It now takes place on the second day of the carnival, usually on Sundays.\n* 1969: The Orchestra Festival was created, which is a musical competition ranging over various genres.\n* 1974: The first Guacherna took place due to [[:es:Esther Forero|Esther Forero's]] initiative. The Guacherna is now celebrated on the previous week Friday before the carnival formally starts.\n* 2002: The Carnival was declared as a National Culture Heritage by the Colombian Senate\n* 2003: The Carnival was proclaimed by UNESCO on November 7, as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].\n\n== Pre-Carnivals ==\n[[file:Congo en carnaval.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Congo dancing group.]]\n\n[[File:Carnival de barranquilla colombia.jpg|thumb|A costume.]]\nThe festivities, which are presided over by both the [[:es:Reina del Carnaval de Barranquilla|carnival queen]] and the Momo King elected the previous year, starts non-officially just after the New Year's Eve. The pre-carnival events begins officially with the Lectura del Bando (The reading of the Carnival Proclamation), followed by la toma de la ciudad (The taking Of the city), the crowning of the Carnival Queen and the Momo King, the children parade, the gay parade and finally La Guacherna, a nocturnal parade regarded as the most important pre-carnival event.\n\n===The Reading of the Carnival Proclamation ===\n\nThe reading of the Carnival Proclamation is one of the most important Barranquilla's pre-Carnival events, because it officially marks the beginning of the pre-Carnivals. In this act, which takes place traditionally at La Paz Square, the current Barranquilla mayor symbolically grants the keys of the city to the carnival queen, hence \"ceding\" their power to her for as long as the carnival season lasts. This proclamation may be seen as a \"decree\" divided into paragraphs that explains what is permitted and what is forbidden for the attendants during the period of celebration. Each paragraph includes recent and gripping happenings of the city that incentivise the revelry. It is read publicly by the queen during a folkloric act accompanied by the Momo King, the children kings and displays of folkloric dance groups.\n\n[[file:RemoPlazaPaz2.JPG|thumb|300px|La Paz Square, where traditionally the Carnival proclamation is carried out.]]\n\n=== The Crowning of the Carnival Queen ===\nIt is carried out on the previous Thursday to the Battle of flowers parade. During this show, the previous carnival queen crowns the current carnival queen, amid a party with full of dancing and music. It is currently held at the Romelio Martinez Stadium. Nevertheless, the crowning act dates back from 1918 when the first carnival queen, Alicia Lafaurie Roncallo, was crowned at the disappeared Barranquilla Club.  Ever since the tradition of electing the carnival queen among upper-class young women of the city to preside over the festivities have been maintained, which has made commonplace to see, read and hear how the crown has been only rotated among a few families: Gerlein, Donado, Vengoechea, Lafaurie o Abuchaibe. This tradition is mainly because a large part of the spendings, for instance those related to the attire worn by the queen during her crowning, are paid by the queen's family. This undoubtedly has been criticised since non-upper-class young women cannot aspire to hold the queen title due to the astronomically high sums of money that costs to be the carnival queen. Nevertheless, according to the official call statement, the candidate crowned as the carnival queen is that one showing excellent dancing skills, charisma and carnival spirit to the 11 members of the carnival board, who privately meet annually and elect the queen six months before the beginning of the carnival.\n\nAs for the show, it is a marathon of dancing styles, and it has become the most demanding test for the carnival queen over time, because during which the carnival queen has to demonstrate  her dancing skills by gracefully dancing a myriad of musical genres, such as [[cumbia]], [[salsa music|salsa]], [[merengue music|merengue]], [[champeta]], [[mapal\u00e9]], etc. This show is accompanied by members from some of the most important dancing groups participating in the carnival and by national and international singers, as the Dominican [[Juan Luis Guerra]] who made part of it in the 2014 carnivals. Also, during this event, the official song of the carnival queen is presented. By the way, the Carnival Queen is usually selected in October so that she has enough time to prepare for the Carnival.\n\n=== The Children Parade  ===\nDesfile del Carnaval de Los Ni\u00f1os is a parade for children in which school and community dancing groups participate as well as the children kings. In this parade, mini-floats adapted to the size of the children are seen.\n\n=== La Guacherna ===\n[[File:Bq - 9 sept 2007 030.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Esther Forero|Esthercita Forero]]'s statue, who recovered the La Guacherna's Tradition.]]\nLa Guacherna is a nocturnal parade and is considered as the most important pre-carnival event. It takes place on the previous week Friday before the beginning of the carnival. Many folkloric groups, cumbiambas, tamboras, disguises to the light of candles and people holding color lanterns participate in it.\n\nLa Guacherna unofficially started as early as the beginnings of the 20th century in [[barrio]] Abajo. In its beginnings, during the pre-carnival days, people used to call others by playing a [[Guache (percusi\u00f3n)|guache]] (percussion instrument producing a similar sound to that of a [[maraca]]) to signal the commencement of dancing, which was accompanied by tamboras and [[Ca\u00f1a de millo|flauta de millo]] as well as by candles to illuminate the night, making the surrounding people joyful. In 1974, this tradition was recovered thanks to the music composer [[Esther Forero|Esthercita Forero]]'s initiative, who, along with Alicia de Andr\u00e9is, achieved to make the carnival board introduce it in the carnival program. This parade did not exist formally until that year and it was named as La Guacherna after its creator, Esther forero. \n\nThe idea of bringing about such a nocturnal parade in the Barranquilla's Carnival dates back to a night in 1958, when Esther forero was at a nocturnal parade in [[Santiago de Cuba]], prompting her to ask around among folklorists about it the following days and hence learning that the parade, named as La Conga Parade, came to existence after many small groups had been gathering from across [[Santiago de Cuba Province]] over time. She then remembered that her city, Barranquilla, did not have a nocturnal parade in its carnivals, therefore as soon as she came back to her city, she decided to achieve to bring about a similar parade and then named it as La Guacherna - that name originated from a memory she had back her childhood of when cumbia groups would go out on the streets to rehearse their rhythms and the surrounding people would say a Guacherna was passing by. In short, that great nocturnal parade was created in 1974 and still exists as a great and brightly nocturnal parade.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Oviedo |first1=\u00c1lvaro |title=NOCHE DE GUACHERNA |url= http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-867618 |accessdate=24 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe insignia song of this date is the merengue song with the same name \"''La Guacherna''\", a composition by Esthercita Forero herself, and whose most known version is that of the Dominican [[Milly Quezada]].\n\n== Events ==\nThe carnival is celebrated during the four days before the [[ash wednesday]]. People party widely and get disguised as an act of fun and a lack of inhibition.<ref name=\"historia\">{{cite news |url=http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/previo/tradicion.html |title=Historia |accessdate=17 March 2017 |author=Fundaci\u00f3n Carnaval de Barranquilla |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100208082232/http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/previo/tradicion.html |archivedate=8 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During this time, Barranquilla people and foreigners coming in the city submerse themselves in the collective joy, drinking and dancing.\n\n=== Saturday of Carnival ===\n[[File:Carnaval_de_B.quilla..jpg|thumb|left|300px|The carnival queen during the Battle of Flowers.]]\nIt is the first day of Carnival. The celebration starts off firmly with the Battle of Flowers, which is the most important and most expected event. It is a great parade of floats, headed by the Carnival queen and followed by folkloric groups, disguises, cumbia groups and other dancing groups, winners of the last carnival's competitions. The Battle of Flowers is the oldest parade carried out in the Barranquilla Carnival, and was organised for the first time in 1903 following the general Heriberto Arturo Vengoechea's initiative, who was looking for a way to celebrate the end of the 1000 days war. With this event, the carnival resumed as it had been suspended since 1900.\n\nInitially, the Battle of Flowers was a stroll along the old \"Camell\u00f3n Abello\", now [[Paseo de Bol\u00edvar (Barranquilla)|Paseo de Bol\u00edvar]], that opened two groups of people formed by members of rich families on carriages decorated with flowers.<ref>{{cite news |last= Candela |first= Mariano |title= ''D\u00edas de carnaval. Carnaval de Barranquilla: La fiesta sin fin'' |year=2011 |publisher=Marem\u00e1gnum |editor= Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carbonell Blanco |isbn=978-958-99788-0-1 |pages=112 |location=Barranquilla}}</ref> The historian and chronicler Alfredo de la Espriella described the first battle of flowers as a game in that two groups of people got confronted each other by shooting flowers, plastic party streamers and confetti along a course extending a few miles. This battle finished with a peace gesture when both groups reconciled and went on to celebrate at Emiliano Vengoeachea theatre. Its success was such that the same battle was repeated the next year.<ref>{{cite news |last=De la Espriella|first=Alfredo|title=Carnaval de Barranquilla: centenario de la Batalla de Flores (1903-2003)|year=2003|publisher=Mejoras|location=Barranquilla}}</ref>\n\nIt has been taking place along the Via 40 avenue since 1991, after having taken place along Olaya Herrera avenue, the 43 road and el paseo de Bol\u00edvar avenue. The floats now are equipped with loudspeakers and boarded by international and national singers who invites the spectators to celebrate and dance. Although the spectators are now accommodated in palcos (boxes), from where they watch the spectacle, they used to watch it on foot.\n\n=== Sunday of Carnival=== \n\nIt is the second day of Carnival. The most important event carried out on this day is: The great tradition and folklore parade (Gran parada de tradici\u00f3n y folclore).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://medellinguru.com/carnaval-de-barranquilla/ | title=Carnaval de Barranquilla 2019: Second Largest Carnival in the World}}</ref>\n\nThis parade, commonly called as the great parade, is carried out on the second day of Carnival and was introduced in 1967. Only traditional folkloric groups, cumbia groups, and dancing groups participate in it. Also, it takes place along the V\u00eda 40 avenue too, but there are no floats participating in it. This parade shows the dance and the music in their more traditional essence since there are no floats neither high loudspeakers present in it.\nFor the year of 2013, around 300 dancing groups were counted as participants. The dancing groups participating in this parade are the ones called as popular dancing groups, such as \nCaim\u00e1n Cienaguero, Negritas Puloy and others as that of the devil harlequins. The music also, therefore, shows its most conservative facet, being cumbias, chand\u00e9s - associated with the Garabato dancing group- and fandangos -associated with the Marimondas dancing group-, the musical genres most heard.\n\n=== Monday Of Carnival ===\n\nIt is the third day of Carnival. The two most important events carried out on this day are: The Great Fantasy Parade and the Orchestras Festival.\n;The Great Fantasy Parade\n[[File:Comparsa del C. de B.quilla.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Fantasy dancing group parading.]]\n\nIt therefore shows innovating choreographic mixtures fluctuating from the most traditional, through the local, to the international by blending international rhythms, such as samba, salsa, reggaeton, champeta and electronic music with other local ones such as cumbia, porro, mapal\u00e9 and merecumb\u00e9. This event attracts renewing proposals searching for an space in the carnival. The success of a fantasy dancing group could have a renewing meaning to the carnival itself, enriching it and helping in its development. Over time, this parade has become one of the most attended events of the carnival.\n\n;Orchestras Festival\n[[File:Festival de Orquestas 2007 Barranquilla.jpg|thumb|300px|Orchestras Festival 2007. [[Richie Ray]] and [[Bobby Cruz]] Presentation.]]\n\nIt is a concert featuring many national and international musical ensembles, and was created in 1969. It normally starts at the early Monday afternoon lasting until the early Tuesday morning. In this festival, the participating musical ensembles compete for the coveted award called Congo De Oro in different categories. As a rule, each musical ensembles should perform three songs and at least one of them should be dedicated, in their content, to the city of Barranquilla. This event currently takes place at the Romelio Mart\u00ednez Stadium.\nThe following are the categories in which the musical ensembles vie for obtaining the Congo de Oro prize:\n\n* '''Tropical'''. Generic term referring to musical ensembles with both a popular orchestra format and a folkloric format that perform typical musical genres from the Caribbean region and the Barranquilla's Carnival such as [[cumbia]], [[porro]], [[fandango]], [[chalupa]], [[mapal\u00e9]] and others.\n* '''Vallenato'''.  Term referring to musical ensembles performing [[Vallenato]] and its many variations (Paseo, Son, Merengue, Puya, new trending ones), played with [[accordion]], [[caja vallenata|caja]] and [[guacharaca]] as main instruments.\n* '''Salsa'''. Term referring to musical ensembles performing the diverse West Indian musical genres such [[son cubano]], [[son montuno]], [[pachanga]], [[guaguanc\u00f3]], [[boogaloo]], [[Bomba (Ecuador)|bomba]], [[plena]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]], [[latin jazz]] and others.\n* '''Merengue'''. Term referring to musical ensembles performing musical genres coming out of [[Dominican Republic]] and the Caribbean such as [[merengue music|merengue]], [[House music|house]], [[ragga]], and others.\n* '''Urban music'''. Term referring to musical ensembles performing \"new styles\" of urban music, such as [[champeta]],  [[reggaet\u00f3n]], [[hip hop]], [[rap]], [[dancehall]] and others.\n* '''Rescuing the ours'''. Generic term referring to musical ensembles performing typical folkloric music such as [[cumbia]], [[porro]], [[fandango]], [[chalupa]], [[mapal\u00e9]] and others.\n\nLikewise,  special prizes are given to the best instrumentalists and the best singers of the contest.\n\n=== Tuesday of Carnival===\nThis the fourth and the last day of Carnival. It is marked by the death of Joselito. As a closing way, the burial of Joselito Carnaval is carried out, which symbolises the end of the festivities. On this day, many funny burials of Joselito are carried out across the city. This character symbolises the joy of the carnival. It is said that this character \"resuscitate\" the Saturday of Carnival and \"dies\" the last day, tired and drunken, to again resuscitate the next carnival. In this way, thousands of Barranquilla persons go out on the streets to cry the deceased with play-acting. Joselito Carnaval may be either a real person or a dummy, and it is used to be transported either within a coffin or stretches decorated with flowers and surrounded by its crying widows \u2013 these crying widows may be men disguised as women \u2013. In addition to widows, there may be seen other characters as priests and orphans. It is uncertain of this character's origins. Since 1999, The Barranquilla Carnaval Foundation celebrates the \"Joselito se va con las cenizas\" contest to encourage more groups to join in this celebration and in which the best portrayal is awarded.\n\nIn the night, a jocose meeting is celebrated either at Abajo neighborhood or at La Paz square, in which litanies, with simple verses and their characteristic intonation, are recited with the aim of making either a comment or a critique on the current affairs.\n\n== Venues ==\n\n[[File:Verbena en el Carnaval de Barranquilla.JPG|400px|thumb|right|Verbena at the Barranquilla's Carnival]]\nThe main Venue of the Carnival is the V\u00eda 40, which is an industrial avenue where the Battle of Flowers (Saturday), the Great Parade (Sunday) and The Great Fantasy Parade (Monday) take place. Other venues are the 17 road (The King Momo Parade), the 44 road (Guacherna), the [[Romelio Mart\u00ednez stadium]] (Orchestras festival, The queen crowning), La Paz square (the Proclamation reading), as well as verbenas and closed dancing rooms featuring live music, to which a ticket must be bought for accessing. Most of the parades can be viewed for free, but it's a good idea to buy a ticket to one of the bleacher seats for better views.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rove.me/to/colombia/barranquilla-carnival | title=Barranquilla Carnival}}</ref>\n\n=== Verbenas ===\n\nThey are open, free-access spaces, where people can dance, eat and enjoy themselves with different activities. Verbenas are presumed to have appeared as early as the beginnings of the 20th century when surprise-visiting a residence by friends was a common activity. These surprise-visits should be assumed completely and without any hesitation by the owner of the residence as a rendezvous point for making a party. These carnival dancing encounters were commonplace in the middle-upper and upper class and were a spread activity until the official appearance of dancing rooms hosted by nightclubes and hotels.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/el-swing-de-los-tiempos-de-la-verbena-99468 |title=El \u2018swing\u2019 de los tiempos de la verbena {{!}} Revistas|accessdate=2017-02-03 |language=Spanish |website= revistas.elheraldo.co}}</ref> Some popular verbenas are:<ref>{{cite news |last1= Stevenson Samper |first1=Adlai |title= El \u2018swing\u2019 de los tiempos de la verbena |url= http://revistas.elheraldo.co/latitud/el-swing-de-los-tiempos-de-la-verbena-99468|language=Spanish |accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n*''El Bamb\u00fa'', at the Olaya neighborhood, .\n*''Polvor\u00edn'', at the San Jos\u00e9 neighborhood.\n*''A Pleno Sol'', at the La Uni\u00f3n neighborhood.\n*''La Gustadera'', at the Las Nieves neighborhood.\n*''La Puya loca'', at the Los Pinos neighborhood.\n\n=== Donkey Rooms ===\n\nThese were semi-open, free access rooms where people met to dance and enjoy themselves. That particular, curious name came from the fact people used to leave their donkeys tied to a post outside the room just before entering.\n\n==Music and Dancing==\n<!--[[File:El Mapal\u00e9 dancer Carnival de Barranquilla Colombia.jpg|thumb|An El Mapal\u00e9 dancer. The [[El Mapal\u00e9]] is a traditional dance originating with African slaves in Colombia.]]-->\nThe music consists of a mixture of [[cumbia]], [[porro]], [[mapale]], [[gaita (bagpipe)|gaita]], [[chand\u00e9]], [[Culoepuya|puya]], [[fandango]], and fantastic [[merecumb\u00e9s]]. These are examples of many styles of [[Colombian music]]. It is a party that gathers up tradition based on the creativity of the Colombian people, being expressed by a lot of forms of dancing, music, and by donning different costumes. This diversity gives it a character of unique, unrivalled party, in which the people are the main protagonists. Every dance, every [[folkloric]] group, and every custome plays different roles to make it the best show on earth.\n\nThe Barranquilla Carnival  is multicultural, diverse, and rich in different cultural expressions. There are traditional dances, choreographic dances; Comparsas (a form of live music), with which the choreography and creativity of dances are expressed; Comedies, like litany are traditional and folkloric popular theater, these are traditional groups that sing in groups ; These can be individual, or collectives, [[structural]], and dramatic.\n\n==Costumes and dances==\nThe ''Marimondas'', which are hooded figures with long noses, floppy ears and bright trousers and vests, are the most popular costume.\n\nOther traditional costumes are ''El Garabato, El Africano, Dr\u00e1cula, El Torito, El Congo, El Monocuco, Los Cabezones, Las Mu\u00f1econas'', and ''El Tigrillo''. Each costume represents something, and were originated with authenticity, some are based on other costumes around the world but mostly they all have Colombian roots and have a meaning for the barranquilleros specially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carnaval de Barranquilla|url=http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/DanzasExpresiones|publisher=Fundacion Carnval de Barranquilla|accessdate=20 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223001526/http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/DanzasExpresiones|archivedate=23 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Carnival\u00b4s dances are: [[:es:Cumbia|La Cumbia]], [[:es:Danza del Garabato|El Garabato]], El Son de Negro, El Congo, [[:es:Mapal\u00e9|El Mapal\u00e9]], El Caiman, El Paloteo, El Gusano, Las Farotas, De Relacion and Las Pilanderas.\n\n\"The cumbia, a good example of the fusion of Indian, Black and White elements that simulates a couple courting and is characterized by the elegance and subtle movements of the woman's hips to the rhythm of a drum and flute.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Barranquilla Carnival: The Most Colorful Carnival in the World|url=http://www.colombia.travel/en/international-tourist/sightseeing-what-to-do/history-and-tradition/fairs-and-festivals/february/the-barranquilla-carnival|publisher=Colombia Travel|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> Another of the main dances is the Garabato, which represents a mystical battle between life and death.

The railway originally formed as the '''Prince Edward County Railway''' in 1879, running between [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] and Trenton, where it connected with the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] that ran between [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]]. After being purchased by a group of investors and receiving a new charter to build northward, the railway renamed as the COR in 1882 and the company started building towards the gold fields at [[Madoc, Ontario|Eldorado]] and newly discovered iron fields in Coe Hill.\n\nOn reaching Coe Hill in 1884, the mine was found to have low grade ore, nearly bankrupting the company. Expansion continued to other mining areas around [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]], along with two wholly owned subsidiary lines, the '''Ontario, Belmont and Northern Railway''', later known as the '''Marmora Railway''', and the '''Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway'''. The later was supposed to connect to the [[Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway]] (OA&PS) at [[Barry's Bay, Ontario|Barry's Bay]], but these plans were shelved. A new route to the OA&PS was selected to [[Whitney, Ontario|Whitney]], just outside [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Construction on this final portion reached [[Maynooth, Ontario|Maynooth]] in 1907 but was never completed, and the line ultimately ended in the now abandoned town of Wallace, about 25 kilometres south of Whitney.\n\nThe COR was taken over by [[William Mackenzie (railway entrepreneur)|Mackenzie]] and [[Donald Mann|Mann]] in 1910, along with the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] which was connected to the COR north of Bancroft in July 1910. Both lines were then merged into their [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) in 1911. After CNoR was nationalized 1918, the lines became part of the [[Canadian National Railways]] (CN) system in 1923. CN operated the COR as the '''Maynooth Subdivision'''. Sections of the line north of Maynooth were lifted in 1965, and the entire rest of the line in 1985. All of the side branches had been abandoned much earlier, typically when the ore deposits dried up.\n\nMuch of the route of the COR has been re-purposed as a multi-use recreational [[rail trail]], which has a variety of names depending on its location, with the '''Hastings Heritage Trail''' being a prominent part.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prince Edward County Railway===\n[[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]] is a large peninsula on eastern [[Lake Ontario]]. It is roughly triangular in shape with its apex pointed to the east, and its connection to the mainland at the northwestern corner. It was first settled starting in 1784 by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] after the [[American Revolutionary War]], and depended largely on fishing and barley in its early days.\n\nThe [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) reached [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] on its way to Toronto in 1855, opening new markets to the County. Local businessmen began considering a railway to collect produce from across the peninsula and connecting with the GTR at Trenton, on the north side of the land bridge with the mainland.{{sfn|Brown|2011}} The Prince Edward County Railway company (PECR) was formed in 1873{{efn|Sources disagree on the date, some suggesting that it was formed in 1879 and opened in 1880, while others give 1873 as the formation and 1879 as the opening date.}} and began construction due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the peninsula, then turning northward for Trenton. Due to financial constraints, the line finally completed in 1879 and opened for service in October.{{sfn|Brown|2011}} In 1976 a large branch was wyed off west of Picton to serve large quarries north of town, near Elmbrook.\n\n===Expansion to Coe Hill===\nThe opening of [[Central Ontario]] during the 19th Century was driven primarily by the discovery of a number of mineral deposits, notably gold and iron ore. As mines grew, principally in the area of [[Marmora, Ontario|Marmora]] and [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]], a race formed between a series of railways companies who wanted to serve these markets. Among the many claimants were the [[Victoria Railway]] (VicR) that ran through [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], a combined rail and water route by the [[Cobourg and Peterborough Railway]] (C&P), and a potential extension of the [[Toronto and Nipissing Railway]]. None of these were well placed though, as they ran towards Toronto instead of east to the major markets and shipping routes. The only line that appeared to be well positioned was a proposed branch of the [[Grand Junction Railway (Ontario)|Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) out of Belleville. Since the new mining areas were directly north of both Trenton and Belleville, the PERC was also in an ideal location as a starting point.\n\nWilliam Coe of [[Madoc, Ontario|Madoc]] found [[iron ore]] deposits outside Brinklow and began looking for ways to commercialize the find. He contacted [[George William McMullen]], a railway promoter in [[Chicago]] who had been born and raised in Picton. McMullen started looking for partners, and found [[Samuel Ritchey]], a businessman from [[Ohio]] who was looking for new ventures. Rickey, McMullen and McMullen's brother J.B. bought the PECR in 1880 to serve as the basis for a rapid expansion. In 1881 the group purchased 70,000 acres of land for the mines, and transferred the deeds to the company.{{sfn|Bray}} The group then petitioned the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario Legislature]] for the rights to rename the company and start construction northward, which was granted on 10 March 1882.{{sfn|Walker|2013}} The land deeds were transferred to the newly formed Coe Hill Mining Company, and the railway was renamed the Central Ontario Railway.{{sfn|Bray}}\n\nThe route was selected to take the line through several other mining areas, including Marmora, Deloro and Malone, before reaching Eldorado. The line reached Marmora in 1883 and the newly formed [[Wollaston, Ontario|Coe Hill]] in 1884.{{efn|Most sources agree this took place in 1884, either directly or by saying \"two years later\" after formation of the company in 1882. One source states Coe Hill was not reached until 1889, but this appears to be an error.}} The first load of ore left the station on 2 June 1884,{{sfn|Walker|2013}} but when the samples reached [[Cleveland]] for analysis the results showed that the ore was too low grade to be useful for mining, leaving the company on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|Bray}}\n\n===Further routes and branches===\n[[File:Central Ontario Railway in Bancroft.jpg|thumb|A Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) passenger train heads south out of Bancroft station in 1910.]]\n\nFrom that point the company turned to servicing other mines and sawmills in the area and constructed a number of branch lines. As early as May 1891, the '''Ontario, Belmont & Northern Railway''' (OB&NR), a wholly owned subsidiary of the COR, received a charter to build a branch line to the iron mines in the Marmora area. Construction did not start for some time, and the 14.5&nbsp;km line from Marmora Junction near Belmar to the Cordova mines was finally completed in July 1896. Later that year the branch was renamed to become the '''Marmora Railway & Mining Company'''.\n\nStarting in 1899 the mainline was extended further north, not from the original terminus in Coe Hill which became a branch line, but by via a wye off the line south of Brinklow and running almost due north from that point, roughly following the route of the modern [[Ontario Highway 62]]. The 19.55 mile extension to Bancroft opened on 2 November 1900.{{sfn|Walker|2013}} Another subsidiary line, the '''Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway''', was chartered in 1904 (although apparently formed in the late 1800s) to branch off the COR at L'Amable, just south of Bancroft, and run eastward to connect to Bessemer and the Child's Mine. Later, plans were made to use this branch as the basis for an extension all the way to the  [[Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway]], at that time the busiest railway in Canada,<ref>\"Track and Tower\" brochure, Friends of Algonquin Park</ref> meeting it at [[Barry's Bay, Ontario|Barry's Bay]]. However, the extension plans were never taken up and the B&BB remained a spur ending Child's Mine.\n\nA connection with the OA&PS, by this time reorganized to become part of the [[Canadian Atlantic Railway]] (CAR), remained desirable. A new route running from the Bancroft  terminus was selected, running almost due north to meet the CAR near [[Whitney, Ontario|Whitney]], just outside today's [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Construction on this link reached Maynooth on 7 November 1907, Lake St. Peter in 1909, and Wallace in 1911<ref name=bob>[http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm \"Central Ontario Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217020851/http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm |date=February 17, 2014 }}, Railway Bob</ref> - so-named for the line's surveyor and chief engineer.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} By this time the logging era had reached its peak and traffic was dwindling on the COR, and further expansion was abandoned, leaving the end of the line a turnaround-wye next to Joseph Lavalley's farm in Wallace.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\n===Leasing, purchase and abandonment===\n[[File:Maynooth Station 1971.jpg|thumb|By the time this photo was taken in 1971, the COR north of Maynooth had been abandoned and the section north of Bancroft was little used. Maynooth station is already in shabby condition.]]\n\nIn 1910 the entire COR was leased by the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]], which was itself purchased by the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) in 1911. The Canadian government took control of the CNoR in 1916, and folded its holdings into the forming [[Canadian National Railways]] (CNR) in 1918.<ref name=bob/> Under CN ownership, various sections were renamed as subdivisions; the line from Picton to Trenton became the '''Picton Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Picton.html \"C.N.Rys.

Bessemer Subdivision\"]</ref>\n\nThe line was kept active by a series of small lumber mills that opened in the Lake McKenzie area. McConnell's Mill near the current intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and [[Ontario Highway 127]] was the first of these, and later taken over by the [[Rathburn Lumber|Rathbun Lumber Company]]. Judson Gunters opened a mill slightly to the north around 1918, which gives its name to maps to this day. The final mill in the area opened in 1943 when J.S.L. McRea moved his mill from Lake of Two Rivers in Algonquin to the area just north of Wallace. This mill operated until 1952.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\nWith the closing of the McRea mill and several other businesses in the area, traffic on the northern section of the line quickly dwindled. By 1955 all the business in Wallace had closed, and the COR ran a single train to the town every Wednesday to deliver mail. This section was abandoned in 1960, leaving the terminus at Lake St. Peter. On 22 April 1964 CNR applied to abandon the entire line from Wallace to Bird's Creek, just north of Bancroft where the COR met the Irondale (at today's \"Y\" Road). But only a smaller section, from Maynooth to Lake St. Peter was abandoned in 1965,{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} along with most of the spurs. The remainder of the line was abandoned by CNR in 1984, and the rails lifted either that year or the next. Today only a 1.5&nbsp;km long section of the line remains, used by [[CN Rail]] as a siding to service the grain terminal at Trenton junction.\n\n===Conversion to rail-trail===\n[[File:Northern end of the Central Ontario Railway.JPG|thumb|Looking south from the northernmost \"navigable\" point of the COR, at the ghost town of Gunters.]]\n[[File:Maynooth Ontario railway station.jpg|thumb|Maynooth Station on the COR, about 2 km east of the town of Maynooth, Ontario. The station was the northernmost major station on the Central Ontario Railway.]]\n\nMost of the COR, including the original PECR route, has been converted to rail-trail use. After its abandonment the line has increasingly been turned to local authorities for maintenance.\n\nThe route of the original PECR was purchased by Prince Edward County in 1997 and is now known as the [http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails-a-z/millennium-trail-1 Millennium Trail], running for 49&nbsp;km out of Picton and ending just outside Trenton.<ref>[http://www.pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf Map of the Millennium Trail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826023249/http://pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}.</ref>\n\nThe 17&nbsp;km section between [[Ontario Highway 401|the 401]] at Trenton and Glen Ross had been re-used for roadways and other uses, as well as being in a built-up area. The unused sections in this area only started conversion to trail use in the 2000s, and several of these sections opened in 2011. Just north of Trenton this is known as the Jack Lange Memorial Trail, and from there, from just south of {{Not a typo|Glen Miller}} to Glen Ross, it becomes the Lower Trent Trail.<ref>[http://www.friendsofthetrail.ca \"Welcome to the Lower Trent Trail\"]</ref>\n\nThe largest section of the trail network is the {{convert|156|km|adj=on}} long four-season [https://web.archive.org/web/20140515175353/http://www.hastingscounty.com/discovering-hastings/hastings-heritage-trail.html Hastings Heritage Trail], stretching from Glen Ross all the way to [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] outside Maynooth.<ref>[http://www.ontariotrailmaps.ca/5G.page Map of the Hastings Heritage Trail]</ref> This is the official end of the line, where it hits the border between [[Hastings County]] and [[South Algonquin]]. The trail remains in good repair, signed and used, north of this border to its current ending point near [[McKenzie Lake (Madawaska River)|McKenzie Lake]], at the intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and McKenzie North Road, marked on many maps as the village of Gunters.<ref>[https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=gunters+ontario \"Gunters, Ontario\"], as it appears in Google Maps.</ref>\n\nThe short remaining section from Gunters to Wallace is used for a variety of purposes, including section of McKenzie Lake Road, [[Hydro One]] lines providing local service, and in some areas simply abandoned and heavily overgrown. The ultimate terminus can be seen a few meters to the west of McKenzie Lake Road at the [[ghost town]] of Wallace.\n\n==Route==\n[[File:Central Ontario Railway map 1910.pdf|thumb|This map, from the COR's June 1910 passenger timetable, shows the route running all the way to Whitney.

It turned northwest at [[Wellington, Ontario|Wellington]] and then due north at [[Hillier, Ontario|Hillier]] before turning northwest again at Consecon to loop around the western end of the [[Bay of Quinte]] and then northeast for the short remaining distance to Trenton. There were ten stations on the line, Picton, Bloomfield at 4.22 miles, Hallowell 7.59 miles, Wellington 10.97 miles, Niles' Corner 14.90 miles, Hillier 16.55 miles, Consecon 21.32 miles, [[Weller's Bay]] 25.64 miles, Canal 27.02 miles and Trenton 30.60 miles.<ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway \"Prince Edward County Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002074301/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> This section of the line was abandoned in 1984 and the rails removed, but now the majority is used for a recreational trail. The original Picton Station is located on Main Street, and is occupied by C.F. Evans Lumber Company.\n\nFrom Trenton the line ran almost due north through Frankford, Glen Ross, Anson, Bonariaw, Marmora Station (just northeast of Marmora) and Deloror. Here it turned northeast toward Malone, and then east through Madoc to Eldorado. The line then turned north to run through Bannockburn, Millbridge Station and Gilmour, before turning west just south of Brinklow and running through Ormsby to its end just southwest of Coe Hill.\n\nThe Bancroft extension wyed off near Brinklow at Ormsby Junction, running north through Brinklow and detouring to the east en route to serve Detlor before reaching Bancroft. The next extension took it north from Bancroft to Maynooth Station (east of Maynooth). The original plans would have had it run roughly northeast along the route of [[Ontario Highway 62]] to [[Barry's Bay]], but instead took it northward along the route of [[Ontario Highway 127]] through [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] before ultimately ending in the bush near McKenzie Lake.\n\nThere were two main spur lines. One split just south of Marmora at Belmar Station to run northwest to Cordova Mines, and the other split at Bessemer Junction near Detlor running east-northeast to Childs Mine.\n\nThe COR was joined by several other railways in the area. The [[Grand Junction Railway (Ontario)|Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) ran between [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] and Belleville and met the COR in a wye junction just outside the town of Anson, near [[Stirling, Ontario|Stirling]]. A branch of the GJR, the Belleville and North Hastings Railway (B&NH), later met the COR about 1&nbsp;km west of Eldorado. The [[Bay of Quinte Railway]] was extended to meet the COR just north of Eldorado at Bannockburn, reaching this point in 1902.<ref>[http://vishwawalking.ca/hastings-heritage-trail/hast-hertge-trl-of-2-lkes.html \"Trail of Two Lakes, Belleville and North Hastings Line\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings \"Belleville and North Hastings Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002041723/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> The final connection was to the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway|Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa]] which met the COR just north of Bancroft in 1910, meeting it at what it today known as \"Y\" Road, named for the wye intersection.\n\nMain stations on the line included Picton, Bloomfield, Wellington, Trenton, Frankford, Marmora, Coe Hill, Bancroft and Maynooth. Several stations have survived; the original Picton station was moved and became a private home, while the second station remains in use as a lumberyard. Hallowell was moved to Stanley Street in Bloomfield as a children's playhouse, Bloomfield moved to West Lake as a summer residence, Consecon is abandoned in place, Frankford moved to Stockdale as a restaurant, Marmora and Coe Hill both moved to a park to become information centres, Bancroft's station remains in place and is now a museum, Maynooth was abandoned in place (see image at top) and Lake St. Peter was moved to an unknown location.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |first=Matt |last=Bray |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ritchie_samuel_j_13E.html |title=Ritchie, Samuel J. |website=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] |volume=XIII |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |first=Ron |last=Brown |url=http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |title=The ghost rail lines of Hastings County |website=Country Roads |date=17 June 2011 |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624023930/http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |archivedate=24 June 2013 }}\n* {{cite web |first=Jim |last=Walker |url=http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |title=Canadian Railways |website=Harvey Historical Society |date=1 February 2013 |ref=harv |access-date=4 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000358/http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}\n* {{cite book |last=Lyons |first=Bob |title=Whitney: Island in the Shield |publisher=Bancroft Times |year=1986 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/castelmar/105663683/ This image] is a marked up version of the map in the 1910 timetable, highlighting nearby railways.

The railway originally formed as the '''Prince Edward County Railway''' in 1879, running between [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] and Trenton, where it connected with the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] that ran between [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]]. After being purchased by a group of investors and receiving a new charter to build northward, the railway renamed as the COR in 1882 and the company started building towards the gold fields at [[Madoc, Ontario|Eldorado]] and newly discovered iron fields in Coe Hill.\n\nOn reaching Coe Hill in 1884, the mine was found to have low grade ore, nearly bankrupting the company. Expansion continued to other mining areas around [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]], along with two wholly owned subsidiary lines, the '''Ontario, Belmont and Northern Railway''', later known as the '''Marmora Railway''', and the '''Bessemer and Barry's Bay Railway'''.

However, the extension plans were never taken up and the B&BB remained a spur ending Child's Mine.\n\nA connection with the OA&PS, by this time reorganized to become part of the [[Canadian Atlantic Railway]] (CAR), remained desirable. A new route running from the Bancroft  terminus was selected, running almost due north to meet the CAR near [[Whitney, Ontario|Whitney]], just outside today's [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Construction on this link reached Maynooth on 7 November 1907, Lake St. Peter in 1909, and Wallace in 1911<ref name=bob>[http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm \"Central Ontario Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217020851/http://www.railwaybob.com/Constituents/CNoRConstituents.htm |date=February 17, 2014 }}, Railway Bob</ref> - so-named for the line's surveyor and chief engineer.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} By this time the logging era had reached its peak and traffic was dwindling on the COR, and further expansion was abandoned, leaving the end of the line a turnaround-wye next to Joseph Lavalley's farm in Wallace.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\n===Leasing, purchase and abandonment===\n[[File:Maynooth Station 1971.jpg|thumb|By the time this photo was taken in 1971, the COR north of Maynooth had been abandoned and the section north of Bancroft was little used. Maynooth station is already in shabby condition.]]\n\nIn 1910 the entire COR was leased by the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]], which was itself purchased by the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) in 1911. The Canadian government took control of the CNoR in 1916, and folded its holdings into the forming [[Canadian National Railways]] (CNR) in 1918.<ref name=bob/> Under CN ownership, various sections were renamed as subdivisions; the line from Picton to Trenton became the '''Picton Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Picton.html \"C.N.Rys. Picton Subdivision\"]</ref> the mainline to Maynooth became the '''Maynooth Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Maynooth.html \"C.N.Rys. Maynooth Subdivision\"]</ref> while the various spurs became the '''Coe Hill Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Coe_Hill.html \"C.N.Rys. Coe Hill Subdivision\"]</ref> the '''Marmora Subdivision''',<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Marmora.html \"C.N.Rys. Marmora Subdivision\"]</ref> and the '''Bessemer Subdivision'''.<ref>[http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Subdivisions/Bessemer.html \"C.N.Rys. Bessemer Subdivision\"]</ref>\n\nThe line was kept active by a series of small lumber mills that opened in the Lake McKenzie area. McConnell's Mill near the current intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and [[Ontario Highway 127]] was the first of these, and later taken over by the [[Rathburn Lumber|Rathbun Lumber Company]]. Judson Gunters opened a mill slightly to the north around 1918, which gives its name to maps to this day. The final mill in the area opened in 1943 when J.S.L. McRea moved his mill from Lake of Two Rivers in Algonquin to the area just north of Wallace. This mill operated until 1952.{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\nWith the closing of the McRea mill and several other businesses in the area, traffic on the northern section of the line quickly dwindled. By 1955 all the business in Wallace had closed, and the COR ran a single train to the town every Wednesday to deliver mail. This section was abandoned in 1960, leaving the terminus at Lake St. Peter. On 22 April 1964 CNR applied to abandon the entire line from Wallace to Bird's Creek, just north of Bancroft where the COR met the Irondale (at today's \"Y\" Road). But only a smaller section, from Maynooth to Lake St. Peter was abandoned in 1965,{{sfn|Lyons|1986|loc=Chapter 7}} along with most of the spurs. The remainder of the line was abandoned by CNR in 1984, and the rails lifted either that year or the next. Today only a 1.5&nbsp;km long section of the line remains, used by [[CN Rail]] as a siding to service the grain terminal at Trenton junction.\n\n===Conversion to rail-trail===\n[[File:Northern end of the Central Ontario Railway.JPG|thumb|Looking south from the northernmost \"navigable\" point of the COR, at the ghost town of Gunters.]]\n[[File:Maynooth Ontario railway station.jpg|thumb|Maynooth Station on the COR, about 2 km east of the town of Maynooth, Ontario. The station was the northernmost major station on the Central Ontario Railway.]]\n\nMost of the COR, including the original PECR route, has been converted to rail-trail use. After its abandonment the line has increasingly been turned to local authorities for maintenance.\n\nThe route of the original PECR was purchased by Prince Edward County in 1997 and is now known as the [http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails-a-z/millennium-trail-1 Millennium Trail], running for 49&nbsp;km out of Picton and ending just outside Trenton.<ref>[http://www.pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf Map of the Millennium Trail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826023249/http://pecounty.on.ca/government/eng_dev_works/pdf/MilleniumTrailMap.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}.</ref>\n\nThe 17&nbsp;km section between [[Ontario Highway 401|the 401]] at Trenton and Glen Ross had been re-used for roadways and other uses, as well as being in a built-up area. The unused sections in this area only started conversion to trail use in the 2000s, and several of these sections opened in 2011. Just north of Trenton this is known as the Jack Lange Memorial Trail, and from there, from just south of {{Not a typo|Glen Miller}} to Glen Ross, it becomes the Lower Trent Trail.<ref>[http://www.friendsofthetrail.ca \"Welcome to the Lower Trent Trail\"]</ref>\n\nThe largest section of the trail network is the {{convert|156|km|adj=on}} long four-season [https://web.archive.org/web/20140515175353/http://www.hastingscounty.com/discovering-hastings/hastings-heritage-trail.html Hastings Heritage Trail], stretching from Glen Ross all the way to [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] outside Maynooth.<ref>[http://www.ontariotrailmaps.ca/5G.page Map of the Hastings Heritage Trail]</ref> This is the official end of the line, where it hits the border between [[Hastings County]] and [[South Algonquin]]. The trail remains in good repair, signed and used, north of this border to its current ending point near [[McKenzie Lake (Madawaska River)|McKenzie Lake]], at the intersection of McKenzie Lake Road and McKenzie North Road, marked on many maps as the village of Gunters.<ref>[https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=gunters+ontario \"Gunters, Ontario\"], as it appears in Google Maps.</ref>\n\nThe short remaining section from Gunters to Wallace is used for a variety of purposes, including section of McKenzie Lake Road, [[Hydro One]] lines providing local service, and in some areas simply abandoned and heavily overgrown. The ultimate terminus can be seen a few meters to the west of McKenzie Lake Road at the [[ghost town]] of Wallace.\n\n==Route==\n[[File:Central Ontario Railway map 1910.pdf|thumb|This map, from the COR's June 1910 passenger timetable, shows the route running all the way to Whitney. It actually ended near the \"Y\" in \"RAILWAY\", in Sabine County.]]\nThe original Prince Edward County Railway ran almost due west out of Picton towards the western shore of the Prince Edward County peninsula. It turned northwest at [[Wellington, Ontario|Wellington]] and then due north at [[Hillier, Ontario|Hillier]] before turning northwest again at Consecon to loop around the western end of the [[Bay of Quinte]] and then northeast for the short remaining distance to Trenton. There were ten stations on the line, Picton, Bloomfield at 4.22 miles, Hallowell 7.59 miles, Wellington 10.97 miles, Niles' Corner 14.90 miles, Hillier 16.55 miles, Consecon 21.32 miles, [[Weller's Bay]] 25.64 miles, Canal 27.02 miles and Trenton 30.60 miles.<ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway \"Prince Edward County Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002074301/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/100-prince-edward-county-railway |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> This section of the line was abandoned in 1984 and the rails removed, but now the majority is used for a recreational trail. The original Picton Station is located on Main Street, and is occupied by C.F. Evans Lumber Company.\n\nFrom Trenton the line ran almost due north through Frankford, Glen Ross, Anson, Bonariaw, Marmora Station (just northeast of Marmora) and Deloror. Here it turned northeast toward Malone, and then east through Madoc to Eldorado. The line then turned north to run through Bannockburn, Millbridge Station and Gilmour, before turning west just south of Brinklow and running through Ormsby to its end just southwest of Coe Hill.\n\nThe Bancroft extension wyed off near Brinklow at Ormsby Junction, running north through Brinklow and detouring to the east en route to serve Detlor before reaching Bancroft. The next extension took it north from Bancroft to Maynooth Station (east of Maynooth). The original plans would have had it run roughly northeast along the route of [[Ontario Highway 62]] to [[Barry's Bay]], but instead took it northward along the route of [[Ontario Highway 127]] through [[Lake St. Peter Provincial Park]] before ultimately ending in the bush near McKenzie Lake.\n\nThere were two main spur lines. One split just south of Marmora at Belmar Station to run northwest to Cordova Mines, and the other split at Bessemer Junction near Detlor running east-northeast to Childs Mine.\n\nThe COR was joined by several other railways in the area. The [[Grand Junction Railway (Ontario)|Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) ran between [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] and Belleville and met the COR in a wye junction just outside the town of Anson, near [[Stirling, Ontario|Stirling]]. A branch of the GJR, the Belleville and North Hastings Railway (B&NH), later met the COR about 1&nbsp;km west of Eldorado. The [[Bay of Quinte Railway]] was extended to meet the COR just north of Eldorado at Bannockburn, reaching this point in 1902.<ref>[http://vishwawalking.ca/hastings-heritage-trail/hast-hertge-trl-of-2-lkes.html \"Trail of Two Lakes, Belleville and North Hastings Line\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings \"Belleville and North Hastings Railway\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002041723/http://www.bellevillemodelrailroad.org/index.php/local-history/93-belleville-north-hastings |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> The final connection was to the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway|Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa]] which met the COR just north of Bancroft in 1910, meeting it at what it today known as \"Y\" Road, named for the wye intersection.\n\nMain stations on the line included Picton, Bloomfield, Wellington, Trenton, Frankford, Marmora, Coe Hill, Bancroft and Maynooth. Several stations have survived; the original Picton station was moved and became a private home, while the second station remains in use as a lumberyard. Hallowell was moved to Stanley Street in Bloomfield as a children's playhouse, Bloomfield moved to West Lake as a summer residence, Consecon is abandoned in place, Frankford moved to Stockdale as a restaurant, Marmora and Coe Hill both moved to a park to become information centres, Bancroft's station remains in place and is now a museum, Maynooth was abandoned in place (see image at top) and Lake St. Peter was moved to an unknown location.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |first=Matt |last=Bray |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ritchie_samuel_j_13E.html |title=Ritchie, Samuel J. |website=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] |volume=XIII |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |first=Ron |last=Brown |url=http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |title=The ghost rail lines of Hastings County |website=Country Roads |date=17 June 2011 |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624023930/http://countryroadshastings.ca/current-issue-s2.php?command=viewArticle&ID=7&currentFeed=3 |archivedate=24 June 2013 }}\n* {{cite web |first=Jim |last=Walker |url=http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |title=Canadian Railways |website=Harvey Historical Society |date=1 February 2013 |ref=harv |access-date=4 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000358/http://blog.harveyhistoricalsociety.ca/canadian-railways/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}\n* {{cite book |last=Lyons |first=Bob |title=Whitney: Island in the Shield |publisher=Bancroft Times |year=1986 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/castelmar/105663683/ This image] is a marked up version of the map in the 1910 timetable, highlighting nearby railways.

Stacey International, London, 160 pp.</ref> Some evidence suggests that global climatic events, such as [[el Ni\u00f1o]], may affect the migratory behaviour of the painted lady butterflies, causing large-scale migrations.<ref>Tilden, J.W. (1962). General characteristics of the movements of ''Vanessa cardui'' (L.). ''Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera'' 1: 43-49.</ref>\nThe first noticeable wave of migration in eastern Ukraine was noted in the 20s of April 2019. From May 15, numbers began to grow and it was possible to observe hundreds of this species in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, including in the city streets of Kharkiv.<ref>Annual report of the Department of Science and nature monitoring, National nature park \"Gomil`shans`ky Lisy\" (Ukraine, Kharkiv region). 2018 and 2019 years.</ref>\n\nBased on experimental data, the painted lady's migration pattern in northern Europe apparently does not follow a strict north-west heading. The range of headings suggests that migrating butterflies may adjust their migration patterns in response to local topographical features and weather, such as strong wind patterns. Laboratory-raised autumn-generation painted lady butterflies were able to distinguish a southern orientation for a return migration path. According to the same laboratory-based study, when butterflies were isolated from the sun, they were unable to orient themselves in a specific direction, opposed to those that did have access to the sun. This suggests that ''V. cardui'' requires a direct view of the sky, implying the use of a [[solar compass]] to orient its migratory direction and maintain a straight flight path.<ref>Nesbit, R.L., J.K.

Print.</ref>\n\n==Mating behaviour in relation to migration==\n''V. cardui'' displays a unique system of continuous mating, throughout all seasons, including the winter. This may be attributed to its migratory patterns, thus significantly affecting its mating behaviour. During European migrations, the butterflies immediately begin to mate and lay eggs upon arrival in the Mediterranean in the spring, starting in late May.<ref name=\"Stefanescu\" >Stefanescu, C., P\u00e1ramo, F., \u00c5kesson, S., Alarc\u00f3n, M., \u00c1vila, A., Brereton, T., Carnicer, J., Cassar, L.

W. (1962). \"General Characteristics of the Movements of ''Vanessa cardui'' (L.)\" ''Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera'' 43-49</ref> this allows them the opportunity to continually reproduce throughout their migrations. Because these butterflies are constantly migrating, male butterflies are thought to lack consistent territory. Instead of requiring territory to mate with females and developing evolutionary behaviour to defend this territory, the mating butterflies appear to establish a particular \"time and place\" in certain locations that they find to be suitable for reproduction. More specifically, they locate certain perches, hilltops, forest-meadow edges, or other landmarks where they will stay until, presumably, a female arrives to mate.\n\nEqually important for the reproduction of the painted lady butterflies is the males' exhibition of [[polygynous]] mating behaviour, in which they often mate with more than one female.<ref name=Mich>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Marie|title=''Vanessa cardui''|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Vanessa_cardui/#reproduction|work=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref> This is important for painted lady butterflies because the benefits may supersede the costs of polygyny<ref>Davies, N., Krebs, J., & West, S. (2012). An introduction to behavioural ecology. (4th ed.). West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> since no permanent breeding ground is used. Upon mating, which typically occurs in the afternoon, female painted lady butterflies lay eggs one by one in their desired breeding locations. The variety of [[eclosion]] locations ultimately dictates the male painted lady behaviour.<ref>Rutowski, Ronald L. (1991). \"The Evolution of Male Mate-Locating Behavior in Butterflies\". ''The American Naturalist'' '''Vol. 138, No. 5''': 1121-1139.</ref>\n\nFemale painted lady butterflies have been observed to have a relatively \"high biotic potential\", meaning they each produce large numbers of offspring. This perpetual influx of reproduction may be a reason why these painted lady butterflies have propagated so successfully. One interesting aspect that scientists have observed is that these butterflies like to fly towards rain. Further studies have suggested that the large amounts of rainfall may somehow \"activate more eggs or induce better larval development\".<ref>Abbott, Charles H. (1951). \"A Quantitative Study of the Migration of the Painted Lady Butterfly, ''Vanessa cardui'' L.\" ''Ecology'' '''Vol. 32, No. 2''': 155-171.</ref> \nInhabited locations begin to observe a large influx of new generations of painted lady butterflies in the fall, particularly in September and October. Their reproductive success declines relatively throughout the winter, primarily through November.<ref name=\"Stefanescu\" /> However, they still continue to reproduce\u2014an aspect of butterfly behaviour that is quite unique. Scientists hypothesize that these extensive migratory patterns help the painted lady butterflies find suitable conditions for breeding, thus offering a possible reason as to why these butterflies mate continuously.\n\n==Oviposition==\nAdult butterflies feed on flower nectar and aphid [[honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref>Scott, J. A. 1986. The butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press.</ref> Females oviposit on plants with nectar immediately available for the adults even if it leads to high mortality of the larvae. This lack of discrimination indicates they do not take into account volatile chemicals released from potential host plants when searching for oviposition choices.<ref>O'Neill, Bridget F., Arthur R. Zangerl, Evan H. Delucia, and May R. Berenbaum. \"Olfactory Preferences Of, AndforGrown Under Elevated CO.\" Environmental Entomology 39.4 (2010): 1291-1301. Print.</ref>\n\nThe availability of adult resources dictates preference for specific areas of flowers. Flowers with more available nectar result in a larger number of eggs deposited on the plants. This reinforces the idea that the painted lady butterfly does not discriminate host plants and chooses mainly on availability of adult food sources even if it increases mortality rate of the offspring.

Stacey International, London, 160 pp.</ref> Some evidence suggests that global climatic events, such as [[el Ni\u00f1o]], may affect the migratory behaviour of the painted lady butterflies, causing large-scale migrations.<ref>Tilden, J.W. (1962). General characteristics of the movements of ''Vanessa cardui'' (L.). ''Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera'' 1: 43-49.</ref>\nThe first noticeable wave of migration in eastern Ukraine was noted in the 20s of April 2019. From May 15, numbers began to grow and it was possible to observe hundreds of this species in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, including in the city streets of Kharkiv.<ref>Annual report of the Department of Science and nature monitoring, National nature park \"Gomil`shans`ky Lisy\" (Ukraine, Kharkiv region). 2018 and 2019 years.</ref>\n\nBased on experimental data, the painted lady's migration pattern in northern Europe apparently does not follow a strict north-west heading.  The range of headings suggests that migrating butterflies may adjust their migration patterns in response to local topographical features and weather, such as strong wind patterns.  Laboratory-raised autumn-generation painted lady butterflies were able to distinguish a southern orientation for a return migration path.  According to the same laboratory-based study, when butterflies were isolated from the sun, they were unable to orient themselves in a specific direction, opposed to those that did have access to the sun.  This suggests that ''V. cardui'' requires a direct view of the sky, implying the use of a [[solar compass]] to orient its migratory direction and maintain a straight flight path.<ref>Nesbit, R.L., J.K.

Print.</ref>\n\n==Mating behaviour in relation to migration==\n''V. cardui'' displays a unique system of continuous mating, throughout all seasons, including the winter. This may be attributed to its migratory patterns, thus  significantly affecting its mating behaviour. During European migrations, the butterflies immediately begin to mate and lay eggs upon arrival in the Mediterranean in the spring, starting in late May.<ref name=\"Stefanescu\" >Stefanescu, C., P\u00e1ramo, F., \u00c5kesson, S., Alarc\u00f3n, M., \u00c1vila, A., Brereton, T., Carnicer, J., Cassar, L.

(1962). \"General Characteristics of the Movements of ''Vanessa cardui'' (L.)\" ''Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera'' 43-49</ref> this allows them the opportunity to continually reproduce throughout their migrations. Because these butterflies are constantly migrating, male butterflies are thought to lack consistent territory. Instead of requiring territory to mate with females and developing evolutionary behaviour to defend this territory, the mating butterflies appear to establish a particular \"time and place\" in certain locations that they find to be suitable for reproduction. More specifically, they locate certain perches, hilltops, forest-meadow edges, or other landmarks where they will stay until, presumably, a female arrives to mate.\n\nEqually important for the reproduction of the painted lady butterflies is the males' exhibition of [[polygynous]] mating behaviour, in which they often mate with more than one female.<ref name=Mich>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Marie|title=''Vanessa cardui''|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Vanessa_cardui/#reproduction|work=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>  This is important for painted lady butterflies because the benefits may supersede the costs of polygyny<ref>Davies, N., Krebs, J., & West, S. (2012). An introduction to behavioural ecology. (4th ed.). West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> since no permanent breeding ground is used.  Upon mating, which typically occurs in the afternoon, female painted lady butterflies lay eggs one by one in their desired breeding locations. The variety of [[eclosion]] locations ultimately dictates the male painted lady behaviour.<ref>Rutowski, Ronald L. (1991). \"The Evolution of Male Mate-Locating Behavior in Butterflies\". ''The American Naturalist'' '''Vol. 138, No. 5''': 1121-1139.</ref>\n\nFemale painted lady butterflies have been observed to have a relatively \"high biotic potential\", meaning they each produce large numbers of offspring. This perpetual influx of reproduction may be a reason why these painted lady butterflies have propagated so successfully. One interesting aspect that scientists have observed is that these butterflies like to fly towards rain. Further studies have suggested that the large amounts of rainfall may somehow \"activate more eggs or induce better larval development\".<ref>Abbott, Charles H. (1951). \"A Quantitative Study of the Migration of the Painted Lady Butterfly, ''Vanessa cardui'' L.\" ''Ecology'' '''Vol. 32, No. 2''': 155-171.</ref> \nInhabited locations begin to observe a large influx of new generations of painted lady butterflies in the fall, particularly in September and October. Their reproductive success declines relatively throughout the winter, primarily through November.<ref name=\"Stefanescu\" /> However, they still continue to reproduce\u2014an aspect of butterfly behaviour that is quite unique. Scientists hypothesize that these extensive migratory patterns help the painted lady butterflies find suitable conditions for breeding, thus offering a possible reason as to why these butterflies mate continuously.\n\n==Oviposition==\nAdult butterflies feed on flower nectar and aphid [[honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref>Scott, J. A. 1986. The butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press.</ref> Females oviposit on plants with nectar immediately available for the adults even if it leads to high mortality of the larvae. This lack of discrimination indicates they do not take into account volatile chemicals released from potential host plants when searching for oviposition choices.<ref>O'Neill, Bridget F., Arthur R. Zangerl, Evan H. Delucia, and May R. Berenbaum. \"Olfactory Preferences Of, AndforGrown Under Elevated CO.\" Environmental Entomology 39.4 (2010): 1291-1301. Print.</ref>\n\nThe availability of adult resources dictates preference for specific areas of flowers.  Flowers with more available nectar result in a larger number of eggs deposited on the plants.  This reinforces the idea that the painted lady butterfly does not discriminate host plants and chooses mainly on availability of adult food sources even if it increases mortality rate of the offspring.  The data also suggest that the painted lady butterfly favours quantity of offspring over quality.<ref>Janz, Niklas. \"The Relationship Between Habitat Selection And Preference For Adult And Larval Food Resources In The Polyphagous Butterfly ''Vanessa cardui'' (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)\".
