In the first edition, Murshid Quli Khan was bought as a slave of Iran's high-ranking Mughal officer named [[Haji Shafi Isfahani]]. Isfahani educated him. On his return to India, he joined the [[Mughal Empire]]. In 6, he is converted to [[Islam]] in the presence of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], who named him as Kartalab Khan, and appointed him as thr governor of Bengal. In another version he was the grandson of [[Maratha General]] [[Muhammad Quli Khan]]. But the most popular is that Murshid Quli Khan was born into a poor Deccan plateau [[Oriya]] [[Brahmin]] family. Before being sold as a slave to [[Haji Shafi Isfahan]] to a Persian merchant, who was a [[Shia]] muslim, he was converted to Islam. Some source says he changed his name to Muhammad Hadi or Mirza Hadi. He took a job under [[Dewan Haji Abdullah Quraishi]] in the province of Berar. Later, the Dewan emperor of Berar province came under [[Aurangzeb]].\n\nSome source states, born a [[Hindu]] in the [[Deccan Plateau]] {{circa}} 1670, Murshid Quli Khan was bought by Mughal noble Haji Shafi. After Shafi's death, he worked under the [[Divan]] of [[Vidarbha]], during which time he piqued the attention of the then-emperor [[Aurangzeb]], who sent him to [[Bengal]] as the divan {{circa}} 1700. However, he entered into a bloody conflict with the province's ''[[subahdar]]'', [[Azim-us-Shan]]. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, he was transferred to the Deccan Plateau by Azim-us-Shan's father the Mughal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah I]]. However, he was brought back as deputy ''subahdar'' in 1710. In 1717, he was appointed as the ''Nawab Nazim'' of Murshidabad by [[Farrukhsiyar]]. During his reign, he changed the ''[[jagirdari]]'' system (land management) to the ''mal jasmani,'' which would later transform into the ''[[zamindari]]'' system. He also continued sending revenues from the state to the [[Mughal Empire]]. He built the [[Katra Masjid]] mosque at [[Murshidabad]] where he was buried under the steps of the staircase after his death on 30 June 1727. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Shuja ud Din Muhammad Khan.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to [[Sir Jadunath Sarkar]], Murshid Quli Khan was originally a [[Hindu]]  as Surya Narayan Mishra, born in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] {{circa}} 1670.<ref>Sarkar, p.400</ref> The book ''[[Ma'asir al-umara]]'' supports this statement.<ref name=\"MQK\">Chowdhury, p.16</ref> At the age of around ten years, he was sold to a Persian named Haji Shafi who circumcised him,{{refn|group=note|Shafi worked in various posts in the [[Mughal Empire]] which included Diwan-i-Tan and Dewan of Bengal.<ref name=\"MQK\"/>}} and raised him with the name Mohammad Hadi.<ref name=\"MQK\"/> In {{circa}} 1690, Shafi left his position in the Mughal court and returned to Persia accompanied by Murshid Quli Khan. About five years after Shafi's death, Murshid returned to India and worked under Abdullah Khurasani, the Diwan of [[Vidarbha]] in the Mughal Empire. Due to his expertise in revenue matters, he was noticed by Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] and played an important when applying the [[sharia]] based [[Fatwa Alamgiri's]] financial strategies.<ref name=\"MQK\"/>\n\nUnlike other Islamic rulers, Murshid Quli Khan had only one wife, Nasiri Banu Begum, and no concubines. He had three children, two daughters and one son. One of his daughters became the wife of [[Nawab]] [[Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan]] and mother of [[Sarfaraz Khan]].<ref>Chowdhury, p.87</ref>\n\n==First appointment in Bengal==\n\n===Conflict with Azim-us-Shan===\nAurangzeb appointed Quli Khan the Diwan of Bengal {{circa}} 1700. At that time, [[Azim-us-Shan]], a grandson of the Mughal emperor, was the ''subahdar'' of the province. He was not pleased at this appointment as he intend to use the revenue collected from the state to fund his campaign to occupy the Mughal throne after Aurangzeb's death.<ref name=\"MQ\">Chowdhury, p.17</ref> Immediately after being appointed to the post, Quli Khan went to Jahangirnagar (present day [[Dhaka]]) and transferred officials from the service of Azim-us-Shan to himself, enraging Azim-us-Shan.<ref name=\"MQ\"/>\n\n===Assassination attempt===\nAzim-us-Shan planned to assassinate Quli Khan. Taking advantage of the fact the soldiers had yet to be paid, he convinced them that Quli Khan was responsible for the situation. He planned to have them surround Quli Khan on the pretext of confronting him over non-payment of their wages, and he would then be stabbed.<ref name=\"MQ\"/>\n\nOne morning when Quli Khan was going to meet Azim-us-Shan, soldiers, under the leadership of Abdul Wahid, surrounded him and asked him for their wages. But, according to Historian Chowdhury, Quli Khan knew that us-Shan was responsible for inciting the soldiers,<ref name=\"MQ\"/> so he said to them: \"You have conspired to assassinate me. Remember that the ''Alamgir'' (Aurangzeb) will come to know everything. Abstain from doing such things, as it is a way of showing disrespect to the emperor. Be careful! If you kill me, then you will face dire consequences.\"<ref name=\"Sarkar, p.404\">Sarkar, p.404</ref>\n\nAzim-us-Shan was extremely worried Quli Khan knew of his assassination plans and was fearful of Aurangzeb's reaction. Quli Khan behaved as if he knew nothing of the plan assuring us-Shan they would remain friends in the future. However, he wrote about the matter to Aurangzeb, who in turn sent a letter to us-Shan warning him that if Quli Khan was \"harmed, then he would take revenge on him\".<ref name=\"ME\">Chowdhury, p.18</ref>\n\n==Foundation of Murshidabad==\nQuli Khan felt unsafe in Dhaka, so he moved the ''diwani'' office to Mukshudabad.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Ain-i-Akbari]], Mukshudabad was founded by a trader named Mukshud Khan in the sixteenth century who also built a ''sarai'' here. On Dutch traveller Valentijn's map, the city was shown as an island in the [[Ganges]] River. According to historian Nikhilnath Roy, during the reign of Sultan Hussain Shah, he was cured of fever by sage, so the city was named after it in 1702.<ref name=\"MQKTT\">Chowdhury, p.20</ref>}} He said that he relocated the office since Mukshudabad was situated in the central part of Bengal, making it easy to communicate throughout the province. As the city was on the banks of the Ganges, European trading companies had also set up their bases there. Quli Khan thought that it would be easy for him to keep a vigil over their actions. He also relocated the bankers to the new city. Azim-us-Shan felt betrayed as this was done without his permission. Historian Chowdhury says that Quli Khan was able to do this because he had the \"support\" of Aurangzeb.<ref name=\"MQN\">Choudhury, p.19</ref> A year later, in 1703, Aurangzeb transferred us-Shan from Bengal to [[Bihar]] and [[Farrukhsiyar]] was made the titular ''subahdar'' of the province. The ''[[subah]]'' office was then relocated to Mukshudabad. The city became a centre for all activities of the region.<ref name=\"MQN\"/>\n\nQuli Khan went to [[Bijapur]] to meet Aurangzeb, and to give him the revenue which was generated from the province. The emperor was happy with his work and gifted him clothes, flags, ''nagra,'' and a sword. He also gave him the title of Murshid Quli and gave him permission to rename the city [[Murshidabad]] (the city of Murshid Quli Khan), which he did when he returned to it.<ref name=\"Sarkar, p.404\"/>\n\nWhen the city was renamed is disputed by historians. [[Sir Jadunath Sarkar]] says that he was given the title on 23 December 1702, and his return to the city would have taken at least three months; so Mukshudabad was renamed in 1703.<ref>Sarkar, p.399</ref> But according to the newspaper ''Tarikh-i-Bangla,'' and Persian historian Riwaz-us-Salatin, the city was renamed in {{circa}} 1704. Chowdhury opines that this \"might be the correct date\" as the representative of the [[British East Indian Company]] in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] province met Quli Khan in early 1704. The fact that the first coins issued in Murshidabad are dated 1704 is strong evidence of the year of the name change.<ref>Chowdhury, p.21</ref>\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Death of Aurangzeb===\nUntil the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, all the powers of the ''subahdar'' were vested in the hands of Quli Khan. He was succeeded by Azim-us-Shan's father [[Bahadur Shah I]]. He reappointed his son as the ''subahdar'' of the province and made Quli Khan his deputy. Azim-us-Shan influenced his father to throw Quli Khan out of the province. As a result, he was appointed the Diwan of Deccan in 1708, and served in the post until 1709.<ref name=\"MQKTF\">Chowdhury, p.24</ref>\n\nBut, in 1710, Quli Khan was brought back as the ''[[Dewan|diwan]]'' (revenue officer) of the province on the advice of us-Shan. According to Sarkar, he did so to form an allegiance with him, as he thought that it would be impossible to occupy the Delhi throne without the support of local nobility. Though he was brought back, his relationship with the Mughal prince remained stained.<ref>Sarkar, p.405</ref>\n\nShah was succeeded by [[Jahandar Shah]] in 1712, (27 February 1712 \u2013 11 February 1713) and he was followed by Farrukhsiyar in 1713. In 1717,{{refn|group=note|Historian Abdul Karim disputes the date and claims it to be 1716, but all other sources use 1717.<ref name=\"MQKTF\"/>}} he gave Quli Khan the title of Zafar Khan and made him the Subahdar of Bengal, thus holding both the post of ''subahdar'' and ''diwan'' at the same time. He declared himself the [[Nawab]] of Bengal and became the first independent ''nawab'' of the province.<ref>Sarkar, p.407</ref> The capital was shifted from Dhaka to Murshidabad.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\"/>\n\n===Revenue===\nQuli Khan replaced the Mughal ''[[jagirdari]]'' system with the ''mal jasmani'' system, which was similar to France's ''[[Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale|fermiers generals]]''. He took security bonds from the contractors or ''ijardaars'' who later collected the land revenue. Though at first there remained many ''jagirdars'', they were shortly squeezed out by the contractors, who later came to be known as ''zamindars''.<ref>{{cite book |author1=U. A. B. Razia Akter Banu |year=1992 |title=Islam in Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyzqATEDPSgC&pg=PA21 |publisher=E. J. Brill |page=21 |isbn=978-90-04-09497-0}}</ref>\n\nQuli Khan continued his policy of sending part of the revenue collected to the Mughal Empire. He did so even when the empire was in decline with the emperor vesting no power, as the power became concentrated in the hands of kingmakers. He justified his action by saying that it would be impossible to run the Mughal Empire without the revenue he sent. Historian Chowdhury says that his real reason was to show his loyalty to the Mughal Emperor so that he could run the state according to his own wishes.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\">Chowdhury, p.25</ref>\n\nRecords show that every year 1 crore 30 lakh rupees was sent as the revenue to the Mughal emperor. Besides money revenue was also paid in kind.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} Quli Khan himself used to carry the money and other forms of revenue with the [[infantry]] and the [[cavalry]] to [[Bihar]] where they were given to the Mughal collector.<ref name=\"MQKTS\"/>\n\n===Structures built===\nWith Murshidabad evolving as the capital of [[Bengal]], it became necessary for Quli Khan to build buildings and offices for work to be carried out from that city. In the Dugharia region of the city he built a palace, a ''diwankhana'' (\"office of revenue collection\", a court of exchequer). He also built an inn and a mosque for foreign travellers. He also constructed a mint in the city in 1720.<ref name=\"MQKTS\">Chowdhury, p.26</ref> In the eastern end of the city he built the [[Katra Masjid]] mosque in 1724 where he was buried after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Begum |first=Ayesha |year=2012 |chapter=Katra Mosque, Murshidabad |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Katra_Mosque,_Murshidabad |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions in Murshidabad===\nDuring Quli Khan's reign  the people of the Murshidabad used to participate in many festivals. One of them was the ''Punyah'' which occurred in the last week of the Bengali month of ''Chaitra''. The ''[[zamindar]]s,'' or their representatives, took part in it. However, the festival which was celebrated with the greatest pomp and grandeur was [[Mawlid]] the festival to celebrate the birth of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. During Mawlid people from neighbouring provinces came to the city to celebrate. On Quli Khan's order ''chirag'' or lamps were lit in all religious places such as mosques, and ''imambararas.''<ref name=\"MQKTSE\">Chowdhury, p.27</ref>\n\nQuli Khan also imitated the Mughal tradition of holding a ''durbar'' in the city which was attended by the city's bankers, foreign tourists, and European companies' representatives. Because of the increase in trade, a new class of businessmen arose who also attended his ''durbar''. Due to his pious nature, Quli Khan followed [[Islam]] strictly and, according to Islamic rules, visitors were fed twice a day.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nPrior to Quli Khan being the nawab of Murshidabad, the city was a major exporter of [[rice]] across India. But, after he became the nawab {{circa}} 1720, he passed a law prohibiting the export of rice. For this reason, the cost of rice in the region rose.<ref>Murshidabader Itihash by Nikhilnath Roy, p.471</ref> According to his minister Gulam Hussain the cost became Rs 1 per 5 ''mon''.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nHistorian Chowdhury says that the condition of Hindus during his reign was \"also good\" as \"they became more rich\"(''sic''). Though Quli Khan was a Muslim, Hindus were employed in the tax department primarily because he thought they were experts in the field; they could also speak fluent [[Persian language|Persian]].

In the first edition, [[Murshid Quli Khan]] was bought as a slave of Iran's high-ranking Mughal officer named [[Haji Shafi Isfahani]]. Isfahani educated him. On his return to India, he joined the [[Mughal Empire]]. In 6, he is converted to [[Islam]] in the presence of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], who named him as Kartalab Khan, and appointed him as thr governor of Bengal. In another version he was the grandson of [[Maratha General]] [[Muhammad Quli Khan]]. But the most popular is that [[Murshid Quli Khan]] was born into a poor Deccan plateau [[Oriya]] [[Brahmin]] family. Before being sold as a slave to [[Haji Shafi Isfahan]] to a Persian merchant, who was a [[Shia]] muslim, he was converted to Islam. Some source says he changed his name to Muhammad Hadi or Mirza Hadi. He took a job under [[Dewan Haji Abdullah Quraishi]] in the province of Berar. Later, the Dewan emperor of Berar province came under [[Aurangzeb]].\n\nSome source states, born a [[Hindu]] in the [[Deccan Plateau]] {{circa}} 1670, [[Murshid Quli Khan]] was bought by Mughal noble Haji Shafi. After Shafi's death, he worked under the [[Divan]] of [[Vidarbha]], during which time he piqued the attention of the then-emperor [[Aurangzeb]], who sent him to [[Bengal]] as the divan {{circa}} 1700. However, he entered into a bloody conflict with the province's ''[[subahdar]]'', [[Azim-us-Shan]]. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, he was transferred to the Deccan Plateau by Azim-us-Shan's father the Mughal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah I]]. However, he was brought back as deputy ''subahdar'' in 1710. In 1717, he was appointed as the ''Nawab Nazim'' of Murshidabad by [[Farrukhsiyar]]. During his reign, he changed the ''[[jagirdari]]'' system (land management) to the ''mal jasmani,'' which would later transform into the ''[[zamindari]]'' system. He also continued sending revenues from the state to the [[Mughal Empire]]. He built the [[Katra Masjid]] mosque at [[Murshidabad]] where he was buried under the steps of the staircase after his death on 30 June 1727. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Shuja ud Din Muhammad Khan.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to [[Sir Jadunath Sarkar]], Murshid Quli Khan was originally a [[Hindu]]  as '''Surya Narayan Mishra''', born in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] {{circa}} 1670.<ref>Sarkar, p.400</ref> The book ''[[Ma'asir al-umara]]'' supports this statement.<ref name=\"MQK\">Chowdhury, p.16</ref> At the age of around ten years, he was sold to a Persian named Haji Shafi who circumcised him,{{refn|group=note|Shafi worked in various posts in the [[Mughal Empire]] which included Diwan-i-Tan and Dewan of Bengal.<ref name=\"MQK\"/>}} and raised him with the name Mohammad Hadi.<ref name=\"MQK\"/> In {{circa}} 1690, Shafi left his position in the Mughal court and returned to Persia accompanied by Murshid Quli Khan. About five years after Shafi's death, Murshid returned to India and worked under Abdullah Khurasani, the Diwan of [[Vidarbha]] in the Mughal Empire. Due to his expertise in revenue matters, he was noticed by Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] and played an important when applying the [[sharia]] based [[Fatwa Alamgiri's]] financial strategies.<ref name=\"MQK\"/>\n\nUnlike other Islamic rulers, Murshid Quli Khan had only one wife, Nasiri Banu Begum, and no concubines. He had three children, two daughters and one son. One of his daughters became the wife of [[Nawab]] [[Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan]] and mother of [[Sarfaraz Khan]].<ref>Chowdhury, p.87</ref>\n\n==First appointment in Bengal==\n\n===Conflict with Azim-us-Shan===\nAurangzeb appointed Quli Khan the Diwan of Bengal {{circa}} 1700. At that time, [[Azim-us-Shan]], a grandson of the Mughal emperor, was the ''subahdar'' of the province. He was not pleased at this appointment as he intend to use the revenue collected from the state to fund his campaign to occupy the Mughal throne after Aurangzeb's death.<ref name=\"MQ\">Chowdhury, p.17</ref> Immediately after being appointed to the post, Quli Khan went to Jahangirnagar (present day [[Dhaka]]) and transferred officials from the service of Azim-us-Shan to himself, enraging Azim-us-Shan.<ref name=\"MQ\"/>\n\n===Assassination attempt===\nAzim-us-Shan planned to assassinate Quli Khan. Taking advantage of the fact the soldiers had yet to be paid, he convinced them that Quli Khan was responsible for the situation. He planned to have them surround Quli Khan on the pretext of confronting him over non-payment of their wages, and he would then be stabbed.<ref name=\"MQ\"/>\n\nOne morning when Quli Khan was going to meet Azim-us-Shan, soldiers, under the leadership of Abdul Wahid, surrounded him and asked him for their wages. But, according to Historian Chowdhury, Quli Khan knew that us-Shan was responsible for inciting the soldiers,<ref name=\"MQ\"/> so he said to them: \"You have conspired to assassinate me. Remember that the ''Alamgir'' (Aurangzeb) will come to know everything. Abstain from doing such things, as it is a way of showing disrespect to the emperor. Be careful! If you kill me, then you will face dire consequences.\"<ref name=\"Sarkar, p.404\">Sarkar, p.404</ref>\n\nAzim-us-Shan was extremely worried Quli Khan knew of his assassination plans and was fearful of Aurangzeb's reaction. Quli Khan behaved as if he knew nothing of the plan assuring us-Shan they would remain friends in the future. However, he wrote about the matter to Aurangzeb, who in turn sent a letter to us-Shan warning him that if Quli Khan was \"harmed, then he would take revenge on him\".<ref name=\"ME\">Chowdhury, p.18</ref>\n\n==Foundation of Murshidabad==\nQuli Khan felt unsafe in Dhaka, so he moved the ''diwani'' office to Mukshudabad.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Ain-i-Akbari]], Mukshudabad was founded by a trader named Mukshud Khan in the sixteenth century who also built a ''sarai'' here. On Dutch traveller Valentijn's map, the city was shown as an island in the [[Ganges]] River. According to historian Nikhilnath Roy, during the reign of Sultan Hussain Shah, he was cured of fever by sage, so the city was named after it in 1702.<ref name=\"MQKTT\">Chowdhury, p.20</ref>}} He said that he relocated the office since Mukshudabad was situated in the central part of Bengal, making it easy to communicate throughout the province. As the city was on the banks of the Ganges, European trading companies had also set up their bases there. Quli Khan thought that it would be easy for him to keep a vigil over their actions. He also relocated the bankers to the new city. Azim-us-Shan felt betrayed as this was done without his permission. Historian Chowdhury says that Quli Khan was able to do this because he had the \"support\" of Aurangzeb.<ref name=\"MQN\">Choudhury, p.19</ref> A year later, in 1703, Aurangzeb transferred us-Shan from Bengal to [[Bihar]] and [[Farrukhsiyar]] was made the titular ''subahdar'' of the province. The ''[[subah]]'' office was then relocated to Mukshudabad. The city became a centre for all activities of the region.<ref name=\"MQN\"/>\n\nQuli Khan went to [[Bijapur]] to meet Aurangzeb, and to give him the revenue which was generated from the province. The emperor was happy with his work and gifted him clothes, flags, ''nagra,'' and a sword. He also gave him the title of Murshid Quli and gave him permission to rename the city [[Murshidabad]] (the city of Murshid Quli Khan), which he did when he returned to it.<ref name=\"Sarkar, p.404\"/>\n\nWhen the city was renamed is disputed by historians. [[Sir Jadunath Sarkar]] says that he was given the title on 23 December 1702, and his return to the city would have taken at least three months; so Mukshudabad was renamed in 1703.<ref>Sarkar, p.399</ref> But according to the newspaper ''Tarikh-i-Bangla,'' and Persian historian Riwaz-us-Salatin, the city was renamed in {{circa}} 1704. Chowdhury opines that this \"might be the correct date\" as the representative of the [[British East Indian Company]] in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] province met Quli Khan in early 1704. The fact that the first coins issued in Murshidabad are dated 1704 is strong evidence of the year of the name change.<ref>Chowdhury, p.21</ref>\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Death of Aurangzeb===\nUntil the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, all the powers of the ''subahdar'' were vested in the hands of Quli Khan. He was succeeded by Azim-us-Shan's father [[Bahadur Shah I]]. He reappointed his son as the ''subahdar'' of the province and made Quli Khan his deputy. Azim-us-Shan influenced his father to throw Quli Khan out of the province. As a result, he was appointed the Diwan of Deccan in 1708, and served in the post until 1709.<ref name=\"MQKTF\">Chowdhury, p.24</ref>\n\nBut, in 1710, Quli Khan was brought back as the ''[[Dewan|diwan]]'' (revenue officer) of the province on the advice of us-Shan. According to Sarkar, he did so to form an allegiance with him, as he thought that it would be impossible to occupy the Delhi throne without the support of local nobility. Though he was brought back, his relationship with the Mughal prince remained stained.<ref>Sarkar, p.405</ref>\n\nShah was succeeded by [[Jahandar Shah]] in 1712, (27 February 1712 \u2013 11 February 1713) and he was followed by Farrukhsiyar in 1713. In 1717,{{refn|group=note|Historian Abdul Karim disputes the date and claims it to be 1716, but all other sources use 1717.<ref name=\"MQKTF\"/>}} he gave Quli Khan the title of Zafar Khan and made him the Subahdar of Bengal, thus holding both the post of ''subahdar'' and ''diwan'' at the same time. He declared himself the [[Nawab]] of Bengal and became the first independent ''nawab'' of the province.<ref>Sarkar, p.407</ref> The capital was shifted from Dhaka to Murshidabad.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\"/>\n\n===Revenue===\nQuli Khan replaced the Mughal ''[[jagirdari]]'' system with the ''mal jasmani'' system, which was similar to France's ''[[Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale|fermiers generals]]''. He took security bonds from the contractors or ''ijardaars'' who later collected the land revenue. Though at first there remained many ''jagirdars'', they were shortly squeezed out by the contractors, who later came to be known as ''zamindars''.<ref>{{cite book |author1=U. A. B. Razia Akter Banu |year=1992 |title=Islam in Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyzqATEDPSgC&pg=PA21 |publisher=E. J. Brill |page=21 |isbn=978-90-04-09497-0}}</ref>\n\nQuli Khan continued his policy of sending part of the revenue collected to the Mughal Empire. He did so even when the empire was in decline with the emperor vesting no power, as the power became concentrated in the hands of kingmakers. He justified his action by saying that it would be impossible to run the Mughal Empire without the revenue he sent. Historian Chowdhury says that his real reason was to show his loyalty to the Mughal Emperor so that he could run the state according to his own wishes.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\">Chowdhury, p.25</ref>\n\nRecords show that every year 1 crore 30 lakh rupees was sent as the revenue to the Mughal emperor. Besides money revenue was also paid in kind.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} Quli Khan himself used to carry the money and other forms of revenue with the [[infantry]] and the [[cavalry]] to [[Bihar]] where they were given to the Mughal collector.<ref name=\"MQKTS\"/>\n\n===Structures built===\nWith Murshidabad evolving as the capital of [[Bengal]], it became necessary for Quli Khan to build buildings and offices for work to be carried out from that city. In the Dugharia region of the city he built a palace, a ''diwankhana'' (\"office of revenue collection\", a court of exchequer). He also built an inn and a mosque for foreign travellers. He also constructed a mint in the city in 1720.<ref name=\"MQKTS\">Chowdhury, p.26</ref> In the eastern end of the city he built the [[Katra Masjid]] mosque in 1724 where he was buried after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Begum |first=Ayesha |year=2012 |chapter=Katra Mosque, Murshidabad |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Katra_Mosque,_Murshidabad |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions in Murshidabad===\nDuring Quli Khan's reign  the people of the Murshidabad used to participate in many festivals. One of them was the ''Punyah'' which occurred in the last week of the Bengali month of ''Chaitra''. The ''[[zamindar]]s,'' or their representatives, took part in it. However, the festival which was celebrated with the greatest pomp and grandeur was [[Mawlid]] the festival to celebrate the birth of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. During Mawlid people from neighbouring provinces came to the city to celebrate. On Quli Khan's order ''chirag'' or lamps were lit in all religious places such as mosques, and ''imambararas.''<ref name=\"MQKTSE\">Chowdhury, p.27</ref>\n\nQuli Khan also imitated the Mughal tradition of holding a ''durbar'' in the city which was attended by the city's bankers, foreign tourists, and European companies' representatives. Because of the increase in trade, a new class of businessmen arose who also attended his ''durbar''. Due to his pious nature, Quli Khan followed [[Islam]] strictly and, according to Islamic rules, visitors were fed twice a day.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nPrior to Quli Khan being the nawab of Murshidabad, the city was a major exporter of [[rice]] across India. But, after he became the nawab {{circa}} 1720, he passed a law prohibiting the export of rice. For this reason, the cost of rice in the region rose.<ref>Murshidabader Itihash by Nikhilnath Roy, p.471</ref> According to his minister Gulam Hussain the cost became Rs 1 per 5 ''mon''.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nHistorian Chowdhury says that the condition of Hindus during his reign was \"also good\" as \"they became more rich\"(''sic''). Though Quli Khan was a Muslim, Hindus were employed in the tax department primarily because he thought they were experts in the field; they could also speak fluent [[Persian language|Persian]]. However, if they were found guilty of cheating, Quli Khan imposed harsh punishments compared to those imposed upon Muslims.<ref>Chowdhury, p.28</ref>\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:TombofMurshidQuliKhan.jpg|thumb|Khan's tomb under the stairs of [[Katra Masjid]]]]\nQuli Khan died on 30 June 1727.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammed Yamin|title=Impact of Islam on Orissan Culture|publisher=Readworthy|isbn=9789350181027|page=46}}</ref> He was succeeded initially by his grandson [[Sarfaraz Khan]].
