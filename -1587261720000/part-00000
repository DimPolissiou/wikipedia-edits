The original draft of the Mitrelias Committee, however, was deemed too liberal, and was heavily amended in the following months. In its final form, as presented on 11 July 1968, it retained the [[Greek monarchy|monarchy]], but granted the armed forces autonomy from governmental and parliamentary control and entrusted them with the role of guardians of the ''status quo'', it imposed restrictions on political parties and established a constitutional watchdog, the Constitutional Court, with wide-ranging powers, to regulate the country's political life.\n\nThe referendum itself was proclaimed for 29 September, and was regarded by the regime as a public vote of support on its policies. Participation was made obligatory and abstention punishable by imprisonment. The regime employed extensive propaganda in favour of a \"yes\" vote, while any opposition was silenced. The referendum's results were thus predictably in favour of the new constitution.

The company established a library and its [[Clockmakers' Museum|Museum]] in 1813, which is the oldest specific collection of clocks and watches worldwide.<ref>https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/clockmakers-museum</ref> This is administered by the company's affiliated charity, the Clockmakers\u2019 Charity,<ref>Charity No. 275380 registered with the UK Charity Commission</ref> and is presently housed on the second floor of London's [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]. The modern aims of the company and its Museum are charitable and educational, in particular to promote and preserve clockmaking and watchmaking, which as of 2019 were added to the [[HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts]].\n\n==Museum==\nThe [[Clockmakers' Museum|Clockmakers\u2019 Museum]], first established in 1813, was housed at London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] from 1874 to 2014. The collection of clocks and watches was moved to a new gallery provided by the Science Museum, officially opened by HRH [[Princess Anne]] on 22 October 2015. The company's archive and library are however still kept at [[Guildhall Library]]. The collection includes [[John Harrison|John Harrison's]] sea watch H5, once personally tested by [[King George III]].\n\n==Motto==\nThe company's motto, ''Tempus Rerum Imperator'', can be translated as \u2018Time, the Ruler of All Things\u2019. It appears as an epitaph on the tombstone of former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], a liveryman of the company. It has also been adopted by the [[Google Web Accelerator]] project.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the seventeenth century, clockmaking by native English craftsmen was mostly confined to the production of [[turret clocks]]. Domestic clocks and watches were mostly imported or the work of immigrants from the Continent. Because turret clock making involved working in ferrous metal, clockmakers within the City of London tended to be freemen of the [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths|Blacksmiths\u2019 Company]], though some were members of other livery companies, notably the [[Worshipful Company of Clothworkers|Clothworkers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Lantern Clocks|last=White|first=George|publisher=ACC|year=1989|location=|pages=51\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the loss of many London clock and watchmakers in the plagues of 1598 and 1603, the trade consolidated and began to grow. The continued influx of newcomers led to resentment from those who had become established in London towards outsiders who came to set up in or near the City and who threatened their market. From 1620 onwards, groups of clockmakers attempted to set up their own guild. The Blacksmiths initially succeeded in opposing these moves. Eventually, however, with the King issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a Royal Charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clockmakers of London|last=White|first=George|publisher=WCC|year=2018|location=London|pages=14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe Charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have \u2018continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking\u2019. It provided that the Fellowship should be governed by a Master, three Wardens and ten or more Assistants who would form the Court. The first Master was [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]], a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to [[James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England. The noted clockmaker [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]] also formed part of the first Court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|last=Atkins|first=Samuel|publisher=|year=1881|location=London|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nThe original Charter is still in the company's possession and is housed with the rest of its library and archive in the Guildhall Library.<ref>See the catalogue of the London Metropolitan Archive, reference CLC/L/CD</ref>\nThe company obtained a [[grant of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]] in January 1672.

His father's name was Gisu.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of [[Ank\u014d Asato]], a karate and [[Jigen-ry\u016b]] master who would soon become his first karate teacher.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> \n\u2212\t\nFunakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the Meiji government's abolition of the Japanese [[Chonmage|topknot]], and this meant that he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school (where topknots were banned), despite having passed the entrance examination.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings. Funakoshi was not supportive of all of the changes that the JKA eventually made to his karate style.

From about eleven years old he began to study to-te jutsu under [[Azato Anko]] and [[Itosu Anko]]. He practiced diligently and in 1912 became the president of the Okinawan Shobukai. In May 1922, he relocated to Tokyo and became a professional teacher of karate-do. He devoted his entire life to the development of karate-do. He lived out his eighty-eight years of life and left this world on April 26, 1957. Reinterpreting to-te jutsu, the Sensei promulgated karate-do while not losing its original philosophy. Like bugei (classical martial arts), so too is the pinnacle of karate \u201cmu\u201d (enlightenment): to purify and make one empty through the transformation from \u201cjutsu\u201d to \u201cdo\u201d.

His father's name was Gisu.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of [[Ank\u014d Asato]], a karate and [[Jigen-ry\u016b]] master who would soon become his first karate teacher.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> \n\u2212\t\nFunakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the Meiji government's abolition of the Japanese [[Chonmage|topknot]], and this meant that he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school (where topknots were banned), despite having passed the entrance examination.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings. Funakoshi was not supportive of all of the changes that the JKA eventually made to his karate style. He resigned from the JKA in 1956 in order to reduce friction between the JKA and Shotokai.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died of [[colorectal cancer]] in 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".

In the [[philosophy of science]], it is the same, except that the observations used to show '''falsifiability''' (or '''refutability''') are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] in his book ''Logik der Forschung'' (1934, revised and translated into English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), as an attempt to solve both the [[problem of induction]] and the [[demarcation problem]]. He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nPopper opposed falsifiability to '''verifiability'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]-->. For example, in order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, a [[ceteris paribus]] clause must say that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that one relaxes the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses. Very often one must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other. It is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that induction is actually never used in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Instead, laws are conjectured, tested and the results are considered together with other aspects to decide which of these laws are applied in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of some philosophers of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], especially [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true, either in practice or in theory. Popper had to explain why a different demarcation criterion was needed. He considered both the practical and the basic philosophical sides. \n\nOn the practical side, Popper pointed out his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper argued that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which are used to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When  this distinction is applied to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if it is accepted that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though it is possible to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Another example is \"this angel does not have large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though the absence of large wings can be observed, no technology (independent of the presence of wings<ref name=\"iftechnologyiswingsthentautology\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require using a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>  would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's two senses of number statements}}\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

In the [[philosophy of science]], it is the same, except that the observations used to show '''falsifiability''' (or '''refutability''') are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] in his book ''Logik der Forschung'' (1934, revised and translated into English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), as an attempt to solve both the [[problem of induction]] and the [[demarcation problem]]. He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nPopper opposed falsifiability to '''verifiability'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]-->. For example, in order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, a [[ceteris paribus]] clause must say that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that one relaxes the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses. Very often one must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other. It is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that induction is actually never used in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Instead, laws are conjectured, tested and the results are considered together with other aspects to decide which of these laws are applied in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of some philosophers of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], especially [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Friedrich Waismann]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true, either in practice or in theory. Popper had to explain why a different demarcation criteria was needed. He considered both the practical and the basic philosophical sides. \n\nOn the practical side, Popper pointed out his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper argued that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which are used to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When  this distinction is applied to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if it is accepted that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though it is possible to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Another example is \"this angel does not have large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though the absence of large wings can be observed, no technology (independent of the presence of wings<ref name=\"iftechnologyiswingsthentautology\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require using a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>  would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's two senses of number statements}}\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].
