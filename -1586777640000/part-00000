The tower was octagonal, wooden, with its sides painted alternately red and white, {{convert|15.54|m|ft}} high, base to vane.  During its first winter the lead roof was blown off in a heavy gale and the light was out until the lantern could be replaced with a new iron lantern.  It was so exceedingly cold that the lightkeeper, Robert McNab, was forced to put pans of hot coals around the inside of  the lantern to keep the light going; it was nearly impossible to keep up a flame from poor-grade oil when the temperature was minus 25 to 30 degrees Celsius.  In 1856, McNab complained that there had been no repairs or improvements of any consequence in the 19 years of the light's operation.  In particular, the tiny dwelling required considerable repair, and the light leading into the increasingly busy Sydney Harbour was considered to be inadequate.  New lamps were supplied immediately, which did improve the light, but it was another seven years before a new octagonal iron lantern was installed, providing the room necessary for larger oil burners and reflectors.\n\n[[File:Low Point Lighthouse Plan.jpg|thumb|left|Low Point Lighthouse Plan]]\nBy 1878, it was once again necessary to increase the size of the lantern; to accommodate it, the tower had to be strengthened structurally. A temporary light was fitted {{convert|4.87|m|ft}} below the lantern deck while new frames and knees were fitted under the gallery deck. The new iron lantern was 12 sided, {{convert|2.95|m|ft}}in diameter, and able to hold the new lighting apparatus of 13 burners, each with its own {{convert|40.6|cm|in}} reflector. A light was first shown from the new lantern on July 13, 1878, and with all the buildings repaired and painted, the station was in first-rate order.\n\nBy October 12, 1881 Low Point was a signal station at which the International Code of Signals was in use and was one of two stations on Cape Breton Island of the Maritime Telegraph System .<ref name=\"Notice to Mariners No. 253\"/>   The Port War Signal Station was located at the Flat Point Lighthouse during [[World War I|WWI]] (1917 - 1918) and [[World War II|WWII]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.northamericanforts.com/Canada/nscape.html#syd\n | title = COAST ARTILLERY DEFENCES, SYDNEY HARBOUR\n | publisher = American Forts Network\n | accessdate = April 19, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 a third-order [[Fresnel lens|Fresnel]] double bullseye dioptric lens, group flashing white (5 sec.), manufactured in France by [[Barbier, Benard, et Turenne|Barbier, B\u00e9nard et Turenne]] was installed.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=217&M=IP&N=2\n | title = History of Low Point Lighthouse\n | publisher = Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref> replaced the 1857 fixed white, fountain lamp.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=217&M=D&N=1\n | title = First Light, Low Point I - History Items for This Lighthouse\n | publisher = Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society\n | accessdate = April 9, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nA steam fog-horn was established at this station in 1903, followed by many alterations and additions over the years to the horn and lighting mechanisms as technology advanced. One of the more serious problems that plagued this station, as it did many others, was erosion. Through the years, upwards of half a million dollars was spent on building and maintaining the breastworks and cribbing.\n\n==The lighthouse today==\n[[File:Low Point Lighthouse Lantern.jpg|thumb|left|The round, iron, first-order lantern remains atop the lighthouse tower, the last classic lantern of this type still in use on an operational lighthouse in Nova Scotia.]]\n\nIn 1938, the wooden tower came to the end of its days and the existing tower was built in its place, a sturdy octagonal reinforced-concrete shaft, painted white and punctuated by a few rectangular openings. Tapered at its base, it flares outward at its top to support a railed platform surmounted by a red, dome-topped iron lantern, reusing the lens and lighting apparatus from the old tower, the circular iron lantern housing built by [[Chance Brothers]], England's famous builders of lenses and lanterns.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=217&M=IP&N=3\n | title = Low Point Lighthouse, The Light Today\n | publisher = Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, a new dwelling was built for an assistant keeper and electric power was brought to the station. By 1954, the station consisted of the lighthouse tower, fog-alarm building, stores building, oil stores, head keeper's dwelling, and the assistant keeper's dwelling. The old house was torn down, the materials used for general improvements around the station. In 1962, with the addition of a diaphone horn and associated machinery, a third lightkeeper was taken on and a third dwelling built to accommodate him and his family.\n\nIn 1970 an electronic horn was installed, eliminating the need for engines and compressors used with the diaphone horn-and the third keeper. His dwelling, now surplus, was sold and removed from the station in August 1977. Further downgraded to a one-person station in January 1979, the older two-storey dwelling was first converted to a survival station, then sold and removed in 1987. In the meantime, the third-order Fresnel lens was replaced in October 1984 by a DCB-36 optic, a {{convert|91.44|cm|in}} diameter rotating airport beacon. The Fresnel lens is reported to be in storage at the Coast Guard base in Dartmouth.  The round, iron, first-order lantern remains atop the lighthouse tower, the last classic lantern of this type still in use on an operational lighthouse in Nova Scotia.\n\nThe Low Point Lighthouse was destaffed in 1988 but the newest of the lightkeeper's houses remains onsite, one of the few lightstations to retain its keeper's home.   The house has been restored and is in the care of a community non-profit group.\n\n==Heritage designation==\n\nThe light tower, an iconic landmark, is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building because of its historical associations, and its architectural and environmental values.  It was designated 19 October 2006, and is listed in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations. The designation is confined to the footprint of the building.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_fhbro_eng.aspx?id=11247\n | title = Light Tower, Recognized Federal Heritage Building, Sydney, Nova Scotia\n | publisher = Government of Canada\n | accessdate = June 10, 2017\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://sencanada.ca/content/sen/Committee/403/fish/rep/rep07mar11-e.pdf\n | title = REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HERITAGE LIGHTHOUSE PROTECTION ACT, Page 27\n | publisher = Government of Canada, Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries and Oceans\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==An uncertain future==\n[[File:Low Point Lighthouse, located in New Victoria, Nova Scotia, Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|Low Point Lighthouse, a cultural heritage site in Canada, number 13966 in the Canadian Register of Historic Places.]]\n\nThe Low Point Lighthouse,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/dfrp-rbif/pn-nb/03687-eng.aspx\n | title = Low Point\n | publisher = Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref> while still active, has been declared surplus<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/infocus-alaune/2010/02/lighthouse-phare-active-eng.htm\n | title = Table of Active Lighthouses Declared Surplus\n | publisher = Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref> under the [[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act]] as Canadian Coast Guard officials have determined Low Point Lighthouse could be replaced with a simpler structure whose operation and maintenance would be more cost-effective.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/infocus-alaune/2010/02/lighthouse-phare-faq-eng.htm\n | title = Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act Implementation - FAQ\n | publisher = Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref>  Because the Low Point Lighthouse was declared surplus by the Canadian Coast Guard in June 2010 (along with almost all lighthouses in Canada), the lighthouse had until May 29, 2012 to be nominated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act by a group willing to look after it, or the lighthouse would face disposal.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2012/03/25/ns-peggys-cove-lighthouse-surplus.html\n | title = Peggys Cove lighthouse needs new owner\n | publisher = CBC News\n | accessdate = April 6, 2012\n}}</ref> The Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society made a number of lighthouse petitions in advance of this deadline to make sure a request was submitted, while hoping some community group would then take on the responsibility.

Low Point Lighthouse Society spokeswoman Debbie Lee Pearson in an interview stated that she expected the work to begin in the spring and end before the summer season. The renos are actually only the first phase of the society's plan for the site.  Taking into account Sydney's growing cruise ship industry, in the longer term the society wants also to establish the lighthouse as one of six or so stops on a new Cape Breton tourist trail that will reveal Sydney Harbour's history and heritage. The society is aiming to also add to the site signage, parking and interpretative panels as well as \u2014 in the longer-term \u2014 an RV park, campground, gift shop, caf\u00e9 and picnic area.\n\n \"We see the lighthouse as a stop on a new Sydney Harbour tourist trail stretching from the Whitney Pier Historical Society Museum, past St. Alphonsus (gothic-style stone) Church in Victoria Mines, past Fort Petrie and the lighthouse in New Victoria, on to the Colliery Lands Park in New Waterford.

A light was first shown from the new lantern on July 13, 1878, and with all the buildings repaired and painted, the station was in first-rate order.\n\nBy October 12, 1881 Low Point was a signal station at which the International Code of Signals was in use and was one of two stations on Cape Breton Island of the Maritime Telegraph System .<ref name=\"Notice to Mariners No. 253\"/>   The Port War Signal Station was located at the Flat Point Lighthouse during [[World War I|WWI]] (1917 - 1918) and [[World War II|WWII]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.northamericanforts.com/Canada/nscape.html#syd\n | title = COAST ARTILLERY DEFENCES, SYDNEY HARBOUR\n | publisher = American Forts Network\n | accessdate = April 19, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922 a third-order [[Fresnel lens|Fresnel]] double bullseye dioptric lens, group flashing white (5 sec.), manufactured in France by [[Barbier, Benard, et Turenne|Barbier, B\u00e9nard et Turenne]] was installed.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=217&M=IP&N=2\n | title = History of Low Point Lighthouse\n | publisher = Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref> replaced the 1857 fixed white, fountain lamp.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=217&M=D&N=1\n | title = First Light, Low Point I - History Items for This Lighthouse\n | publisher = Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society\n | accessdate = April 9, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nA steam fog-horn was established at this station in 1903, followed by many alterations and additions over the years to the horn and lighting mechanisms as technology advanced. One of the more serious problems that plagued this station, as it did many others, was erosion. Through the years, upwards of half a million dollars was spent on building and maintaining the breastworks and cribbing.\n\n==The lighthouse today==\n[[File:Low Point Lighthouse Lantern.jpg|thumb|left|The round, iron, first-order lantern remains atop the lighthouse tower, the last classic lantern of this type still in use on an operational lighthouse in Nova Scotia.]]\n\nIn 1938, the wooden tower came to the end of its days and the existing tower was built in its place, a sturdy octagonal reinforced-concrete shaft, painted white and punctuated by a few rectangular openings. Tapered at its base, it flares outward at its top to support a railed platform surmounted by a red, dome-topped iron lantern, reusing the lens and lighting apparatus from the old tower, the circular iron lantern housing built by [[Chance Brothers]], England's famous builders of lenses and lanterns.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nslps.com/light-detail.aspx?ID=217&M=IP&N=3\n | title = Low Point Lighthouse, The Light Today\n | publisher = Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, a new dwelling was built for an assistant keeper and electric power was brought to the station. By 1954, the station consisted of the lighthouse tower, fog-alarm building, stores building, oil stores, head keeper's dwelling, and the assistant keeper's dwelling. The old house was torn down, the materials used for general improvements around the station. In 1962, with the addition of a diaphone horn and associated machinery, a third lightkeeper was taken on and a third dwelling built to accommodate him and his family.\n\nIn 1970 an electronic horn was installed, eliminating the need for engines and compressors used with the diaphone horn-and the third keeper. His dwelling, now surplus, was sold and removed from the station in August 1977. Further downgraded to a one-person station in January 1979, the older two-storey dwelling was first converted to a survival station, then sold and removed in 1987. In the meantime, the third-order Fresnel lens was replaced in October 1984 by a DCB-36 optic, a {{convert|91.44|cm|in}} diameter rotating airport beacon. The Fresnel lens is reported to be in storage at the Coast Guard base in Dartmouth.  The round, iron, first-order lantern remains atop the lighthouse tower, the last classic lantern of this type still in use on an operational lighthouse in Nova Scotia.\n\nThe Low Point Lighthouse was destaffed in 1988 but the newest of the lightkeeper's houses remains onsite, one of the few lightstations to retain its keeper's home.   The house has been restored and is in the care of a community non-profit group.\n\n==Heritage designation==\n\nThe light tower, an iconic landmark, is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building because of its historical associations, and its architectural and environmental values.  It was designated 19 October 2006, and is listed in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations. The designation is confined to the footprint of the building.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_fhbro_eng.aspx?id=11247\n | title = Light Tower, Recognized Federal Heritage Building, Sydney, Nova Scotia\n | publisher = Government of Canada\n | accessdate = June 10, 2017\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://sencanada.ca/content/sen/Committee/403/fish/rep/rep07mar11-e.pdf\n | title = REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HERITAGE LIGHTHOUSE PROTECTION ACT, Page 27\n | publisher = Government of Canada, Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries and Oceans\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==An uncertain future==\n[[File:Low Point Lighthouse, located in New Victoria, Nova Scotia, Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|Low Point Lighthouse, a cultural heritage site in Canada, number 13966 in the Canadian Register of Historic Places.]]\n\nThe Low Point Lighthouse,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/dfrp-rbif/pn-nb/03687-eng.aspx\n | title = Low Point\n | publisher = Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref> while still active, has been declared surplus<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/infocus-alaune/2010/02/lighthouse-phare-active-eng.htm\n | title = Table of Active Lighthouses Declared Surplus\n | publisher = Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref> under the [[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act]] as Canadian Coast Guard officials have determined Low Point Lighthouse could be replaced with a simpler structure whose operation and maintenance would be more cost-effective.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/infocus-alaune/2010/02/lighthouse-phare-faq-eng.htm\n | title = Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act Implementation - FAQ\n | publisher = Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n | accessdate = April 5, 2012\n}}</ref>  Because the Low Point Lighthouse was declared surplus by the Canadian Coast Guard in June 2010 (along with almost all lighthouses in Canada), the lighthouse had until May 29, 2012 to be nominated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act by a group willing to look after it, or the lighthouse would face disposal.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2012/03/25/ns-peggys-cove-lighthouse-surplus.html\n | title = Peggys Cove lighthouse needs new owner\n | publisher = CBC News\n | accessdate = April 6, 2012\n}}</ref> The Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society made a number of lighthouse petitions in advance of this deadline to make sure a request was submitted, while hoping some community group would then take on the responsibility.

Low Point Lighthouse Society spokeswoman Debbie Lee Pearson in an interview stated that she expected the work to begin in the spring and end before the summer season. The renos are actually only the first phase of the society's plan for the site.  Taking into account Sydney's growing cruise ship industry, in the longer term the society wants also to establish the lighthouse as one of six or so stops on a new Cape Breton tourist trail that will reveal Sydney Harbour's history and heritage. The society is aiming to also add to the site signage, parking and interpretative panels as well as \u2014 in the longer-term \u2014 an RV park, campground, gift shop, caf\u00e9 and picnic area.\n\n \"We see the lighthouse as a stop on a new Sydney Harbour tourist trail stretching from the Whitney Pier Historical Society Museum, past St. Alphonsus (gothic-style stone) Church in Victoria Mines, past Fort Petrie and the lighthouse in New Victoria, on to the Colliery Lands Park in New Waterford. Each stop has something unique to offer\"\n\nThe province and Ottawa have co-funded both a $3,450 engineering assessment of the site's existing seawall and a $7,187 protection study of the nearby shoreline. The society estimates that rebuilding the seawall will cost approximately $400,000.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.thechronicleherald.mobi/novascotia/1447783-nowns-a-tale-of-two-lighthouses\n | title = NowNS: A tale of two lighthouses\n | publisher = The Chronicle Herald\n | accessdate = April 16, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\nThe fall of 2017 saw work begin on the lighthouse tower itself, with contractors chipping away loose exterior concrete, grinding away any and all cracks that are visible, and [[Parge coat|parging]] over these areas to prevent further damage from winter freeze thaw cycles.
