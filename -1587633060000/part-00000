Smallholdings are usually farms supporting a single family with a mixture of [[cash crop]]s and [[subsistence farming]]. As a country becomes more affluent, smallholdings may not be self-sufficient but are valued primarily for the rural lifestyle that they provide for the owners, who often do not earn their livelihood from the farm. There are an estimated 500 million smallholder farms in the world, supporting almost two billion people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/operations/food/farmer.htm|title=Operating model \u2013 ifad.org|website=www.ifad.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505224355/http://www.ifad.org/operations/food/farmer.htm|archivedate=2013-05-05}}</ref> Today some companies try to include smallholdings into their [[Agricultural value chain|value chain]], providing seed, feed or fertilizer to improve production.

It is usually smaller than a [[farm]] but larger than an [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]], usually under {{convert|50|acre|ha}}. It is often established for breeding [[farm|farm animals]] [[organic movement|organically]] on [[free-range]] pastures. Alternatively, the smallholder may concentrate on [[market gardening|growing]] [[vegetable]]s by traditional methods or, in a more modern way, using plastic covers, [[polytunnel]]ing or [[row cover|cloches]] for quick growth.\n\nGenerally, a smallholding offers its owner a means of achieving [[self-sufficiency]] for its family's needs.   They may be able to supplement their income by selling surplus produce at a [[farmers' market]] or at a permanent [[Retailing#Shops and Stores|shop]] on the smallholding.\n\n== Hobby farms in Australia ==\nIn [[Western Australia]], many small acre farms were established under the [[Agricultural Land Purchase Act]] to encourage settlement. The government purchased large land grants held by absentee owners and subdivided them according to the best use for the land: the development of orchids in [[Coondle, Western Australia|Coondle]], viticulture, horse breeding, sheep grazing, and high density crops like corn, and broad acre crops like wheat.\n\nA [[hobby farm]] in [[Australia]] is a variety of smallholding that may be as small as 2 [[hectares]] up to a self-sustaining farm size, that allows the \"city farmer\" to have a house and a small number of animals or small crop fields or [[grape vine]]s. In Western Australia, they are often termed [[Special Rural Properties]] for planning purposes.\n\n== Lifestyle blocks in New Zealand ==\n\nIn [[New Zealand]], a [[lifestyle block]] is a smallholding valued primarily for the rural lifestyle it affords. Planning restrictions on subdividing farm land often lead to the creation of lifestyle blocks of minimum  permissible size near urban areas.\n\n== Developing countries ==\nIn many [[developing countries]], a smallholding is a small plot of land with low rental value, used to grow crops.<ref>Bunnett, R.B.

Originally '''Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine''' at birth, she was given the name and [[patronymic]] ''Alexandra Feodorovna'' when she converted and was received into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  She and her immediate family were all killed while in [[Execution of the Romanov family|Bolshevik]] captivity in 1918, during the Russian Revolution. She was later [[canonized]] in 2000 in the Russian Orthodox Church as '''Saint Alexandra the Passion Bearer'''.\n\nA favourite granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], Alexandra was, like her grandmother, one of the most famous [[Haemophilia in European royalty|royal carriers of the haemophilia disease]]. Alix had lost her elder brother, [[Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine]] and her uncle, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]] to hemophilia, and bore a hemophiliac heir, [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsesarevich of Russia]]. Her reputation for encouraging her husband's resistance to the surrender of autocratic authority and her known faith in the Russian mystic [[Grigori Rasputin]] severely damaged her popularity and that of the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov|Romanov]] monarchy in its final years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/2006alix/chapter_XXVI.html|title=The Life and Tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna :: Chapter XXVI :: Revolution 1917|publisher=Alexander Palace}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/memoir/FrAmbRus/pal3-01.htm|title=Maurice Pal\u00e9ologue.

Gelardi|Gelardi, Julia]], ''Born to Rule'', p.5</ref><ref>Buxhoeveden, Baroness Sophie, ''Life and Tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna'', p.1</ref> a [[Grand Duchy]] then part of the [[German Empire]]. She was the sixth child and fourth daughter among the seven children of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]], and his first wife, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], the second daughter of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As an infant, she was noted to be very pretty. \n\nAlix was baptized on 1 July 1872 (her parents' tenth wedding anniversary) in the Protestant [[Lutheran Church]] and given the names of her mother and each of her mother's four sisters, some of which were transliterated into German. Her godparents were the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] (her maternal uncle and aunt), [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom]] (her maternal aunt), the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (her great-grandaunt), the [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsesarevich]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Tsesarevna]] of Russia (her future parents-in-law), and [[Princess Anna of Prussia]]. Her mother gave her the nickname of \"Sunny\", due to her cheerful disposition, a name adopted later by her husband. Her British relatives nicknamed her as \"Alicky\", to distinguish her from her aunt Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who was known within the family as Alix.<ref>King, Greg ''Twilight of Splendor: The Court of Queen Victoria in Her Diamond Jubilee Year ''(John Wiley & Sons, 2007) pg. 52</ref> Alix's older brother [[Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine]] (\"Frittie\") suffered from [[hemophilia]] and died in May 1873 after a fall, when Alix was about one year old. Of her siblings, Alix was closest to [[Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (1874-1878)|Princess Marie]] (\"May\"), who was two years younger; they were noted as \"inseparable\". \n\nIn November 1878, [[diphtheria]] swept through the [[House of Hesse]]; Alix, her three sisters, her brother [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernst]] (\"Ernie\"), and their father fell ill. Elisabeth (\"Ella\"), Alix's older sister, was visiting their paternal grandmother, and escaped the outbreak. Alix's mother Alice tended to the children herself, rather than abandon them to nurses and doctors. Alice fell ill and died on 14 December 1878, when Alix was six years old. This was the 17th anniversary of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Alice\u2019s own father]]\u2019s death. Marie also died, but the rest of the siblings survived. After her mother and sister's deaths, Alix became more reserved and withdrawn.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File:The Hessian children with their grandmother, Queen Victoria.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Alix of Hesse, lower right, with her grandmother Queen Victoria and her four older siblings in mourning after the deaths of her mother and sister.

After Alix's mother, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]] had died of [[diphtheria]], her grandmother, Queen Victoria, became interested in her marriage prospects and attempted to control her choice. Victoria had intended for Alix to be Britain's future queen, but she relented to Alix's objections, accepting them as indicative of her strength of character.\n\nAlix had already met and fallen in love with [[Nicholas II of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas]], heir-apparent to the throne of Russia. The royal families were closely linked. Nicholas's mother, Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)]], was Alix's godmother and the younger sister of [[Alexandra of Denmark]], who married Alix\u2019s uncle [[Edward VII]]. Her sister [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)|Elisabeth]] had converted into [[Russian Orthodoxy]] and married Nicholas's uncle [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]].\n\nAlix and Nicholas were related to each other via several different lines of European royalty: they were second cousins through a great-grandmother, [[Wilhelmine of Baden|Princess Wilhelmina of Baden]], and [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II of Prussia]] had been both the great-great-grandfather of Alix and the great-great-great-grandfather of Nicholas, making them third cousins-once-removed via him.\n\nNicholas and Alix had first met in 1884 at the wedding of Nicholas's Uncle Sergei and Alix's sister [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)|Elisabeth]] in St. Petersburg. When Alix returned to Russia on a several week visit in 1889, the two young people fell in love. Nicholas wrote in his diary: \"It is my dream to one day marry Alix H. I have loved her for a long time, but more deeply and strongly since 1889 when she spent six weeks in Petersburg. For a long time, I have resisted my feeling that my dearest dream will come true.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.49\">Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.49</ref> Initially Nicholas's father, [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]], refused the prospect of their marriage.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.49\" />\n\nAlexander and his wife were both vehemently [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]], and did not want the match with Princess Alix. It was generally known that Alexander III hoped for a better match for his son, such as [[Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne of Orl\u00e9ans|Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne]], the tall, dark-haired daughter of [[Philippe, Comte de Paris]], pretender to the throne of France.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.49\" /> Nicholas was not attracted to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, writing in his diary: \"Mama made a few allusions to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, daughter of the Comte de Paris. I myself want to go in one direction and it is evident that Mama wants me to choose the other one.\"<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.50.</ref> H\u00e9l\u00e8ne also resisted this match, as she was [[Roman Catholic]] and her father refused to allow her to convert to [[Russian Orthodoxy]]. After appealing to the Pope, who refused to consider the marriage, the potential relationship was ended. The tsar sent emissaries to [[Princess Margaret of Prussia]], sister of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]], and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Nicholas declared that he would rather become a monk than marry Margaret; she in turn was unwilling to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church from being Protestant.\n\nWhile in good health, Alexander III ignored his son's demands, but began to relent when his health began to fail in 1894.<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.50</ref> At first, Alix was troubled by the requirement that she become Orthodox, but she was persuaded and eventually became a fervent convert. The tsar and tsarina were not the only ones opposed to the match; Queen Victoria wrote to Alix's sister [[Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Victoria]] of her suspicions (which were correct) that [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei]] and Elisabeth were encouraging the match.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''pgs. 51 & 52</ref> The Queen opposed it not from personal feelings about the tsesarevich, whom she liked, but her misgivings about Russia, including past political experiences; her personal dislike of Nicholas's father, and fears over her granddaughter's safety in that country.\n[[File:Engagement official picture of Alexandra and Nicholas.jpg|thumb|180px|Tsar Nicholas II, in hussar uniform, and Princess Alix of Hesse in an official engagement photograph, 1894]]\nIn April 1894 Alix's brother [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernest Louis]], who had succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine in 1892, was to be married to his first cousin, [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (\"Ducky\"), daughter of Queen Victoria's second son [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], and his wife, [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia]], a sister of [[Alexander III of Russia]]. \nNumerous relatives gathered in Coburg, Germany, for the festivities, including Queen Victoria (who had arranged the marriage), the Prince of Wales, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany]], and the [[Empress Frederick]], mother of the Kaiser and eldest daughter of the Queen. Victoria Melita, a granddaughter of [[Tsar Alexander II]] through her mother, was also a first cousin of Nicholas. The Tsesarevich headed up the Russian delegation, which included three of Nicholas's uncles: Vladimir, Sergei and Paul; and two of his aunts by marriage: Elisabeth Feodorovna and Maria Pavlovna.<ref>King, Greg. ''The Court of the Last Tsar: Pomp Power and Pageantry in the Reign of Nicholas II ''(Wiley & Sons, 2006), pp. 36 & 37</ref>\n\nThe day after his arrival in Coburg, Nicholas proposed to Alix. She initially rejected him on the grounds of her refusal to convert to Orthodoxy. However, after pressure from the Kaiser, who had told her that it was her duty to marry Nicholas, and her sister Elisabeth, who noted similarities between Lutheranism and Russian Orthodoxy, she accepted Nicholas's second proposal.<ref>King, Greg. ''The Last Empress ''(Wiley & Sons, 1994) pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nFollowing the engagement, Alix returned to England with her grandmother. In June, Nicholas travelled to England to visit her, bringing with him his father's personal priest, Father Yanishev, who was to give her religious instruction. Along with visiting Alix and the Queen, Nicholas was there to attend the christening of the eldest son of Nicholas and Alix's mutual cousin, [[George V|Prince George, Duke of York]] and his wife, [[Mary of Teck]]. Alix and Nicholas were both named as godparents of the boy, who reigned briefly as [[King Edward VIII]] of England in 1936.<ref>King, ''Empress, '' p. 70</ref>\n\nLater that autumn, as Alexander III's health declined, Nicholas obtained the permission of his dying father to summon Alix to the Romanovs' [[Crimean]] palace of [[Livadia Palace|Livadia]]. Escorted by her sister, Elisabeth, from [[Warsaw]] to the Crimea, she traveled by ordinary passenger train.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''pg. 73</ref> The dying tsar insisted on receiving Alix in full dress uniform and gave her his blessing.<ref>King, ''Empress'', p. 73</ref>\n\n==Empress of Russia==\n===Wedding===\n{{main|Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna}}\n[[File:Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna by Laurits Tuxen (1895-6, Royal coll.).jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait by [[Laurits Tuxen]] of the wedding of [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and the Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt, which took place at the Chapel of the Winter Palace, St Petersburg, on 14/26 November 1894.<ref>Among those also depicted in this portrait, against the wall and to the right of the window, from left to right \u2013 [[Christian IX of Denmark]], [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna]], [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna]], [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna]], [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna of Russia)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]], [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Olga Konstantinovna, Queen of the Hellenes]], the future [[Edward VII]], [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke George Alexandrovich]] (son of [[Tsar Alexander III]]) and [[Prince Heinrich of Prussia]] (son of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Kaiser Friedrich III]]).

The following day, Alix was received into the Russian Orthodox Church as \"the truly believing Grand Duchess Alexandra Feodorovna\". Yet as a dispensation, she was not required to repudiate Lutheranism or her former faith.<ref>King, ''Empress'' pgs. 74 & 75</ref> Alix apparently expressed a wish to take the name ''Yekaterina'', but on Nicholas's wish to relive the names of his great-grandfather [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and his great-grandmother [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Feodorovna]] as Nicholas and Alexandra, she took the name Alexandra.<ref>King, ''Court'', pg. 329</ref>\n\nAlexandra, along with her and Nicholas's mutual aunt and uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]], and some of Nicholas's relatives from Greece accompanied the coffin of Alexander III first to Moscow, where it lay in state in the Kremlin, and then to St. Petersburg. The funeral of Alexander III occurred on 19 November.\n\nThe marriage with Nicholas was not delayed. Alexandra and Nicholas were wed in the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Grand Church]] of the [[Winter Palace]] of [[St Petersburg]] on 26 November 1894, the birthday of Nicholas's mother, now [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]], when court mourning could be somewhat relaxed.<ref>King, ''Court, ''pg. 344</ref> The marriage that began that night remained exceptionally close until the pair was assassinated in 1918.

She brings misfortune with her.\"<ref>''Gilliard, Pierre''.Thirteen years at the Russian court.  Chapter 4.</ref> The subsequent coronation celebrations were marred by the [[Khodynka Tragedy]] and the royal couple were criticized as cold and uncaring.\n\n===Birth of eldest child===\n\nOn 15 November 1895, Alexandra gave birth to her eldest child and daughter, [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]] at the Alexander Palace. Olga could not be [[heir presumptive]] due to the [[Pauline Laws]] implemented by Tsar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]: priority in the order of succession to the Russian throne belonged to male members of the Romanov dynasty, however distantly related to the Tsar, so long as any remained alive. While Alexandra wished to name her daughter Victoria after her beloved grandmother, the couple chose the name Olga instead after Nicholas's younger sister [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna]] and because it was an ancient Russian name. Although many Russians and the Romanovs were disappointed an heir to the throne was not born, Nicholas and Alexandra were delighted with their daughter and doted on her. It was expected that since Alexandra was only twenty three and still young, there would be plenty of time for a son to be born.\n\n===Coronation===\n[[File:Lesser CoA of the empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia.svg|thumb|left|Lesser arms of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]]\nAlexandra Feodorovna became Empress of Russia on her wedding day, but it was not until 14 May 1896 that the coronation of Nicholas and Alexandra took place at the [[Assumption Cathedral in Moscow|Assumption Cathedral]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in Moscow. The following day, the coronation celebrations were halted when the deaths of over one thousand people became known. The victims had been [[Stampede#Crushes|trampled to death]] at the [[Khodynka Field]] in [[Moscow]] when rumours spread that there would not be enough of the food being distributed in honour of the coronation for the thousands who had gathered there. The relatively small numbers of police in attendance could not maintain order, and thousands were crushed in the ensuing stampede. In light of these events the tsar declared he could not go to the ball being given that night by the French Ambassador, the Marquis de Montebello. Nonetheless his uncles urged him to attend so as not to offend the French. Nicholas relented, and he and Alexandra attended the ball. [[Sergei Witte]] commented, \"We expected the party would be called off. Instead it took place as if nothing had happened and the ball was opened by Their Majesties dancing a quadrille.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.80\">Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 80</ref> Alexandra was affected by the loss of life; \"The Empress appeared in great distress, her eyes reddened by tears,\" the British Ambassador informed Queen Victoria. Although Alexandra and Nicholas had visited the wounded the day after and offered to pay for the coffins of the dead, many Russians took the disaster at Khodynka Meadow as an omen that the reign would be unhappy. Others used the circumstances of the tragedy and the behaviour of the royal establishment to underscore the heartlessness of the autocracy and the contemptible shallowness of the young tsar and his \"German woman\".<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 81</ref>\n\nThat autumn Nicholas, Alexandra, and the infant Grand Duchess Olga\u2014who was approaching one\u2014traveled to Scotland to spend time with Queen Victoria at [[Balmoral Castle]]. While Nicholas was in somewhat of a bad mood due to days spent with \"Uncle Bertie\" (the Prince of Wales) shooting in bad weather while Nicholas suffered from a toothache,<ref>''Twilight of Splendor ''pg. 175</ref> Alexandra relished the time with her grandmother. It was in fact, the last time that grandmother and granddaughter would see each other, and when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, pregnancy with her fourth daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia, prevented Alexandra from attending the funeral in London.\n\n===Rejection by the Russian people===\n\nUnlike her vivacious and popular mother-in-law, Alexandra was heartily disliked among her subjects. She came off as very cold and curt, although according to her and many other close friends, she was only terribly shy and nervous in front of the Russian people. She felt her feelings were bruised and battered from the Russians' \"hateful\" nature. She was also frowned upon by the wealthy and poor alike for her distaste for Russian culture (her embrace of Orthodoxy notwithstanding), whether it was the food or the manner of dancing. She spoke Russian with a heavy accent. Her perceived inability to produce a son also incensed the people. After the birth of the Grand Duchess Olga, her first-born child, Nicholas was reported to have said, \"We are grateful she was a daughter; if she was a boy she would have belonged to the people, being a girl she belongs to us.\" When her second daughter [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]] was born, Alexandra was said to have burst into tears over what the Russian people would think of her. The disappointment only increased with the birth of her subsequent daughters, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Maria]] and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia]]. When her \"sunbeam\", [[Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia|Tsesarevich Alexei]], was born, she further isolated herself from the Russian court by spending nearly all of her time with him; his haemophilia bringing them even closer together.  She associated herself with more solitary figures such as [[Anna Vyrubova]] and the invalid Princess Sonia Orbeliani, rather than the \"frivolous\" young Russian aristocratic ladies.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nHistorian [[Barbara W. Tuchman]] in ''[[The Guns of August]]'' writes of Alexandra as tsarina:\n\n{{quote|Though it could hardly be said that the Czar governed Russia in a working sense, he ruled as an autocrat and was in turn ruled by his strong-willed if weak-witted wife. Beautiful, hysterical, and morbidly suspicious, she hated everyone but her immediate family and a series of fanatic or lunatic charlatans who offered comfort to her desperate soul.<ref>Tuchman, Barbara, ''[[The Guns of August]]'' 1962, Ballantine Books reprint 1994, p. 8</ref>}}\n\nIn later life she had an addiction to the barbiturate [[Barbital|Veronal]]: \"I'm literally saturated with it,\" she confessed to a friend in 1914.<ref>Dehn, Lili ''The Real Tsaritsa'', Boston, Little Brown, 1922, p138</ref>\n\nAlong with her association with Vyrubova and Orbeliani, Alexandra associated herself with [[Grand Duchess Militza Nikolaevna of Russia]], who was a Montenegrin princess by birth and wife of a relative of Nicholas. Through her, Alexandra was introduced to a mystic by the name of [[Nizier Anthelme Philippe|Philippe Nizier-Vachot]] in 1901. Philippe enjoyed a brief influence over the imperial couple, until he was exposed as a charlatan in 1903 and was expelled from Russia.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''153</ref> In 1902, it was also suggested that if Nicholas and Alexandra were to sponsor the canonisation of [[Seraphim of Sarov]], Alexandra would give birth to a son.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''pg. 153</ref> Imperial pressure from the tsar led to the church canonising him in 1903. Imperial interference in the canonisation process, which forced the Church to disregard the established rules regarding canonisation, led to an outcry from both laity and clergy alike.\n\nAlexandra lived mainly as a recluse during her husband's reign. She also was reported to have had a terrible relationship with her mother-in-law, Maria Feodorovna. The Dowager Empress had tried to assist Alexandra in learning about the position of empress, but was shunned by the younger woman. Unlike other European courts of the day, in the Russian court, the position of Dowager Empress was senior in rank and precedence to that of the tsarina\u2014a rule that Maria, with the support of Nicholas II, enforced strictly. At royal balls and other formal Imperial gatherings, Maria would enter on her son's arm, and Alexandra would silently trail behind them according to court protocol. It did not help that Maria tended to be extremely possessive of her sons. In addition, Alexandra resented the ostentatiously considerate treatment of Maria by her husband the tsar, which only slightly evaporated after the birth of their five children. For Maria's part, she did not approve of her son's marriage to a German bride and was appalled at her daughter-in-law's inability to win favour with the Russian people. In addition, Maria had spent seventeen years in Russia prior to her coronation with Alexander III; Alexandra had a scarce month to learn the rules of the Russian court (which she seldom followed), and this might have contributed to her unpopularity. Alexandra at least was astute enough not to criticise openly the woman she publicly referred to as \"Mother dear.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlexandra's only real associations were with Nicholas's siblings and a very small number of the otherwise close-knit Romanov family: [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] (husband of Nicholas's sister [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]]), [[Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich]] (the most artistic of the Imperial house) and his family, and [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia (1863\u20131919)|Grand Duke George Mikhailovich]], who was married to Nicholas's maternal first cousin, [[Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna (Maria of Greece)|Maria of Greece]]. Alexandra disliked in particular the family of Nicholas's senior uncle, [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich]], and his wife, [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna of Russia)|Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna]], who, during the war, openly criticized the Empress. She considered their sons [[Grand Duke Kyrill Vladimirovich of Russia|Kyrill]], [[Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia|Boris]] and [[Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia|Andrei]] to be irredeemably immoral, and in 1913 refused Boris's proposal for the hand of Grand Duchess Olga.\n\nAlexandra was very supportive of her husband, yet often gave him extreme advice. She was a fervent advocate of the \"[[divine right of kings]]\" and believed that it was unnecessary to attempt to secure the approval of the people, according to her aunt, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick of Germany]], who wrote to Queen Victoria that \"Alix is very imperious and will always insist on having her own way; she will never yield one iota of power she will imagine she wields{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=\"King, G, The Last Empress, p.93\">King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.93</ref> During World War I, with the national citizens aroused, all the complaints Russians had about the Empress\u2014for instance, her German birth, her poor ideals, her devotion to Rasputin\u2014circled and twisted around the deadly designs that claimed her entire family.

The couple was fertile; Alexandra bore three more girls in the next six years: [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]] on 10 June 1897, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899\u20131918)|Maria]] on 26 June 1899, and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia]] on 18 June 1901. Three more years passed before she bore a son, the long-awaited heir to the throne: [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei Nikolaevich]], born in [[Petergof|Peterhof]] on 12 August 1904. To his parents' dismay, Alexei was born with [[hemophilia]], an incurable genetic disease of the blood that increased risk of early death because of failure of the blood to clot. It had caused the deaths of her elder brother Friedrich and her uncle Leopold. Alexandra felt guilt for having passed the disease to Alexei. Historians believe that she had a breakdown due to the worry for her son's health.\n\nDetermined to care for her children, Alexandra shocked the Russian aristocracy by nursing her own children. She repeated elements of her own upbringing in rearing them.<ref>Massie, R. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 132</ref>\n\n[[File:Family Nicholas II of Russia ca. 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The Russian Imperial Family, 1913.

Tsesarevich Alexei sits in front of his parents.]]\n\nGrand Duchess Olga was reportedly shy and subdued. As she grew older, Olga read widely, both fiction and poetry, often borrowing books from her mother before the Empress had read them. \"You must wait, Mama, until I find out whether this book is a proper one for you to read,\" Olga wrote. She was the most bright of her siblings and possessed a quick mind, according to her tutors. While she adored her father, whom she physically resembled, she had a more distant relationship with Alexandra.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.154\">Massie, R. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 154</ref> Alexandra was close to her second daughter, Tatiana, who gave her unvarying attention but also was favoured by their father. If a favour was needed, the Imperial children agreed that \"Tatiana must ask Papa to grant it.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.154\" /> During the family's final months, Tatiana helped her mother by pushing her about the house in a wheelchair. She most resembled Alexandra, both in terms of appearance and personality. Tatiana was considered the most elegant of her sisters, and more attractive than Olga. \n\nThe third Grand Duchess, Maria, was sweet and gentle, said to enjoy talking about marriage and children. She took after her paternal grandparents and inherited [[Alexander III, Emperor of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]]\u2019s famous strength. The tsar thought she would make an excellent wife, and Maria was considered the \"angel\" of the family. Maria was considered the most beautiful of the sisters, along with Tatiana. Anastasia, exuberant and vivacious, was the youngest daughter and became well-known. She was dubbed the ''shvibzik,'' Russian for \"imp.\"<ref>Vorres, I, ''The Last Grand Duchess'', p.108</ref> While Anastasia physically resembled her mother, she was quite different in personality. She was energetic and mischievous throughout her childhood, known to climb trees and refuse to come down unless specifically commanded by her father. Her aunt and godmother, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, once recalled slapping the child for her merciless teasing.<ref>Vorres, I, ''The Last Grand Duchess'', p.109</ref>\n\nWhen they were children, Alexandra dressed her daughters as pairs, the oldest two and the youngest two wearing matching dresses. They were known as the 'Big Pair' and 'Little Pair,' respectively.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.157\">Massie, R. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.157</ref> As Olga and Tatiana grew older, they played a more serious role in public affairs.  There they referred to their parents as \"the Empress\" and \"the Emperor\".<ref name=\"Massie, R p.157\" /> Nicholas and Alexandra intended for both their older daughters to make their debuts in 1914, when Olga was nineteen and Tatiana seventeen. But the beginning of the [[First World War|Great War]] led them to cancel these plans. By 1917, the four daughters had blossomed into young women.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.158\">Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.158</ref> While Nicholas and Alexandra loved their daughters, their gender meant they would be less active in the world. They were frequently treated as one, with the nickname \"OTMA\", taken from their first names. Their brother's birth resulted in the girls being overshadowed. \n\nAlexandra doted on Alexei. The children's tutor [[Pierre Gilliard]] wrote, \"Alexei was the centre of a united family, the focus of all its hopes and affections. His sisters worshiped him. He was his parents' pride and joy. When he was well, the palace was transformed. Everyone and everything in it seemed bathed in sunshine.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.158\" />\n\nKnowing that he had hemophilia, Alexandra was obsessed with trying to protect him. She consulted a number of mystics who claimed to be able to heal him during his nearly fatal attacks. Alexandra spoiled her only son and let him have his way. In 1912, Alexandra revealed Alexei's illness, in confidence, to her mother-in-law and Nicholas's sisters, but the knowledge soon reached a limited circle of courtiers and relatives. Alexandra became blamed for Alexei's frail health. Some of the Russian court referred to his condition as \"the English disease,\" because it had appeared among Queen Victoria's children. Alexandra was isolated by being foreign. Increasingly, she became an unpopular figure with the imperial family, the aristocracy, and the Russian people. During the [[World War I|Great War]], she became unpopular because of her German birth and upbringing, when that country was an enemy of the Russian Empire. Alexandra became a primary focus for the increasing unrest associated with  opposition to the monarchy.\n\n====Issue====\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Image!!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|colspan=5|'''By [[Nicholas II of Russia]]''' (6 June 1872&nbsp;\u2013 17 July 1918, married on 26 November 1894)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Olgachair.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|15 November|1895|3 November}}||rowspan=\"5\"|[[Execution of the Romanov family|17 July 1918]]||rowspan=\"5\"|executed by gunshot in [[Yekaterinburg]] by the [[Bolshevik]]s\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Tatiana Nikolaevna.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|10 June|1897|29 May}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:GrandDuchessMaria1914formal2.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899\u20131918)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|26 June|1899|14 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Crisco edit letters removed.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|18 June|1901|5 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Alexis.png|90px]] || [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]]||{{OldStyleDate|12 August|1904|30 July}}\n|}\n\nIn addition to the five children she bore, Alexandra was thought to have suffered a miscarriage in the summer of 1896, presumably because she became physically exhausted during her coronation festivities. She also may have had a phantom pregnancy in August 1902.<ref>Rounding, Virginia. \"Alix and Nicky\". (2011), p.41</ref>\n\nAlexandra's health was never robust and her frequent pregnancies, with four daughters in six years and her son three years after, drew from her energy. Her biographers, including Robert Massie, Carrolly Erickson, Greg King, and Peter Kurth, attribute the semi-invalidism of her later years to nervous exhaustion from obsessive worry over the fragile tsarevich, who suffered from hemophilia. She spent most of her time in bed or reclining on a chaise in her boudoir or on a veranda. This immobility enabled her to avoid the social occasions that she found distasteful. Alexandra regularly took a herbal medicine known as Adonis Vernalis in order to regulate her pulse. She was constantly tired, slept badly, and complained of swollen feet. She ate little, but never lost weight. She may have suffered from Graves Disease (hyperthyroidism), a condition resulting in high levels of the thyroid hormone, which can also result in [[atrial fibrillation]], poor heartbeat and lack of energy.<ref>Banks, ECS, ''Road to Ekaterinburg: Nicholas and Alexandra's Daughters 1913\u20131918.''

He was [[heir apparent]] to the throne of Russia. At first the infant seemed healthy but in a few weeks' time, it was noticed that when he bumped himself, his bruises did not heal. He would bleed from the navel and his blood was slow to clot. Alexei was diagnosed as suffering from [[haemophilia]], a genetic disease of males and carried by females, found among Alexandra's side of the family.<ref>Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p.574</ref> Because of lack of successful treatment, haemophilia was generally fatal in the early 20th century. It had entered the royal houses of Europe via the daughters of Queen Victoria, also a carrier. Alexandra's brother, [[Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine|Friedrich]] died in 1873, as did her uncle, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]], in 1884. \n\nHer sister [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine]] was later also found to carry the gene, and it emerged among descendants of her marriage to her cousin [[Prince Heinrich of Prussia]]. [[Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], another of Queen Victoria's granddaughters and a first cousin of Alexandra, also was found to carry the disease. She married [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and two of her sons were haemophiliacs. \n\nSince the incurable illness threatened the sole son and heir of the emperor, the Crown decided to keep his condition secret from the Russian people. They wanted to limit social instability because of uncertainty. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors to treat Alexei. Their treatments generally failed. Burdened with the threats to her son from any fall or cut, Alexandra turned toward religion for comfort. She studied all the Orthodox rituals and saints, and spent hours daily praying in her private chapel for deliverance.<ref>Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p.374</ref> She also increasingly turned to [[mysticism|mystics]] and so-called holy men. \n\n[[Grigori Rasputin]], a priest and mystic from Siberia, appeared to have a cure for her son and became powerful in court as a result. But Rasputin's debauched habits led Nicholas at times to distance him from the family. Even after Alexandra was told by the director of the national police that a drunk Rasputin had exposed himself at a popular Moscow restaurant and bragged that Nicholas gave him sexual access to Alexandra, she blamed the account on malicious gossip. \"Saints are always calumniated,\" she once wrote. \"He is hated because we love him.\"<ref name=\"Denton, C.S p.577\">Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p.577</ref>  Nicholas was not nearly as blind, but he felt powerless to do anything about the man who seemingly saved his only son's life. [[Pierre Gilliard]] wrote, \"He did not like to send Rasputin away, for if Alexei died, in the eyes of the mother, he would have been the murderer of his own son.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/gilliard/XIV.html|title=Thirteen Years at the Russian Court \u2013 Chapter Fourteen \u2013 Death of Rasputin|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start, members of the court exchanged gossip about Rasputin. Although some of St.. Petersburg's top clergy accepted him as a living prophet, others angrily denounced him as a fraud and a heretic. Stories from his life in Siberia were heard in St. Petersburg. For instance, he was said to conduct weddings for villagers in exchange for sleeping the first night with the bride. He lived in St. Petersburg with his two daughters and two housekeepers, and was often visited by persons seeking his blessing, a healing, or a favour with the tsarina. Women, enchanted by the healer's crude mystique, also came to Rasputin for more \"private blessings\" and received a private audience in his bedroom, jokingly called the \"Holy of Holies\". Rasputin liked to preach a unique theology that one must become familiar with sin before having a chance to overcome it.<ref>Denton, C. S, ''Absolute Power'', p.576</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Alexei suffered a life-threatening [[Bleeding|haemorrhage]] in the thigh while the family was at [[Spa\u0142a]] in Poland. Alexandra and Nicholas took turns at his bedside and tried in vain to comfort him from his intense pain.<ref name=\"Denton, C.S p.575\">Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p. 575</ref> Alexandra thought God was ignoring her prayers for her son's relief. Alexandra in desperation sent a telegram to Rasputin, who immediately replied: \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\"<ref name=\"Denton, C.S p.575\" /> Alexei recovered after Rasputin's advice was followed. From 1912 onwards, Alexandra came to rely increasingly on Rasputin and to believe in his ability to ease Alexei's suffering. This reliance enhanced Rasputin's political power. His role in the court seriously undermined Romanov rule during the First World War.\n\nRasputin was assassinated to end his perceived interference in political matters, on 30 December 1916. Amongst the conspirators were the nobleman [[Felix Yusupov|Prince Felix Yusupov]], who was married to Nicholas II's niece, [[Princess Irina of Russia]]; and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], a first cousin of Nicholas.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Bodarevsky - Zarin Alexandra Fyodorovna.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Portrait of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. Livadia, 1907]]\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] was a pivotal moment for Russia and Alexandra. The war pitted the Russian Empire of the Romanov dynasty against the much stronger German Empire of the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]].<ref>The Last tsar by Virginia Cowles, p.4</ref> When Alexandra learned of the Russian mobilization, she stormed into her husband's study and said: \"War! And I knew nothing of it! This is the end of everything.\"<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.213</ref>\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine, ruled by her brother, formed part of the German Empire. This was, of course, the place of Alexandra's birth. This made Alexandra very unpopular with the Russian people, who accused her of collaboration with the Germans.<ref>The Last Empress by Greg King p.223</ref> The German Emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], was also Alexandra's first cousin. Ironically, one of the few things that Empress Alexandra and her mother-in-law Empress Maria had in common was their utter distaste for Emperor Wilhelm II. Wilhelm treated her with condescension, as a small time German princess.  Alexandra's sister, Irene, who was married to Kaiser Wilhelm's brother, Heinrich, was also on the German side.\n\nWhen the tsar travelled to the front line in 1915 to take personal command of the Army, he left Alexandra in charge as Regent in the capital Saint Petersburg. Her brother-in-law, [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] recorded, \"When the Emperor went to war of course his wife governed instead of him.\"<ref name=\"King, G p.244\">King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.244</ref> Alexandra had no experience of government and constantly appointed and re-appointed incompetent new ministers, which meant the government was never stable or efficient. This was particularly dangerous in a war of attrition, as neither the troops nor the civilian population were ever adequately supplied. She paid attention to the self-serving advice of Rasputin, and their relationship was widely, though falsely, believed to be sexual in nature.  Alexandra was the focus of ever-increasing negative rumors, and was widely believed to be a German spy at the Russian court.\n\nDuring the war, there was great concern within the imperial house of the influence empress Alexandra had upon state affairs through the Tsar, and the influence [[Grigori Rasputin]] was believed to have upon her, as it was considered to provoke the public and endanger the safety of the imperial throne and the survival of the monarchy.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\">King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8065-1761-1}}. p. 299-300</ref> \nOn behalf of the imperial relatives of the Tsar, both [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)]] and [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] had been selected to mediate and ask Empress Alexandra to banish Rasputin from court to protect her and the throne's reputation, the former twice, but without success. In parallel, several of the Grand Dukes had tried to intervene with the Tsar, but with no more success.\n\n[[File:Nicholas II with his family in Yevpatoria.jpg|thumb|left|Tsar, Alexandra and their children in [[Yevpatoria]], Crimea, May 1916]]\nDuring this conflict of 1916\u20131917, [[Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] reportedly planned a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to depose the Tsar with the help of four regiments of the imperial guard which were to invade the Alexander Palace, force the Tsar to abdicate and replace him with his underage son under the regency of her son [[Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia]].<ref>King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8065-1761-1}}. p. 319-26-300</ref>\n\nThere are documents that support the fact that, in this critical situation, the empress dowager Maria Feodorovna was involved in a planned [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to depose her son from the throne in order to save the monarchy.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  The plan was reportedly for Maria to make a final ultimatum to the Tsar to banish Rasputin unless he wished for her to leave the capital, which would be the signal to unleash the coup.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  Exactly how she planned to replace her son is unconfirmed, but two versions are available: first, that [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]] would take power in her name, and that she herself would thereafter become ruling empress; the other version claims that she and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia would replace the Tsar with his son, the heir to the throne, Maria's grandson Alexei, upon which Maria and Paul Alexandrovich would share power as regents during his minority.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed about the planned coup, and when Maria Feodorovna made the ultimatum to the Tsar, the empress convinced him to order his mother to leave the capital.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  \nConsequently, the Dowager Empress left St. Petersburg to live in the [[Mariyinsky Palace]] in [[Kiev]] the same year. She never again returned to Russia's capital.\n\n==Revolution (1917)==\n[[World War I]] put what proved to be unbearable burden on Imperial Russia's government and economy, both of which were dangerously weak. Mass shortages and hunger became the daily situation for tens of millions of Russians due to the disruptions of the [[war economy]]. Fifteen million men were diverted from agricultural production to fight in the war, and the transportation infrastructure (primarily railroads) was diverted towards war use, exacerbating food shortages in the cities as available agricultural products could not be brought to urban areas. Inflation was rampant. This, combined with the food shortages and the poor performance by the Russian military in the war, generated a great deal of anger and unrest among the people in [[Saint Petersburg]] and other cities.<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the Tsars'', p.52</ref>\n\nThe decision of the tsar to take personal command of the military against advice was disastrous, as he was directly blamed for all losses. His relocation to the front, leaving the [[Empress]] in charge of the government, helped undermine the Romanov dynasty. The poor performance of the military led to rumours believed by the people that the German-born Empress was part of a conspiracy to help Germany win the war. Moreover, within several months of taking personal command of the army, the tsar replaced several capable ministers with less able men on the Empress and Rasputin's behest; most notable among these replacements was replacing N. B. [[Nikolai Borisovich Shcherbatov|Shcherbatov]] with [[Alexei Khvostov|Khvostov]] as minister of the interior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/popups/pdf_viewer.jsf?cid=CBO9781139055437A042&hithighlight=on&ref=true&pubCode=CUP&urlPrefix=cambridge&productCode=cho|title=War and Revolution, 1914\u20131917.\" In The Cambridge History of Russia|last=Lohr|first=Eric|date=|website=universitypublishingonline.org|publisher=Cambridge University Press|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref> The severe winter of 1916\u201317 essentially doomed Imperial Russia. Food shortages worsened and [[famine]] gripped the cities. The mismanagement and failures of the war turned the soldiers against the tsar. By 1917, the tsar realized that Russia could not fight the war much longer and a make or break spring offensive was planned. But as railroads carried troops to the front there was little capacity left to bring food to the cities.\n\nBy March 1917, conditions had worsened even more. Steelworkers went out on strike on 7 March, and the following day, crowds hungry for bread began rioting on the streets of St Petersburg to protest food shortages and the war. After two days of rioting, the tsar ordered the Army to restore order and on 11 March they fired on the crowd. That very same day, the [[Duma]], the elected legislature, urged the tsar to take action to ameliorate the concerns of the people. The tsar responded by dissolving the Duma.<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the tsars'', p.53</ref>\n\nOn 12 March soldiers sent to suppress the rioting crowds mutinied and joined the rebellion, thus providing the spark to ignite the February Revolution (like the later October Revolution of November 1917, the Russian Revolutions of 1917 get their names due to the Old Style calendar). Soldiers and workers set up the \"[[Petrograd Soviet]]\" of 2,500 elected deputies while the Duma declared a Provisional Government on 13 March. [[Alexander Kerensky]] was a key player in the new regime. The Duma informed the tsar that day that he must abdicate.\n\nIn an effort to put an end to the uprising in the capital, Nicholas tried to get to St Petersburg by train from army headquarters at Mogiliev. The route was blocked so he tried another way. His train was stopped at Pskov where, after receiving advice from his generals, he first abdicated the throne for himself and later, on seeking medical advice, for himself and his son the [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei]].<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the tsars'', p.55</ref>\n\nAlexandra was now in a perilous position as the wife of the deposed tsar, hated by the Russian people.

They were visited by [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] from the government, who interviewed Alexandra regarding her involvement in state affairs and Rasputin's involvement in them through his influence over her.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p 344-345\">King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8065-1761-1}}. p 344-345</ref> She answered that as she and her spouse kept no secrets from each other, they often discussed politics and she naturally gave him advice to support him; as for Rasputin, he had been a true holy man of God, and his advice had been only in the interest of the good of Russia and the imperial family.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p 344-345\"/> After the interview, Kerensky told the tsar that he believed that Alexandra had told him the truth and was not lying.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nThe Provisional Government did not wish to keep the family in Russia, particularly as both the family as well as the Provincial Government were under threat from the Bolsheviks; they trusted that the former tsar and his family would be received in Great Britain, and made sure inquiries were being made.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>  Despite the fact he was a first cousin of both Nicholas and Alexandra, [[George V]] refused to allow them and their family permission to evacuate to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], as he was alarmed by their unpopularity in his country and the potential repercussions to his own throne.<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the tsars'', p.57</ref> After this, they were suggested to be moved to France; however, although the French government was never asked, British diplomats in France reported that the family was not likely to be welcome there, as anti-German feelings were strong in France during the war and Alexandra was widely unpopular because she was believed to be a sympathizer of Germany.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> The Provisional Government was reportedly very disappointed that no foreign state seemed to be willing to receive the family, and was forced to act and relocate them within Russia, as the security situation was becoming more and more difficult.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nIn August 1917, the family were moved to [[Tobolsk]] in [[Siberia]], a step by the [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] government designed to remove them from the capital and possible harm.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>  Nicholas and Alexandra had themselves suggested to be moved to the [[Livadia Palace]] in the Crimea, but Kerensky deemed this to be too dangerous, as they would have to travel through Central Russia, an area which was at the time full of riots where the upper classes were attacked by the public and their mansions burned.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> Tobolsk in Siberia was, in contrast to Central and Southern Russia, a calm and peaceful place with greater security and more sympathy for the former tsar.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> There were indications that the Provisional Government were actually attempting to transport them out of Russia by the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], thus fulfilling the government's wish to have them expelled, but now via a different route, after the first attempt to exile them to Europe had failed.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> However, this plan was not revealed to the family, and if it had indeed been the intent of the government, it had to be cancelled because of a strong Bolshevik presence in Ekaterinburg and other cities along the Trans-Siberian Railway east of Tobolsk, and the family therefore continued to their official destination.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nFrom Tobolsk, Alexandra managed to send a letter to her sister-in-law, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia Alexandrovna]], in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]:\n\n{{quote|My darling Xenia,\n\nMy thoughts are with you, how magically good and beautiful everything must be with you \u2013 you are the flowers.

The fall of the Provincial Government and the Bolshevik's accession to power greatly worsened their position.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nIn 1918, they were subsequently moved to Bolshevik controlled [[Yekaterinburg]]. Nicholas, Alexandra and their daughter Maria arrived at the [[Ipatiev House]] on 30 April 1918. On entering their new prison, they were ordered to open all their luggage. Alexandra immediately objected. Nicholas tried to come to her defence saying, \"So far we have had polite treatment and men who were gentlemen but now -\"<ref name=\"King, G p.344\">King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.344</ref> The former Tsar was quickly cut off. The guards informed him he was no longer at Tsarskoe Selo and that refusal to comply with their request would result in his removal from the rest of his family; a second offence would be rewarded with hard labour. Fearing for her husband's safety, Alexandra quickly gave in and allowed the search. On the window frame of what was to be her last bedroom in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra scrawled a [[swastika]], her favourite good luck symbol, and pencilled the date 17/30 April 1918.<ref name=\"King, G p.344\" /> In May, the rest of the family arrived in Yekaterinburg. They had not been able to travel earlier due to the illness of Alexei. Alexandra was pleased to be reunited with her family once more.\n\nSeventy-five men did guard duty at the Ipatiev House. Many of the men were factory workers from the local Zlokazovsky Factory and the Verkh-Isetsk Factory. The commandant of the Ipatiev House, Alexander Avadeyev was described as \"a real Bolshevik\". The majority of witnesses recall him as coarse, brutish and a heavy drinker. If a request for a favour on behalf of the family reached Avadeyev, he always gave the same response, \"Let them go to hell!!\" The guards in the house often heard him refer to the deposed tsar as \"Nicholas the Blood-Drinker\" and to Alexandra as \"The German Bitch\".<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.345</ref>\n\nFor the Romanovs, life at the Ipatiev House was a nightmare of uncertainty and fear. The Imperial Family never knew if they would still be in the Ipatiev House from one day to the next or if they might be separated or killed. The privileges allowed to them were few. For an hour each afternoon they could exercise in the rear garden under the watchful eye of the guards. Alexei could still not walk, and his sailor Nagorny had to carry him. Alexandra rarely joined her family in these daily activities. Instead she spent most of her time sitting in a wheelchair, reading the Bible or the works of St. Seraphim. At night the Romanovs played cards or read; they received little mail from the outside world, and the only newspapers they were allowed were outdated editions.<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.346</ref>\n\nDmitri Volkogonov and other Soviet historians believe that indirect evidence indicates that [[Vladimir Lenin]] personally ordered the execution of the Imperial Family,<ref>Volkogonov, Dmitri (2006).

Trotsky wrote:\n\n{{quote|My next visit to Moscow took place after the fall of Ekaterinburg. Talking to [[Yakov Sverdlov|Sverdlov]] I asked in passing, \"Oh yes, and where is the tsar?\" \"It's all over,\" he answered. \"He has been shot.\" \"And where is his family?\" \"And the family with him.\" \"All of them?\" I asked, apparently with a touch of surprise. \"All of them,\" replied Sverdlov. \"What about it?\" He was waiting to see my reaction. I made no reply. \"And who made the decision?\" I asked. \"We decided it here. Ilyich (Lenin) believed that we shouldn't leave The Whites a live banner to rally around, especially under the present difficult circumstances.\"<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.358</ref>}}\n\nOn 4 July 1918, [[Yakov Yurovsky]], the chief of the Ekaterinburg Cheka, was appointed commandant of the Ipatiev House. Yurovsky was a loyal Bolshevik, a man Moscow could rely on to carry out its orders regarding The Imperial Family. Yurovsky quickly tightened security. From The Imperial Family he collected all of their jewellery and valuables. These he placed in a box which he sealed and left with the prisoners. Alexandra kept only two bracelets which her uncle, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]], had given her as a child and which she could not take off. He did not know that the former tsarina and her daughters wore concealed on their person diamonds, emeralds, rubies and ropes of pearls. These would be discovered only after the murders. Yurovsky had been given the order for the murder on 13 July.<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.539</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, 14 July 1918, two priests came to the Ipatiev House to celebrate the Divine Liturgy. One of the priests, Father Storozhev later recalled:\n\n{{quote|I went into the living room first, then the deacon and Yurovsky. At the same time Nicholas and Alexandra entered through the doors leading into the inner room. Two of his daughters were with him. I did not have a chance to see exactly which ones. I believe Yurovsky asked Nicholas Alexandrovich, \"Well, are you all here?\" Nicholas Alexandrovich answered firmly, \"Yes, all of us.\" Ahead beyond the archway, Alexandra Feodorovna was already in place with two daughters and Alexei Nicolaievich. He was sitting in a wheelchair and wore a jacket, as it seemed to me, with a sailor's collar. He was pale, but not so much as at the time of my first service. In general he looked more healthy. Alexandra Feodorovna also had a healthier appearance. ...According to the liturgy of the service it is customary at a certain point to read the prayer, \"Who Resteth with the Saints.\" On this occasion for some reason the deacon, instead of reading the prayer began to sing it, and I as well, somewhat embarrassed by this departure from the ritual. But we had scarcely begun to sing when I heard the members of the Romanov family, standing behind me, fall on their knees ...<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.361</ref>}}\n\n==Death==\n{{main|Execution of the Romanov family}}\n\n===Execution===\nTuesday, 16 July 1918 passed normally for the former imperial family. At four o'clock in the afternoon, Nicholas and his daughters took their usual walk in the small garden. Early in the evening Yurovsky sent away the fifteen-year-old kitchen boy Leonid Sedinev, saying that his uncle wished to see him. At 7 p.m., Yurovsky summoned all the Cheka men into his room and ordered them to collect all the revolvers from the outside guards. With twelve heavy military revolvers lying before him on the table he said, \"Tonight, we shoot the entire family, everybody.\" Upstairs Nicholas and Alexandra passed the evening playing [[bezique]]; at ten thirty, they went to bed.<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p,540</ref>\n\nThe former tsar, tsarina, and all of their family, including the gravely ill Alexei, along with several family servants, were executed by firing squad and bayonets in the basement of the Ipatiev House, where they had been imprisoned, early in the morning of 17 July 1918, by a detachment of [[Bolshevik]]s led by [[Yakov Yurovsky]].<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the Tsars'', p. 63</ref> In the basement room of the Ipatiev House, Alexandra complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on, whereupon Nicholas asked for and received three chairs from the guards. Minutes later, at about 2:15&nbsp;a.m., a squad of soldiers, each armed with a revolver, entered the room. Their leader Yurovsky ordered the entire party to stand; Alexandra complied \"with a flash of anger\", and Yurovsky then casually pronounced, \"Your relations have tried to save you. They have failed and we must now shoot you.\" Nicholas rose from his chair and only had time to utter \"What...?\" before he was shot several times, not (as is usually said) in the head, but in the chest; his skull bears no bullet wounds, but his ribs were shattered by at least three fatal bullet wounds.<ref>Denton, C.S., ''Absolute Power'', p.588</ref>  Standing about six feet from the gunmen and facing them, Alexandra watched the execution of her husband and two menservants before military commissar [[Peter Ermakov]] took aim at her.  She instinctively turned away from him and began to make the sign of the cross, but before she could finish the gesture, Ermakov killed her with a single gunshot which, as she had partly turned away, entered her head just above the left ear and exited at the same spot above her right ear.  After all the victims had been shot, Ermakov in a drunken haze stabbed Alexandra's body and that of her husband, shattering both their rib cages and chipping some of Alexandra's vertebrae.<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.364</ref>\n\n===Identification of remains===\n[[File:Yekaterinburg cathedral on the blood 2007.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Yekaterinburg]]'s \"[[All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land|Church on the Blood]]\", built on the spot where the Ipatiev House once stood]]\nAfter the execution of the Romanov family in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra's body, along with Nicholas, their children and some faithful retainers who died with them, was stripped and the clothing burnt according to the Yurovsky Note.

They belonged to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)]]. Nicholas was identified using DNA obtained from, among others, his late brother [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia]].

Originally '''Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine''' at birth, she was given the name and [[patronymic]] ''Alexandra Feodorovna'' when she converted and was received into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  She and her immediate family were all killed while in [[Execution of the Romanov family|Bolshevik]] captivity in 1918, during the Russian Revolution. She was later [[canonized]] in 2000 in the Russian Orthodox Church as '''Saint Alexandra the Passion Bearer'''.\n\nA favourite granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], Alexandra was, like her grandmother, one of the most famous [[Haemophilia in European royalty|royal carriers of the haemophilia disease]]. Alix had lost her elder brother, [[Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine]] and her uncle, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]] to hemophilia, and bore a hemophiliac heir, [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsesarevich of Russia]]. Her reputation for encouraging her husband's resistance to the surrender of autocratic authority and her known faith in the Russian mystic [[Grigori Rasputin]] severely damaged her popularity and that of the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov|Romanov]] monarchy in its final years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/2006alix/chapter_XXVI.html|title=The Life and Tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna :: Chapter XXVI :: Revolution 1917|publisher=Alexander Palace}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/memoir/FrAmbRus/pal3-01.htm|title=Maurice Pal\u00e9ologue.

Gelardi|Gelardi, Julia]], ''Born to Rule'', p.5</ref><ref>Buxhoeveden, Baroness Sophie, ''Life and Tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna'', p.1</ref> a [[Grand Duchy]] then part of the [[German Empire]]. She was the sixth child and fourth daughter among the seven children of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]], and his first wife, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], the second daughter of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As an infant, she was noted to be very pretty. \n\nAlix was baptized on 1 July 1872 (her parents' tenth wedding anniversary) in the Protestant [[Lutheran Church]] and given the names of her mother and each of her mother's four sisters, some of which were transliterated into German. Her godparents were the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] (her maternal uncle and aunt), [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom]] (her maternal aunt), the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (her great-grandaunt), the [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsesarevich]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Tsesarevna]] of Russia (her future parents-in-law), and [[Princess Anna of Prussia]]. Her mother gave her the nickname of \"Sunny\", due to her cheerful disposition, a name adopted later by her husband. Her British relatives nicknamed her as \"Alicky\", to distinguish her from her aunt Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who was known within the family as Alix.<ref>King, Greg ''Twilight of Splendor: The Court of Queen Victoria in Her Diamond Jubilee Year ''(John Wiley & Sons, 2007) pg. 52</ref> Alix's older brother [[Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine]] (\"Frittie\") suffered from [[hemophilia]] and died in May 1873 after a fall, when Alix was about one year old. Of her siblings, Alix was closest to [[Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (1874-1878)|Princess Marie]] (\"May\"), who was two years younger; they were noted as \"inseparable\". \n\nIn November 1878, [[diphtheria]] swept through the [[House of Hesse]]; Alix, her three sisters, her brother [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernst]] (\"Ernie\"), and their father fell ill. Elisabeth (\"Ella\"), Alix's older sister, was visiting their paternal grandmother, and escaped the outbreak. Alix's mother Alice tended to the children herself, rather than abandon them to nurses and doctors. Alice fell ill and died on 14 December 1878, when Alix was six years old. This was the 17th anniversary of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Alice\u2019s own father]]\u2019s death. Marie also died, but the rest of the siblings survived. After her mother and sister's deaths, Alix became more reserved and withdrawn.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File:The Hessian children with their grandmother, Queen Victoria.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Alix of Hesse, lower right, with her grandmother Queen Victoria and her four older siblings in mourning after the deaths of her mother and sister.

After Alix's mother, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]] had died of [[diphtheria]], her grandmother, Queen Victoria, became interested in her marriage prospects and attempted to control her choice. Victoria had intended for Alix to be Britain's future queen, but she relented to Alix's objections, accepting them as indicative of her strength of character.\n\nAlix had already met and fallen in love with [[Nicholas II of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas]], heir-apparent to the throne of Russia. The royal families were closely linked. Nicholas's mother, Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)]], was Alix's godmother and the younger sister of [[Alexandra of Denmark]], who married Alix\u2019s uncle [[Edward VII]]. Her sister [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)|Elisabeth]] had converted into [[Russian Orthodoxy]] and married Nicholas's uncle [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]].\n\nAlix and Nicholas were related to each other via several different lines of European royalty: they were second cousins through a great-grandmother, [[Wilhelmine of Baden|Princess Wilhelmina of Baden]], and [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II of Prussia]] had been both the great-great-grandfather of Alix and the great-great-great-grandfather of Nicholas, making them third cousins-once-removed via him.\n\nNicholas and Alix had first met in 1884 at the wedding of Nicholas's Uncle Sergei and Alix's sister [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)|Elisabeth]] in St. Petersburg. When Alix returned to Russia on a several week visit in 1889, the two young people fell in love. Nicholas wrote in his diary: \"It is my dream to one day marry Alix H. I have loved her for a long time, but more deeply and strongly since 1889 when she spent six weeks in Petersburg. For a long time, I have resisted my feeling that my dearest dream will come true.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.49\">Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.49</ref> Initially Nicholas's father, [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]], refused the prospect of their marriage.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.49\" />\n\nAlexander and his wife were both vehemently [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]], and did not want the match with Princess Alix. It was generally known that Alexander III hoped for a better match for his son, such as [[Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne of Orl\u00e9ans|Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne]], the tall, dark-haired daughter of [[Philippe, Comte de Paris]], pretender to the throne of France.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.49\" /> Nicholas was not attracted to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, writing in his diary: \"Mama made a few allusions to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, daughter of the Comte de Paris. I myself want to go in one direction and it is evident that Mama wants me to choose the other one.\"<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.50.</ref> H\u00e9l\u00e8ne also resisted this match, as she was [[Roman Catholic]] and her father refused to allow her to convert to [[Russian Orthodoxy]]. After appealing to the Pope, who refused to consider the marriage, the potential relationship was ended. The tsar sent emissaries to [[Princess Margaret of Prussia]], sister of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]], and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Nicholas declared that he would rather become a monk than marry Margaret; she in turn was unwilling to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church from being Protestant.\n\nWhile in good health, Alexander III ignored his son's demands, but began to relent when his health began to fail in 1894.<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.50</ref> At first, Alix was troubled by the requirement that she become Orthodox, but she was persuaded and eventually became a fervent convert. The tsar and tsarina were not the only ones opposed to the match; Queen Victoria wrote to Alix's sister [[Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Victoria]] of her suspicions (which were correct) that [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei]] and Elisabeth were encouraging the match.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''pgs. 51 & 52</ref> The Queen opposed it not from personal feelings about the tsesarevich, whom she liked, but her misgivings about Russia, including past political experiences; her personal dislike of Nicholas's father, and fears over her granddaughter's safety in that country.\n[[File:Engagement official picture of Alexandra and Nicholas.jpg|thumb|180px|Tsar Nicholas II, in hussar uniform, and Princess Alix of Hesse in an official engagement photograph, 1894]]\nIn April 1894 Alix's brother [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernest Louis]], who had succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine in 1892, was to be married to his first cousin, [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (\"Ducky\"), daughter of Queen Victoria's second son [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], and his wife, [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia]], a sister of [[Alexander III of Russia]]. \nNumerous relatives gathered in Coburg, Germany, for the festivities, including Queen Victoria (who had arranged the marriage), the Prince of Wales, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany]], and the [[Empress Frederick]], mother of the Kaiser and eldest daughter of the Queen. Victoria Melita, a granddaughter of [[Tsar Alexander II]] through her mother, was also a first cousin of Nicholas. The Tsesarevich headed up the Russian delegation, which included three of Nicholas's uncles: Vladimir, Sergei and Paul; and two of his aunts by marriage: Elisabeth Feodorovna and Maria Pavlovna.<ref>King, Greg. ''The Court of the Last Tsar: Pomp Power and Pageantry in the Reign of Nicholas II ''(Wiley & Sons, 2006), pp. 36 & 37</ref>\n\nThe day after his arrival in Coburg, Nicholas proposed to Alix. She initially rejected him on the grounds of her refusal to convert to Orthodoxy. However, after pressure from the Kaiser, who had told her that it was her duty to marry Nicholas, and her sister Elisabeth, who noted similarities between Lutheranism and Russian Orthodoxy, she accepted Nicholas's second proposal.<ref>King, Greg. ''The Last Empress ''(Wiley & Sons, 1994) pp. 55\u201356</ref>\n\nFollowing the engagement, Alix returned to England with her grandmother. In June, Nicholas travelled to England to visit her, bringing with him his father's personal priest, Father Yanishev, who was to give her religious instruction. Along with visiting Alix and the Queen, Nicholas was there to attend christening of the eldest son of Nicholas and Alix's mutual cousin, [[George V|Prince George, Duke of York]] and his wife, [[Mary of Teck]]. Alix and Nicholas were both named as godparents of the boy, who reigned briefly as [[King Edward VIII]] of England in 1936.<ref>King, ''Empress, '' p. 70</ref>\n\nLater that autumn, as Alexander III's health declined, Nicholas obtained the permission of his dying father to summon Alix to the Romanovs' [[Crimean]] palace of [[Livadia Palace|Livadia]]. Escorted by her sister, Elisabeth, from [[Warsaw]] to the Crimea, she traveled by ordinary passenger train.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''pg. 73</ref> The dying tsar insisted on receiving Alix in full dress uniform and gave her his blessing.<ref>King, ''Empress'', p. 73</ref>\n\n==Empress of Russia==\n===Wedding===\n{{main|Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna}}\n[[File:Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna by Laurits Tuxen (1895-6, Royal coll.).jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait by [[Laurits Tuxen]] of the wedding of [[Tsar Nicholas II]] and the Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt, which took place at the Chapel of the Winter Palace, St Petersburg, on 14/26 November 1894.<ref>Among those also depicted in this portrait, against the wall and to the right of the window, from left to right \u2013 [[Christian IX of Denmark]], [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna]], [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna]], [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna]], [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna of Russia)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]], [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Olga Konstantinovna, Queen of the Hellenes]], the future [[Edward VII]], [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke George Alexandrovich]] (son of [[Tsar Alexander III]]) and [[Prince Heinrich of Prussia]] (son of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Kaiser Friedrich III]]).

The following day, Alix was received into the Russian Orthodox Church as \"the truly believing Grand Duchess Alexandra Feodorovna\". Yet as a dispensation, she was not required to repudiate Lutheranism or her former faith.<ref>King, ''Empress'' pgs. 74 & 75</ref> Alix apparently expressed a wish to take the name ''Yekaterina'', but on Nicholas's wish to relive the names of his great-grandfather [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and his great-grandmother [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Feodorovna]] as Nicholas and Alexandra, she took the name Alexandra.<ref>King, ''Court'', pg. 329</ref>\n\nAlexandra, along with her and Nicholas's mutual aunt and uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]], and some of Nicholas's relatives from Greece accompanied the coffin of Alexander III first to Moscow, where it lay in state in the Kremlin, and then to St. Petersburg. The funeral of Alexander III occurred on 19 November.\n\nThe marriage with Nicholas was not delayed. Alexandra and Nicholas were wed in the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Grand Church]] of the [[Winter Palace]] of [[St Petersburg]] on 26 November 1894, the birthday of Nicholas's mother, now [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]], when court mourning could be somewhat relaxed.<ref>King, ''Court, ''pg. 344</ref> The marriage that began that night remained exceptionally close until the pair was assassinated in 1918.

She brings misfortune with her.\"<ref>''Gilliard, Pierre''.Thirteen years at the Russian court.  Chapter 4.</ref> The subsequent coronation celebrations were marred by the [[Khodynka Tragedy]] and the royal couple were criticized as cold and uncaring.\n\n===Birth of eldest child===\n\nOn 15 November 1895, Alexandra gave birth to her eldest child and daughter, [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga]] at the Alexander Palace. Olga could not be [[heir presumptive]] due to the [[Pauline Laws]] implemented by Tsar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]: priority in the order of succession to the Russian throne belonged to male members of the Romanov dynasty, however distantly related to the Tsar, so long as any remained alive. While Alexandra wished to name her daughter Victoria after her beloved grandmother, the couple chose the name Olga instead after Nicholas's younger sister [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna]] and because it was an ancient Russian name. Although many Russians and the Romanovs were disappointed an heir to the throne was not born, Nicholas and Alexandra were delighted with their daughter and doted on her. It was expected that since Alexandra was only twenty three and still young, there would be plenty of time for a son to be born.\n\n===Coronation===\n[[File:Lesser CoA of the empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia.svg|thumb|left|Lesser arms of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]]\nAlexandra Feodorovna became Empress of Russia on her wedding day, but it was not until 14 May 1896 that the coronation of Nicholas and Alexandra took place at the [[Assumption Cathedral in Moscow|Assumption Cathedral]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in Moscow. The following day, the coronation celebrations were halted when the deaths of over one thousand people became known. The victims had been [[Stampede#Crushes|trampled to death]] at the [[Khodynka Field]] in [[Moscow]] when rumours spread that there would not be enough of the food being distributed in honour of the coronation for the thousands who had gathered there. The relatively small numbers of police in attendance could not maintain order, and thousands were crushed in the ensuing stampede. In light of these events the tsar declared he could not go to the ball being given that night by the French Ambassador, the Marquis de Montebello. Nonetheless his uncles urged him to attend so as not to offend the French. Nicholas relented, and he and Alexandra attended the ball. [[Sergei Witte]] commented, \"We expected the party would be called off. Instead it took place as if nothing had happened and the ball was opened by Their Majesties dancing a quadrille.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.80\">Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 80</ref> Alexandra was affected by the loss of life; \"The Empress appeared in great distress, her eyes reddened by tears,\" the British Ambassador informed Queen Victoria. Although Alexandra and Nicholas had visited the wounded the day after and offered to pay for the coffins of the dead, many Russians took the disaster at Khodynka Meadow as an omen that the reign would be unhappy. Others used the circumstances of the tragedy and the behaviour of the royal establishment to underscore the heartlessness of the autocracy and the contemptible shallowness of the young tsar and his \"German woman\".<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 81</ref>\n\nThat autumn Nicholas, Alexandra, and the infant Grand Duchess Olga\u2014who was approaching one\u2014traveled to Scotland to spend time with Queen Victoria at [[Balmoral Castle]]. While Nicholas was in somewhat of a bad mood due to days spent with \"Uncle Bertie\" (the Prince of Wales) shooting in bad weather while Nicholas suffered from a toothache,<ref>''Twilight of Splendor ''pg. 175</ref> Alexandra relished the time with her grandmother. It was in fact, the last time that grandmother and granddaughter would see each other, and when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, pregnancy with her fourth daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia, prevented Alexandra from attending the funeral in London.\n\n===Rejection by the Russian people===\n\nUnlike her vivacious and popular mother-in-law, Alexandra was heartily disliked among her subjects. She came off as very cold and curt, although according to her and many other close friends, she was only terribly shy and nervous in front of the Russian people. She felt her feelings were bruised and battered from the Russians' \"hateful\" nature. She was also frowned upon by the wealthy and poor alike for her distaste for Russian culture (her embrace of Orthodoxy notwithstanding), whether it was the food or the manner of dancing. She spoke Russian with a heavy accent. Her perceived inability to produce a son also incensed the people. After the birth of the Grand Duchess Olga, her first-born child, Nicholas was reported to have said, \"We are grateful she was a daughter; if she was a boy she would have belonged to the people, being a girl she belongs to us.\" When her second daughter [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]] was born, Alexandra was said to have burst into tears over what the Russian people would think of her. The disappointment only increased with the birth of her subsequent daughters, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Maria]] and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia]]. When her \"sunbeam\", [[Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia|Tsesarevich Alexei]], was born, she further isolated herself from the Russian court by spending nearly all of her time with him; his haemophilia bringing them even closer together.  She associated herself with more solitary figures such as [[Anna Vyrubova]] and the invalid Princess Sonia Orbeliani, rather than the \"frivolous\" young Russian aristocratic ladies.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nHistorian [[Barbara W. Tuchman]] in ''[[The Guns of August]]'' writes of Alexandra as tsarina:\n\n{{quote|Though it could hardly be said that the Czar governed Russia in a working sense, he ruled as an autocrat and was in turn ruled by his strong-willed if weak-witted wife. Beautiful, hysterical, and morbidly suspicious, she hated everyone but her immediate family and a series of fanatic or lunatic charlatans who offered comfort to her desperate soul.<ref>Tuchman, Barbara, ''[[The Guns of August]]'' 1962, Ballantine Books reprint 1994, p. 8</ref>}}\n\nIn later life she had an addiction to the barbiturate [[Barbital|Veronal]]: \"I'm literally saturated with it,\" she confessed to a friend in 1914.<ref>Dehn, Lili ''The Real Tsaritsa'', Boston, Little Brown, 1922, p138</ref>\n\nAlong with her association with Vyrubova and Orbeliani, Alexandra associated herself with [[Grand Duchess Militza Nikolaevna of Russia]], who was a Montenegrin princess by birth and wife of a relative of Nicholas. Through her, Alexandra was introduced to a mystic by the name of [[Nizier Anthelme Philippe|Philippe Nizier-Vachot]] in 1901. Philippe enjoyed a brief influence over the imperial couple, until he was exposed as a charlatan in 1903 and was expelled from Russia.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''153</ref> In 1902, it was also suggested that if Nicholas and Alexandra were to sponsor the canonisation of [[Seraphim of Sarov]], Alexandra would give birth to a son.<ref>King, ''Empress, ''pg. 153</ref> Imperial pressure from the tsar led to the church canonising him in 1903. Imperial interference in the canonisation process, which forced the Church to disregard the established rules regarding canonisation, led to an outcry from both laity and clergy alike.\n\nAlexandra lived mainly as a recluse during her husband's reign. She also was reported to have had a terrible relationship with her mother-in-law, Maria Feodorovna. The Dowager Empress had tried to assist Alexandra in learning about the position of empress, but was shunned by the younger woman. Unlike other European courts of the day, in the Russian court, the position of Dowager Empress was senior in rank and precedence to that of the tsarina\u2014a rule that Maria, with the support of Nicholas II, enforced strictly. At royal balls and other formal Imperial gatherings, Maria would enter on her son's arm, and Alexandra would silently trail behind them according to court protocol. It did not help that Maria tended to be extremely possessive of her sons. In addition, Alexandra resented the ostentatiously considerate treatment of Maria by her husband the tsar, which only slightly evaporated after the birth of their five children. For Maria's part, she did not approve of her son's marriage to a German bride and was appalled at her daughter-in-law's inability to win favour with the Russian people. In addition, Maria had spent seventeen years in Russia prior to her coronation with Alexander III; Alexandra had a scarce month to learn the rules of the Russian court (which she seldom followed), and this might have contributed to her unpopularity. Alexandra at least was astute enough not to criticise openly the woman she publicly referred to as \"Mother dear.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlexandra's only real associations were with Nicholas's siblings and a very small number of the otherwise close-knit Romanov family: [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] (husband of Nicholas's sister [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]]), [[Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich]] (the most artistic of the Imperial house) and his family, and [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia (1863\u20131919)|Grand Duke George Mikhailovich]], who was married to Nicholas's maternal first cousin, [[Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna (Maria of Greece)|Maria of Greece]]. Alexandra disliked in particular the family of Nicholas's senior uncle, [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich]], and his wife, [[Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Maria Pavlovna of Russia)|Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna]], who, during the war, openly criticized the Empress. She considered their sons [[Grand Duke Kyrill Vladimirovich of Russia|Kyrill]], [[Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia|Boris]] and [[Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia|Andrei]] to be irredeemably immoral, and in 1913 refused Boris's proposal for the hand of Grand Duchess Olga.\n\nAlexandra was very supportive of her husband, yet often gave him extreme advice. She was a fervent advocate of the \"[[divine right of kings]]\" and believed that it was unnecessary to attempt to secure the approval of the people, according to her aunt, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick of Germany]], who wrote to Queen Victoria that \"Alix is very imperious and will always insist on having her own way; she will never yield one iota of power she will imagine she wields{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=\"King, G, The Last Empress, p.93\">King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.93</ref> During World War I, with the national citizens aroused, all the complaints Russians had about the Empress\u2014for instance, her German birth, her poor ideals, her devotion to Rasputin\u2014circled and twisted around the deadly designs that claimed her entire family. Her assassination, according to the daughter of the British ambassador, was openly spoken of in aristocratic drawing rooms as the only way of saving the Empire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Meriel|title=Petrograd, the city of trouble, 1914\u20131918|date=2010|edition=reprint|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=978-1171704744|page=74}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with her children===\nAbout a year after her marriage to the tsar, Alexandra gave birth to the couple's first child: a girl named [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Olga]], born on 15 November 1895. The couple was fertile; Alexandra bore three more girls in the next six years: [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]] on 10 June 1897, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899\u20131918)|Maria]] on 26 June 1899, and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia]] on 18 June 1901. Three more years passed before she bore a son, the long-awaited heir to the throne: [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei Nikolaevich]], born in [[Petergof|Peterhof]] on 12 August 1904. To his parents' dismay, Alexei was born with [[hemophilia]], an incurable genetic disease of the blood that increased risk of early death because of failure of the blood to clot. It had caused the deaths of her elder brother Friedrich and her uncle Leopold. Alexandra felt guilt for having passed the disease to Alexei. Historians believe that she had a breakdown due to the worry for her son's health.\n\nDetermined to care for her children, Alexandra shocked the Russian aristocracy by nursing her own children. She repeated elements of her own upbringing in rearing them.<ref>Massie, R. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 132</ref>\n\n[[File:Family Nicholas II of Russia ca. 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The Russian Imperial Family, 1913. Left to right: Grand Duchess Maria, Tsarina Alexandra, Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana, Tsar Nicholas II, and Grand Duchess Anastasia. Tsesarevich Alexei sits in front of his parents.]]\n\nGrand Duchess Olga was reportedly shy and subdued. As she grew older, Olga read widely, both fiction and poetry, often borrowing books from her mother before the Empress had read them. \"You must wait, Mama, until I find out whether this book is a proper one for you to read,\" Olga wrote. She was the most bright of her siblings and possessed a quick mind, according to her tutors. While she adored her father, whom she physically resembled, she had a more distant relationship with Alexandra.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.154\">Massie, R. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p. 154</ref> Alexandra was close to her second daughter, Tatiana, who gave her unvarying attention but also was favoured by their father. If a favour was needed, the Imperial children agreed that \"Tatiana must ask Papa to grant it.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.154\" /> During the family's final months, Tatiana helped her mother by pushing her about the house in a wheelchair. She most resembled Alexandra, both in terms of appearance and personality. Tatiana was considered the most elegant of her sisters, and more attractive than Olga. \n\nThe third Grand Duchess, Maria, was sweet and gentle, said to enjoy talking about marriage and children. She took after her paternal grandparents and inherited [[Alexander III, Emperor of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]]\u2019s famous strength. The tsar thought she would make an excellent wife, and Maria was considered the \"angel\" of the family. Maria was considered the most beautiful of the sisters, along with Tatiana. Anastasia, exuberant and vivacious, was the youngest daughter and became well-known. She was dubbed the ''shvibzik,'' Russian for \"imp.\"<ref>Vorres, I, ''The Last Grand Duchess'', p.108</ref> While Anastasia physically resembled her mother, she was quite different in personality. She was energetic and mischievous throughout her childhood, known to climb trees and refuse to come down unless specifically commanded by her father. Her aunt and godmother, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, once recalled slapping the child for her merciless teasing.<ref>Vorres, I, ''The Last Grand Duchess'', p.109</ref>\n\nWhen they were children, Alexandra dressed her daughters as pairs, the oldest two and the youngest two wearing matching dresses. They were known as the 'Big Pair' and 'Little Pair,' respectively.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.157\">Massie, R. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.157</ref> As Olga and Tatiana grew older, they played a more serious role in public affairs.  There they referred to their parents as \"the Empress\" and \"the Emperor\".<ref name=\"Massie, R p.157\" /> Nicholas and Alexandra intended for both their older daughters to make their debuts in 1914, when Olga was nineteen and Tatiana seventeen. But the beginning of the [[First World War|Great War]] led them to cancel these plans. By 1917, the four daughters had blossomed into young women.<ref name=\"Massie, R p.158\">Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.158</ref> While Nicholas and Alexandra loved their daughters, their gender meant they would be less active in the world. They were frequently treated as one, with the nickname \"OTMA\", taken from their first names. Their brother's birth resulted in the girls being overshadowed. \n\nAlexandra doted on Alexei. The children's tutor [[Pierre Gilliard]] wrote, \"Alexei was the centre of a united family, the focus of all its hopes and affections. His sisters worshiped him. He was his parents' pride and joy. When he was well, the palace was transformed. Everyone and everything in it seemed bathed in sunshine.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p.158\" />\n\nKnowing that he had hemophilia, Alexandra was obsessed with trying to protect him. She consulted a number of mystics who claimed to be able to heal him during his nearly fatal attacks. Alexandra spoiled her only son and let him have his way. In 1912, Alexandra revealed Alexei's illness, in confidence, to her mother-in-law and Nicholas's sisters, but the knowledge soon reached a limited circle of courtiers and relatives. Alexandra became blamed for Alexei's frail health. Some of the Russian court referred to his condition as \"the English disease,\" because it had appeared among Queen Victoria's children. Alexandra was isolated by being foreign. Increasingly, she became an unpopular figure with the imperial family, the aristocracy, and the Russian people. During the [[World War I|Great War]], she became unpopular because of her German birth and upbringing, when that country was an enemy of the Russian Empire. Alexandra became a primary focus for the increasing unrest associated with  opposition to the monarchy.\n\n====Issue====\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Image!!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|colspan=5|'''By [[Nicholas II of Russia]]''' (6 June 1872&nbsp;\u2013 17 July 1918, married on 26 November 1894)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Olgachair.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|15 November|1895|3 November}}||rowspan=\"5\"|[[Execution of the Romanov family|17 July 1918]]||rowspan=\"5\"|executed by gunshot in [[Yekaterinburg]] by the [[Bolshevik]]s\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Tatiana Nikolaevna.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|10 June|1897|29 May}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:GrandDuchessMaria1914formal2.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899\u20131918)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|26 June|1899|14 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Crisco edit letters removed.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|18 June|1901|5 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Alexis.png|90px]] || [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]]||{{OldStyleDate|12 August|1904|30 July}}\n|}\n\nIn addition to the five children she bore, Alexandra was thought to have suffered a miscarriage in the summer of 1896, presumably because she became physically exhausted during her coronation festivities. She also may have had a phantom pregnancy in August 1902.<ref>Rounding, Virginia. \"Alix and Nicky\". (2011), p.41</ref>\n\nAlexandra's health was never robust and her frequent pregnancies, with four daughters in six years and her son three years after, drew from her energy. Her biographers, including Robert Massie, Carrolly Erickson, Greg King, and Peter Kurth, attribute the semi-invalidism of her later years to nervous exhaustion from obsessive worry over the fragile tsarevich, who suffered from hemophilia. She spent most of her time in bed or reclining on a chaise in her boudoir or on a veranda. This immobility enabled her to avoid the social occasions that she found distasteful. Alexandra regularly took a herbal medicine known as Adonis Vernalis in order to regulate her pulse. She was constantly tired, slept badly, and complained of swollen feet. She ate little, but never lost weight. She may have suffered from Graves Disease (hyperthyroidism), a condition resulting in high levels of the thyroid hormone, which can also result in [[atrial fibrillation]], poor heartbeat and lack of energy.<ref>Banks, ECS, ''Road to Ekaterinburg: Nicholas and Alexandra's Daughters 1913\u20131918.''

He was [[heir apparent]] to the throne of Russia. At first the infant seemed healthy but in a few weeks' time, it was noticed that when he bumped himself, his bruises did not heal. He would bleed from the navel and his blood was slow to clot. Alexei was diagnosed as suffering from [[haemophilia]], a genetic disease of males and carried by females, found among Alexandra's side of the family.<ref>Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p.574</ref> Because of lack of successful treatment, haemophilia was generally fatal in the early 20th century. It had entered the royal houses of Europe via the daughters of Queen Victoria, also a carrier. Alexandra's brother, [[Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine|Friedrich]] died in 1873, as did her uncle, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]], in 1884. \n\nHer sister [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine]] was later also found to carry the gene, and it emerged among descendants of her marriage to her cousin [[Prince Heinrich of Prussia]]. [[Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], another of Queen Victoria's granddaughters and a first cousin of Alexandra, also was found to carry the disease. She married [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII of Spain]] and two of her sons were haemophiliacs. \n\nSince the incurable illness threatened the sole son and heir of the emperor, the Crown decided to keep his condition secret from the Russian people. They wanted to limit social instability because of uncertainty. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors to treat Alexei. Their treatments generally failed. Burdened with the threats to her son from any fall or cut, Alexandra turned toward religion for comfort. She studied all the Orthodox rituals and saints, and spent hours daily praying in her private chapel for deliverance.<ref>Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p.374</ref> She also increasingly turned to [[mysticism|mystics]] and so-called holy men. \n\n[[Grigori Rasputin]], a priest and mystic from Siberia, appeared to have a cure for her son and became powerful in court as a result. But Rasputin's debauched habits led Nicholas at times to distance him from the family. Even after Alexandra was told by the director of the national police that a drunk Rasputin had exposed himself at a popular Moscow restaurant and bragged that Nicholas gave him sexual access to Alexandra, she blamed the account on malicious gossip. \"Saints are always calumniated,\" she once wrote. \"He is hated because we love him.\"<ref name=\"Denton, C.S p.577\">Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p.577</ref>  Nicholas was not nearly as blind, but he felt powerless to do anything about the man who seemingly saved his only son's life. [[Pierre Gilliard]] wrote, \"He did not like to send Rasputin away, for if Alexei died, in the eyes of the mother, he would have been the murderer of his own son.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/gilliard/XIV.html|title=Thirteen Years at the Russian Court \u2013 Chapter Fourteen \u2013 Death of Rasputin|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start, members of the court exchanged gossip about Rasputin. Although some of St.. Petersburg's top clergy accepted him as a living prophet, others angrily denounced him as a fraud and a heretic. Stories from his life in Siberia were heard in St. Petersburg. For instance, he was said to conduct weddings for villagers in exchange for sleeping the first night with the bride. He lived in St. Petersburg with his two daughters and two housekeepers, and was often visited by persons seeking his blessing, a healing, or a favour with the tsarina. Women, enchanted by the healer's crude mystique, also came to Rasputin for more \"private blessings\" and received a private audience in his bedroom, jokingly called the \"Holy of Holies\". Rasputin liked to preach a unique theology that one must become familiar with sin before having a chance to overcome it.<ref>Denton, C. S, ''Absolute Power'', p.576</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Alexei suffered a life-threatening [[Bleeding|haemorrhage]] in the thigh while the family was at [[Spa\u0142a]] in Poland. Alexandra and Nicholas took turns at his bedside and tried in vain to comfort him from his intense pain.<ref name=\"Denton, C.S p.575\">Denton, C.S, ''Absolute Power'', p. 575</ref> Alexandra thought God was ignoring her prayers for her son's relief. Alexandra in desperation sent a telegram to Rasputin, who immediately replied: \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\"<ref name=\"Denton, C.S p.575\" /> Alexei recovered after Rasputin's advice was followed. From 1912 onwards, Alexandra came to rely increasingly on Rasputin and to believe in his ability to ease Alexei's suffering. This reliance enhanced Rasputin's political power. His role in the court seriously undermined Romanov rule during the First World War.\n\nRasputin was assassinated to end his perceived interference in political matters, on 30 December 1916. Amongst the conspirators were the nobleman [[Felix Yusupov|Prince Felix Yusupov]], who was married to Nicholas II's niece, [[Princess Irina of Russia]]; and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], a first cousin of Nicholas.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Bodarevsky - Zarin Alexandra Fyodorovna.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Portrait of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. Livadia, 1907]]\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] was a pivotal moment for Russia and Alexandra. The war pitted the Russian Empire of the Romanov dynasty against the much stronger German Empire of the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]].<ref>The Last tsar by Virginia Cowles, p.4</ref> When Alexandra learned of the Russian mobilization, she stormed into her husband's study and said: \"War! And I knew nothing of it! This is the end of everything.\"<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.213</ref>\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine, ruled by her brother, formed part of the German Empire. This was, of course, the place of Alexandra's birth. This made Alexandra very unpopular with the Russian people, who accused her of collaboration with the Germans.<ref>The Last Empress by Greg King p.223</ref> The German Emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], was also Alexandra's first cousin. Ironically, one of the few things that Empress Alexandra and her mother-in-law Empress Maria had in common was their utter distaste for Emperor Wilhelm II. Wilhelm treated her with condescension, as a small time German princess.  Alexandra's sister, Irene, who was married to Kaiser Wilhelm's brother, Heinrich, was also on the German side.\n\nWhen the tsar travelled to the front line in 1915 to take personal command of the Army, he left Alexandra in charge as Regent in the capital Saint Petersburg. Her brother-in-law, [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] recorded, \"When the Emperor went to war of course his wife governed instead of him.\"<ref name=\"King, G p.244\">King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.244</ref> Alexandra had no experience of government and constantly appointed and re-appointed incompetent new ministers, which meant the government was never stable or efficient. This was particularly dangerous in a war of attrition, as neither the troops nor the civilian population were ever adequately supplied. She paid attention to the self-serving advice of Rasputin, and their relationship was widely, though falsely, believed to be sexual in nature.  Alexandra was the focus of ever-increasing negative rumors, and was widely believed to be a German spy at the Russian court.\n\nDuring the war, there was great concern within the imperial house of the influence empress Alexandra had upon state affairs through the Tsar, and the influence [[Grigori Rasputin]] was believed to have upon her, as it was considered to provoke the public and endanger the safety of the imperial throne and the survival of the monarchy.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\">King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8065-1761-1}}. p. 299-300</ref> \nOn behalf of the imperial relatives of the Tsar, both [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)]] and [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] had been selected to mediate and ask Empress Alexandra to banish Rasputin from court to protect her and the throne's reputation, the former twice, but without success. In parallel, several of the Grand Dukes had tried to intervene with the Tsar, but with no more success.\n\n[[File:Nicholas II with his family in Yevpatoria.jpg|thumb|left|Tsar, Alexandra and their children in [[Yevpatoria]], Crimea, May 1916]]\nDuring this conflict of 1916\u20131917, [[Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] reportedly planned a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to depose the Tsar with the help of four regiments of the imperial guard which were to invade the Alexander Palace, force the Tsar to abdicate and replace him with his underage son under the regency of her son [[Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia]].<ref>King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8065-1761-1}}. p. 319-26-300</ref>\n\nThere are documents that support the fact that, in this critical situation, the empress dowager Maria Feodorovna was involved in a planned [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to depose her son from the throne in order to save the monarchy.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  The plan was reportedly for Maria to make a final ultimatum to the Tsar to banish Rasputin unless he wished for her to leave the capital, which would be the signal to unleash the coup.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  Exactly how she planned to replace her son is unconfirmed, but two versions are available: first, that [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]] would take power in her name, and that she herself would thereafter become ruling empress; the other version claims that she and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia would replace the Tsar with his son, the heir to the throne, Maria's grandson Alexei, upon which Maria and Paul Alexandrovich would share power as regents during his minority.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed about the planned coup, and when Maria Feodorovna made the ultimatum to the Tsar, the empress convinced him to order his mother to leave the capital.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p. 299-300\"/>  \nConsequently, the Dowager Empress left St. Petersburg to live in the [[Mariyinsky Palace]] in [[Kiev]] the same year. She never again returned to Russia's capital.\n\n==Revolution (1917)==\n[[World War I]] put what proved to be unbearable burden on Imperial Russia's government and economy, both of which were dangerously weak. Mass shortages and hunger became the daily situation for tens of millions of Russians due to the disruptions of the [[war economy]]. Fifteen million men were diverted from agricultural production to fight in the war, and the transportation infrastructure (primarily railroads) was diverted towards war use, exacerbating food shortages in the cities as available agricultural products could not be brought to urban areas. Inflation was rampant. This, combined with the food shortages and the poor performance by the Russian military in the war, generated a great deal of anger and unrest among the people in [[Saint Petersburg]] and other cities.<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the Tsars'', p.52</ref>\n\nThe decision of the tsar to take personal command of the military against advice was disastrous, as he was directly blamed for all losses. His relocation to the front, leaving the [[Empress]] in charge of the government, helped undermine the Romanov dynasty. The poor performance of the military led to rumours believed by the people that the German-born Empress was part of a conspiracy to help Germany win the war. Moreover, within several months of taking personal command of the army, the tsar replaced several capable ministers with less able men on the Empress and Rasputin's behest; most notable among these replacements was replacing N. B. [[Nikolai Borisovich Shcherbatov|Shcherbatov]] with [[Alexei Khvostov|Khvostov]] as minister of the interior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/popups/pdf_viewer.jsf?cid=CBO9781139055437A042&hithighlight=on&ref=true&pubCode=CUP&urlPrefix=cambridge&productCode=cho|title=War and Revolution, 1914\u20131917.\" In The Cambridge History of Russia|last=Lohr|first=Eric|date=|website=universitypublishingonline.org|publisher=Cambridge University Press|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref> The severe winter of 1916\u201317 essentially doomed Imperial Russia. Food shortages worsened and [[famine]] gripped the cities. The mismanagement and failures of the war turned the soldiers against the tsar. By 1917, the tsar realized that Russia could not fight the war much longer and a make or break spring offensive was planned. But as railroads carried troops to the front there was little capacity left to bring food to the cities.\n\nBy March 1917, conditions had worsened even more. Steelworkers went out on strike on 7 March, and the following day, crowds hungry for bread began rioting on the streets of St Petersburg to protest food shortages and the war. After two days of rioting, the tsar ordered the Army to restore order and on 11 March they fired on the crowd. That very same day, the [[Duma]], the elected legislature, urged the tsar to take action to ameliorate the concerns of the people. The tsar responded by dissolving the Duma.<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the tsars'', p.53</ref>\n\nOn 12 March soldiers sent to suppress the rioting crowds mutinied and joined the rebellion, thus providing the spark to ignite the February Revolution (like the later October Revolution of November 1917, the Russian Revolutions of 1917 get their names due to the Old Style calendar). Soldiers and workers set up the \"[[Petrograd Soviet]]\" of 2,500 elected deputies while the Duma declared a Provisional Government on 13 March. [[Alexander Kerensky]] was a key player in the new regime. The Duma informed the tsar that day that he must abdicate.\n\nIn an effort to put an end to the uprising in the capital, Nicholas tried to get to St Petersburg by train from army headquarters at Mogiliev. The route was blocked so he tried another way. His train was stopped at Pskov where, after receiving advice from his generals, he first abdicated the throne for himself and later, on seeking medical advice, for himself and his son the [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei]].<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the tsars'', p.55</ref>\n\nAlexandra was now in a perilous position as the wife of the deposed tsar, hated by the Russian people.

They were visited by [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] from the government, who interviewed Alexandra regarding her involvement in state affairs and Rasputin's involvement in them through his influence over her.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p 344-345\">King, Greg, The Last Empress, Citadel Press Book, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8065-1761-1}}. p 344-345</ref> She answered that as she and her spouse kept no secrets from each other, they often discussed politics and she naturally gave him advice to support him; as for Rasputin, he had been a true holy man of God, and his advice had been only in the interest of the good of Russia and the imperial family.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994. p 344-345\"/> After the interview, Kerensky told the tsar that he believed that Alexandra had told him the truth and was not lying.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nThe Provisional Government did not wish to keep the family in Russia, particularly as both the family as well as the Provincial Government were under threat from the Bolsheviks; they trusted that the former tsar and his family would be received in Great Britain, and made sure inquiries were being made.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>  Despite the fact he was a first cousin of both Nicholas and Alexandra, [[George V]] refused to allow them and their family permission to evacuate to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], as he was alarmed by their unpopularity in his country and the potential repercussions to his own throne.<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the tsars'', p.57</ref> After this, they were suggested to be moved to France; however, although the French government was never asked, British diplomats in France reported that the family was not likely to be welcome there, as anti-German feelings were strong in France during the war and Alexandra was widely unpopular because she was believed to be a sympathizer of Germany.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> The Provisional Government was reportedly very disappointed that no foreign state seemed to be willing to receive the family, and was forced to act and relocate them within Russia, as the security situation was becoming more and more difficult.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nIn August 1917, the family were moved to [[Tobolsk]] in [[Siberia]], a step by the [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] government designed to remove them from the capital and possible harm.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>  Nicholas and Alexandra had themselves suggested to be moved to the [[Livadia Palace]] in the Crimea, but Kerensky deemed this to be too dangerous, as they would have to travel through Central Russia, an area which was at the time full of riots where the upper classes were attacked by the public and their mansions burned.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> Tobolsk in Siberia was, in contrast to Central and Southern Russia, a calm and peaceful place with greater security and more sympathy for the former tsar.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> There were indications that the Provisional Government were actually attempting to transport them out of Russia by the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], thus fulfilling the government's wish to have them expelled, but now via a different route, after the first attempt to exile them to Europe had failed.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/> However, this plan was not revealed to the family, and if it had indeed been the intent of the government, it had to be cancelled because of a strong Bolshevik presence in Ekaterinburg and other cities along the Trans-Siberian Railway east of Tobolsk, and the family therefore continued to their official destination.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nFrom Tobolsk, Alexandra managed to send a letter to her sister-in-law, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia Alexandrovna]], in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]:\n\n{{quote|My darling Xenia,\n\nMy thoughts are with you, how magically good and beautiful everything must be with you \u2013 you are the flowers.

The fall of the Provincial Government and the Bolshevik's accession to power greatly worsened their position.<ref name=\"King, Greg 1994\"/>\n\nIn 1918, they were subsequently moved to Bolshevik controlled [[Yekaterinburg]]. Nicholas, Alexandra and their daughter Maria arrived at the [[Ipatiev House]] on 30 April 1918. On entering their new prison, they were ordered to open all their luggage. Alexandra immediately objected. Nicholas tried to come to her defence saying, \"So far we have had polite treatment and men who were gentlemen but now -\"<ref name=\"King, G p.344\">King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.344</ref> The former Tsar was quickly cut off. The guards informed him he was no longer at Tsarskoe Selo and that refusal to comply with their request would result in his removal from the rest of his family; a second offence would be rewarded with hard labour. Fearing for her husband's safety, Alexandra quickly gave in and allowed the search. On the window frame of what was to be her last bedroom in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra scrawled a [[swastika]], her favourite good luck symbol, and pencilled the date 17/30 April 1918.<ref name=\"King, G p.344\" /> In May, the rest of the family arrived in Yekaterinburg. They had not been able to travel earlier due to the illness of Alexei. Alexandra was pleased to be reunited with her family once more.\n\nSeventy-five men did guard duty at the Ipatiev House. Many of the men were factory workers from the local Zlokazovsky Factory and the Verkh-Isetsk Factory. The commandant of the Ipatiev House, Alexander Avadeyev was described as \"a real Bolshevik\". The majority of witnesses recall him as coarse, brutish and a heavy drinker. If a request for a favour on behalf of the family reached Avadeyev, he always gave the same response, \"Let them go to hell!!\" The guards in the house often heard him refer to the deposed tsar as \"Nicholas the Blood-Drinker\" and to Alexandra as \"The German Bitch\".<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.345</ref>\n\nFor the Romanovs, life at the Ipatiev House was a nightmare of uncertainty and fear. The Imperial Family never knew if they would still be in the Ipatiev House from one day to the next or if they might be separated or killed. The privileges allowed to them were few. For an hour each afternoon they could exercise in the rear garden under the watchful eye of the guards. Alexei could still not walk, and his sailor Nagorny had to carry him. Alexandra rarely joined her family in these daily activities. Instead she spent most of her time sitting in a wheelchair, reading the Bible or the works of St. Seraphim. At night the Romanovs played cards or read; they received little mail from the outside world, and the only newspapers they were allowed were outdated editions.<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.346</ref>\n\nDmitri Volkogonov and other Soviet historians believe that indirect evidence indicates that [[Vladimir Lenin]] personally ordered the execution of the Imperial Family,<ref>Volkogonov, Dmitri (2006).

Trotsky wrote:\n\n{{quote|My next visit to Moscow took place after the fall of Ekaterinburg. Talking to [[Yakov Sverdlov|Sverdlov]] I asked in passing, \"Oh yes, and where is the tsar?\" \"It's all over,\" he answered. \"He has been shot.\" \"And where is his family?\" \"And the family with him.\" \"All of them?\" I asked, apparently with a touch of surprise. \"All of them,\" replied Sverdlov. \"What about it?\" He was waiting to see my reaction. I made no reply. \"And who made the decision?\" I asked. \"We decided it here. Ilyich (Lenin) believed that we shouldn't leave The Whites a live banner to rally around, especially under the present difficult circumstances.\"<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.358</ref>}}\n\nOn 4 July 1918, [[Yakov Yurovsky]], the chief of the Ekaterinburg Cheka, was appointed commandant of the Ipatiev House. Yurovsky was a loyal Bolshevik, a man Moscow could rely on to carry out its orders regarding The Imperial Family. Yurovsky quickly tightened security. From The Imperial Family he collected all of their jewellery and valuables. These he placed in a box which he sealed and left with the prisoners. Alexandra kept only two bracelets which her uncle, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]], had given her as a child and which she could not take off. He did not know that the former tsarina and her daughters wore concealed on their person diamonds, emeralds, rubies and ropes of pearls. These would be discovered only after the murders. Yurovsky had been given the order for the murder on 13 July.<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p.539</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, 14 July 1918, two priests came to the Ipatiev House to celebrate the Divine Liturgy. One of the priests, Father Storozhev later recalled:\n\n{{quote|I went into the living room first, then the deacon and Yurovsky. At the same time Nicholas and Alexandra entered through the doors leading into the inner room. Two of his daughters were with him. I did not have a chance to see exactly which ones. I believe Yurovsky asked Nicholas Alexandrovich, \"Well, are you all here?\" Nicholas Alexandrovich answered firmly, \"Yes, all of us.\" Ahead beyond the archway, Alexandra Feodorovna was already in place with two daughters and Alexei Nicolaievich. He was sitting in a wheelchair and wore a jacket, as it seemed to me, with a sailor's collar. He was pale, but not so much as at the time of my first service. In general he looked more healthy. Alexandra Feodorovna also had a healthier appearance. ...According to the liturgy of the service it is customary at a certain point to read the prayer, \"Who Resteth with the Saints.\" On this occasion for some reason the deacon, instead of reading the prayer began to sing it, and I as well, somewhat embarrassed by this departure from the ritual. But we had scarcely begun to sing when I heard the members of the Romanov family, standing behind me, fall on their knees ...<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.361</ref>}}\n\n==Death==\n{{main|Execution of the Romanov family}}\n\n===Execution===\nTuesday, 16 July 1918 passed normally for the former imperial family. At four o'clock in the afternoon, Nicholas and his daughters took their usual walk in the small garden. Early in the evening Yurovsky sent away the fifteen-year-old kitchen boy Leonid Sedinev, saying that his uncle wished to see him. At 7 p.m., Yurovsky summoned all the Cheka men into his room and ordered them to collect all the revolvers from the outside guards. With twelve heavy military revolvers lying before him on the table he said, \"Tonight, we shoot the entire family, everybody.\" Upstairs Nicholas and Alexandra passed the evening playing [[bezique]]; at ten thirty, they went to bed.<ref>Massie, R, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', p,540</ref>\n\nThe former tsar, tsarina, and all of their family, including the gravely ill Alexei, along with several family servants, were executed by firing squad and bayonets in the basement of the Ipatiev House, where they had been imprisoned, early in the morning of 17 July 1918, by a detachment of [[Bolshevik]]s led by [[Yakov Yurovsky]].<ref>Tames, R, ''Last of the Tsars'', p. 63</ref> In the basement room of the Ipatiev House, Alexandra complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on, whereupon Nicholas asked for and received three chairs from the guards. Minutes later, at about 2:15&nbsp;a.m., a squad of soldiers, each armed with a revolver, entered the room. Their leader Yurovsky ordered the entire party to stand; Alexandra complied \"with a flash of anger\", and Yurovsky then casually pronounced, \"Your relations have tried to save you. They have failed and we must now shoot you.\" Nicholas rose from his chair and only had time to utter \"What...?\" before he was shot several times, not (as is usually said) in the head, but in the chest; his skull bears no bullet wounds, but his ribs were shattered by at least three fatal bullet wounds.<ref>Denton, C.S., ''Absolute Power'', p.588</ref>  Standing about six feet from the gunmen and facing them, Alexandra watched the execution of her husband and two menservants before military commissar [[Peter Ermakov]] took aim at her.  She instinctively turned away from him and began to make the sign of the cross, but before she could finish the gesture, Ermakov killed her with a single gunshot which, as she had partly turned away, entered her head just above the left ear and exited at the same spot above her right ear.  After all the victims had been shot, Ermakov in a drunken haze stabbed Alexandra's body and that of her husband, shattering both their rib cages and chipping some of Alexandra's vertebrae.<ref>King, G, ''The Last Empress'', p.364</ref>\n\n===Identification of remains===\n[[File:Yekaterinburg cathedral on the blood 2007.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Yekaterinburg]]'s \"[[All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land|Church on the Blood]]\", built on the spot where the Ipatiev House once stood]]\nAfter the execution of the Romanov family in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra's body, along with Nicholas, their children and some faithful retainers who died with them, was stripped and the clothing burnt according to the Yurovsky Note.

They belonged to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)]]. Nicholas was identified using DNA obtained from, among others, his late brother [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia]].

In the year 2018, a total of 577 TWh was traded on the Power Spot Markets of EPEX SPOT (2017: 543 TWh). In the field of natural gas the volume traded on the EEX amounted to 1,111 TWh, an increase of 34 percent compared with the previous year (2017: 828 TWh).

On each day of the year, EPEX SPOT operates day-ahead auctions for three market areas: Germany/Austria, France and Switzerland. The physical delivery of power takes place on the next day. EPEX SPOT also provides an intraday market for Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria and the United Kingdom. This market can be used to satisfy short-term needs of electricity or to sell short-term over capacities. Participants in the market can buy up to 45 minutes before every hour electricity for the specific hour. This market operates 24/7 without exceptions. The electricity for the next day can be traded from 15:00 onwards.\n\nIn 2011, EEX introduced 24/7 trading on the Natural Gas Spot Market. On the Spot Market, companies can trade natural gas on a continuous basis for the current day (within day), one day and two days in advance as well as for the following weekend. Since the launch of 24/7 trading EEX has also offered continuous trading with a minimum lot size of 1 MW (in addition to the 10 MW contracts). Short term gas quantities can be traded on the exchange for delivery in the market areas GASPOOL, NetConnect Germany (NCG) and the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) area.\n\nEEX offers also a spot market for [[EU ETS|EU allowances]]. Since 2005, EEX operates both [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s markets in emission allowances.<ref>[http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances Emission Allowances Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304062035/http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances |date=4 March 2014 }}</ref> EEX has offered trading of emission allowances on the basis of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 2005. EEX currently runs a secondary market for continuous trading on a Spot and Derivatives basis for EU ETS allowances (EUA, EUAA) and Kyoto credits (CER, ERU).<ref>[http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances/emissions-allowance-secondary-market Emission Allowances Secondary Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304060802/http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances/emissions-allowance-secondary-market |date=4 March 2014 }}</ref> As of March 26, 2008, it is possible to trade CER Futures on the EEX (Certified Emission Reductions), global emission credits in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. On 14 April 2008 EEX and Eurex launched trading of options on EUA Futures. Since January 2010 EEX AG runs the auctioning of the Emission Allowances issued by the Federal Ministry of the Environment. All trading participants admitted to trading in emission allowances on EEX are able to take part in the auction without any further preconditions regarding licensing. From the very beginning, this also included all trading participants taking part in the existing Eurex cooperation on the Derivatives Market. In addition, EEX also carries out the EUA auctions for further countries (Poland, Hungary). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has won the tendering procedure for the transitory auctioning platform for the EUA auctioned off by Germany for the third emissions trading period in February 2012 and it was chosen as cooperation exchange for the NER30 program of the European Investment Bank (EIB). As of 30 April 2012, emission allowances for the aviation industry (EU Aviation Allowances \u2013 EUAA) will also be offered for trading. Furthermore, Futures on Emission Reduction Units (ERU) will be launched at the end of April. In March, EEX extended the futures on Certified Emission Reductions (CER) for all maturities of the third trading period.\n\n==Derivatives market==\nParticipants on the EEX  can trade power contracts (weeks, months, quarters, years) up to 6 years in the future. The Power Futures are financially settled contracts, but they can be physically delivered in Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy (Coming). Besides electricity also natural gas futures (market areas GASPOOL and NCG), a broad range of {{CO2}} derivatives ([[Futures contract|Futures]] on EUA, CER, EUAA and ERU) can be traded at the EEX-Derivatives market.\n\n==Clearing and settlement==\nClearing and settlement of all exchange transactions is done by the European Commodity Clearing AG (ECC). ECC was founded in 2006 with the transfer of the EEX clearing activities to this subsidiary.<ref>[http://www.eex.com/en/about/newsroom/news-detail/eex-and-endex-establish-clearing-co-operation/57366 Press Release, 07/05/2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175715/http://www.eex.com/en/about/newsroom/news-detail/eex-and-endex-establish-clearing-co-operation/57366 |date=16 April 2014 }}</ref> Specialised on the physical delivery of energy products, ECC is dedicated clearing provider for 10 exchanges: European Energy Exchange (EEX), EEX Asia, EPEX SPOT, Powernext and Power Exchange Central Europe (PXE)as well as the partner exchanges HUPX, HUDEX, NOREXECO, SEEPEX and SEMOpx. Furthermore, EEX and ECC provide the service of Trade Registration. This service enables the trading participants and the trade registration participants to conclude transactions through registration by mutual agreement or to have over-the-counter transactions registered.\n\n==Transparency==\nEEX operates \"Transparency in Energy Markets\u201d, the neutral platform for energy market data which fulfils the statutory publication requirements and implements the market participants\u2019 voluntary commitments. The platform was established by EEX and the four German transmission system operators and launched in October 2009. In 2011, the Austrian transmission system operator Austrian Power Grid AG joined the cooperation.

On each day of the year, EPEX SPOT operates day-ahead auctions for three market areas: Germany/Austria, France and Switzerland. The physical delivery of power takes place on the next day. EPEX SPOT also provides an intraday market for Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria and the United Kingdom. This market can be used to satisfy short-term needs of electricity or to sell short-term over capacities. Participants in the market can buy up to 45 minutes before every hour electricity for the specific hour. This market operates 24/7 without exceptions. The electricity for the next day can be traded from 15:00 onwards.\n\nIn 2011, EEX introduced 24/7 trading on the Natural Gas Spot Market. On the Spot Market, companies can trade natural gas on a continuous basis for the current day (within day), one day and two days in advance as well as for the following weekend. Since the launch of 24/7 trading EEX has also offered continuous trading with a minimum lot size of 1 MW (in addition to the 10 MW contracts). Short term gas quantities can be traded on the exchange for delivery in the market areas GASPOOL, NetConnect Germany (NCG) and the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) area.\n\nEEX offers also a spot market for [[EU ETS|EU allowances]]. Since 2005, EEX operates both [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s markets in emission allowances.<ref>[http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances Emission Allowances Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304062035/http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances |date=4 March 2014 }}</ref> EEX has offered trading of emission allowances on the basis of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 2005. EEX currently runs a secondary market for continuous trading on a Spot and Derivatives basis for EU ETS allowances (EUA, EUAA) and Kyoto credits (CER, ERU).<ref>[http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances/emissions-allowance-secondary-market Emission Allowances Secondary Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304060802/http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances/emissions-allowance-secondary-market |date=4 March 2014 }}</ref> As of March 26, 2008, it is possible to trade CER Futures on the EEX (Certified Emission Reductions), global emission credits in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. On 14 April 2008 EEX and Eurex launched trading of options on EUA Futures. Since January 2010 EEX AG runs the auctioning of the Emission Allowances issued by the Federal Ministry of the Environment. All trading participants admitted to trading in emission allowances on EEX are able to take part in the auction without any further preconditions regarding licensing. From the very beginning, this also included all trading participants taking part in the existing Eurex cooperation on the Derivatives Market. In addition, EEX also carries out the EUA auctions for further countries (Poland, Hungary). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has won the tendering procedure for the transitory auctioning platform for the EUA auctioned off by Germany for the third emissions trading period in February 2012 and it was chosen as cooperation exchange for the NER30 program of the European Investment Bank (EIB). As of 30 April 2012, emission allowances for the aviation industry (EU Aviation Allowances \u2013 EUAA) will also be offered for trading. Furthermore, Futures on Emission Reduction Units (ERU) will be launched at the end of April. In March, EEX extended the futures on Certified Emission Reductions (CER) for all maturities of the third trading period.\n\n==Derivatives market==\nParticipants on the EEX  can trade power contracts (weeks, months, quarters, years) up to 6 years in the future. The Power Futures are financially settled contracts, but they can be physically delivered in Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy (Coming). Besides electricity also natural gas futures (market areas GASPOOL and NCG), a broad range of {{CO2}} derivatives ([[Futures contract|Futures]] on EUA, CER, EUAA and ERU) can be traded at the EEX-Derivatives market.\n\n==Clearing and settlement==\nClearing and settlement of all exchange transactions is done by the European Commodity Clearing AG (ECC). ECC was founded in 2006 with the transfer of the EEX clearing activities to this subsidiary.<ref>[http://www.eex.com/en/about/newsroom/news-detail/eex-and-endex-establish-clearing-co-operation/57366 Press Release, 07/05/2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175715/http://www.eex.com/en/about/newsroom/news-detail/eex-and-endex-establish-clearing-co-operation/57366 |date=16 April 2014 }}</ref> Specialised on the physical delivery of energy products, ECC is dedicated clearing provider for 10 exchanges: European Energy Exchange (EEX), EEX Asia, EPEX SPOT, Powernext and Power Exchange Central Europe (PXE)as well as the partner exchanges HUPX, HUDEX, NOREXECO, SEEPEX and SEMOpx. Furthermore, EEX and ECC provide the service of Trade Registration. This service enables the trading participants and the trade registration participants to conclude transactions through registration by mutual agreement or to have over-the-counter transactions registered.\n\n==Transparency==\nEEX operates \"Transparency in Energy Markets\u201d, the neutral platform for energy market data which fulfils the statutory publication requirements and implements the market participants\u2019 voluntary commitments. The platform was established by EEX and the four German transmission system operators and launched in October 2009. In 2011, the Austrian transmission system operator Austrian Power Grid AG joined the cooperation. EEX is in charge of the operation of the platform, which comprises plausibility checking, anonymisation, aggregation and publication of the data reported.\n\nOn 2 September 2014, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) launched its new transparency site.

After his third season at [[Marquette University]], Rivers was drafted in the second round (31st overall<ref name=coachfile/>) of the [[1983 NBA draft]] by the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. He graduated from Marquette while completing course work as an NBA player. He spent the next seven seasons as a starter in Atlanta, assisting star [[Dominique Wilkins]] as the team found great regular-season success. He averaged a double-double for the [[1986-87 NBA season|1986\u201387 season]] with 12.8 points and 10.0 assists per game. Rivers later spent one year as a starter for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and two more for the [[New York Knicks]], before finishing his career as a player for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] from 1994 to 1996.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===Orlando Magic (1999\u20132003)===\nRivers began his coaching career with the [[Orlando Magic]] in 1999, where he coached for more than four [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] seasons.

That season, he led the team that was picked to finish last in the league to a near playoff berth.\n\nDuring the Magic's free agency spending spree in the summer of 2000, Doc Rivers had the opportunity to assemble the first \"Big Three\" team in the NBA, as the Magic were courting free agent [[Tim Duncan]], who came close to signing with the Magic and teaming up with [[Grant Hill]] and [[Tracy McGrady]]. However, Tim Duncan re-signed with the San Antonio Spurs due to Rivers' strict policy of family members not being allowed to travel in the team's plane.<ref>https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2018/2/15/17018756/grant-hill-confirms-the-tim-duncan-doc-rivers-airplane-policy-story</ref>\n\nHe made the post-season in his next three years as coach, but was fired in 2003 after a 1\u201310 start to the season.\n\n===Boston Celtics (2004\u20132013)===\nAfter spending a year working as a commentator for the ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' (calling the [[2004 NBA Finals|2004 Finals]] with [[Al Michaels]]), he was hired by the [[Boston Celtics]] as their head coach in 2004.

As an NBA [[point guard]], Rivers was known for his defense, a trait that has carried over into his coaching.\n\n==Playing career==\n[[File:Doc Rivers.jpg|thumb|Rivers in 2011]]\nRivers was a [[McDonald's All-American]] for [[Proviso East High School]] in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-02-17/sports/ct-spt-0218-mitchell--20120218_1_austin-rivers-jabari-parker-chicago-eyes|title=Rivers reflects on stress son is under: Austin was high school phenom like his father, but Celtics coach says pressure much greater now|accessdate=February 18, 2012|date=February 18, 2012|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Mitchell, Fred}}</ref> Rivers represented the United States with the [[United States men's national basketball team|national team]] in the [[1982 FIBA World Championship]], in which he led the team to the silver medal, despite missing the last shot in the final, which could have given the title to his team. After his third season at [[Marquette University]], Rivers was drafted in the second round (31st overall<ref name=coachfile/>) of the [[1983 NBA draft]] by the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. He graduated from Marquette while completing course work as an NBA player. He spent the next seven seasons as a starter in Atlanta, assisting star [[Dominique Wilkins]] as the team found great regular-season success. He averaged a double-double for the [[1986-87 NBA season|1986\u201387 season]] with 12.8 points and 10.0 assists per game. Rivers later spent one year as a starter for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and two more for the [[New York Knicks]], before finishing his career as a player for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] from 1994 to 1996.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===Orlando Magic (1999\u20132003)===\nRivers began his coaching career with the [[Orlando Magic]] in 1999, where he coached for more than four [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] seasons. Rivers won the [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year award]] in [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]] after his first year with the Magic. That season, he led the team that was picked to finish last in the league to a near playoff berth.\n\nDuring the Magic's free agency spending spree in the summer of 2000, Doc Rivers had the opportunity to assemble the first \"Big Three\" team in the NBA, as the Magic were courting free agent [[Tim Duncan]], who came close to signing with the Magic and teaming up with [[Grant Hill]] and [[Tracy McGrady]]. However, Tim Duncan re-signed with the San Antonio Spurs due to Rivers' strict policy of family members not being allowed to travel in the team's plane.<ref>https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2018/2/15/17018756/grant-hill-confirms-the-tim-duncan-doc-rivers-airplane-policy-story</ref>\n\nHe made the post-season in his next three years as coach, but was fired in 2003 after a 1\u201310 start to the season.\n\n===Boston Celtics (2004\u20132013)===\nAfter spending a year working as a commentator for the ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' (calling the [[2004 NBA Finals|2004 Finals]] with [[Al Michaels]]), he was hired by the [[Boston Celtics]] as their head coach in 2004. During his first years with the Celtics, he was criticized by many in the media for his coaching style, most vociferously by [[Bill Simmons]], who in 2006 publicly called for Rivers to be fired in his columns.\n\nAs a result of the Celtics' 109\u201393 victory over the [[New York Knicks]] on January 21, 2008, Rivers, as the coach of the team with the best winning percentage in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], earned the honor to coach the East for the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game]] in [[New Orleans Hornets|New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/rivers_as_080121.html|title=Doc Rivers to Coach East in 2008 All-Star Game|work=NBA.com|date=January 21, 2008|access-date=March 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305044857/http://www.nba.com/news/rivers_as_080121.html|archive-date=March 5, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> On June 17, 2008, Rivers won his first [[NBA Finals|NBA Championship]] as a head coach after defeating the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in six games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/06/18/ring_it_up/?page=full|title=Ring it up!|date=June 18, 2008|first=Marc J.|last=Spears|newspaper=Boston Globe}}</ref> The Celtics needed an NBA record 26 post-season games to win it.

The [[2014 NBA playoffs]] first round playoff series against the [[Golden State Warriors]] was marred when TMZ released an audiotape containing racially insensitive remarks made by the then-Clippers owner [[Donald Sterling]]. Though there was a possibility of the Clippers boycotting the series, they would play on, holding a silent protest by leaving their shooting jerseys at center court and obscuring the Clippers logo on their warm-up shirts. Rivers himself stated that he would not return to the Clippers if Sterling remained as owner the following season. NBA commissioner [[Adam Silver]] responded to the controversy by banning Sterling for life and compelling him to sell the team. After the team was sold to [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] for $2 billion on August 12, 2014, Rivers remained with the Clippers.<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/4/29/5664400/doc-rivers-coach-return-donald-sterling-racism-controversy \"Doc Rivers won't return to Clippers under Donald Sterling, per report\"].

Various forms of isolation exist, in some of which contact procedures are modified, and others in which the patient is kept away from all others. In a system devised, and periodically revised, by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), various levels of patient isolation comprise application of one or more formally described \"precaution\".\n\nIsolation is most commonly used when a patient is known to have a contagious ([[Transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] from person-to-person) [[viral illness|viral]] or [[Bacteria|bacterial illness]].<ref name=\"LawrenceMay2003a\">{{cite book|author1=Lawrence J|author2=May D|title=Infection control in the community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKK2QI8AhTgC&pg=PA136|year=2003|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-443-06406-7|page=136}}</ref> Special equipment is used in the management of patients in the various forms of isolation.

[[Quarantine]] is the compulsory separation and confinement, with restriction of movement, of healthy individuals or groups who have potentially been exposed to an agent to prevent further infections should infection occur. [[Biocontainment]] refers to laboratory biosafety in microbiology laboratories in which the physical containment (BSL-3, BSL-4) of highly pathogenic organisms is accomplished through built-in engineering controls.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html |title=Quarantine and Isolation {{!}} Quarantine {{!}} | work = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2018-10-03 |access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Importance ==\n[[Infection|Contagious diseases]] can spread to others through various forms. Four types of infectious disease [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] can occur: (1) contact transmission, which can be through direct physical contact, indirect contact through fomites, or droplet contact in which airborne infections spread short distances, (2) vehicular transmission, which involves contaminated objects, (3) [[airborne transmission]], which involves spread of infectious particles through air, and (4) vector transmission, which is spread through insects or animals.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Walker HK, Hall WD, Hurst JW, McCue JD |title=The Contagious Patient |date=1990 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK337/ |work=Clinical Methods: The History, Physical, and Laboratory Examinations |veditors=Walker HK, Dallas W, Willis J |edition=3rd |publisher=Butterworths |isbn=978-0-409-90077-4 |pmid=21250179}}</ref> Depending on the [[contagious disease]], transmission can occur within a person's home, school, worksite, health care facility, and other shared spaces within the community. Even if a person takes all necessary precautions to protect oneself from disease, such as being up-to-date with [[Vaccine|vaccines]] and practicing good [[hygiene]], he or she can still get sick. Some people may not be able to protect themselves from diseases and may develop serious complications if they contract the disease.

Health care workers may be regularly exposed to various types of illnesses and are at risk of getting sick. Disease spread can occur between a patient and a health care worker, even if the health care workers take all necessary precautions to minimize transmission, including proper hygiene and being up-to-date with vaccines. If a health care worker gets sick with a communicable disease, the possible spread may occur to other health care workers or susceptible patients within the health care facility. This can include patients with a weakened immune system and may be at risk for serious complications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/about/ipc/en/ |title=WHO {{!}} Infection prevention and control|website=WHO|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nHealth care workers who become infected with certain contagious agents may not be permitted to work with patients for a period of time. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has implemented several standards and directives applicable to protecting health care workers from the spread of infectious agents. These include bloodborne pathogens, personal protective equipment, and respiratory protections. The CDC has also released resource for health care facilities to assist in assessing and reducing risk for occupational exposure to infectious diseases. The purpose of these standards and guidelines is to prevent the spread of disease to others in a health care facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthcarefacilities/infectious_diseases.html |title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Healthcare - Infectious Diseases {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Consequences ==\nDisease isolation is rarely disputed for its importance in protecting others from disease.

Health care workers may be regularly exposed to various types of illnesses and are at risk of getting sick. Disease spread can occur between a patient and a health care worker, even if the health care workers take all necessary precautions to minimize transmission, including proper hygiene and being up-to-date with vaccines. If a health care worker gets sick with a communicable disease, the possible spread may occur to other health care workers or susceptible patients within the health care facility. This can include patients with a weakened immune system and may be at risk for serious complications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/about/ipc/en/ |title=WHO {{!}} Infection prevention and control|website=WHO|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nHealth care workers who become infected with certain contagious agents may not be permitted to work with patients for a period of time. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has implemented several standards and directives applicable to protecting health care workers from the spread of infectious agents. These include bloodborne pathogens, personal protective equipment, and respiratory protections. The CDC has also released resource for health care facilities to assist in assessing and reducing risk for occupational exposure to infectious diseases. The purpose of these standards and guidelines is to prevent the spread of disease to others in a health care facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthcarefacilities/infectious_diseases.html |title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Healthcare - Infectious Diseases {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Consequences ==\nDisease isolation is rarely disputed for its importance in protecting others from disease. However, it is important to consider the consequences disease isolation may have on an individual. For instance, patients may not be able to receive visitors, and in turn, become [[Loneliness|lonely]]. Patients may experience depression, anxiety, and anger.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Furuno JP, Krein S, Lansing B, Mody L |title=Health care worker opinions on use of isolation precautions in long-term care facilities |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=263\u20136 |date=April 2012 |pmid=21784557 |pmc=3526888 |doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2011.03.019}}</ref> Small children may feel their isolation is a punishment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gostin LO |title=Law, ethics, and public health in the vaccination debates: politics of the measles outbreak |journal=JAMA |volume=313 |issue=11 |pages=1099\u2013100 |date=March 2015 |pmid=25675396 |doi=10.1001/jama.2015.1518}}</ref> Staff may need to spend more time with patients. Patients may not be able to receive certain types of care due to the risk that other patients may become contaminated. This includes forms of care that involve use of equipment common to all patients at the facility, or that involve transporting the patient to an area of the facility common to all patients. Given the impact of isolation on patients, social and emotional support may be needed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gammon J, Hunt J |title=Source isolation and patient wellbeing in healthcare settings |journal=British Journal of Nursing |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=88\u201391 |date=January 2018 |pmid=29368561 |doi=10.12968/bjon.2018.27.2.88}}</ref>\n\nAlthough a majority of health care professionals advocate for disease isolation as an effective means of reducing disease transmission, some health care professionals are concerned with implementing such control protocols given the possible negative consequences on patients. Patients isolated with [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus]] (MRSA) can also be negatively impacted by having less documented care/bedside visits from attending and residents.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Masse V, Valiquette L, Boukhoudmi S, Bonenfant F, Talab Y, Carvalho JC, Alarie I, Carrier N, Farand P |title=Impact of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus contact isolation units on medical care |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=e57057 |date=2013 |pmid=23451144 |pmc=3581535 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0057057 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...857057M}}</ref>\n\n== Ethics ==\n[[File:New isolation ward.jpg|thumb|The new Ebola isolation ward in Lagos, Nigeria provides more space and better treatment.]]\nDisease isolation serves as an important method to protect the general community from disease, especially in a hospital or community-wide outbreak. However, this intervention poses an ethical question on rights of the individual versus rights of the general community.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Aita |first=Mark |last2=Ragland |first2=Takeem |name-list-format=vanc |date=2015-01-01 |title=Ebola Scare and Measles Resurgence: Mandatory Isolation/quarantine and Vaccination |journal=Online Journal of Health Ethics |volume=11 |issue=2 |doi=10.18785/ojhe.1102.02 |issn=1551-4218|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nInfectious diseases, including isolation precaution measures, are generally not considered a primary topic of importance in the field of bioethics in comparison to other topics such as [[euthanasia]], [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproduction]], and [[Genetic engineering|genetics]]. Possible reasons as to why infectious diseases are not viewed as a primary topic in medical ethics include the following: bias for topics that are more high-tech, wealthy-world topics such as euthanasia and assisted reproduction, blinding optimism that infectious diseases are no longer a threat because of the success of antibiotics and vaccines, and the labeling of \"other\" among certain infectious diseases such as [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]], etc.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Selgelid MJ |title=Ethics and infectious disease |journal=Bioethics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=272\u201389 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16167406 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00441.x}}</ref>\n\nIn cases of disease outbreaks, isolation can be argued as an ethical and necessary precaution for protecting the community from further disease transmission. This can be seen during the 2014 Disneyland measles outbreak and 2014 Ebola outbreak. This can be justified using [[felicific calculus]] to predict the outcomes (consequences) of moral action between the individual rights versus the rights of the general public during disease isolation. This justifies that disease isolation is most likely to result in the greatest amount of positive outcomes for the largest number of people.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aita MD, Mark C, Ragland MA, Takeem T |title=Ebola Scare and Measles Resurgence: Mandatory Isolation/quarantine and Vaccination. |journal=Online Journal of Health Ethics |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=2 |doi=10.18785/ojhe.1102.02|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nDisease isolation can also be justified as a morally legitimate ethical practice in public health based on the reciprocal relationship between the individual and the state. The individual is obligated to protect others by preventing further spread of disease, respect the instructions from public health authorities and sequester themselves in their homes and not attend public gatherings, and act as a first responder (if a healthcare professional) by providing services to protect and restore public health. The state, on the other hand, is obligated to provide support to individuals burdened as a result of restrictive measures (e.g. compensation for missed work, providing access to food and other necessities for those quarantined and isolated, assistance for first responders to balance personal/professional obligations), ensure several legal protections are in place for those subjected to restrictive measures and communicate all relevant information regarding the necessity of restriction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Viens AM, Bensimon CM, Upshur RE |date=2009-06-01 |title=Your Liberty or Your Life: Reciprocity in the Use of Restrictive Measures in Contexts of Contagion |journal=Journal of Bioethical Inquiry |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=207\u2013217 |doi=10.1007/s11673-009-9149-2}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*{{annotated link|Seclusion}}\n*{{annotated link|Physical distancing}}\n*{{annotated link|Barrier nursing}}\n*{{annotated link|Body substance isolation}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=LILWN0VQuGQC&pg=RA1-PA250&lpg=RA1-PA249&dq=isolation+nursing&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Chart showing recommendations for various forms of isolation]\n\n{{Health care}}\n\n[[Category:Infectious diseases]]\n[[Category:Prevention]]\n[[Category:Nursing]]\n[[Category:Medical hygiene]]\n", "name_user": "Yadsalohcin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Re-ordered to bring out distinction between quarantine and isolation in the lead section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(health_care)"}

The trains were designated as [[British Rail Class 482|Class 482]] until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to [[London Underground]].<ref name=TFL/> The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP.\n\n[[Transport for London]] and [[Metronet]] closed the Waterloo & City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock. The line's limited access meant that this was the first time that the units had been brought above ground since their introduction 12 years earlier. The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the [[Network SouthEast]] colours used since the stock's introduction.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.\n\nIn ''Automatic'' mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press both \"Start\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded.\n\nIn ''Coded Manual'' mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The [[speedometer]] on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until 2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|title=1992 tube stock: Sonia|accessdate=2014-07-13|work=SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014044448/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|archive-date=14 October 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe original format of the announcements were as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank. Change for Northern, District and Circle lines, Docklands Light Railway and Network SouthEast services. \u2026 This train terminates at Hainault via Newbury Park.\" (The [[Waterloo & City line]] was part of [[Network SouthEast]] at the time of the stock's introduction and the original recordings were never revised to reflect the takeover of the line by [[London Underground]] in 1994.){{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n*''Approaching {{LUL stations|station=Notting Hill Gate}}:''\n*:\"The next station is Notting Hill Gate. Change for District and Circle lines.\"\n\nSince 2003, voice artist [[Emma Clarke]] has provided recordings for the 1992 Stock DVA. Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.

Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.

The collision resulted in one door being ripped off and a number of broken windows. 32 passengers received minor injuries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Final report |url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |publisher=RAIB |accessdate=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209124951/https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |archive-date=9 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe cause of the derailment was determined to be the detachment of the rearmost [[traction motor]] on the fifth car, caused by a gearbox failure. The traction motor was then struck by the remainder of the train as it passed over it, causing the following [[bogies]] to derail.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703040611/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |archive-date=3 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nThe entire 1992 Stock fleet was withdrawn from service the same afternoon, and the Central and Waterloo & City lines were closed for several weeks until modifications were made. This included fitting new traction-motor bolts and secondary brackets in to prevent a loose motor from striking the track and causing further damage. The lines re-opened in stages from 14 March 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703040611/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |archive-date=3 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Refurbishment ==\n=== Central line units ===\nThe 1992 Stock has had a refresh of both the interior and exterior. Some of the noticeable changes include a new seat moquette, improved lighting and improvements to the window frames. The front of the driving cabs are also being renewed. This includes repairing water ingress and replacing a large number of parts with a much simpler design, saving costs on future work. The new-style front end can be easily identified by the red panelling instead of the original grey. The refresh comes after nearly twenty years of continuous service on the Central line.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} \n\n=== Waterloo & City line units ===\n[[File:65507 at Bank LUL station.jpg|thumb|A Waterloo & City line 1992 Stock in its original Network SouthEast livery.

During this period, the 1992 Stock units in use on the line were removed by crane from [[Waterloo Underground Depot|Waterloo depot]] and taken by road to [[Wabtec Rail]] in [[Doncaster]] for refurbishment. External changes included repainting the trains, which were still in Network SouthEast livery, into London Underground's corporate livery.

The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the [[Network SouthEast]] colours used since the stock's introduction.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.\n\nIn ''Automatic'' mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press both \"Start\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded.\n\nIn ''Coded Manual'' mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The [[speedometer]] on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until mid-2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|title=1992 tube stock: Sonia|accessdate=2014-07-13|work=SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014044448/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|archive-date=14 October 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe original format of the announcements were as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

Some of the noticeable changes include a new seat moquette, improved lighting and improvements to the window frames. The front of the driving cabs are also being renewed. This includes repairing water ingress and replacing a large number of parts with a much simpler design, saving costs on future work. The new-style front end can be easily identified by the red panelling instead of the original grey.

During this period, the 1992 Stock units in use on the line were removed by crane from [[Waterloo Underground Depot|Waterloo depot]] and taken by road to [[Wabtec Rail]] in [[Doncaster]] for refurbishment. External changes included repainting the trains, which were still in Network SouthEast livery, into London Underground's corporate livery.

This is the first Cypriot bank; all the other banks in Cyprus are foreign-owned.\n*1912 The \"Nicosia Savings Bank\" became a public company and changed its name to Bank of Cyprus (BoC), three years after its shareholders had applied to the High Commissioner in 1909.\n*1930 The BoC incorporated as a limited company.\n*1943 The BoC amalgamated with [[Famagusta]] Bank and [[Larnaca]] Bank (est. 1926).\n*1944 The BoC acquired the Melissa Bank, [[Paphos]], (est. 1924). The Mortgage Bank of Cyprus was established.\n*1945 BoC merged with the Cyprus Savings Bank (Kypriakon Tomieftiron), which had been established in Nicosia in 1908.\n*1953 BoC merged with Paphos Popular Bank (Paphos Laiki Bank) (est. 1924).\n*1955 BoC opened its first branch abroad when it opened in London to serve the Cypriot community there.\n*1960 BoC established a subsidiary, Bank of Cyprus (London) Ltd.: Xeros, Morphou and Zodhia (Nicosia District), Golden Sands, Kato Varosha, Kennedy Avenue, Democratias Avenue, Evagoras Avenue and Oceania (Famagusta Town), Yialousa, Rizokarpaso and Lysi (Famagusta District), and Kyrenia, Karavas and Lapithos branches (Kyrenia District).\n*1982 BoC acquired [[Standard Chartered Bank]]'s Cypriot operations. (The then Chartered Bank had bought the [[Ionian Bank]]'s Cypriot operations in 1957.) BoC also opened a representative office in Greece.\n*1986 BoC opened a representative office in Australia.\n*1991 BoC established its first branch in Greece. Kolonaki branch was located at the corner of Vasilissis Sophias Avenue and Sekeri Street, and also boasted a Business Banking Centre and the bank's treasury. In the summer of 2009, this and Mitropoleos Street branches were merged to form the new Syntagma Square branch, which retains branch code 001.\n*1995 BoC opened a representative office in South Africa, and a branch in [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]].\n*1996 BoC established Bank of Cyprus (Channel Islands) in [[Guernsey]], and a representative office in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, located in the heart of Greektown in Toronto to serve mainly the Greek-Cypriot community.\n* A subsidiary company, Cyprus Leasing S.A., was established in Greece to deal with leasing activities. It is now the second largest of its kind in Greece. In Cyprus, leasing activities are carried out by a dedicated department of the BoC itself rather than a focused subsidiary.\n*1998 BoC established representative offices in New York and Moscow, and then another in [[Bucharest]], Romania.\n*2000 BoC established a subsidiary in Australia, the country with the world's largest Greek and Cypriot community. The community, which numbers around 600,000 people, is concentrated in [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. BOC had long had a presence in the Australian market through its representative offices in Sydney, Melbourne, [[Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane]]. BoC also opened a representative office in [[Bucharest]].\n:BoC bid for Interbank in New York for about $43 million. Interbank was 78% owned by Greek businessman [[Dimitris Kontominas]], and the remaining equity was dispersed among three other shareholders.

The combined business is known as \"Bank of Cyprus UK\".\n*2005 BoC opened its Pallini branch in eastern Athens, thereby reaching 100 branches in Greece.\n*2007 On 8 October, BoC announced that it had opened a branch in Moscow, making it the first Cypriot bank to have banking operations in Russia. In the same year, the opening of two new branches in Athens (Haidari and Spata) meant that the branches in Greece outnumbered those in Cyprus.\n*2008 BoC purchased 80% of Uniastrum, the 9th largest bank in Russia, for US$576 million.

The bank traded under the Bank of Cyprus name.\n*2010 The Bank of Cyprus decided to establish a banking unit in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), in the Emirate of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. It also established a representative office in India. In Cyprus, Ayios Lazaros branch in Larnaca closed, due to the forthcoming demolition of the building housing it.

The former Bank of Cyprus Australia is now known as Delphi Bank.\n*2012 Bank of Cyprus UK became a subsidiary, regulated by the [[Financial Services Authority]]. Under pressure from the [[Central Bank of Cyprus]], CEO Andreas Eliades and Deputy CEO Yiannis Pehlivanides resigned as Bank of Cyprus could not reach by private means the 9% Core Tier 1 capital by 30 June 2012 that the [[European Banking Authority]] had required. Eliades's replacement was Yiannis Kypri. Later Chairman Theodoros Aristodemou resigned and was replaced by Andreas Artemi. The bank was also forced to re-consider its strategy of rapid international expansion.\n*2012\u20132013 Due to the harsh economic downturn in both Cyprus and Greece, the Bank of Cyprus began downsizing its network in Greece by closing branches, with the greater Athens area most affected (closures as at March 2013 were the branches at Omonia Square, Phidippides Street, America Square, Gyzi, Tavros, Petralona, Kessariani, Nea Ionia, Yerakas, Spata, Peania, Drapetsona, Ayios Ierotheos and Keratea). Three branches were closed in Salonica (Nikis Street, Stavros and Ionia), one in Patra (Acrotiriou Street, leaving the Corinth Street and Ayea branches in operation), one in Heraclion, Crete (62 Martyrs Avenue), Asklipiou Street in Trikala, which was merged with the town's other branch at 28 October Street, the Corfu Harbour branch was merged with the Corfu Town branch, Ialyssos branch on the island of Rhodes was absorbed by the Rhodes Town branch, while the towns of Alexandria in northern Greece and Loutraki became devoid of Bank of Cyprus branches altogether. In most cases, the ATMs of the branches were either retained on site or transferred to nearby premises to allow former customers some form of access to their accounts. In addition to downsizing the network, the bank reduced its staff by 300 by way of voluntary redundancy, but aimed to further reduce its number of branches first to 110 from 166, and then closing all of its smaller branches with up to five staff, maintaining only a small number of branches in key locations.\n*On 26 March 2013 the Greek branches of the bank, along with those of [[CPB Bank]] (the Greek arm of the now defunct [[Laiki Bank]]) and [[Hellenic Bank]], were sold to [[Piraeus Bank]]. Unlike other banks in the Piraeus Bank Group (e.g. [[Geniki Bank]]), which retained for a while its corporate identity, the \"Bank of Cyprus\" brand was replaced in the ex-Bank of Cyprus branches by the Piraeus Bank corporate identity.\n*On 29 March 2013 the loan business (advances) of Cyprus Popular Bank Public Co Ltd (Laiki UK), pursuant to a legal decree put in place by the Cypriot authorities, was transferred to Bank of Cyprus Public Co Ltd (Bank of Cyprus.) Also the Romanian operations apart from Head Office and some loans were taken over by Marfin Romania.\n* 2013 The good (Cypriot) parts of [[Cyprus Popular Bank]] were merged into the new Bank of Cyprus. On 27 March 2013 the board and CEO were replaced. A Special Administrator was put in place (Dinos Christophides) for 4 months to oversee the merger with the good parts of [[Cyprus Popular Bank]]. A new interim board (with Dr Sophocles Michaeilides as Chairman) and interim CEO (Christos Sorotos) were put in place for 3 months, to replace the Special Administrator to lead the back to a new Annual General Meeting on 10 September 2013 and to oversee the \"bail in\" of depositors and to restructure and downsize the new bank.

This is the first Cypriot bank; all the other banks in Cyprus are foreign-owned.\n*1912 The \"Nicosia Savings Bank\" became a public company and changed its name to Bank of Cyprus (BoC), three years after its shareholders had applied to the High Commissioner in 1909.\n*1930 The BoC incorporated as a limited company.\n*1943 The BoC amalgamated with [[Famagusta]] Bank and [[Larnaca]] Bank (est. 1926).\n*1944 The BoC acquired the Melissa Bank, [[Paphos]], (est. 1924). The Mortgage Bank of Cyprus was established.\n*1945 BoC merged with the Cyprus Savings Bank (Kypriakon Tomieftiron), which had been established in Nicosia in 1908.\n*1953 BoC merged with Paphos Popular Bank (Paphos Laiki Bank) (est. 1924).\n*1955 BoC opened its first branch abroad when it opened in London to serve the Cypriot community there.\n*1960 BoC established a subsidiary, Bank of Cyprus (London) Ltd.: Xeros, Morphou and Zodhia (Nicosia District), Golden Sands, Kato Varosha, Kennedy Avenue, Democratias Avenue, Evagoras Avenue and Oceania (Famagusta Town), Yialousa, Rizokarpaso and Lysi (Famagusta District), and Kyrenia, Karavas and Lapithos branches (Kyrenia District).\n*1982 BoC acquired [[Standard Chartered Bank]]'s Cypriot operations. (The then Chartered Bank had bought the [[Ionian Bank]]'s Cypriot operations in 1957.) BoC also opened a representative office in Greece.\n*1986 BoC opened a representative office in Australia.\n*1991 BoC established its first branch in Greece. Kolonaki branch was located at the corner of Vasilissis Sophias Avenue and Sekeri Street, and also boasted a Business Banking Centre and the bank's treasury. In the summer of 2009, this and Mitropoleos Street branches were merged to form the new Syntagma Square branch, which retains branch code 001.\n*1995 BoC opened a representative office in South Africa, and a branch in [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]].\n*1996 BoC established Bank of Cyprus (Channel Islands) in [[Guernsey]], and a representative office in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, located in the heart of Greektown in Toronto to serve mainly the Greek-Cypriot community.\n* A subsidiary company, Cyprus Leasing S.A., was established in Greece to deal with leasing activities. It is now the second largest of its kind in Greece. In Cyprus, leasing activities are carried out by a dedicated department of the BoC itself rather than a focused subsidiary.\n*1998 BoC established representative offices in New York and Moscow, and then another in [[Bucharest]], Romania.\n*2000 BoC established a subsidiary in Australia, the country with the world's largest Greek and Cypriot community. The community, which numbers around 600,000 people, is concentrated in [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. BOC had long had a presence in the Australian market through its representative offices in Sydney, Melbourne, [[Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane]]. BoC also opened a representative office in [[Bucharest]].\n:BoC bid for Interbank in New York for about $43 million. Interbank was 78% owned by Greek businessman [[Dimitris Kontominas]], and the remaining equity was dispersed among three other shareholders. With four branches in New York, including the [[Astoria, Queens]] area where there is a strong Greek presence, the bank catered to the Greek American community. The U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] withheld its approval and bid expired.\n\n*2004 BoC merged its UK branch with its subsidiary Bank of Cyprus (London) Ltd. The combined business is known as \"Bank of Cyprus UK\".\n*2005 BoC opened its Pallini branch in eastern Athens, thereby reaching 100 branches in Greece.\n*2007 On 8 October, BoC announced that it had opened a branch in Moscow, making it the first Cypriot bank to have banking operations in Russia. In the same year, the opening of two new branches in Athens (Haidari and Spata) meant that the branches in Greece outnumbered those in Cyprus.\n*2008 BoC purchased 80% of Uniastrum, the 9th largest bank in Russia, for US$576 million.

The bank traded under the Bank of Cyprus name.\n*2010 The Bank of Cyprus decided to establish a banking unit in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), in the Emirate of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. It also established a representative office in India. In Cyprus, Ayios Lazaros branch in Larnaca closed, due to the forthcoming demolition of the building housing it.

Eliades's replacement was Yiannis Kypri. Later Chairman Theodoros Aristodemou resigned and was replaced by Andreas Artemi. The bank was also forced to re-consider its strategy of rapid international expansion.\n*2012\u20132013 Due to the harsh economic downturn in both Cyprus and Greece, the Bank of Cyprus began downsizing its network in Greece by closing branches, with the greater Athens area most affected (closures as at March 2013 were the branches at Omonia Square, Phidippides Street, America Square, Gyzi, Tavros, Petralona, Kessariani, Nea Ionia, Yerakas, Spata, Peania, Drapetsona, Ayios Ierotheos and Keratea). Three branches were closed in Salonica (Nikis Street, Stavros and Ionia), one in Patra (Acrotiriou Street, leaving the Corinth Street and Ayea branches in operation), one in Heraclion, Crete (62 Martyrs Avenue), Asklipiou Street in Trikala, which was merged with the town's other branch at 28 October Street, the Corfu Harbour branch was merged with the Corfu Town branch, Ialyssos branch on the island of Rhodes was absorbed by the Rhodes Town branch, while the towns of Alexandria in northern Greece and Loutraki became devoid of Bank of Cyprus branches altogether. In most cases, the ATMs of the branches were either retained on site or transferred to nearby premises to allow former customers some form of access to their accounts. In addition to downsizing the network, the bank reduced its staff by 300 by way of voluntary redundancy, but aimed to further reduce its number of branches first to 110 from 166, and then closing all of its smaller branches with up to five staff, maintaining only a small number of branches in key locations.\n*On 26 March 2013 the Greek branches of the bank, along with those of [[CPB Bank]] (the Greek arm of the now defunct [[Laiki Bank]]) and [[Hellenic Bank]], were sold to [[Piraeus Bank]]. Unlike other banks in the Piraeus Bank Group (e.g. [[Geniki Bank]]), which retained for a while its corporate identity, the \"Bank of Cyprus\" brand was replaced in the ex-Bank of Cyprus branches by the Piraeus Bank corporate identity.\n*On 29 March 2013 the loan business (advances) of Cyprus Popular Bank Public Co Ltd (Laiki UK), pursuant to a legal decree put in place by the Cypriot authorities, was transferred to Bank of Cyprus Public Co Ltd (Bank of Cyprus.) Also the Romanian operations apart from Head Office and some loans were taken over by Marfin Romania.\n* 2013 The good (Cypriot) parts of [[Cyprus Popular Bank]] were merged into the new Bank of Cyprus. On 27 March 2013 the board and CEO were replaced. A Special Administrator was put in place (Dinos Christophides) for 4 months to oversee the merger with the good parts of [[Cyprus Popular Bank]]. A new interim board (with Dr Sophocles Michaeilides as Chairman) and interim CEO (Christos Sorotos) were put in place for 3 months, to replace the Special Administrator to lead the back to a new Annual General Meeting on 10 September 2013 and to oversee the \"bail in\" of depositors and to restructure and downsize the new bank.
