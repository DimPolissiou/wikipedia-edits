In 1616, an epidemic, probably [[smallpox]], swept the region, killing thousands in its wake. Nanepashemet retired to the Mystic River, in what is now [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], but was found murdered in 1619 at his fort on the brow of Rock Hill overlooking the river.  Three sons succeeded him in his reign. One of them, [[Wonohaquaham]], also called Sagamore John, had jurisdiction over the Native Americans at Winnisemmit (later [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]]) and Rumney Marsh. {{citation needed}}\n\nThe Native Americans, with their intimate knowledge of the area, often helped the settlers in their struggle to survive. {{citation needed}} During [[King Philip's War]] (also known as [[Metacomet]]'s War), the local Native Americans were forcibly removed to what is now [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], where half of those imprisoned died of starvation or exposure.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |title=Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered |website=IndianCountryToday.com |access-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105201204/https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some were enlisted to help the colonists defeat other native tribes.\n\n=== English settlement ===\nRumney Marsh was originally divided and allotted to twenty-one of Boston's most prominent citizens.

Farming was the principal industry of Winnisemmet, and Rumney Marsh in particular.\n\nIn 1624, [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] became the first colonist to settle in the area.

It has a fairly active beach front district.  From its inception, Revere Beach was \"the people's beach\", used mostly by the working class and the many immigrants who settled in the area. The Revere Beach Reservation Historic District was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998, including the full Revere Beach Reservation in 2003.\n\nThe Beach began to deteriorate in the 1950s and by the early 1970s it had become a strip of [[honky-tonk]] bars and abandoned buildings. The [[Northeastern United States Blizzard of 1978|Great Blizzard of 1978]] proved to be the final death knell for the \"old\" Revere Beach, as many of the remaining businesses, amusements, pavilions, sidewalks, and much of the [[seawall]] were destroyed.\n\nThe area once boasted an extensive array of amusement rides and attractions. The Whip, the [[Ferris wheel]], Bluebeard's Palace, the Fun House, Hurley's Dodgems, the Pit, Himalaya, Hippodrome, Sandy's, the Wild Mouse, the [[Virginia Reel roller coaster|Virginia Reel]] and many more provided hours of enjoyment for residents and visitors alike. The biggest attraction was the [[Cyclone (Revere Beach)|Cyclone]], among the largest roller coasters in the United States. Built in 1925, its cars traveled at speeds of up to {{convert|50|mph|km/h|sigfig=1}} and its height reached {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}}.<ref>[http://www.reverebeach.com/hist2.htm RevereBeach.com History page].

[[Lightning (Revere Beach)|Lightning]] was another roller coaster at Revere Beach, and was a member of [[Harry Traver]]'s infamous \"Terrifying Triplets\". In addition, there were two roller skating rinks, two bowling alleys, and numerous food stands. There were also ballrooms, including the most famous, the Oceanview and the Beachview, each the site of many dance marathons which were popular in the 1930s.\n\nThe Beach was the focus of a major revitalization effort by the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]] and the City in the 1980s and was officially reopened in May 1992. It now boasts high-rise housing units, a re-sanded beach, restored pavilions, and a renovated boulevard. Revere commemorated the centennial of the first opening of Revere Beach on the weekend of July 19, 1996.\n\n=== Rumney Marsh Reservation ===\nThe [[Rumney Marsh Reservation|Rumney Marsh]] is a [[List of Massachusetts state parks|Massachusetts state park]] occupying 600 acres within Revere and the [[Saugus, Massachusetts|town of Saugus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/locations/rumney-marsh-reservation|title=Rumney Marsh Reservation|website=Mass.gov|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Historic places ===\nRevere has [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Suffolk County, Massachusetts|eight places]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n<gallery>\nChurch of Christ Revere MA 03.jpg|[[Church of Christ (Revere, Massachusetts)|Church of Christ]]\nImmaculate Conception Rectory Revere MA 03.jpg|[[Immaculate Conception Rectory (Revere, Massachusetts)|Immaculate Conception Rectory]]\nMary T Ronan School Revere MA.jpg|[[Mary T.

The company maintained headquarters at 135 American Legion Highway in Revere, where it offered tours of the facilities.\n\n=== Wonderland Greyhound Park ===\n[[Wonderland Greyhound Park]] was a [[greyhound racing]] track located in the city owned by the Westwood Group. It was constructed on the site of the former [[Wonderland Amusement Park (Massachusetts)|Wonderland Amusement Park]].  Wonderland opened on June 12, 1935 and formerly offered 361 performances during its 100-day, April to September racing period.  [[Parimutuel]] wagering was legalized by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1934. The Park opened the following year and offered [[greyhound]] racing from June 1935 until September 2009.  It ran its last program on September 18, 2009, as a result of a statewide referendum that banned greyhound racing. The future of the land is uncertain.\n\n=== Revere Post Office ===\nFrom 1934 to 1943 murals were produced in the United States through the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]], later called the [[Section of Fine Arts]], of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].

By 1885, ten years later, the town had increased to 3,637 inhabitants, more than tripling in size over 15 years. By 1890, the population had grown to 5,668.\n\nIn 1871, Revere was the site of [[The Great Revere Train Wreck of 1871]], the deadliest railroad incident in Massachusetts history up to that point, when the Eastern Railroad's \"Portland Express\" slammed into the back of a stopped local commuter train at Revere Station.\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] terminates in Revere, with stops at [[Wonderland (MBTA station)|Wonderland]], [[Revere Beach (MBTA station)|Revere Beach]], and [[Beachmont (MBTA station)|Beachmont]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] and state highways\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 1A|1A]],\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 16|16]],\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 60|60]],\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 107|107]], and\n[[Massachusetts State Highway 145|145]] run through Revere.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Revere Public Schools]] operates the city's public schools.

The leader, or [[sachem]], of the Pawtuckets was [[Nanepashemet]] of Lynn. In 1616, an epidemic, probably [[smallpox]], swept the region, killing thousands in its wake. Nanepashemet retired to the Mystic River, in what is now [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], but was found murdered in 1619 at his fort on the brow of Rock Hill overlooking the river.  Three sons succeeded him in his reign. One of them, [[Wonohaquaham]], also called Sagamore John, had jurisdiction over the Native Americans at Winnisemmit (later [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]]) and Rumney Marsh.\n\nThe Native Americans, with their intimate knowledge of the area, often helped the settlers in their struggle to survive. During [[King Philip's War]] (also known as [[Metacomet]]'s War), the local Native Americans were forcibly removed to what is now [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], where half of those imprisoned died of starvation or exposure.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |title=Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered |website=IndianCountryToday.com |access-date=January 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105201204/https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered-AtuXxfhWUEOHpaaNcBJADw/ |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some were enlisted to help the colonists defeat other native tribes.\n\n=== English settlement ===\nRumney Marsh was originally divided and allotted to twenty-one of Boston's most prominent citizens.

Farming was the principal industry of Winnisemmet, and Rumney Marsh in particular.\n\nIn 1624, [[Samuel Maverick (colonist)|Samuel Maverick]] became the first colonist to settle in the area.

In addition to the desire to keep their colony Puritan, they were also concerned with the immigration of paupers. In subsequent years a law was passed that restricted the immigration of 'lame, impotent, or infirmed persons.' Hardly any immigrants came to Massachusetts during the second half of the 17th century.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish immigration came to a near-complete stop in 1642 as a result of the English Civil War, but was replaced with immigration from other European countries.\n\nIn 1687, only 31 people lived in the settlements of Winnisimmit, Rumney Marsh, and Pullen Point. In 1739, when these settlements were separated from Boston and formed the Town of Chelsea, there were 10 homes in Winnisimmit (Chelsea), 26 in Rumney Marsh (Revere), and 4 homes in Pullen Point (Winthrop), with 267 inhabitants in total.

The Revere Beach Reservation Historic District was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998, including the full Revere Beach Reservation in 2003.\n\nThe Beach began to deteriorate in the 1950s and by the early 1970s it had become a strip of [[honky-tonk]] bars and abandoned buildings. The [[Northeastern United States Blizzard of 1978|Great Blizzard of 1978]] proved to be the final death knell for the \"old\" Revere Beach, as many of the remaining businesses, amusements, pavilions, sidewalks, and much of the [[seawall]] were destroyed.\n\nThe area once boasted an extensive array of amusement rides and attractions. The Whip, the [[Ferris wheel]], Bluebeard's Palace, the Fun House, Hurley's Dodgems, the Pit, Himalaya, Hippodrome, Sandy's, the Wild Mouse, the [[Virginia Reel roller coaster|Virginia Reel]] and many more provided hours of enjoyment for residents and visitors alike. The biggest attraction was the [[Cyclone (Revere Beach)|Cyclone]], among the largest roller coasters in the United States.

[[Lightning (Revere Beach)|Lightning]] was another roller coaster at Revere Beach, and was a member of [[Harry Traver]]'s infamous \"Terrifying Triplets\". In addition, there were two roller skating rinks, two bowling alleys, and numerous food stands. There were also ballrooms, including the most famous, the Oceanview and the Beachview, each the site of many dance marathons which were popular in the 1930s.\n\nThe Beach was the focus of a major revitalization effort by the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]] and the City in the 1980s and was officially reopened in May 1992. It now boasts high-rise housing units, a re-sanded beach, restored pavilions, and a renovated boulevard.

It is said that the food, originally in the shape of two human-shaped pieces of dough but later evolved into two pieces joined in the middle, represents Qin Hui and his wife, both having a hand in collaborating with the enemy to bring about the great general's demise.<ref>[http://www.angsarap.net/2014/02/04/youtiao-chinese-crullers/ Youtiao (Chinese Crullers) - Ang Sarap]</ref> Thus the youtiao is deep fried and eaten as if done to the traitorous couple.

Cambodians usually dip it in rice congee (porridge) or coffee.\n\nIn [[Australia]] it is sometimes called '''chopstick cake''' by some [[Demographics of Cambodia|Cambodian]] Chinese immigrants because of its resemblance to a pair of [[chopsticks]].[[File:Cakwe dari Solo.jpg|thumb|In Indonesia, the fried dough is known as ''cakwe'' and is commonly chopped or thinly sliced and then eaten for breakfast.]]\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn Indonesia, the fried dough is known as ''cakwe'' ({{IPA-may|t\u0283akwe|pron}}). It is commonly chopped or thinly sliced and then eaten for breakfast with ''[[bubur ayam]]'' (chicken porridge) or eaten as snacks with dipping of local version of chilli vinaigrette or peanut / satay sauce. \n\nIn [[Semarang]], cakwe is usually sold as a street snack at [[Street food of Indonesia|kaki lima]], at the same stalls that sell ''[https://berita.kitamerahputih.id/2019/03/12/jajanan-semarang-hantu-yang-digoreng/ bolang-baling]'' and ''untir-untir'' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]] names for fried donuts or ''[https://whattocooktoday.com/ham-chim-peng.html ham chim peng]'' and ''[[Mahua (snack)|mahua]],'' respectively). With savoury cakwe and sweet bolang-baling being soft and fluffy and untir-untir being crispy, they make a good snack mix.\n\n===Laos===\nIn Laos, youtiao is generally called ''kao nom kou'' or ''patongko'' (''cf.'' Thai ''[[Youtiao#Thailand|patongko]]'') or \"chao quay\", and is commonly eaten with coffee at breakfast in place of a [[baguette]] (''khao jee falang'').<ref>[http://www.cpamedia.com/food/lao_food/ \"Laos: Food and Drink.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616025317/http://www.cpamedia.com/food/lao_food/ |date=June 16, 2008 }} at CPAMedia.

It is rendered in [[Malay language|Malay]] as ''cakoi'', an alteration of the Minnan term, \"char kuey\". The Malay version comes with various fillings, which are either sweet, such as red bean paste or savoury, such as sardines fried in tomato sauce. The plain version is usually eaten with coconut and egg jam ''[[Kaya (jam)|kaya]]''. Cakoi is usually sold in morning street markets or \"pasar malam\" night markets.\n\nIt is also normally served with [[Bak kut teh]] (\u8089\u9aa8\u8336), porridge or rice [[congee]], sliced thinly to be dipped into the broth/congee and eaten. It is also commonly eaten with coffee or soy milk for breakfast.[[File:Mini youtiao.JPG|thumb|The youtiao is a popular breakfast food in [[Myanmar]], where it is called ''e kya kway''.]]\n\n=== Myanmar ===\nThe youtiao is also a popular breakfast food in [[Myanmar]] (Burma)  where it is called ''e kya kway''. It is usually eaten with steamed yellow beans (with salt and oil). It is also usually dipped into coffee or tea. E kya kway is also eaten with rice porridge, or cut into small rings and used as a condiment for [[mohinga]].\nTea culture is very prevalent in Myanmar, and every shop will serve e kya kway for breakfast.\n\nSome shops stuff meat into the youtiao and deep fry it over again. It is called ''e kya kway asar thoot'' \u2013 stuffed e kya kway.\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 350\n| image1 = Bicho-Bicho.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Shakoy/Bicho from the [[Philippines]]\n| image2 = Bicho-bicho.jpg\n| caption2 = Bicho-Bicho from the [[Philippines]]\n}}\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the [[Philippines]], it is either known as ''Bicho'' / ''Bicho-Bicho'' or ''[[Shakoy]]'' / ''Siyakoy'' / ''Pinisi'' / ''lubid-lubid.'' They are usually deep-fried, in the case of Bicho-Bicho, or deep-fried and twisted as [[Twisted doughnut|twisted doughnuts]], in the case of Shakoy. Dry, smaller and crunchy versions are called ''[[pilipit]]''.\n\n===Thailand===\n\n[[File:Pathongko.jpg|thumb|Thai youtiao]]\n\nIn [[Thailand]], youtiao is generally called ''pathongko'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e17\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e42\u0e01\u0e4b}}, {{IPA-th|pa\u02d0t\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u014bk\u01d2\u02d0|pron}}) due to a confusion with a different kind of dessert. ''Pathongko'' is a loanword adapted from either [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] [[Southern Min|Minnan]] ''beh teung guai'' (\u767d\u7cd6\u7cbf; Mandarin: ''b\u00e1i t\u00e1nggu\u01d2'') or [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] of ''baahkt\u00f2ngg\u00f2u'' (\u767d\u7cd6\u7cd5; Mandarin: b\u00e1i t\u00e1ngg\u0101o). However, both possible original names are different desserts, not to be confused with the real [[White sugar sponge cake|white sugar sponge cake (\u767d\u7cd6\u7cd5)]]. It was previously sold together with youtiao by [[hawker (trade)|street vendors]] who normally walked around and shouted both names out loud. However, Thai customers often mistakenly thought that the more popular youtiao was ''\"pathongko\"''. Eventually, the real ''pathongko'' disappeared from the market because of its unpopularity. Ironically, the disappearance of real ''\"pathongko\"'' leaves youtiao being called under the former's name, but the latter's real name is generally unknown amongst the Thais.  But the original white sugar sponge cake can still be easily found in [[Trang Province]] in [[Southern Thailand]] under its original name.\n\nIn Thailand, pathongko is also dipped into condensed milk or, in the South, eaten with kaya.\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Qu\u1ea9y.jpg|thumb|right|''Qu\u1ea9y'']]\n\nIn [[Vietnamese cuisine]], it is known by a name that is a mix of [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] and native Vietnamese to achieve a pronunciation similar to the Cantonese name, as ''d\u1ea7u ch\u00e1o qu\u1ea9y'', ''gi\u00f2 ch\u00e1o qu\u1ea9y'' or simply ''qu\u1ea9y''. \u6cb9 (\"D\u1ea7u/gi\u00f2\") \u9b3c (\"qu\u1ef7/qu\u1ea9y\") coming from the approximate Chinese name.

In [[Yunnan]], a roasted riceflour pancake usually wrapped around a ''youtiao'' is known as ''[[shaoerkuai]]'' ({{zh|links=no|t=\u71d2\u990c\u584a|s=\u70e7\u9975\u5757}}). Yet another name for a sandwich variant is ''jianbinggu\u01d2zi'' ({{zh|links=no|t=\u714e\u9905\u679c\u5b50|s=\u714e\u997c\u679c\u5b50|l=youtiao and fried bread}}).\n\n''Youtiao'' is occasionally dipped into various liquids, for example the soup ''[[xidoufen]]'', soymilk (sweet or salty), and soy sauce.\n\nYoutiao is also an important ingredient of the food ''[[C\u00edf\u00e0n tu\u00e1n]]'' in [[Shanghai cuisine]].\n\n''T\u00e1ngg\u0101o'' ({{zh|links=no|t=\u7cd6\u7cd5}}), or \"sugar cake\", is a sweet, fried food item similar in appearance to youtiao but shorter in length.\n\nIn [[Cambodia]], it's called ''chhakhvay'' (\u1786\u17b6\u1781\u17d2\u179c\u17c3) and often eaten with rice congee (porridge) for breakfast.\n\nIn Thailand, ''youtiao'' or ''pathongko'' ({{lang|ta|\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e17\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e42\u0e01\u0e4b}}) in Thai are eaten for breakfast with [[soymilk]] or [[porridge]].\n\n==Names==\n\n===China===\nAlthough generally known as ''y\u00f3uti\u00e1o'' in Standard Mandarin throughout China, the dish is also known as ''gu\u01d2zi'' (\u991c\u5b50) in [[northern and southern China|northern China]]. In [[Min Nan]]-speaking areas, such as [[Taiwan]], it is known as  ''i\u00fb-chi\u0101-k\u00f3e'' ({{lang|nan-Hant|\u6cb9\u70b8\u7cbf}}),<ref name=\"Taiwanese\">\u8a31\u6975\u71c9. \u300a\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u53f0\u8a9e\u8a5e\u5178\u300b. \u53f0\u5317\u5e02: \u81ea\u7acb\u665a\u5831\u793e\u6587\u5316\u51fa\u7248\u90e8, 1992.

See [[Char koay teow#Etymology|Char koay teow: Etymology]] for more information.}}\n\n====Folk etymology====\nThe [[Cantonese]] name ''y\u00e0uhjagw\u00e1i'' literally means \"oil-fried devil\" and, according to folklore,<ref>[http://breadexpectations.yolasite.com/blog/yew-char-kway-the-easy-way Yew Char Kway the Easy Way by denise fletcher on July 7, 2011 ]</ref> is an act of protest against [[Song Dynasty (960-1279)|Song Dynasty]] official [[Qin Hui (Song Dynasty)|Qin Hui]], who is said to have orchestrated the plot to frame the general [[Yue Fei]], an icon of [[patriotism]] in [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]]. It is said that the food, originally in the shape of two human-shaped pieces of dough but later evolved into two pieces joined in the middle, represents Qin Hui and his wife, both having a hand in collaborating with the enemy to bring about the great general's demise.<ref>[http://www.angsarap.net/2014/02/04/youtiao-chinese-crullers/ Youtiao (Chinese Crullers) - Ang Sarap]</ref> Thus the youtiao is deep fried and eaten as if done to the traitorous couple. In keeping with the legend, youtiao are often made as two foot-long rolls of dough joined along the middle, with one roll representing the husband and the other the wife.<ref>West Lake, a Collection of Folktales ({{ISBN|9620400542}}) page 181.</ref> The Cantonese name may derive from [[Guangzhou]] being the last resistance front before the Song dynasty collapsed. \n\n===Cambodia===\nIn [[Cambodia]], it is called Cha Kway. Cambodians usually dip it in rice congee (porridge) or coffee.\n\nIn [[Australia]] it is sometimes called '''chopstick cake''' by some [[Demographics of Cambodia|Cambodian]] Chinese immigrants because of its resemblance to a pair of [[chopsticks]].[[File:Cakwe dari Solo.jpg|thumb|In Indonesia, the fried dough is known as ''cakwe'' and is commonly chopped or thinly sliced and then eaten for breakfast.]]\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn Indonesia, the fried dough is known as ''cakwe'' ({{IPA-may|t\u0283akwe|pron}}). It is commonly chopped or thinly sliced and then eaten for breakfast with ''[[bubur ayam]]'' (chicken porridge) or eaten as snacks with dipping of local version of chilli vinaigrette or peanut / satay sauce. \n\nIn [[Semarang]], cakwe is usually sold as a street snack at [[Street food of Indonesia|kaki lima]], at the same stalls that sell ''[https://berita.kitamerahputih.id/2019/03/12/jajanan-semarang-hantu-yang-digoreng/ bolang-baling]'' and ''untir-untir'' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]] names for fried donuts or ''[https://whattocooktoday.com/ham-chim-peng.html ham chim peng]'' and ''[[Mahua (snack)|mahua]],'' respectively). With savoury cakwe and sweet bolang-baling being soft and fluffy and untir-untir being crispy, they make a good snack mix.\n\n===Laos===\nIn Laos, youtiao is generally called ''kao nom kou'' or ''patongko'' (''cf.'' Thai ''[[Youtiao#Thailand|patongko]]'') or \"chao quay\", and is commonly eaten with coffee at breakfast in place of a [[baguette]] (''khao jee falang'').<ref>[http://www.cpamedia.com/food/lao_food/ \"Laos: Food and Drink.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616025317/http://www.cpamedia.com/food/lao_food/ |date=June 16, 2008 }} at CPAMedia.

It is rendered in [[Malay language|Malay]] as ''cakoi'', an alteration of the Minnan term, \"char kuey\". The Malay version comes with various fillings, which are either sweet, such as red bean paste or savoury, such as sardines fried in tomato sauce. The plain version is usually eaten with coconut and egg jam ''[[Kaya (jam)|kaya]]''. Cakoi is usually sold in morning street markets or \"pasar malam\" night markets.\n\nIt is also normally served with [[Bak kut teh]] (\u8089\u9aa8\u8336), porridge or rice [[congee]], sliced thinly to be dipped into the broth/congee and eaten. It is also commonly eaten with coffee or soy milk for breakfast.[[File:Mini youtiao.JPG|thumb|The youtiao is a popular breakfast food in [[Myanmar]], where it is called ''e kya kway''.]]\n\n=== Myanmar ===\nThe youtiao is also a popular breakfast food in [[Myanmar]] (Burma)  where it is called ''e kya kway''. It is usually eaten with steamed yellow beans (with salt and oil). It is also usually dipped into coffee or tea. E kya kway is also eaten with rice porridge, or cut into small rings and used as a condiment for [[mohinga]].\nTea culture is very prevalent in Myanmar, and every shop will serve e kya kway for breakfast.\n\nSome shops stuff meat into the youtiao and deep fry it over again. It is called ''e kya kway asar thoot'' \u2013 stuffed e kya kway.\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 350\n| image1 = Bicho-Bicho.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Shakoy/Bicho from the [[Philippines]]\n| image2 = Bicho-bicho.jpg\n| caption2 = Bicho-Bicho from the [[Philippines]]\n}}\n=== Philippines ===\nIn the [[Philippines]], it is either known as ''Bicho'' / ''Bicho-Bicho'' or ''[[Shakoy]]'' / ''Siyakoy'' / ''Pinisi'' / ''lubid-lubid.'' They are usually deep-fried, in the case of Bicho-Bicho, or deep-fried and twisted as [[Twisted doughnut|twisted doughnuts]], in the case of Shakoy. Dry, smaller and crunchy versions are called ''[[pilipit]]''.\n\n===Thailand===\n\n[[File:Pathongko.jpg|thumb|Thai youtiao]]\n\nIn [[Thailand]], youtiao is generally called ''pathongko'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e17\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e42\u0e01\u0e4b}}, {{IPA-th|pa\u02d0t\u02b0\u0254\u0302\u014bk\u01d2\u02d0|pron}}) due to a confusion with a different kind of dessert. ''Pathongko'' is a loanword adapted from either [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] [[Southern Min|Minnan]] ''beh teung guai'' (\u767d\u7cd6\u7cbf; Mandarin: ''b\u00e1i t\u00e1nggu\u01d2'') or [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] of ''baahkt\u00f2ngg\u00f2u'' (\u767d\u7cd6\u7cd5; Mandarin: b\u00e1i t\u00e1ngg\u0101o). However, both possible original names are different desserts, not to be confused with the real [[White sugar sponge cake|white sugar sponge cake (\u767d\u7cd6\u7cd5)]]. It was previously sold together with youtiao by [[hawker (trade)|street vendors]] who normally walked around and shouted both names out loud. However, Thai customers often mistakenly thought that the more popular youtiao was ''\"pathongko\"''. Eventually, the real ''pathongko'' disappeared from the market because of its unpopularity. Ironically, the disappearance of real ''\"pathongko\"'' leaves youtiao being called under the former's name, but the latter's real name is generally unknown amongst the Thais.  But the original white sugar sponge cake can still be easily found in [[Trang Province]] in [[Southern Thailand]] under its original name.\n\nIn Thailand, pathongko is also dipped into condensed milk or, in the South, eaten with kaya.\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Qu\u1ea9y.jpg|thumb|right|''Qu\u1ea9y'']]\n\nIn [[Vietnamese cuisine]], it is known by a name that is a mix of [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] and native Vietnamese to achieve a pronunciation similar to the Cantonese name, as ''d\u1ea7u ch\u00e1o qu\u1ea9y'', ''gi\u00f2 ch\u00e1o qu\u1ea9y'' or simply ''qu\u1ea9y''. \u6cb9 (\"D\u1ea7u/gi\u00f2\") \u9b3c (\"qu\u1ef7/qu\u1ea9y\") coming from the approximate Chinese name. In Vietnam, gi\u00f2 ch\u00e1o qu\u1ea9y is eaten typically with congee, pho in Hanoi and sometimes with [[wonton noodle]] (''mi hoanh thanh'').\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food|China|Malaysia}}\n* [[Fried dough foods]]\n* [[List of Chinese dishes]]\n* [[List of doughnut varieties]]\n* [[List of deep fried foods]]\n* [[List of snack foods]]\n* [[List of street foods]]\n* [[Zhaliang]]\n* [[Ci fan tuan]]\n\n===Similar Chinese foods===\n* [[Ox-tongue pastry]]\n* [[Shuangbaotai]]\n\n===Other similar foods===\n* [[Boortsog]] from [[Mongolia]] and [[Central Asia]]\n* [[Churro]] from [[Iberia]]\n* [[Cruller]]\n* [[Beignet]] from [[New Orleans]] (USA)\n* [[Tenkasu]] from [[Japan]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*https://www.kfc.com.sg/our-food/kfc-a-m/original-recipe-porridge-and-youtiao/\n\n{{Commons category multi|Youtiao|You tiao}}\n*https://berita.kitamerahputih.id/2019/03/12/jajanan-semarang-hantu-yang-digoreng/\n\n{{Shanghai cuisine}}\n{{Filipino cuisine}}\n{{Malaysian cuisine}}\n{{Thai cuisine}}\n\n[[Category:Chinese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Deep fried foods]]\n[[Category:Dim sum]]\n[[Category:Doughnuts]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Thai desserts and snacks]]\n", "name_user": "Qin096", "label": "safe", "comment": "insert citation for Youtiao (section)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtiao"}
