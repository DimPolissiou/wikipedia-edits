In [[great house]]s, the household is sometimes divided into departments with the butler in charge of the [[dining room]], [[wine cellar]], and [[pantries|pantry]]. Some also have charge of the entire parlour floor, and [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeepers]] caring for the entire house and its appearance.<ref name=\"emilypost\">{{cite book | title=Emily Post's Etiquette| last=Post| first=Emily| year=2007| publisher=Echo Library| isbn=978-1-4068-1215-2}}</ref> A butler is usually male,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.butlersguild.com/index.php?subject=5 |title=Home |website=Butlersguild |accessdate=22 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623234657/http://www.butlersguild.com/index.php?subject=5 |archivedate=23 June 2017 }}</ref> and in charge of male servants, while a housekeeper is usually a woman, and in charge of female servants.  Traditionally, male servants (such as footmen) were better paid and of higher status than female servants.  The butler, as the senior male servant, has the highest servant status. He can also sometimes function as a [[chauffeur]].\n\nIn older houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as ''[[majordomo]]'', ''butler administrator'', ''house manager'', ''manservant'', ''staff manager'', ''[[chief of staff]]'', ''staff captain'', ''estate manager'' and ''head of household staff'' are sometimes given. The precise duties of the employee will vary to some extent in line with the title given, but perhaps, more importantly in line with the requirements of the individual employer. In the grandest homes or when the employer owns more than one residence, there is sometimes an estate manager of higher rank than the butler. The butler can also be assisted by a head [[footman|footman or footboy]] called the '''under-butler'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.literary-liaisons.com/article046.htm|title=Article 046--Servants--Their Hierarchy and Duties|website=www.literary-liaisons.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905105230/http://www.literary-liaisons.com/article046.htm|archivedate=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Butler 1922.jpg|thumb|Butler c. 1922]]\nThe word \"butler\" comes from Anglo-Norman ''buteler'', variant form of Old Norman ''*butelier'', corresponding to [[Old French]] ''botellier'' \"officer in charge of the king's wine bottles\", derived of ''boteille'' \"bottle\", Modern French ''bouteille'', itself from Gallo-Romance <small>BUTICULA</small> \"bottle\". The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages which in ancient times might have represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.\n\nIn Britain, the butler was originally a middle-ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries, <!-- When gentleman attendants disappeared from aristocratic households that doesn't make sense; pages, valets and footmen were all still in place\u2014needs explaining. Reply: pageboys in the 18th century sense were just very young servants, nothing like a medieval page of high birth. Valets and footmen were not \"gentlemen\" attendants, they were servants.--> the butler gradually became the senior, usually male, member of a household's staff in the very grandest households. However, there was sometimes a steward who ran the outside estate and financial affairs, rather than just the household, and who was senior to the butler in social status into the 19th century. Butlers used always to be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the [[livery]] of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a [[Business attire|business suit]] or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.\n\nA ''silverman'' or ''silver butler'' has expertise and professional knowledge of the management, secure storage, use and cleaning of all [[Household silver|silverware]], associated tableware and other paraphernalia for use at military and other special functions.\n\n==Origin and history==\n[[File:Pincerna-roman.jpg|left|thumb|95px|A slave in charge of wine in ancient Rome.]]\nThe modern role of the butler has evolved from earlier roles that were generally concerned with the care and serving of alcoholic beverages.\n\n===Ancient through medieval eras===\nFrom ancient through medieval times, alcoholic beverages were chiefly stored first in earthenware vessels, then later in wooden barrels, rather than in glass bottles; these containers would have been an important part of a household's possessions.  The care of these assets was therefore generally reserved for trusted slaves, although the job could also go to free persons because of heredity-based class lines or the inheritance of trades.\n\nThe biblical book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] contains a reference to a role precursive to modern butlers.  The early Hebrew [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] interpreted a dream of Pharaoh's \u05e9\u05e7\u05d4 (shaqah) (literally \"to give to drink\"), which is most often translated into English as \"chief butler\" or \"chief cup-bearer\".<ref>Genesis 39-40.</ref>\n\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, it was nearly always slaves who were charged with the care and service of wine, while during the [[Medieval Era]] the ''pincerna'' filled the role within the noble court. The English word \"butler\" itself comes from the [[Middle English]] word ''bo(u)teler'' (and several other forms), from Anglo-Norman ''buteler'', itself from Old Norman ''butelier'', corresponding to [[Old French]] ''botellier'' (\"bottle bearer\"), Modern French ''bouteiller'', and before that from [[Medieval Latin]] ''butticula''. The modern [[English language|English]] \"butler\" thus relates both to bottles and [[casks]].\n[[File:Pincera-schenker.jpg|left|thumb|95px|A ''pincerna'' depicted in service to a noble court during the Medieval Era.]]\nEventually the European butler emerged as a middle-ranking member of the servants of a great house, in charge of the ''buttery'' (originally a storeroom for \"butts\" of liquor, although the term later came to mean a general storeroom or pantry).<ref>This was most likely from a loss of the original Latin meaning and the mistaken belief that ''buttery'' related to \"butter\".</ref>  While this is so for household butlers, those with the same title but in service to the Crown enjoyed a position of administrative power and were only minimally involved with various stores.\n[[File:Amesservants.jpg|right|thumb|250px|In a large house, the butler (centre-left) is traditionally head over a full array of household servants.  This is the servant staff at the Stonehouse Hill of [[Massachusetts]], the estate of [[Frederick Lothrop Ames]], 1914.]]\n\n===Elizabethan through Victorian eras===\nThe ''Steward'' of the Elizabethan era was more akin to the butler that later emerged.<ref>[[Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu]]; Lord Montagu's Book of Rules and Orders, 1595.</ref> Gradually, throughout the 19th century and particularly the Victorian era, as the number of butlers and other domestic servants greatly increased in various countries, the butler became a senior male servant of a household's staff. By this time he was in charge of the more modern ''wine cellar'', the \"[[buttery (room)|buttery]]\" or ''pantry'' (from French ''pain'' from Latin ''panis'', bread) as it came to be called, which supplied bread, butter, cheese, and other basic provisions, and the ''ewery'', which contained napkins and basins for washing and shaving.<ref name=\"scanlon\">{{cite journal | author=Nancy Scanlon| title=The Development of the Kitchen in the English Country House 1315\u20131864| journal=Journal of Culinary Science and Technology| year=2006| volume=4| issue=2/3| pages=79\u201392}}</ref> In the very grandest households there was sometimes an Estate Steward or other senior steward who oversaw the butler and his duties.<ref name=\"mrsbeeton\">{{cite book| title=Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management| url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=89404824| last=Beeton| first=Isabella| date=2000| origyear=1861| page=393| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-283345-7| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604032447/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=89404824| archivedate=2011-06-04| access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> ''[[Mrs Beeton]]'s Book of Household Management'', a manual published in Britain in 1861, reported:\n\n<blockquote>The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the chamberlain and house-steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer. The majority of gentlemen's establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman, and coachman, or coachman and groom, where the horses exceed two or three.<ref name=\"mrsbeeton\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Glanusk park.gif|right|thumb|250px|Glanusk Park in Powys, U.K., in 1891. The residence had 17 servants in residence. The largest stately houses could have 40 or more.]]\n\nButlers were head of a strict service hierarchy and therein held a position of power and respect.  They were more managerial than \"hands on\"\u2014more so than serving, they officiated in service.  For example, although the butler was at the door to greet and announce the arrival of a formal guest, the door was actually ''opened'' by a footman, who would receive the guest's hat and coat. Even though the butler helped his employer into his coat, this had been handed to him by a footman.  However, even the highest-ranking butler would \"pitch in\" when necessary, such as during a staff shortage, to ensure that the household ran smoothly, although some evidence suggests this was so even during normal times.<ref>Carrolyn Steedman, \"The servant\u2019s labour: the business of life, England, 1760\u20131820\", ''Social History'', Vol. 29 No. 1, (February 2004).</ref>\n\nThe household itself was generally divided into areas of responsibility. The butler was in charge of the dining room, the [[wine cellar]], pantry, and sometimes the entire main floor.  Directly under the butler was the ''first footman'' (or ''head footman''), although there could also be a ''deputy butler'' or ''under-butler'' who would fill in as butler during the butler's illness or absence.  The ''[[footman]]''\u2014there were frequently numerous young men in the role within a household\u2014performed a range of duties including serving meals, attending doors, carrying or moving heavy items, and they often doubled as ''[[valet]]s''.  Valets themselves performed a variety of personal duties for their employer.  Butlers engaged and directed all these junior staff and each reported directly to him.  The ''[[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]]'' was in charge of the house as a whole and its appearance. In a household without an official head housekeeper, female servants and kitchen staff were also directly under the butler's management, while in smaller households, the butler usually doubled as valet. Employers and their children and guests addressed the butler (and under-butler, if there was one) by last name alone; fellow servants, retainers, and tradespersons as \"Mr. [Surname]\".\n\nButlers were typically hired by the master of the house but usually reported to its lady.   Beeton in her manual suggested a GBP 25\u201350 (US$2,675\u20135,350) per-year salary for butlers; room and board and livery clothing were additional benefits, and  tipping known as ''vails'', were common.<ref>D. Marshall, \"The Domestic Servants of the Eighteenth Century\", ''Economica'', No. 25, (Apr. 1929), pp. 15\u201340.

Some eventually became butlers.  Gary Puckrein, a social historian, argues that those used in particularly affluent homes authentically internalised the sorts of \"refined\" norms and personal attributes that would reflect highly upon the social stature of their masters or mistresses.  One of the first books written and published through a commercial U.S. publisher by an African American was by a butler named [[Robert Roberts (butler)|Robert Roberts]].  The book, ''The House Servant's Directory'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Roberts |url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/books/book_05.cfm |title=The House Servant's Directory |publisher=Munroe and Francis; New York: Charles S. Francis, 1827 |website=Digital.lib.msu.edu |accessdate=22 August 2017}}</ref> first published in 1827, is essentially a manual for butlers and waiters, and is called by Puckrein \"the most remarkable book by an African American in [[South: Ante Bellum|antebellum United States]]\".  The book generated such interest that a second edition was published in 1828, and a third in 1843.<ref name=\"puckrein\">{{cite journal | author=Gary Puckrein| title=The Science of Service| journal=American Visions| date=October\u2013November 1998| volume=13| issue=5}}</ref>\n\nEuropean [[indentured servants]] formed a corps of domestic workers from which butlers were eventually drawn.  Although not the victims of institutionalised slavery, many of them had not volunteered for domestic service, but were forced into it by indebtedness or coercion.  As with African American slaves, they could rise in domestic service, and their happiness or misery depended greatly on the disposition of their masters.\n\n===The modern butler===\nBeginning around the early 1920s (following [[World War I]]), employment in domestic service occupations began a sharp overall decline in western European countries, and even more markedly in the [[United States]].  Even so, there were still around 30,000 butlers employed in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by [[World War II]].  As few as one hundred were estimated to remain by the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"steadyjeevesyouvegotcompany\">{{cite journal | author=J. Lee| title=Steady, Jeeves\u2014you've got company!| journal=U.S. News & World Report| year=1988| volume=104| issue=17}}</ref> [[Social history|Social historian]] Barry Higman argues that a high number of domestic workers within a society correlates with a high level of socio-economic inequality. Conversely, as a society undergoes levelling among its [[social class]]es, the number employed in domestic service declines.<ref name=\"domesticserviceinaustralia\">{{cite book | title=Domestic Service in Australia| last=Higman| first=Barry| year=2002| publisher=Melbourne University Publishing| isbn=978-0-522-85011-6}}</ref>\n\nFollowing varied shifts and changes accompanying accelerated [[globalisation]] beginning in the late 1980s, overall global demand for butlers since the turn of the millennium has risen dramatically. According to Charles MacPherson, President of Charles MacPherson Associates and owner of The Charles MacPherson Academy for Butlers and Household Managers, the proximate cause is that the number of millionaires and billionaires has increased in recent years, and such people are finding that they desire assistance in managing their households. MacPherson emphasises that the number of wealthy people in [[China]] has increased particularly, creating in that country a high demand for professional butlers who have been trained in the European butlering tradition.<ref name=\"NPRradio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7338550|title=By Jeeves, We're Having a Butler Shortage\u2014Interview with Charles MacPherson|accessdate=13 August 2007|publisher=NPR News|date=10 February 2007|author=Scott Simon|work=Weekend Edition Saturday|format=Streaming Audio|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204020022/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7338550|archivedate=4 February 2008}} Also see Sheelah Kolhatka, [http://static.pinnaclecare.com/reprints/atlantic-monthly-09-06.pdf \"Inside the Billionaire Service Industry\"].

Butlers today may be called upon to do whatever household and personal duties their employers deem fitting, in the goal of freeing their employers to carry out their own personal and professional affairs.  Professional butler and author Steven M. Ferry states that the image of tray-wielding butlers who specialise in serving tables and decanting wine is now anachronistic, and that employers may well be more interested in a butler who is capable of managing a full array of household affairs\u2014from providing the traditional dinner service, to acting as valet, to managing high-tech systems and multiple homes with complexes of staff.

Whereas butlers have traditionally worn a special uniform that separated them from junior servants, and although this is still often the case, butlers today may wear more casual clothing geared for climate, while exchanging it for formal business attire only upon special service occasions.

Probably the first mention of a female butler is in the 1892 book ''Interludes being Two Essays, a Story, and Some Verses'' by Horace Smith.

With the advent of the medieval era, butlering became an opportunity for social advancement\u2014even more so during Victorian times. Although still based upon various antecedent roles as manifested during different eras, butlering today has frequently taken over many of the roles formerly reserved for lower-ranking domestic servants.  At the same time it has become a potentially lucrative career option.<ref>In Loeffler (15 April 2007), Nathalie Laitmon of The Calendar Group in Stamford, Connecticut, states that skilled butlers within the grandest households can make USD 200,000 (GBP 101,500).  She states, \"The bigger the lifestyle of the family, the more they can earn\".</ref>\n\n==Notable butlers==\n* [[Eugene Allen]], White House butler who served under eight U.S. presidents\n* [[Paul Burrell]], butler to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]\n* [[Leslie Bartlett]], butler, [[toastmaster]]; and founder of [[The London School of British Butlers]]\n* [[Alonzo Fields]], White House chief butler from 1932\u20131953\n\n==In visual art==\n[[File:Hogarths-Servants.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Heads of Six of Hogarth's Servants]]'']]\nButlers have been occasionally depicted in visual art. A famous [[painting]], ''[[Heads of Six of Hogarth's Servants]]'' (c. 1758), is unique among such works.  In it, the 18th-century English artist [[William Hogarth]] depicted his household servants, all surrounding the butler.  In showing the group in a close-knit assemblage rather than in the performance of their routine household duties, Hogarth sought to humanise and dignify them in a manner akin to wealthy-class members, who were the normal subjects of such [[portrait]]s. While this was a subversive act that certainly raised many eyebrows in his day\u2014Hogarth conspicuously displayed the work in his estate home in full view of guests\u2014at the same time he had painted his servants' facial expressions to convey the sincerity and deference expected of servant-class members.<ref name=\"fourhundredyears\">{{cite book | title=Below stairs, 400 years of servants' portraits|editor=Waterfield G. |editor2=A.

In the series, Stock portrays the butler as sick with love, but the possibility of fulfillment is hopeless: the love is a forbidden love, perhaps felt for the lady of the house, and so it must be suffered alone in silent concealment.  In addition to the ongoing mannerisms and facial expressions of the butler, a seated lady once appearing in a curtained room and a recurring lipstick-stained [[absinthe]] glass over which the butler obsesses provide the interpretive clues.  In selecting a butler as his subject, Stock sought to provide a \"universal character\", a pathos-laden figure that could be widely related to and that could depict the universality of loneliness felt by someone who can only look in from the outside. Stock began the series in 1985 to express his difficult feelings during a personal experience of unrequited love.  One of the paintings was inspiration for a [[3-D film|3-D]] short film, \"The Butler's in Love\" by actor/director [[David Arquette]], shot in 2008 at [[San Francisco]]'s historic [[Westerfield Mansion]].<ref>Croft, Karen.  \"Butlers in Love\", ''Salon'', 24 May 2001.

The butler of fiction, by contrast, often tends to be larger than life and has become a [[plot device]] in [[literature]] and a traditional [[role]] in the [[performing arts]]. Butlers may provide comic relief with wry comments, clues as to the perpetrators of various crimes, and are represented as at least as intelligent and moral as their \u201cbetters,\u201d or even more so. They are often portrayed as being serious and expressionless and in the case that the wealthy hero is an orphan\u2014such as [[Batman]], [[Chrono Crusade]]'s Satella Harvenheit, or [[Tomb Raider]]'s [[Lara Croft]]\u2014may be a father figure to said hero. Regardless of the genre in which they are cast, butlers in fiction almost invariably follow the \"British butler\" model and are given an appropriate-sounding surname. The fictional butler tends to be given a typical Anglo-Celtic surname and have an English accent. The Asian, African American, or Caribbean houseboy is a variant, but even these major-domos are based on the British icon.\n\nToday, butlers are usually portrayed as being refined and well-spoken. However, in 19th century fiction such as ''[[Dracula]]'', butlers generally spoke with a strong [[Cockney]] or other regional accent.\n\n\"The butler\" is integral to the plot of countless [[potboiler]]s and [[melodrama]]s, whether or not the character has been given a name. Butlers figure so prominently in [[period piece]]s and [[whodunit]]s that they can be considered [[stock character]]s in [[film]] and [[theatre]], where a [[catchphrase]] is \"[[Mary Roberts Rinehart|The butler did it]]!\"\n\nThe best-known fictional manservant, and the archetype of the quintessential British butler, is himself not a butler at all. [[Jeeves|Reginald Jeeves]], the iconic creation of author [[P. G. Wodehouse]] is a \"[[valet|gentleman's gentleman]]\" and general [[Domestic worker|factotum]]. Probably the best-known fictional butlers are [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] from the ''[[Batman]]'' comic and films; Hudson of [[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]] television fame; [[List of Downton Abbey characters#Mr Carson|Mr Carson]] from the [[Downton Abbey]] television series; and Crichton from [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]''. Lesser-knowns include Mr. Belvedere from the novel ''Belvedere'', which was adapted into a feature film with sequels and later a [[Mr. Belvedere|television series]]; [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], from the television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'', based on Charles Addams' ''[[The New Yorker]]'' cartoons; Beach, from the Wodehouse series about [[Blandings Castle]]; [[Niles (The Nanny)|Niles]], the butler at the Sheffield house in American sitcom ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', Geoffrey from [[The Fresh Prince of Bel Air]], Bailey (an English canine butler) from the children's animated television series ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' and Benson from the two series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]''.\n\nNot all fictional butlers portray the \"butler stereotype\", however. [[Alan Bates]], who played the butler Jennings in the film ''[[Gosford Park]]'', was coached in brooding detail by Arthur Inch, a longtime real-life butler.<ref>\"The man who got it right for Gosford Park and told Richard E Grant what was wrong\", ''Mid Sussex Times'', 2002.

Traditionally, male servants (such as footmen) were better paid and of higher status than female servants.  The butler, as the senior male servant, has the highest servant status. He can also sometimes function as a [[chauffeur]].\n\nIn older houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as ''[[majordomo]]'', ''butler administrator'', ''house manager'', ''manservant'', ''staff manager'', ''[[chief of staff]]'', ''staff captain'', ''estate manager'' and ''head of household staff'' are sometimes given. The precise duties of the employee will vary to some extent in line with the title given, but perhaps, more importantly in line with the requirements of the individual employer. In the grandest homes or when the employer owns more than one residence, there is sometimes an estate manager of higher rank than the butler. The butler can also be assisted by a head [[footman|footman or footboy]] called the '''under-butler'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.literary-liaisons.com/article046.htm|title=Article 046--Servants--Their Hierarchy and Duties|website=www.literary-liaisons.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905105230/http://www.literary-liaisons.com/article046.htm|archivedate=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Butler 1922.jpg|thumb|Butler c. 1922]]\nThe word \"butler\" comes from Anglo-Norman ''buteler'', variant form of Old Norman ''*butelier'', corresponding to [[Old French]] ''botellier'' \"officer in charge of the king's wine bottles\", derived of ''boteille'' \"bottle\", Modern French ''bouteille'', itself from Gallo-Romance <small>BUTICULA</small> \"bottle\". The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages which in ancient times might have represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.\n\nIn Britain, the butler was originally a middle-ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries, <!-- When gentleman attendants disappeared from aristocratic households that doesn't make sense; pages, valets and footmen were all still in place\u2014needs explaining. Reply: pageboys in the 18th century sense were just very young servants, nothing like a medieval page of high birth. Valets and footmen were not \"gentlemen\" attendants, they were servants.--> the butler gradually became the senior, usually male, member of a household's staff in the very grandest households. However, there was sometimes a steward who ran the outside estate and financial affairs, rather than just the household, and who was senior to the butler in social status into the 19th century. Butlers used always to be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the [[livery]] of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a [[Business attire|business suit]] or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.\n\nA ''silverman'' or ''silver butler'' has expertise and professional knowledge of the management, secure storage, use and cleaning of all [[Household silver|silverware]], associated tableware and other paraphernalia for use at military and other special functions.\n\n==Origin and history==\n[[File:Pincerna-roman.jpg|left|thumb|95px|A slave in charge of wine in ancient Rome.]]\nThe modern role of the butler has evolved from earlier roles that were generally concerned with the care and serving of alcoholic beverages.\n\n===Ancient through medieval eras===\nFrom ancient through medieval times, alcoholic beverages were chiefly stored first in earthenware vessels, then later in wooden barrels, rather than in glass bottles; these containers would have been an important part of a household's possessions.  The care of these assets was therefore generally reserved for trusted slaves, although the job could also go to free persons because of heredity-based class lines or the inheritance of trades.\n\nThe biblical book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] contains a reference to a role precursive to modern butlers.  The early Hebrew [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] interpreted a dream of Pharaoh's \u05e9\u05e7\u05d4 (shaqah) (literally \"to give to drink\"), which is most often translated into English as \"chief butler\" or \"chief cup-bearer\".<ref>Genesis 39-40.</ref>\n\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, it was nearly always slaves who were charged with the care and service of wine, while during the [[Medieval Era]] the ''pincerna'' filled the role within the noble court. The English word \"butler\" itself comes from the [[Middle English]] word ''bo(u)teler'' (and several other forms), from Anglo-Norman ''buteler'', itself from Old Norman ''butelier'', corresponding to [[Old French]] ''botellier'' (\"bottle bearer\"), Modern French ''bouteiller'', and before that from [[Medieval Latin]] ''butticula''. The modern [[English language|English]] \"butler\" thus relates both to bottles and [[casks]].\n[[File:Pincera-schenker.jpg|left|thumb|95px|A ''pincerna'' depicted in service to a noble court during the Medieval Era.]]\nEventually the European butler emerged as a middle-ranking member of the servants of a great house, in charge of the ''buttery'' (originally a storeroom for \"butts\" of liquor, although the term later came to mean a general storeroom or pantry).<ref>This was most likely from a loss of the original Latin meaning and the mistaken belief that ''buttery'' related to \"butter\".</ref>  While this is so for household butlers, those with the same title but in service to the Crown enjoyed a position of administrative power and were only minimally involved with various stores.\n[[File:Amesservants.jpg|right|thumb|250px|In a large house, the butler (centre-left) is traditionally head over a full array of household servants.  This is the servant staff at the Stonehouse Hill of [[Massachusetts]], the estate of [[Frederick Lothrop Ames]], 1914.]]\n\n===Elizabethan through Victorian eras===\nThe ''Steward'' of the Elizabethan era was more akin to the butler that later emerged.<ref>[[Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu]]; Lord Montagu's Book of Rules and Orders, 1595.</ref> Gradually, throughout the 19th century and particularly the Victorian era, as the number of butlers and other domestic servants greatly increased in various countries, the butler became a senior male servant of a household's staff. By this time he was in charge of the more modern ''wine cellar'', the \"[[buttery (room)|buttery]]\" or ''pantry'' (from French ''pain'' from Latin ''panis'', bread) as it came to be called, which supplied bread, butter, cheese, and other basic provisions, and the ''ewery'', which contained napkins and basins for washing and shaving.<ref name=\"scanlon\">{{cite journal | author=Nancy Scanlon| title=The Development of the Kitchen in the English Country House 1315\u20131864| journal=Journal of Culinary Science and Technology| year=2006| volume=4| issue=2/3| pages=79\u201392}}</ref> In the very grandest households there was sometimes an Estate Steward or other senior steward who oversaw the butler and his duties.<ref name=\"mrsbeeton\">{{cite book| title=Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management| url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=89404824| last=Beeton| first=Isabella| date=2000| origyear=1861| page=393| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-283345-7| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604032447/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=89404824| archivedate=2011-06-04| access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> ''[[Mrs Beeton]]'s Book of Household Management'', a manual published in Britain in 1861, reported:\n\n<blockquote>The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the chamberlain and house-steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer. The majority of gentlemen's establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman, and coachman, or coachman and groom, where the horses exceed two or three.<ref name=\"mrsbeeton\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Glanusk park.gif|right|thumb|250px|Glanusk Park in Powys, U.K., in 1891. The residence had 17 servants in residence. The largest stately houses could have 40 or more.]]\n\nButlers were head of a strict service hierarchy and therein held a position of power and respect.  They were more managerial than \"hands on\"\u2014more so than serving, they officiated in service.  For example, although the butler was at the door to greet and announce the arrival of a formal guest, the door was actually ''opened'' by a footman, who would receive the guest's hat and coat. Even though the butler helped his employer into his coat, this had been handed to him by a footman.  However, even the highest-ranking butler would \"pitch in\" when necessary, such as during a staff shortage, to ensure that the household ran smoothly, although some evidence suggests this was so even during normal times.<ref>Carrolyn Steedman, \"The servant\u2019s labour: the business of life, England, 1760\u20131820\", ''Social History'', Vol. 29 No. 1, (February 2004).</ref>\n\nThe household itself was generally divided into areas of responsibility. The butler was in charge of the dining room, the [[wine cellar]], pantry, and sometimes the entire main floor.  Directly under the butler was the ''first footman'' (or ''head footman''), although there could also be a ''deputy butler'' or ''under-butler'' who would fill in as butler during the butler's illness or absence.  The ''[[footman]]''\u2014there were frequently numerous young men in the role within a household\u2014performed a range of duties including serving meals, attending doors, carrying or moving heavy items, and they often doubled as ''[[valet]]s''.  Valets themselves performed a variety of personal duties for their employer.  Butlers engaged and directed all these junior staff and each reported directly to him.  The ''[[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]]'' was in charge of the house as a whole and its appearance. In a household without an official head housekeeper, female servants and kitchen staff were also directly under the butler's management, while in smaller households, the butler usually doubled as valet. Employers and their children and guests addressed the butler (and under-butler, if there was one) by last name alone; fellow servants, retainers, and tradespersons as \"Mr. [Surname]\".\n\nButlers were typically hired by the master of the house but usually reported to its lady.   Beeton in her manual suggested a GBP 25\u201350 (US$2,675\u20135,350) per-year salary for butlers; room and board and livery clothing were additional benefits, and  tipping known as ''vails'', were common.<ref>D. Marshall, \"The Domestic Servants of the Eighteenth Century\", ''Economica'', No. 25, (Apr. 1929), pp. 15\u201340.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2548516 Available online with subscription]</ref>  The few butlers who were married had to make separate housing arrangements for their families, as did all other servants within the hierarchy.\n\n===Butlers in early United States===\n[[File:Robert Roberts The House Servant's Directory 1827 Book Cover.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Robert Roberts's ''The House Servant's Directory'', 1827.]]\nFrom the beginning of [[slavery]] in the [[United States]], in the early 17th century, [[African Americans]] were put to task as domestic servants. Some eventually became butlers.  Gary Puckrein, a social historian, argues that those used in particularly affluent homes authentically internalised the sorts of \"refined\" norms and personal attributes that would reflect highly upon the social stature of their masters or mistresses.  One of the first books written and published through a commercial U.S. publisher by an African American was by a butler named [[Robert Roberts (butler)|Robert Roberts]].  The book, ''The House Servant's Directory'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Roberts |url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/books/book_05.cfm |title=The House Servant's Directory |publisher=Munroe and Francis; New York: Charles S. Francis, 1827 |website=Digital.lib.msu.edu |accessdate=22 August 2017}}</ref> first published in 1827, is essentially a manual for butlers and waiters, and is called by Puckrein \"the most remarkable book by an African American in [[South: Ante Bellum|antebellum United States]]\".  The book generated such interest that a second edition was published in 1828, and a third in 1843.<ref name=\"puckrein\">{{cite journal | author=Gary Puckrein| title=The Science of Service| journal=American Visions| date=October\u2013November 1998| volume=13| issue=5}}</ref>\n\nEuropean [[indentured servants]] formed a corps of domestic workers from which butlers were eventually drawn.  Although not the victims of institutionalised slavery, many of them had not volunteered for domestic service, but were forced into it by indebtedness or coercion.  As with African American slaves, they could rise in domestic service, and their happiness or misery depended greatly on the disposition of their masters.\n\n===The modern butler===\nBeginning around the early 1920s (following [[World War I]]), employment in domestic service occupations began a sharp overall decline in western European countries, and even more markedly in the [[United States]].  Even so, there were still around 30,000 butlers employed in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by [[World War II]].  As few as one hundred were estimated to remain by the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"steadyjeevesyouvegotcompany\">{{cite journal | author=J.

Conversely, as a society undergoes levelling among its [[social class]]es, the number employed in domestic service declines.<ref name=\"domesticserviceinaustralia\">{{cite book | title=Domestic Service in Australia| last=Higman| first=Barry| year=2002| publisher=Melbourne University Publishing| isbn=978-0-522-85011-6}}</ref>\n\nFollowing varied shifts and changes accompanying accelerated [[globalisation]] beginning in the late 1980s, overall global demand for butlers since the turn of the millennium has risen dramatically. According to Charles MacPherson, President of Charles MacPherson Associates and owner of The Charles MacPherson Academy for Butlers and Household Managers, the proximate cause is that the number of millionaires and billionaires has increased in recent years, and such people are finding that they desire assistance in managing their households. MacPherson emphasises that the number of wealthy people in [[China]] has increased particularly, creating in that country a high demand for professional butlers who have been trained in the European butlering tradition.<ref name=\"NPRradio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7338550|title=By Jeeves, We're Having a Butler Shortage\u2014Interview with Charles MacPherson|accessdate=13 August 2007|publisher=NPR News|date=10 February 2007|author=Scott Simon|work=Weekend Edition Saturday|format=Streaming Audio|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204020022/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7338550|archivedate=4 February 2008}} Also see Sheelah Kolhatka, [http://static.pinnaclecare.com/reprints/atlantic-monthly-09-06.pdf \"Inside the Billionaire Service Industry\"].

Butlers today may be called upon to do whatever household and personal duties their employers deem fitting, in the goal of freeing their employers to carry out their own personal and professional affairs.  Professional butler and author Steven M. Ferry states that the image of tray-wielding butlers who specialise in serving tables and decanting wine is now anachronistic, and that employers may well be more interested in a butler who is capable of managing a full array of household affairs\u2014from providing the traditional dinner service, to acting as valet, to managing high-tech systems and multiple homes with complexes of staff.

Lynda Reeves, president of the Toronto-based House & Home Media, says that the term \"butler\" today is just \"a pretentious name for a housekeeper\".</ref>  Butlers today may also be situated within corporate settings, embassies, cruise ships, yachts, or within their own small \"Rent-a-Butler\" business or similar agency.<ref>Jones, Harvey. \"More money than time?

Whereas butlers have traditionally worn a special uniform that separated them from junior servants, and although this is still often the case, butlers today may wear more casual clothing geared for climate, while exchanging it for formal business attire only upon special service occasions.  There are cultural distinctions, as well.

Probably the first mention of a female butler is in the 1892 book ''Interludes being Two Essays, a Story, and Some Verses'' by Horace Smith. In it Smith quotes the noted writer and Anglican clergyman [[Sydney Smith]], who between 1809 and 1829 struggled to make ends meet in a poorly paid assignment to a rural parish in [[Yorkshire]]:\n<blockquote>\n\"I turned schoolmaster to educate my son, as I could not afford to send him to school.  Mrs. Sydney turned schoolmistress to educate my girls as I could not afford a governess.  I turned farmer as I could not let my land.  A man servant was too expensive, so I caught up a little garden girl, made like a milestone, christened her Bunch, put a napkin in her hand, and made her my butler. The girls taught her to read, Mrs. Sydney to wait, and I undertook her morals. Bunch became the best butler in the country.<ref>Smith, Horace; Joel Lehtonen (translator) (1892).

The school goes on to report that the labour market still has a preference for male butlers; however, the market is becoming more progressive and increasing numbers of female butlers are being hired.<ref>Charles MacPherson (9, April 2014)</ref>\n\nIn ancient times, the roles precursive to butlering were reserved for chattel or those confined within heredity-based class structures. With the advent of the medieval era, butlering became an opportunity for social advancement\u2014even more so during Victorian times. Although still based upon various antecedent roles as manifested during different eras, butlering today has frequently taken over many of the roles formerly reserved for lower-ranking domestic servants.  At the same time it has become a potentially lucrative career option.<ref>In Loeffler (15 April 2007), Nathalie Laitmon of The Calendar Group in Stamford, Connecticut, states that skilled butlers within the grandest households can make USD 200,000 (GBP 101,500).  She states, \"The bigger the lifestyle of the family, the more they can earn\".</ref>\n\n==Notable butlers==\n* [[Eugene Allen]], White House butler who served under eight U.S. presidents\n* [[Paul Burrell]], butler to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]\n* [[Leslie Bartlett]], butler, [[toastmaster]]; and founder of [[The London School of British Butlers]]\n* [[Alonzo Fields]], White House chief butler from 1932\u20131953\n\n==In visual art==\n[[File:Hogarths-Servants.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Heads of Six of Hogarth's Servants]]'']]\nButlers have been occasionally depicted in visual art. A famous [[painting]], ''[[Heads of Six of Hogarth's Servants]]'' (c. 1758), is unique among such works.  In it, the 18th-century English artist [[William Hogarth]] depicted his household servants, all surrounding the butler.  In showing the group in a close-knit assemblage rather than in the performance of their routine household duties, Hogarth sought to humanise and dignify them in a manner akin to wealthy-class members, who were the normal subjects of such [[portrait]]s. While this was a subversive act that certainly raised many eyebrows in his day\u2014Hogarth conspicuously displayed the work in his estate home in full view of guests\u2014at the same time he had painted his servants' facial expressions to convey the sincerity and deference expected of servant-class members.<ref name=\"fourhundredyears\">{{cite book | title=Below stairs, 400 years of servants' portraits|editor=Waterfield G. |editor2=A.

In the series, Stock portrays the butler as sick with love, but the possibility of fulfillment is hopeless: the love is a forbidden love, perhaps felt for the lady of the house, and so it must be suffered alone in silent concealment.  In addition to the ongoing mannerisms and facial expressions of the butler, a seated lady once appearing in a curtained room and a recurring lipstick-stained [[absinthe]] glass over which the butler obsesses provide the interpretive clues.  In selecting a butler as his subject, Stock sought to provide a \"universal character\", a pathos-laden figure that could be widely related to and that could depict the universality of loneliness felt by someone who can only look in from the outside. Stock began the series in 1985 to express his difficult feelings during a personal experience of unrequited love.  One of the paintings was inspiration for a [[3-D film|3-D]] short film, \"The Butler's in Love\" by actor/director [[David Arquette]], shot in 2008 at [[San Francisco]]'s historic [[Westerfield Mansion]].<ref>Croft, Karen.  \"Butlers in Love\", ''Salon'', 24 May 2001.

The butler of fiction, by contrast, often tends to be larger than life and has become a [[plot device]] in [[literature]] and a traditional [[role]] in the [[performing arts]]. Butlers may provide comic relief with wry comments, clues as to the perpetrators of various crimes, and are represented as at least as intelligent and moral as their \u201cbetters,\u201d or even more so. They are often portrayed as being serious and expressionless and in the case that the wealthy hero is an orphan\u2014such as [[Batman]], [[Chrono Crusade]]'s Satella Harvenheit, or [[Tomb Raider]]'s [[Lara Croft]]\u2014may be a father figure to said hero. Regardless of the genre in which they are cast, butlers in fiction almost invariably follow the \"British butler\" model and are given an appropriate-sounding surname. The fictional butler tends to be given a typical Anglo-Celtic surname and have an English accent. The Asian, African American, or Caribbean houseboy is a variant, but even these major-domos are based on the British icon.\n\nToday, butlers are usually portrayed as being refined and well-spoken. However, in 19th century fiction such as ''[[Dracula]]'', butlers generally spoke with a strong [[Cockney]] or other regional accent.\n\n\"The butler\" is integral to the plot of countless [[potboiler]]s and [[melodrama]]s, whether or not the character has been given a name. Butlers figure so prominently in [[period piece]]s and [[whodunit]]s that they can be considered [[stock character]]s in [[film]] and [[theatre]], where a [[catchphrase]] is \"[[Mary Roberts Rinehart|The butler did it]]!\"\n\nThe best-known fictional manservant, and the archetype of the quintessential British butler, is himself not a butler at all. [[Jeeves|Reginald Jeeves]], the iconic creation of author [[P. G. Wodehouse]] is a \"[[valet|gentleman's gentleman]]\" and general [[Domestic worker|factotum]]. Probably the best-known fictional butlers are [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] from the ''[[Batman]]'' comic and films; Hudson of [[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]] television fame; [[List of Downton Abbey characters#Mr Carson|Mr Carson]] from the [[Downton Abbey]] television series; and Crichton from [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]''. Lesser-knowns include Mr. Belvedere from the novel ''Belvedere'', which was adapted into a feature film with sequels and later a [[Mr. Belvedere|television series]]; [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], from the television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'', based on Charles Addams' ''[[The New Yorker]]'' cartoons; Beach, from the Wodehouse series about [[Blandings Castle]]; [[Niles (The Nanny)|Niles]], the butler at the Sheffield house in American sitcom ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', Geoffrey from [[The Fresh Prince of Bel Air]], Bailey (an English canine butler) from the children's animated television series ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' and Benson from the two series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]''.\n\nNot all fictional butlers portray the \"butler stereotype\", however. [[Alan Bates]], who played the butler Jennings in the film ''[[Gosford Park]]'', was coached in brooding detail by Arthur Inch, a longtime real-life butler.<ref>\"The man who got it right for Gosford Park and told Richard E Grant what was wrong\", ''Mid Sussex Times'', 2002.
