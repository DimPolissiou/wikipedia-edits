His governor was the Count [[Johann Eustach von G\u00f6rtz]] and in 1771, [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] was appointed his tutor. In 1774 the poet [[Karl Ludwig von Knebel]] came to [[Weimar]] as tutor to his brother, the young Prince [[Prince Frederick Ferdinand Constantin of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Frederick Ferdinand Constantin]], and in the same year the two princes set out, with Count G\u00f6rtz and Knebel, for [[Paris]]. At [[Frankfurt]], Knebel introduced Karl August to the young [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].\n\nIn [[Karlsruhe]] on 3 October 1775, after he returned to Weimar and assumed the government of his duchy, Karl August married [[Landgravine Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt (1757\u20131830)|Luise Auguste]], daughter of [[Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt]].\n\nOne of the first acts of the young duke was to summon Goethe to Weimar, and in 1776 he was made a member of the privy council. \u201cPeople of discernment,\u201d the duke said, \u201ccongratulate me on possessing this man.

Karl August was also interested in literature, in art, in science, funding Goethe and the foundation of the [[Weimar Princely Free Drawing School]] and encouraging [[Weimar Classicism]]. Critics praised his judgment in painting; biologists found in him an expert in anatomy. \n\nHis aim was to educate his people to work out their own political and social salvation, the object of education being in his view, as he explained later to the dismay of [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]] and his school, to help men to independence of judgment. To this end [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] was summoned to Weimar to [[educational system|reform the educational system]] and the [[University of Jena]] attained the zenith of its fame under his rule. Weimar became the intellectual centre of Germany.\n[[Image:Schr\u00f6ter Karl-August and Goethe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Engraving depicting Karl August walking with [[Corona Schr\u00f6ter]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].]]\nMeanwhile, in the affairs of Germany and of Europe the character of Karl August gave him an influence out of all proportion to his position as a sovereign prince.{{cn|date=March 2017}} He had early faced the problem presented by the decay of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and began to work for the [[unification of Germany|unity of Germany]]. The plans of Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], which threatened to absorb a great part of Germany into the heterogeneous [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] monarchy, threw him into the arms of [[Prussia]], and he was the prime mover in the establishment of the league of princes (''{{lang|de|[[F\u00fcrstenbund]]}}'') in 1785, by which, under the leadership of [[Frederick the Great]], Joseph's intrigues were frustrated.{{cn|date=March 2017}} He was, however, under no illusion as to the power of Austria, and he refused the offer of the [[Holy Crown of Hungary|Hungarian crown]], made to him in 1787 by Prussia at the instance of the Magyar malcontents, with the dry remark that he had no desire to be another [[Winter King]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} In 1788 Karl August took service in the Prussian army as major-general in active command of a regiment. As such he was present, with Goethe, at the [[Battle of Valmy]] in 1792, and in 1794 at the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]] and the [[Battle of Pirmasenz]] (14 September) and [[Battle of Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]] (28\u201330 November). After this, dissatisfied with the attitude of the powers, he resigned, but rejoined on the accession of his friend King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] to the Prussian throne. The disastrous campaign of [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|Jena]] (1806) followed. On 14 October, the day after the battle, Weimar was sacked, and Karl August, to prevent the confiscation of his territories, was forced to join the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. From this time till after the Moscow campaign of 1812 his contingent fought on the French side in all Napoleon's wars. In 1813, however, he joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], and at the beginning of 1814 took command of a corps of 30,000 men operating in the Netherlands.\n\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) Karl August was present in person and protested vainly against the narrow policy of the powers in confining their debates to the rights of the princes to the exclusion of the rights of the people. His services in the war of liberation were rewarded with an extension of territory and the title of grand duke (''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfherzog}}''), but his liberal attitude had already made him suspect, and his subsequent action brought him still further into confrontation with the reactionary powers. He was the first of the German princes to grant a liberal constitution to his state under Article XIII of the Act of Confederation (5 May 1816) and his concession of liberty to the press made Weimar for a while the focus of journalistic agitation against the existing order. Metternich dubbed him contemptuously ''{{lang|de|der grosse Bursche}}'' for his patronage of the revolutionary {{lang|de|[[Burschenschaft]]en}}, and the celebrated festival held at [[Wartburg Castle|the Wartburg]] by his permission in 1818, though in effect the mildest of political demonstrations, brought down upon him the wrath of the great powers. The  grand duke was compelled to yield to the remonstrances of Prussia, Austria and Russia. The liberty of the press was again restricted in the grand duchy, but, thanks to the good understanding between the grand duke and his people, the regime of the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] pressed less heavily upon Weimar than upon other German states.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n[[Image:Carl August of Weimar Portrait by Jagemann.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Karl August as Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.]]\nKarl August died at [[Graditz]], near [[Torgau]], in 1828. [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Karl von Dalberg]], the prince-primate, who owed the co-adjutorship of Mainz to the duke's friendship, said that he had never met a prince with so much understanding, character, frankness and true-heartedness; the [[Milan]]ese, when he visited their city, called him the ''{{lang|it|uomo principe}}'', and Goethe himself said of him that \u201che had the gift of discriminating intellects and characters and setting each one in his place. He was inspired by the noblest good-will, the purest humanity, and with his whole soul desired only what was best. There was in him something of the divine. He would gladly have wrought the happiness of all mankind. And finally, he was greater than his surroundings. ... Everywhere he himself saw and judged, and in all circumstances his surest foundation was in himself.\u201d Karl August's correspondence with Goethe was published in 2 vols. at Weimar in 1863.\n\nHe left two surviving sons: [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl Frederick]], by whom he was succeeded, and [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792\u20131862)|Karl Bernhard]], a soldier, who, after the Congress of Vienna, became colonel of a regiment in the service of the King of the Netherlands, served as commander of the Dutch troops in the Belgian campaign of 1830 (the [[Ten Days' Campaign]]), and from 1847 to 1850 held the command of the forces in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Bernhard's son, William Augustus Edward, known as [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar]] (1823\u20131902), entered the British army and ended his career as a [[field marshal]].\n\nKarl August's only surviving daughter, Caroline Louise, married Frederick Ludwig, Hereditary Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], and was the mother of Helene (1814\u20131858), wife of [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], eldest son of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe I, King of France]].\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA101|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=101}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

As such he was present, with Goethe, at the [[Battle of Valmy]] in 1792, and in 1794 at the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]] and the [[Battle of Pirmasenz]] (14 September) and [[Battle of Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]] (28\u201330 November). After this, dissatisfied with the attitude of the powers, he resigned, but rejoined on the accession of his friend King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] to the Prussian throne. The disastrous campaign of [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|Jena]] (1806) followed. On 14 October, the day after the battle, Weimar was sacked, and Karl August, to prevent the confiscation of his territories, was forced to join the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. From this time till after the Moscow campaign of 1812 his contingent fought on the French side in all Napoleon's wars. In 1813, however, he joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]], and at the beginning of 1814 took command of a corps of 30,000 men operating in the Netherlands.\n\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) Karl August was present in person and protested vainly against the narrow policy of the powers in confining their debates to the rights of the princes to the exclusion of the rights of the people. His services in the war of liberation were rewarded with an extension of territory and the title of grand duke (''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfherzog}}''), but his liberal attitude had already made him suspect, and his subsequent action brought him still further into confrontation with the reactionary powers. He was the first of the German princes to grant a liberal constitution to his state under Article XIII of the Act of Confederation (5 May 1816) and his concession of liberty to the press made Weimar for a while the focus of journalistic agitation against the existing order. Metternich dubbed him contemptuously ''{{lang|de|der grosse Bursche}}'' for his patronage of the revolutionary {{lang|de|[[Burschenschaft]]en}}, and the celebrated festival held at [[Wartburg Castle|the Wartburg]] by his permission in 1818, though in effect the mildest of political demonstrations, brought down upon him the wrath of the great powers. The  grand duke was compelled to yield to the remonstrances of Prussia, Austria and Russia. The liberty of the press was again restricted in the grand duchy, but, thanks to the good understanding between the grand duke and his people, the regime of the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] pressed less heavily upon Weimar than upon other German states.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n[[Image:Carl August of Weimar Portrait by Jagemann.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Karl August as Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.]]\nKarl August died at [[Graditz]], near [[Torgau]], in 1828. [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Karl von Dalberg]], the prince-primate, who owed the co-adjutorship of Mainz to the duke's friendship, said that he had never met a prince with so much understanding, character, frankness and true-heartedness; the [[Milan]]ese, when he visited their city, called him the ''{{lang|it|uomo principe}}'', and Goethe himself said of him that \u201che had the gift of discriminating intellects and characters and setting each one in his place. He was inspired by the noblest good-will, the purest humanity, and with his whole soul desired only what was best. There was in him something of the divine. He would gladly have wrought the happiness of all mankind. And finally, he was greater than his surroundings. ... Everywhere he himself saw and judged, and in all circumstances his surest foundation was in himself.\u201d Karl August's correspondence with Goethe was published in 2 vols. at Weimar in 1863.\n\nHe left two surviving sons: [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl Frederick]], by whom he was succeeded, and [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792\u20131862)|Karl Bernhard]], a soldier, who, after the Congress of Vienna, became colonel of a regiment in the service of the King of the Netherlands, served as commander of the Dutch troops in the Belgian campaign of 1830 (the [[Ten Days' Campaign]]), and from 1847 to 1850 held the command of the forces in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Bernhard's son, William Augustus Edward, known as [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar]] (1823\u20131902), entered the British army and ended his career as a [[field marshal]].\n\nKarl August's only surviving daughter, Caroline Louise, married Frederick Ludwig, Hereditary Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], and was the mother of Helene (1814\u20131858), wife of [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], eldest son of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe I, King of France]].\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA101|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=101}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
