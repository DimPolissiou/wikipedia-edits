The early years were tough for the Brisbane Fire Brigade and it was not until 1889 that the first firemen was employed.\n\nThe first legislation for rural fire management was the Act to Prevent the Careless Use of Fire 1865, and for urban fire management, the Fire Brigades Act 1876. In 1990, the Queensland Fire Service and the Rural Fires Council were formed replacing the 81 Fire Boards in local government areas and the Rural Fires Board; this was the first step in creating a single fire service for Queensland.\n\nIn 1997, it became the Queensland Fire and Rescue Authority and 2001 saw another name change to the current Queensland Fire and Rescue Service.\n\nIn 2013, QFRS merged with EMQ and the Corporate Services Division of the Department of Community Safety to become the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, encompassing Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, parts of the State Emergency Service, Emergency Management and the Rural Fire Service.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Fire and Rescue Service professional Firefighters ensure a balance between the reduction of risk and enhancement of community resilience, whilst providing effective response and recovery capabilities in the primary hazard response areas of: fire and explosion; accident; rescue; environmental and imminent or declared disaster.\n\nThe Queensland Fire and Emergency Services provides specialist personnel with the skills and ability to provide combat support services for: land, marine, air and urban search and rescue; crime scene and forensic searches; missing person searches; animal disease outbreaks and communications.\n\n'''Fire and Rescue Service'''\n\nThe Fire and Rescue Service is made up of 2000 professional Firefighters and 2000 Auxiliary (part-time)firefighters that are responsible for responding to almost every emergency. They are highly trained and work in a command structure with high standards to ensure safety. They have a proud history of protecting Queenslanders and are highly valued by the community. They look after 92% of Queensland's Assets and 95% of the population. To become a Fire and Rescue Service career Firefighter involves a rigorous selection process, after which successful candidates undertake a four-month recruitment course. They the go on to partake in years of intense study and training in all disciplines of rescue, wildfires, structural fires and major emergencies.\n\n==== Rural Fire Service ====\nThe Rural Fire Service (RFS), made up of approximately 36 000 volunteers (5000 active), approximately 1400 rural fire brigades and around 2400 fire wardens. They are mainly responsible for responding to bushfires and have some land management capability. The current QFES model means that volunteers will support the Fire & Rescue Service in any emergency as required.\n\n==== Fire Prevention and Fire and Rescue====\n\nFire and Rescue Service professional Firefighters undertake a range of planning and preparation activities throughout the year. They are trained in Structural Firefighting, Wildland (forest and grassland) fires, vertical rescue, swift water rescue, road crash rescue, confined space rescue, trench rescue and urban search and rescue (USAR) and Hazardous material mitigation.\nFire hazard (vegetation fires) mitigation and response is the primary role of Fire and Rescue and Rural Fire Service in the outer areas. Rural Fire Brigades, in conjunction with Rural Fire Service permanent staff, Fire & rescue Service, local councils, national parks rangers, and local landholders, undertake a range of planning and preparation activities throughout the year to ensure communities are well prepared for the fire season.\n\nOne of these activities is hazard reduction burns. Hazard reduction burns use fire under controlled circumstances to reduce excess vegetation and minimise the potential for bushfires to get out of control.\n\n==== Community education ====\nThere is an increasing awareness that timely and effective fire prevention and education saves lives and property. Fire and Rescue Service professional firefighters visit many schools and engage in a range of community education activities to ensure the community is prepared for a range of emergencies.\n\n==== Permits to Light Fire ====\nThe Fire and Emergency Services Regulation 2011 regulates the use of fire by not allowing fires to be lit without a specific permit. Fire Wardens and authorised fire officers manage the permit to light fire system.\n\nA permit to light fire is required for any fire that exceeds two metres in any direction and can be acquired free of charge from a fire warden.\n\n==== Fighting Bushfires ====\nProfessional firefighters cover the major population areas across most of Queensland. Rural Fire Brigades respond to the outbreak of fires within their local area and in surrounding areas in support of other rural bushfire brigades and emergency services. QFES strives to enact a 'one organisation' approach, where the strengths of individual services are used to provide a stronger, more efficient response to large scale fires.\n\n==== Deployments and assistance during disasters ====\nAll elements of QFES are often sent on deployment to assist other states during disasters. Both paid and volunteer services are also used for state-based deployments to disasters and large scale incidents.\n\n===State Emergency Service===\nThe State Emergency Service is a statewide organisation of volunteers.\n\nThe SES in Queensland consists of volunteers from a variety of backgrounds who respond to emergencies and disasters across the State as needed.\n\nThey are trained and equipped by local councils and QFES, to help their communities across a range of functions, and their primary purpose is to assist the community.\n\nThe SES is designed to empower people to help themselves and others in their community in times of emergency and disaster. The basic concept is one of self-help and mutual assistance within each community.\n\n\nSES members also assist other emergency services with provision of: emergency lighting; emergency welfare services; management of traffic at emergency scenes and emergency communications.\n\n\n\n==Leadership==\nThe following list chronologically records those who have held the post of Commissioner of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[https://www.qld.gov.au/emergency/emergencies-services/response/fire-rescue] \n\nThe minister responsible is the Honourable Craig Crawford [http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/members/current/list/MemberDetails?ID=890183913], Minister for Fire and Emergency Services.\n\nQFES is currently led by Commissioner Greg Leach, formerly a member of the [[Country Fire Authority]], [[Ambulance Victoria]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)]].<ref name=\"leachbio\">{{cite web |title=Commissioner Leach Bio |url=https://www.qfes.qld.gov.au/rti/Documents/Commissioner-Leach-Bio.pdf |publisher=QFES |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe QFES is the result of 150 years of evolution in Queensland's firefighting services; in fact the QFES was born in 1860 after a fire destroyed a Brisbane cabinet making workshop. The early years were tough for the Brisbane Fire Brigade and it was not until 1889 that the first firemen was employed.\n\nThe first legislation for rural fire management was the Act to Prevent the Careless Use of Fire 1865, and for urban fire management, the Fire Brigades Act 1876. In 1990, the Queensland Fire Service and the Rural Fires Council were formed replacing the 81 Fire Boards in local government areas and the Rural Fires Board; this was the first step in creating a single fire service for Queensland.\n\nIn 1997, it became the Queensland Fire and Rescue Authority and 2001 saw another name change to the current Queensland Fire and Rescue Service.\n\nIn 2013, QFRS merged with EMQ and the Corporate Services Division of the Department of Community Safety to become the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, encompassing Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, parts of the State Emergency Service, Emergency Management and the Rural Fire Service.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Fire and Rescue Service professional Firefighters ensure a balance between the reduction of risk and enhancement of community resilience, whilst providing effective response and recovery capabilities in the primary hazard response areas of: fire and explosion; accident; rescue; environmental and imminent or declared disaster.\n\nThe Queensland Fire and Emergency Services provides specialist personnel with the skills and ability to provide combat support services for: land, marine, air and urban search and rescue; crime scene and forensic searches; missing person searches; animal disease outbreaks and communications.\n\n'''Fire and Rescue Service'''\n\nThe Fire and Rescue Service is made up of 2000 professional Firefighters and 2000 Auxiliary (part-time)firefighters that are responsible for responding to almost every emergency. They are highly trained and work in a command structure with high standards to ensure safety. They have a proud history of protecting Queenslanders and are highly valued by the community. They look after 92% of Queensland's Assets and 95% of the population. To become a Fire and Rescue Service career Firefighter takes years of intense study and training in all disciplines of rescue, wildfires, structural fires and major emergencies.\n\n===Rural Fire Service===\nThe Rural Fire Service (RFS), made up of approximately 36 000 volunteers (5000 active), approximately 1400 rural fire brigades and around 2400 fire wardens. They are mainly responsible for responding to bushfires and have some land management capability. The current QFES model means that volunteers will support the Fire & Rescue Service in any emergency as required.\n\n==== Fire Prevention and Fire and Rescue====\n\nFire and Rescue Service professional Firefighters undertake a range of planning and preparation activities throughout the year. They are trained in Structural Firefighting, Wildland (forest and grassland) fires, high angle rescue, swift water rescue, road crash rescue, confined space rescue, trench rescue and urban search and rescue and Hazardous material mitigation.\nFire hazard (vegetation fires) mitigation and response is the primary role of Fire and Rescue and Rural Fire Service in the outer areas. Rural Fire Brigades, in conjunction with Rural Fire Service permanent staff, Fire & rescue Service, local councils, national parks rangers, and local landholders, undertake a range of planning and preparation activities throughout the year to ensure communities are well prepared for the fire season.\n\nOne of these activities is hazard reduction burns. Hazard reduction burns use fire under controlled circumstances to reduce excess vegetation and minimise the potential for bushfires to get out of control.\n\n==== Community education ====\nThere is an increasing awareness that timely and effective fire prevention and education saves lives and property. Fire and Rescue Service professional Firefighters visit many schools and engage in a range of community education activities to ensure the community is prepared for a range of emergencies.\n\n==== Permits to Light Fire ====\nThe Fire and Emergency Services Regulation 2011 regulates the use of fire by not allowing fires to be lit without a specific permit. Fire Wardens and authorised fire officers manage the permit to light fire system.\n\nA permit to light fire is required for any fire that exceeds two metres in any direction and can be acquired free of charge from a fire warden.\n\n==== Fighting Bushfires ====\nProfessional firefighters cover the major population areas across most of Queensland. Rural Fire Brigades respond to the outbreak of fires within their local area and in surrounding areas in support of other rural bushfire brigades and emergency services. QFES come together to ensure the protection of Queenslanders.\n\n==== Deployments and assistance during disasters ====\nAll elements of QFES are often sent on deployment to assist other states during disasters. Volunteer members are also called upon to support Fire and Rescue Service and other emergency service agencies during disasters such as floods and storms.\n\n===State Emergency Service===\nThe State Emergency Service is a national organisation of volunteers.\n\nThe SES in Queensland consists of volunteers from a variety of backgrounds who respond to emergencies and disasters across the State, 24/7.\n\nThey are trained and equipped by local councils and QFES, to help their communities across a range of functions, and their primary purpose is to assist the community.\n\nThe SES is designed to empower people to help themselves and others in their community in times of emergency and disaster. The basic concept is one of self-help and mutual assistance within each community.\n\n\nSES members also assist other emergency services with provision of: emergency lighting; emergency welfare services; management of traffic at emergency scenes and emergency communications.\n\n\n\n==Leadership==\nThe following list chronologically records those who have held the post of Commissioner of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Abu Sa'id was forced to send Amir Husayn Jalayir to face Yasa'ur and while himself marched against \u00d6zbeg. \u00d6zbeg was defeated shortly thanks to reinforcements by Chupan, while Yasa'ur was killed by [[Kebek]] in 1320. Several amirs didn't come to aid of Abu Sa'id, therefore they were subject to punishment by Chupan. Yet another revolt started in 1319, this time by [[Keraites|Keraite]] emirs Irinjin, a former governor of [[Diyar Bakr]] and Qurumishi, governor of Georgia who were among the amirs rebuked by Chupan. Qurumishi and Irinjin were related in addition to both being from Keraite tribe - Irinjin was father of \u00d6ljait\u00fc's widow Qutluqshah Khatun and a son-in-law to [[Tekuder]], while Qurumshi's father Alinaq Noyan was also a son-in-law of Tekuder.<ref name=\":4\" /> 40.000 strong rebel army caught Chupan with his two sons and 2000 strong entourage unguarded near Georgia and caused him to flee. Chupan arrived in [[Tabriz]] and later went to Abu Sa'id to report. Hearing news, Ilkhan moved against rebels and met them near Mianeh.\n\nA decisive battle was fought on 20 June 1319 near [[Mianeh, East Azerbaijan|Mianeh]] with Ilkhanate victory. This victory granted young Abu Sa'id the honorific titles of '''Baghatur''' (from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] \"\u0431\u0430\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\", meaning \"hero, warrior\") and '''al-Sultan al-Adil''' (the just Sultan). In total 36 emirs and 7 khatuns, including Amir Toqmaq, Qurumishi, Princess K\u00f6nchek (daughter of [[Tekuder]]), her husband Irinjin and their sons Sheykh Ali and Vafadar were executed while Qurumushi's son Abdurrahman fled to \u00d6zbeg.<ref name=\":4\" /> Chupan subsequently was given hand of [[Sati Beg]], sister of Abu Sa'id on 6 September 1319, thus growing his family's power greatly. His sons [[Timurtash]], [[Shaikh Mahmoud|Shaikh Mahmud]], [[Hassan (Chupanids)|Hasan]] and [[Demasq Kaja]] were given governorships of [[Anatolia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] respectively. \n\n=== Chupanid rebellion ===\nHowever, Timurtash rose in rebellion in 1322, claiming to be [[Mahdi]]. Chupan went to obtain his surrender personally and even managed to get reappointment to the post by Abu Sa'id. Abu Sa'id sometime fell in love with [[Baghdad Khatun]], one of emir Chupan's daughters. The emir's efforts to keep Abu Sa'id from marrying his daughter, who was still married to [[Hasan Buzurg]] (another powerful kingmaker of the era), did not help the situation. Abu Said approached Chupan in 1325, claiming her unsuccessfully. Chupan sent his daughter and son-in-law to [[Karabakh]] instead while himself went against \u00d6zbeg and [[Tarmashirin]] who invaded Azerbaijan and Khorasan respectively. Using opportunity, on 25 August 1327, Abu Sa'id had one of Chupan's sons, [[Demasq Kaja]], killed, apparently for his activities with a former concubine of \u00d6ljait\u00fc's.<ref name=\":2\" /> Hearing this, Chupan marched against Abu Sa'id seeking revenge. But many emirs including Muhammad Beg, uncle of Abu Sa'id deserted him near [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], taking 30.000 soldier with them, leaving Chupan no choice but to retreat to [[Herat]]. However he was soon strangled to death by [[Kart dynasty|Kartid]] ruler [[Ghiyath-uddin ibn Rukn-uddin|Ghiyath-uddin]] under orders of Abu Sa'id in 1327. His daughter soon forced to divorce Hasan Buzurg and marry Abu Sa'id. In compensation, Hasan was awarded former post of Chupan, rising to be new commander-in-chief of Ilkhanid army. \n\n== Later years ==\nNow ruling personally, Abu Sa'id invited [[Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din|Ghiyas al-Din]], son of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]] to be his vizier.

However Ghiyas al-Din's enforcement of central authority didn't coincide with other amirs' plans. Narin Taghai left his post in 1329 to kill Ghiyas al-Din. He was aided by emirs Ali Padshah and Misr Khwaja. Narin Taghay was executed in September<ref name=\":2\" /> or 29 July 1329<ref name=\":3\" />, ending another serious threat. Later [[Hasan Buzurg]] too was accused of treason with [[Baghdad Khatun]] in 1332 but reinstated as governor of Anatolia later.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, Abu Sa'id divorced from Baghdad and married to her niece [[Dilshad Khatun]] in 1333.\n\nIn 1334, Abu Sa'id appointed Amir Musaffar Inaq as governor of [[Shiraz]] to the resentment of Sharaf al-Din Mahmudshah Inju, founder of [[Injuids|Injuid dynasty]], who was ruling [[Fars Province|Fars]] region for a while since Chupan's death. He pursued Musaffar to Abu Sa'id's tent, accidentally making attempt on his life. Mahmudshah's rebellious act got him imprisoned. \n\n== Foreign relations ==\nAbu Sa'id signed a commercial treaty with Venice in 1320, while also granting them to establish oratories throught the empire. He also improved relations with [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mameluke Egypt]] same year, signing a treaty. He is also known to have corresponded with [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad b. Tughluq]] of [[Delhi Sultanate]]. \n\n== Death ==\nAbu Sa'id had to face another invasion by [[\u00d6z Beg Khan|\u00d6zbeg]] in 1335 and left to face him, but died on his way in [[Karabakh]], on night of 30 November to 1 December 1335. His body was taken to Soltaniyeh and buried there. According to Ibn Battuta, he was poisoned by [[Baghdad Khatun]] on grounds of jealousy.<ref name=\":2\" />He may have been a victim to [[Black Death]] as well.<ref>Continuity and Change in Medieval Persia By Ann K. S. Lambton</ref>\n\nIn consequence of which, Abu Sa'id died without an heir or an appointed successor, thus leaving the Ilkhanate vulnerable, leading to clashes of the major families, such as the [[Chupanids]], the [[Jalayirid]]s, and new movements like the [[Sarbadars]]. On his return to Persia, the great voyager [[Ibn Battuta]] was amazed to discover that the realm which had seemed to be so mighty only twenty years before, had dissolved so quickly. The Ilkhanate lost cohesion after the death of Abu Sa'id, and that of his successor, [[Arpa Ke'un]], becoming a plethora of little kingdoms run by [[Mongols]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[History of Iran|Persians]].\n\n== Viziers ==\n\n* [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (1317)\n* Taj Al-Din Ali Shah (1317-1323)\n* Rukn al-Din Sa'in (1323-1327)\n* [[Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din]] (1327-1335)\n\n==Family==\n;Consorts\n\nAbu Sa'id married six times from different clans including [[Borjigin]], [[Oirats|Oirat]] and [[Taichiud|Suldus]]:\n*[[Uljay Qutlugh Khatun]] (m. 5 July 1317), daughter of [[Ghazan]] and [[Buluqhan Khatun|Bulughan Khatun]], and widow of his elder brother Bastam;\n*[[Baghdad Khatun]] (m. 1327 \u2013 div. 1333, executed 16 December 1336), daughter of Amir [[Chupan]], and former wife of [[Hasan Buzurg]];\n*Malika Khatun, daughter of Tuq b.

Abu Sa'id was forced to send Amir Husayn Jalayir to face Yasa'ur and while himself marched against \u00d6zbeg. \u00d6zbeg was defeated shortly thanks to reinforcements by Chupan, while Yasa'ur was killed by [[Kebek]] in 1320. Several amirs didn't come to aid of Abu Sa'id, therefore they were subject to punishment by Chupan. Yet another revolt started in 1319, this time by [[Keraites|Keraite]] emirs Irinjin, a former governor of [[Diyar Bakr]] and Qurumishi, governor of Georgia who were among the amirs rebuked by Chupan. Qurumishi and Irinjin were related in addition to both being from Keraite tribe - Irinjin was father of \u00d6ljait\u00fc's widow Qutluqshah Khatun and a son-in-law to [[Tekuder]], while Qurumshi's father Alinaq Noyan was also a son-in-law of Tekuder.<ref name=\":4\" /> 40.000 strong rebel army caught Chupan with his two sons and 2000 strong entourage unguarded near Georgia and caused him to flee. Chupan arrived in [[Tabriz]] and later went to Abu Sa'id to report. Hearing news, Ilkhan moved against rebels and met them near Mianeh.\n\nA decisive battle was fought on 20 June 1319 near [[Mianeh, East Azerbaijan|Mianeh]] with Ilkhanate victory. This victory granted young Abu Sa'id the honorific titles of '''Baghatur''' (from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] \"\u0431\u0430\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\", meaning \"hero, warrior\") and '''al-Sultan al-Adil''' (the just Sultan). In total 36 emirs and 7 khatuns, including Amir Toqmaq, Qurumishi, Princess K\u00f6nchek (daughter of [[Tekuder]]), her husband Irinjin and their sons Sheykh Ali and Vafadar were executed while Qurumushi's son Abdurrahman fled to \u00d6zbeg.<ref name=\":4\" /> Chupan subsequently was given hand of [[Sati Beg]], sister of Abu Sa'id on 6 September 1319, thus growing his family's power greatly. His sons [[Timurtash]], [[Shaikh Mahmoud|Shaikh Mahmud]], [[Hassan (Chupanids)|Hasan]] and [[Demasq Kaja]] were given governorships of [[Anatolia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] respectively. \n\n=== Chupanid rebellion ===\nHowever, Timurtash rose in rebellion in 1322, claiming to be [[Mahdi]]. Chupan went to obtain his surrender personally and even managed to get reappointment to the post by Abu Sa'id. Abu Sa'id sometime fell in love with [[Baghdad Khatun]], one of emir Chupan's daughters. The emir's efforts to keep Abu Sa'id from marrying his daughter, who was still married to [[Hasan Buzurg]] (another powerful kingmaker of the era), did not help the situation. Abu Said approached Chupan in 1325, claiming her unsuccessfully. Chupan sent his daughter and son-in-law to [[Karabakh]] instead while himself went against \u00d6zbeg and [[Tarmashirin]] who invaded Azerbaijan and Khorasan respectively. Using opportunity, on 25 August 1327, Abu Sa'id had one of Chupan's sons, [[Demasq Kaja]], killed, apparently for his activities with a former concubine of \u00d6ljait\u00fc's.<ref name=\":2\" /> Hearing this, Chupan marched against Abu Sa'id seeking revenge. But many emirs including Muhammad Beg, uncle of Abu Sa'id deserted him near [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], taking 30.000 soldier with them, leaving Chupan no choice but to retreat to [[Herat]]. However he was soon strangled to death by [[Kart dynasty|Kartid]] ruler [[Ghiyath-uddin ibn Rukn-uddin|Ghiyath-uddin]] under orders of Abu Sa'id in 1327. His daughter soon forced to divorce Hasan Buzurg and marry Abu Sa'id. In compensation, Hasan was awarded former post of Chupan, rising to be new commander-in-chief of Ilkhanid army. \n\n== Later years ==\nNow ruling personally, Abu Sa'id invited [[Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din|Ghiyas al-Din]], son of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]] to be his vizier. Narin Taghai (a nephew of [[Taghachar]] and grandson of [[Kitbuqa]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Melville|first=Charles|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XOVtAAAAMAAJ|title=The Fall of Amir Chupan and the Decline of the Ilkhanate, 1327-37: A Decade of Discord in Mongol Iran|date=1999|publisher=Indiana University, Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies|language=en}}</ref>) who was responsible for Chupan's downfall<ref name=\":0\" /> and Abu Sa'id's uncle Ali Padshah were granted governorates of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and [[Baghdad]] respectively. However Ghiyas al-Din's enforcement of central authority didn't coincide with other amirs' plans. Narin Taghai left his post in 1329 to kill Ghiyas al-Din. He was aided by emirs Ali Padshah and Misr Khwaja. Narin Taghay was executed in September<ref name=\":2\" /> or 29 July 1329<ref name=\":3\" />, ending another serious threat. Later [[Hasan Buzurg]] too was accused of treason with [[Baghdad Khatun]] in 1332 but reinstated as governor of Anatolia later.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, Abu Sa'id divorced from Baghdad and married to her niece [[Dilshad Khatun]] in 1333.\n\nIn 1334, Abu Sa'id appointed Amir Musaffar Inaq as governor of [[Shiraz]] to the resentment of Sharaf al-Din Mahmudshah Inju, founder of [[Injuids|Injuid dynasty]], who was ruling [[Fars Province|Fars]] region for a while since Chupan's death. He pursued Musaffar to Abu Sa'id's tent, accidentally making attempt on his life. Mahmudshah's rebellious act got him imprisoned. \n\n== Foreign relations ==\nAbu Sa'id signed a commercial treaty with Venice in 1320, while also granting them to establish oratories throught the empire. He also improved relations with [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mameluke Egypt]] same year, signing a treaty. He is also known to have corresponded with [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad b. Tughluq]] of [[Delhi Sultanate]]. \n\n== Death ==\nAbu Sa'id had to face another invasion by [[\u00d6z Beg Khan|\u00d6zbeg]] in 1335 and left to face him, but died on his way in [[Karabakh]], on night of 30 November to 1 December 1335. His body was taken to Soltaniyeh and buried there. According to Ibn Battuta, he was poisoned by [[Baghdad Khatun]] on grounds of jealousy.<ref name=\":2\" />He may have been a victim to [[Black Death]] as well.<ref>Continuity and Change in Medieval Persia By Ann K. S. Lambton</ref>\n\nIn consequence of which, Abu Sa'id died without an heir or an appointed successor, thus leaving the Ilkhanate vulnerable, leading to clashes of the major families, such as the [[Chupanids]], the [[Jalayirid]]s, and new movements like the [[Sarbadars]]. On his return to Persia, the great voyager [[Ibn Battuta]] was amazed to discover that the realm which had seemed to be so mighty only twenty years before, had dissolved so quickly. The Ilkhanate lost cohesion after the death of Abu Sa'id, and that of his successor, [[Arpa Ke'un]], becoming a plethora of little kingdoms run by [[Mongols]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[History of Iran|Persians]].\n\n== Viziers ==\n\n* [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (1317)\n* Taj Al-Din Ali Shah (1317-1323)\n* Rukn al-Din Sa'in (1323-1327)\n* [[Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din]] (1327-1335)\n\n==Family==\n;Consorts\n\nAbu Sa'id married six times from different clans including [[Borjigin]], [[Oirats|Oirat]] and [[Taichiud|Suldus]]:\n*[[Uljay Qutlugh Khatun]] (m. 5 July 1317), daughter of [[Ghazan]] and [[Buluqhan Khatun|Bulughan Khatun]], and widow of his elder brother Bastam;\n*[[Baghdad Khatun]] (m. 1327 \u2013 div. 1333, executed 16 December 1336), daughter of Amir [[Chupan]], and former wife of [[Hasan Buzurg]];\n*Malika Khatun, daughter of Tuq b.

Founded in the suburb of [[North Melbourne]] in 1869, it is based at its traditional home ground, [[Arden Street Oval]], and currently plays its home matches at both the nearby [[Docklands Stadium]] and [[Blundstone Arena]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].\n\nThe club's mascot is a grey [https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/2018-05-03/meet-ruby kangaroo donning the club uniform], and its use dates from the mid-20th century. The club is also unofficially known as \"The Shinboners\", a term which dates back to its 19th-century abattoir-worker origins. The club's motto is ''Victoria amat curam'', Latin for \"Victory Demands Dedication\". Aside from their representation in the AFL, the Kangaroos also field teams in the following competitions; [[AFL Women's]], [[VFL Women's]] and [[Victorian Football League]].\n\n==Club history==\n{{quote|In two aspects North Melbourne stands second to none. One is the loyalty of its supporters. The other is the determination to carry on, despite its disadvantages. In the face of adversity, which might well have broken the spirit of most men, we find that from the earliest days there were always enthusiasts to fight for North Melbourne.|''The Australasian'', 15 June 1940.}}\n\n===Formative years===\n[[File:Jameshenrygardiner.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Henry Gardiner]]. Founding father of the NMFC.]]\n\nNorth Melbourne Football Club was founded in [[North Melbourne]] in 1869 by local cricketers desiring to keep fit over the winter months. One thought is that the club was connected to the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club, now the St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, whose colours \u2013 blue and white \u2013 are reflected in the club's colours today.<ref>Rickard, John, An assemblage of decent men and women : a history of the Anglican parish of St Mary's North Melbourne 1853\u20132000. / John Rickard St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, North Melbourne, Vic. :  2008</ref> The association between the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club and the establishment of the North Melbourne Football Club is believed to have been an informal gathering to play some competitive sport. Information on the club's first ever match is limited, but it is known that it took place in [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]], which also served as the club's home ground until 1882. The ball used in the match was purchased by a local resident called Tom Jacks, who sold some roofing iron to pay for it.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[James Henry Gardiner]] is considered the founder of the club. He continued an active role with North Melbourne until his death in 1921.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nRegular premiership matches of Australian Football commenced in Victoria in 1870. Although North Melbourne was a part of this, it was classed as a \"junior club\". ''The Australasian'' noted them as being \"one of the best of many junior clubs\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article137583335|title=FOOTBALL.|date=1873-11-01|work=Australasian (Melbourne, Vic. : 1864 - 1946)|access-date=2020-04-03|pages=11}}</ref>\n\nThe club continued to develop, graduating to senior ranks in 1874, finishing 4th. Along with the promotion, the club adopted its first uniform of blue and white horizontal stripes.<ref name=\"Timetoast 2019\">{{cite web |title=The evolution of the football jumper - North Melbourne Football Club 1874 |website=Timetoast |date=4 May 2019 |url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-evolution-of-the-football-jumper-north-melbourne-football-club-1874-2015 |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1876, North Melbourne disbanded, and many of its player and members joined [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park]],<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=North Melbourne Advertiser |location=North Melbourne, VIC |title=Football |author=Tonball |page=3 |date=26 May 1876}}</ref> giving the club such a strong North Melbourne character that many described it as \"Albert-park ''cum'' North Melbourne\". In 1877, the club was re-established as a stand-alone club under the new name of \"Hotham\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Leader |location=Melbourne, VIC |title=Football Notes |author=Nomad |date=9 July 1877 |page=12}}</ref>\n\n===Association years===\n[[File:NMFCchart.png|thumb|Chart showing the progress of North Melbourne F.C. through the VFA and V/AFL]]\n\nFootball took a giant step forward in 1877, with the formation of Victoria's first colonial football league, the VFA. Hotham were prime movers in establishing this league and were afforded a place in light of their previous contributions to Australian Football.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe 1880s marked the emergence of the modern identity we now associate with North today. In 1882, the club amalgamated with the Hotham Cricket Club and moved into the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve (Arden St Oval), which remains the home of the club today. The joint venture was aimed at affecting improvements at the Hotham Cricket Ground, which was the name of the Reserve at the time. Four years later the club adopted the traditional uniform of blue and white vertical stripes at the insistence of the VFA, who wanted a visible contrast between Geelong's and Hotham's uniforms. The third significant development occurred in 1888 with the club returning to its original name of the North Melbourne Football Club. This followed the name of the local area reverting from Hotham to North Melbourne.\n\nThe 1880s saw the club develop a penchant for inter-colonial travel with trips to Tasmania (1881/1887) and South Australia (1889). Hotham also found itself well represented at the first ever inter-colonial representative game in 1879 with four players from the club gaining selection for Victoria.\n\n===Disregarded by the VFL===\n[[File:Nmfc1903.jpg|300px|thumb|[[1903 VFA season|\"The Inaugurals\"]]. The side that brought North premiership glory after 34 years of wait. To commemorate the achievement, club President [[George Prendergast|G/M Prendergast]] presented the 26 players and head trainer with a gold medal at the club's general meeting that year.]]\n\nThe VFA grew to 13 senior clubs in the 1890s. Led by Geelong and Essendon, the largest clubs of the VFA formed their own break away league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), in 1896. Despite finishing 6th in 1896, North Melbourne was not invited to the breakaway competition. The main reasons for being excluded were:\n* North had not won a premiership yet, and thus was not considered a powerful club\n* The industrialisation of the locality had drained the club's income streams\n* The club had a strong reputation for hooliganism from their fans\n* There was a lot of bad blood between Collingwood and North following a torrid engagement in the previous season\n* Essendon felt threatened by the proximity of North Melbourne\n* A court case against the North Melbourne Cricket Club had damaged the Football Club's status\n\nNorth continued on in the depleted VFA, emerging as a powerhouse, finishing 2nd in 1897, 1898 and 1899. In 1903, after 34 years of competing, the club won its first premiership, defeating Richmond in the final. The club became back to back premiers in 1904 after Richmond [[1904 VFA Grand Final|forfeited the grand final]] due to the appointment of an umpire whose performance when the two teams met earlier in the year was severely criticised by Richmond players and officials.<ref name=\"Atkinson\">{{cite book |last=Atkinson |first=Graeme |title=3AW Book of Footy Records |year=1989 |publisher=Magistra Publishing Company Pty Ltd |location=South Melbourne |isbn=1-86321-009-1 |pages=278}}.</ref>\n\nNorth merged with fellow VFA football club West Melbourne in 1907, which at the time had lost its home ground. The joint venture saw a chance of promotion, and the club applied for admission to the more prestigious VFL in 1908, but Richmond and University were admitted instead. North was kicked out of the VFA during the 1907/08 offseason as a result of applying to join the VFL,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=North Melbourne club |date=4 April 1908 |page=15 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> before the local community reestablished the North Melbourne Football Club under a new committee, successfully enabling the club to play in the VFA in the 1908 season.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=Football \u2013 the Victorian Association |date=18 April 1908 |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Invincibles\"===\nThe reformation of the Club necessitated a massive clean out of the team, leaving only two players remaining from the previous season. The 1910 season was marked by one of the most sensational transfers in Victorian football history, when Andy Curran masterminded the clearance of Carlton's famed \"Big Four\" of 'Mallee' Johnson, [[Fred Jinks]], [[Charlie Hammond]] and Frank 'Silver' Caine to North Melbourne. These signings secured the Northerners' third premiership in 1910.\n[[File:SBarkerNMelb.jpg|125px|thumb|[[Syd Barker, Sr.]], club legend and star ruckman of \"The Invincibles\" era.]]\nThe 1912 finals series was one of the most amazing ever, with the semi-final having to be played three times, after North and Brunswick drew twice. North was eventually victorious and moved on to the final, but lost the game by a mere four points with the last kick of the day.\n\nThe next few years were punctuated by \"The Invincibles\". In the Northerners' most illustrious period ever, the club went undefeated from 1914 to 1919, collecting premierships in 1914, 1915 and 1918 \u2013 the league was in recess in 1916 and 1917 due to [[World War I]]. As well as this, the club won the championship in both 1915 and 1918 for finishing on top of the ladder, and accounted for VFL side St Kilda comfortably. During this period the club won 58 consecutive matches including 49 successive premiership matches, a record that has remained unmatched in Association or League history since.\n\nDespite being rejected from the VFL in both 1896 and 1907, North persisted in trying to gain admission into the League. On 30 June 1921, North told its players it would disband and try to gain entry to the VFL by the 'back-door'. Essendon League Football Club had lost its playing ground at East Melbourne and had decided to acquire the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve as a new playing ground. North accepted their proposal in the idea that the clubs would amalgamate. All of North's players were urged to join the [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon League Club]] to help facilitate the amalgamation. The amalgamation was foiled when some members of the VFA launched a successful legal challenge.<ref name=\"12AugustArgus\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |date=12 August 1921 |title=North Melbourne ground |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> As a result, the Essendon League Club moved instead to the Essendon Oval, replacing the ground's original occupants, [[Essendon Association Football Club|Essendon Association]].\n\nNorth was now without a playing team and the Essendon Association Club was now without a ground, so as a matter of convenience the two clubs amalgamated so they could compete in the 1922 season. As it had after the merger with West Melbourne, North once again managed to avert its destruction.\n\n===Entering the VFL===\n\nAfter three attempts, 29 years of waiting and numerous other applications to enter the VFL, finally North was rewarded for its persistence with admittance to the League in 1925, along with Footscray and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. Even then, the opportunity was almost lost as the League delegates debated into the early hours of the morning on which clubs should be invited to join the intake. It was only after much deliberation that North Melbourne's name was eventually substituted for [[Prahran FC|Prahran's]] making North \"the lucky side\" of the invitees that included Footscray and Hawthorn. North Melbourne was forced to change its uniform to avoid a clash when it joined the VFL.\n\nNorth Melbourne were cellar dwellers for its first twenty-five years of [[Australian Football League|VFL]] membership and struggled to win matches in the superior VFL competition, but by the late 1940s had developed a strong list and significant supporter base. In 1949 North secured the VFL Minor Premiership, finishing top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season with 14 wins and 5 losses. They failed to make the Grand Final that year (eventually won by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]), but in 1950 they did reach the final, defeated by a more efficient Essendon. It was in this year that the club adopted the \"Kangaroos\" mascot.<ref>Gerard Dowling, \"North Melbourne Football Club\", in Andrew Brown-May and [[Shurlee Swain]], ''The Encyclopedia of Melbourne'', Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2005, p.511.</ref>\n[[File:Gasometer North Melbourne 1928.jpg|thumb|North Melbourne and Arden St Oval after admission to the VFL. c. 1928]]\n\nIn February 1965, North Melbourne [[1965 VFA season#North Melbourne's move to Coburg Oval|moved its playing and training base]] from the Arden Street Oval to [[Coburg City Oval|Coburg Oval]], signing a seven-year lease with the [[City of Coburg]]<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=30 March 1965 |title=North gets lease}}</ref> after initially negotiating long-term leases for up to 40 years.<ref name=\"sun3nov\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=34 |author= |date=3 November 1964 |title=North can have a new oval}}</ref> The club came to an arrangement to merge with the VFA's [[Coburg Football Club]], whom it was displacing from the ground;<ref name=\"sun9dec\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |pages=63\u201364 |author=Scot Palmer |date=9 December 1964 |title=Coburg, North merger}}</ref> fourteen Coburg committeemen joined the North Melbourne committee, but the merger was never completed after Coburg established a rival committee which remained loyal to the VFA.<ref name=\"sun6feb\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=56 |author= |date=6 February 1965 |title=Coburg to stay in Association}}</ref> The lease at Coburg lasted only eight months; the Coburg council was hesitant to build a new grandstand without the security of a long-term lease, and neither party made the returns they expected, so it was terminated by mutual agreement in September 1965 and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=28 September 1965 |title=Coburg to drop stand?}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=52 |author= |date=29 September 1965 |title=North to quit Coburg}}</ref>\n\nOnfield, the 1950s and 1960s were lean years for North Melbourne, though the club did secure two consecutive Night Premierships in 1965 and 1966. [[Allen Aylett]] was a brilliant player in the late 1950s and early 1960s (and captain between 1961 and 1964), as was [[Noel Teasdale]], who lost the [[Brownlow Medal]] on a countback in 1965 (he was later awarded a retrospective medal when the counting system was amended).\n\n===Golden era===\nIn the late 1960s, under the leadership of [[Allen Aylett]], North Melbourne began its climb to supremacy. As part of a major recruitment drive North secured the services of several big-name stars, including [[Barry Davis (footballer)|Barry Davis]] from [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Doug Wade]] from [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], John Rantall from [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]], and Barry Cable from [[Perth Football Club|Perth]]. In a major coup, the great [[Ron Barassi]] was appointed coach in 1973. Barrassi reversed the club's playing fortunes, taking a struggling team that was once regarded as the traditional cellar dwellers of the competition through to a golden era of success that transformed North Melbourne into one of the powerhouses of the VFL. Barassi took North to a Grand Final (losing to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] by 41 points) in 1974 and brought success in his 1975 and 1977 seasons. North made five consecutive Grand Finals from 1974\u20131978)<ref name=\"GF\" />{{rp|209}} and defeated [[Norwood Football Club|Norwood]] in the 1975 national championship and thus declared [[Champions of Australia]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#FFFFFF; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1975 VFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Hawthorn ||  9  ||  13  ||  67\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  North Melbourne|| '''19''' ||'''8''' || '''122'''\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n|colspan=\"3\"| Crowd: 110,551<ref name=\"Lovett 2010 669\">{{harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=669}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn 1973 and 1974, North's wingman [[Keith Greig]] (recruited from Brunswick Football Club, Victoria) won consecutive [[Brownlow Medal]]s; forward [[Malcolm Blight]] (recruited from Woodville Football Club, South Australia) then won the award in 1978.

THE MERGER THAT NEVER GOT ACROSS THE LINE. ''Sunday Age'', 13 July, p. 14.<br /></ref>however, Fitzroy ultimately merged with the [[Brisbane Bears]] instead.\n\nSeeking new markets and greater financial security in an increasingly corporatized [[Australian Football League|AFL]] environment, the title \"North Melbourne\" was officially dropped from the logo in 1999, from which time the team played only as the \"Kangaroos\". During the successful 1999 season, North Melbourne played home games in Sydney with a view of becoming a second team in [[New South Wales]]; however, the experiment was not successful, with crowds averaging only 12,000.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Kangaroos team huddle.jpg|thumb|A Kangaroos quarter time team huddle at the MCG in 2006]][[File:Glenn archer.jpg|thumb|In 2005 dual-premiership player and Norm Smith Medallist  [[Glenn Archer]] was named \"Shinboner of the Century\" as the player who most embodies the North Melbourne spirit.]]\nThe 21st century did not begin well for North Melbourne. Its decade-long onfield potency was in decline, questions were raised about its financial position and long-term sustainability. Furthermore, three of the people most important to the club's success in the 1990s left the club under acrimonious circumstances: CEO [[Greg Miller (Australian footballer)|Greg Miller]] left the club, captain Wayne Carey left prior to the 2002 season following an extramarital affair with the wife of teammate and vice captain [[Anthony Stevens]], coach [[Denis Pagan]] was lured to Carlton at the end of 2002.

In what is regarded as one of the most inspirational stories of Australian rules football and Australian sport in general, McCartney successfully returned to action on 6 June 2003 against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at Docklands Stadium. Playing at full forward, he took a mark in the final quarter, scored a goal from the resulting set shot and set up Leigh Harding's winning goal with two minutes remaining. McCartney retired immediately after the game, citing that his recovery had left him spent, and he was chaired from the ground. McCartney wore the numbers \"88\" and \"202\" on the front of his long-sleeved {{not a typo|guernsey}} for the match, signifying the Australian and total number of victims of the Bali bombings, while many in the crowd bore signs reading \"Bali 88/202\".\n\nOnfield, the club reached the elimination finals in 2002 and 2005, but otherwise failed to reach the finals from 2001 until 2006.\nAfter two seasons of finals North Melbourne dropped to 13th in 2009, and coach Dean Laidley announced his resignation with Darren Crocker acting as caretaker coach for the rest of the season, to eventually be replaced by ex-Brisbane Lions premiership player and Collingwood assistant coach [[Brad Scott (Australian footballer)|Brad Scott]]. A$15&nbsp;million redevelopment of the Arden Street, which had started in 2006, was completed in 2009, giving the club top-class training facilities.\n\n===Brad Scott era===\nNorth Melbourne struggled in its first two years under [[Brad Scott (Australian footballer)|Brad Scott]], finishing 9th in both 2010 and 2011. In 2012, the club returned to the finals for the first time since 2008, finishing the season in 8th place, but would go down to the [[West Coast Eagles]] by 96 points in an elimination final. In 2012, the club began a three-year deal to play two games each year at [[Blundstone Arena]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]. The club finished 10th in 2013 in a season full of close losses.

The origins of the nickname are unknown but it may have had something to do with the club's reputation for targeting the shinbones of opposition players, or to do with local butchers who showed their support for North by dressing up beef leg-bones in the club colours.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} By 1926, the club was known as the \"Blue Birds\", but this nickname did not last.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It was Phonse Tobin, North president from 1953 to 1956, who oversaw the club adopting the kangaroo emblem in 1954; Tobin found the image of a shinbone unsavoury and wanted the club to have a mascot it could show with pride. In selecting a new name, he wanted something characteristically Australian and was inspired by a large kangaroo he saw on display outside a city store.<ref name=\"Heraldsun.com.au\">{{cite web | title=Subscribe to the Herald Sun for exclusive stories | website=Heraldsun.com.au | url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/what-your-footy-team-was-once-called-and-how-it-got-its-name/news-story/ebc68823888ac0000580d313422aca4c | access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Watson 2011 p. 23\">{{cite book | last=Watson | first=T. | title=Malcolm Blight | publisher=Hardie Grant Books | series=EBL ebooks online | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-74273-663-1 | url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=5pU9mmDQRwYC&pg=PT23 | access-date=4 May 2019 | page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe official name of the club is North Melbourne, but the club has gone under several other aliases over the years.

In 1998 the club proposed changing its name to the \"Northern Kangaroos\", but it was rejected by the AFL. From 1999 to 2007, the club traded without much success as \"The Kangaroos\" in a bid to increase its appeal nationally; this decision was reversed at the end of 2007 and the club has again reverted to the name \"North Melbourne\".<ref name=\"Navaratnam 2016\">{{cite web | last=Navaratnam | first=Dinny | title=Members force change to North's kangaroo logo | website=afl.com.au | date=4 November 2016 | url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-11-04/north-melbourne-unveils-new-fierce-roo-logo | access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Club song===\n\"Join in the Chorus\" is the official anthem of the North Melbourne Football Club.

It is also played before every match.\n\n\"Join in the Chorus\" is believed to be the oldest club anthem of any AFL club and has been associated with North from its early VFA days. The preamble of the song originates from a score of a theatre musical called ''Australia: Heart to Heart and Hand to Hand'', written by Toso Taylor in the 1890s in pre-federation Australia.<ref name=\"H2H\">{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.mus-an4784438 |title=Australia or Heart to heart and hand to hand}}</ref> The second verse is unknown in origin and was presumably added later by members of the club when the song was chosen. The chorus was appropriated from a song written and performed by Scottish musician [[Harry Lauder]]. The recording currently used by the club was performed by the Fable Singers in April 1972 and only includes the choruses.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-tunes-to-remember-20100723-10nyh.html AFL Tunes to Remember], ''The Age'', 23 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe song has a strong Victorian heritage and has been traditionally sung by the Victorian State Football and Victorian Cricket teams respectively. The lyrics have occasionally been changed, including updating the year in the song (e.g. \"North Melbourne will be premiers in 1993\"), or to remove the words \"North Melbourne\" during the period when the club was competing only as the  Kangaroos.\n\nFor the 2015 premiership season, [[You Am I]]'s lead singer, [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]], a North Melbourne supporter, announced that he would assist in an updated version of the song including the two verses.

Members of the club serve as the guarantees of capital and have full voting rights at AGMs to elect directors to the club's board.\n\nThe club's board of directors has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure of the terms of the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune to a lot of the in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.\n\nNorth Melbourne is unique in its structure, because from 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was floated in 1986 through a membership vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged to buy into the club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3&nbsp;million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade.\n\nIn 1991, the [[John Elliott (businessman)|John Elliott]]-led [[Carlton Football Club]] attempted a hostile take over North Melbourne by purchasing a large parcel of shares formerly owned by Bob Ansett. The Blues acquired 20 per cent of the capital but that stake was eventually bought back by John Magowan, the former head of Merrill Lynch Australia, in 2001. The resulting melodrama saw the formation of B-Class shareholders who had the effective power of veto over any attempt to merge or relocate the club.\n\nFurther takeover attempts were made in the first decade of the 21st century by the [[Southport Sharks]]. Then chairman Allan Aylett knocked back a proposal from the Sharks that would have seen them gain a majority stake in the club in exchange for an injection of capital. In early 2006, another proposal from Sharks to underwrite the Kangaroos' games on the Gold Coast, in exchange for a slice of the shareholder structure at the club was knocked back after AFL intervention.\n\nDue to an [[Australian Taxation Office]] ruling in 2006, the club proposed a shareholder restructure that would have seen the B Class shareholders power reduced significantly and some voting rights returned to members. This was done to avoid extraordinary taxes being placed on the club, but the move was blocked in December by Bob Ansett and his proxies who feared that the restructure would make the club vulnerable to further takeover bids.\n\nOn 28 February 2007, another meeting was called to resolve the shareholder issue. A motion was passed that would return see some voting rights return to members and stop any future tax increments.\n\nIn April 2007 it was revealed the AFL was attempting to buy out the shareholders of the club in a bid to gain full ownership, and force a relocation of the club to the Gold Coast.\n\nDuring October 2007, a group called [[We Are North Melbourne]] emerged and launched a public campaign, calling for ordinary members to be given the final say on the relocation issue. While the group became synonymous with the push to keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club's shareholder structure wound-up and control returned to ordinary members.\n\nNorth Melbourne reverted to public company in November 2008. A moratorium was passed at an extraordinary general meeting that will allow James Brayshaw's board to serve unopposed until 2010, so as to allow his ticket the maximum time to enact their policies to make the North Melbourne Football Club financially viable.\n\nOn 20 November 2016, former Aussie Rules footballer and Football Federation Australia chairman [[Ben Buckley]] replaced James Brayshaw as the new chairman of the club.\n\n===Sponsorship===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:75%;\"\n|-\n!

North supporters have long been bitter with [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] for excluding them from the VFL, and have blamed that for their small supporter base in comparison to Essendon's. North's first [[VFL Grand Final]] was against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in [[1950 VFL Grand Final|1950]]. The rivalry was reignited in the 90s as both teams were constantly in premiership contention. In 1998, following comments by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] coach labelling Kangaroos executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson \"marshmallows\", a reference to their softness, North supporters threw marshmallows at Sheedy after the opening Qualifying Final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sheeds still baiting the crowd on marshmallow anniversary |url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-06-30/marshmallow-moments-not-forgotten |website=AFL Website |accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> In 2014 North Melbourne versed Essendon in Elimination Final 2 Essendon was leading by 30 odd points then North came back to win by 12 points<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2014/24/nmfc-v-ess</ref>\n\n'''Hawthorn'''{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} \u2013 North and Hawthorn have a fierce rivalry that dates back to the 1970s when they played off against each other in three Grand Finals in the space of four years. From 1974 to 1978 the two clubs played against each other in ten finals, and took each other on for the Australian Championship in Adelaide in 1976. During the 1980s Hawthorn dominated North, and during the 90s the results were reversed with North dominating Hawthorn.\nNorth Melbourne defeated Hawthorn in the 1975 Grand Final by 55 points. However, Hawthorn defeated North Melbourne in the 1976 Grand Final by 30 points and in the 1978 Grand Final by 18 points.\nThe rivalry re-ignited in 2014 following a choking incident involving [[Brian Lake]] having North Melbourne forward [[Drew Petrie]] in a choking hold during a clash between the two sides at [[Docklands Stadium]] and reached fever pitch in 2015 following several fights including an all in during the first term of their round 5 clash.\n\n===Minor===\n'''Collingwood''' \u2013 North and Collingwood have a small kind of rivalry between them. As they drew in the [[1977 VFL Grand Final|1977 Grand Final]], which North went on to win in the replay by 27 points.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/afl-grand-final-countdown-no2-North-melbourne-v-collingwood-1977/story-e6frf3e3-1225778963326 AFL grand final countdown No.2: North Melbourne v Collingwood, 1977]</ref>\nIn 2019 [[North Melbourne]] and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] faced off in Round 15 and the Collingwood banner said \"Kanga, Kanga, Kanga Roo, Roo, Roo The Pies, Pies, Pies Will beat, Beat you\" Instead, North Melbourne Held Collingwood to their lowest score since 1994, and of course after a goal they chanted \"KANGA KANGA KANGA!\"ROO ROO\" To annoy Collingwood Supporters.

In 1965, North Melbourne moved to the [[Coburg City Oval]], which Carlton opposed as an invasion of its own territory: Coburg was located within Carlton's recruiting zone, and was home to about of quarter of Carlton's members at the time.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=66 |author=Rex Pullen |date=5 November 1964 |title=North move to Coburg under fire}}</ref> Later, after North Melbourne was listed on the stock market in 1987, Carlton bought 20% of the shares to become part-owner of the rival club.

This was Port's only loss in the first 12 rounds of [[2014 AFL season|2014]].\n\nPort Adelaide lost their first finals appearance to North Melbourne in 1999 in the qualifying final, and in Port's premiership year of [[2004 AFL season|2004]], North beat Port by 92 points, however, Port beat North Melbourne in both the [[2005 AFL finals series#First Elimination Final (5 vs 8)|2005 Elimination Final]] and [[2007 AFL season#Preliminary Finals|2007 Preliminary Final]] by 87 points. In 2019 North beat Port Adelaide by 86 points to end Port's finals hopes for 2019, restarting the rivalry.\n\n'''Richmond''' \u2013 A rivalry that began as a result of North's loss to Richmond in the 1974 Grand Final, the two sides have shared an on and off rivalry ever since. Both sides since their 1975 preliminary final meeting (which North Melbourne won) have mostly been unsuccessful on the field. The rivalry re-ignited in the 2010s due to the clubs recent on field success and accumulated in a clash during the [[2015 AFL finals series]] which North won by 17 points and was preceded by a provocative banner which read, 'Tigers Don't Win Finals, We Do'.\n\n==Club honour board==\n\n===Honour roll===\n{{Main|North Melbourne Football Club honour roll}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#BDB76B;\"\n!

There was no minimum number of games set for selection. [[Wayne Carey]] was named as captain and [[Denis Pagan]] as coach. The selection panel was Geoff Poulter (journalist), Father Gerard Dowling (club historian), [[Keith McKenzie (Australian footballer)|Keith McKenzie]] (former coach), Lloyd Holyoak (former president), [[Max Ritchie]] (former player and chairman of selectors) and Greg Miller (chief executive).\n\n{{Aussie rules team | title = North Melbourne Team of the Century\n| backpocket1 = [[Glenn Archer]]\n| fullback = [[David Dench]]\n| backpocket2 = [[Mick Martyn (Australian footballer)|Mick Martyn]]\n| halfbackflank1 = [[John Rantall]]\n| centrehalfback = [[Ross Glendinning]]\n| halfbackflank2 = [[Ted Jarrard]]\n| wing1 = [[Keith Greig]]\n| centre = [[Les Foote]]\n| wing2 = [[Laurie Dwyer]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = [[Malcolm Blight]]\n| centrehalfforward = [[Wayne Carey]] (c)\n| halfforwardflank2 = [[Wayne Schimmelbusch]]\n| forwardpocket1 = [[John Dugdale (footballer)|John Dugdale]]\n| fullforward = [[Jock Spencer]]\n| forwardpocket2 = [[Allen Aylett]]\n| ruck = [[Noel Teasdale]]\n| ruckrover = [[Anthony Stevens]]\n| rover = [[Barry Cable]]\n| interchange1 = [[Brent Crosswell]]\n| interchange2 = [[Barry Davis (footballer)|Barry Davis]]\n| interchange3 = [[Peter Steward]]\n| interchange4 = [[Sam Kekovich]]\n| interchange5 = [[Jim Krakouer]]\n| interchange6 = [[Brent Harvey]]\n| emergency1 = [[David King]]\n| emergency2 = [[John Blakey]]\n| emergency3 = [[Wayne Schwass]]\n| emergency4 = [[Gary Dempsey]]\n| emergency5 =\n| emergency6 =\n| coach = [[Denis Pagan]]}}\n\n===Shinboner of the Century===\nOn 18 March 2005, the North Melbourne football club held a special gala dinner entitled the \"North Story\" to celebrate the 80th anniversary of North's admission to the VFL, and the 30th anniversary of the club's first VFL premiership. Over 3500 people attended the historic event held at the [[Royal Exhibition Building]], including almost all surviving North Melbourne players. [[Glenn Archer]] was voted the '''Shinboner of the Century''' by his peers as the player who most represents the 'Shinboner Spirit'. The following players were voted 'Shinboners' of their era:\n\n* [[Les Foote]] \u2013 Shinboner of the early era (1925\u20131950)\n* [[Allen Aylett]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 50s\n* [[Noel Teasdale]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 60s\n* [[Malcolm Blight]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 70s\n* [[Wayne Schimmelbusch]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 80s\n* [[Wayne Carey]] \u2013 Shinboner of the modern era (1990\u20132005)\n\n===150th year celebration===\n\nTo commemorate the 150th year of the founding of the North Melbourne Football Club a 150th Year Celebration was organised for the first weekend of August 2019 which commenced with a Friday Night blockbuster against arch rivals Hawthorn. Starting from 27 points down in the first quarter, the Roos fought back heroically against the Hawks to triumph as 22 point winners, and get the weekend celebrations underway. The following day the Roos VFL side took on Box Hill and similarly won in a heroic performance coming back from 31 points down at three quarter time to win by 2 points with just minutes to spare. To cap off the weekend, a 150th Year Celebration Dinner was held at the [[Melbourne Convention Centre]] where the 150 greatest ever North Melbourne players were announced with a top 10 greatest North Melbourne players announced on the night from the results of an expert panel.\n\n'''Top 10 Greatest North Players'''\n*1 \u2013 Wayne Carey\n*2 \u2013 Keith Greig\n*3 - David Dench\n*4 \u2013 Allen Aylett\n*5 \u2013 Brent Harvey\n*6 \u2013 Malcolm Blight\n*7 \u2013 Wayne Schimmelbusch\n*8 \u2013 Les Foote\n*9 \u2013 Anthony Stevens\n*10 \u2013 Ross Glendinning\n\n===Achievements===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" align=\"center\"| '''Premierships'''\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!Competition\n!Level\n!Wins\n!Years Won\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Seniors||4||[[1975 VFL Grand Final|1975]], [[1977 VFL Grand Final|1977]], [[1996 AFL Grand Final|1996]], [[1999 AFL Grand Final|1999]]\n|-\n|'''[[Victorian Football League|VFA]]'''||Seniors||6||1903, 1904, 1910, 1914, 1915, 1918\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Reserves||7||1947, 1957, 1967, 1978, 1979, 1995, 1996\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Under 19s||7||1946, 1976, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" align=\"center\"| '''Other titles and honours'''\n|-\n|'''[[Championship of Australia]]'''||Seniors||1||[[1975 Championship of Australia|1975]]\n|-\n|'''Australian Football Championships'''||[[AFC Night Series|Night Premiership]]||1||1980\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||[[McClelland Trophy]]||4|| 1976, 1978, 1983, 1998\n|-\n|'''[[VFL Night Series]]'''||Seniors||2||1965, 1966\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|AFL]]'''||[[Australian Football League pre-season competition|Preseason premiership]]||1||1995, 1998\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" align=\"center\"| '''Finishing positions'''\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||[[List of Australian Football League minor premiers|Minor premiership]]||4||1949, 1978, 1983, 1998\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Runners-up||5|| 1950, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1998\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||[[Wooden spoon (award)|Wooden Spoons]]||13||\n1926, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1956, 1961, 1968, 1970, 1972\n|-\n||'''[[Victorian Football League|VFA]]'''||Minor premiership||6||\n1905, 1910, 1914, 1915, 1918, 1919\n|}\n\n===Individual honours===\n{{Main|List of North Melbourne Football Club individual awards and records}}\n\n===Premiership results===\n{{Main|List of North Melbourne Football Club premiership results}}\n\n===Finals results===\n{{Main|List of North Melbourne Football Club finals results}}\n\n===Best and Fairest===\n{{Further|Syd Barker Medal}}\n{{Further|Syd Barker Medal#Harold Henderson Best Club-Man Award}}\n\n===VFL/AFL finishing positions (1925\u2013present)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#BDB76B;\"\n!

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]], and from 1992 to 1999 a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]], and North Melbourne fielded its reserves team in both of these competitions while it was in the VFL/AFL, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for North Melbourne in the lower grade. During that time, the North Melbourne reserves team won seven premierships (1947, 1957, 1967, 1978, 1979, 1995, 1996).\n\nFollowing the demise of the AFL reserves competition, North Melbourne's reserves team was dissolved, and over the following eighteen years the club entered [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliations]] with a range of [[Victorian Football League]] clubs. Under the affiliations, reserves players for North Melbourne play VFL football with one of the affiliated clubs.

the '''Kangaroos''' or less formally the '''Roos''', the '''Kangas''' or '''North''', is an [[Australian rules football]] club that competes in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), the sport's premier competition. Founded in the suburb of [[North Melbourne]] in 1869, it is based at its traditional home ground, [[Arden Street Oval]], and currently plays its home matches at both the nearby [[Docklands Stadium]] and [[Blundstone Arena]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].\n\nThe club's mascot is a grey [https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/2018-05-03/meet-ruby kangaroo donning the club uniform], and its use dates from the mid-20th century. The club is also unofficially known as \"The Shinboners\", a term which dates back to its 19th-century abattoir-worker origins. The club's motto is ''Victoria amat curam'', Latin for \"Victory Demands Dedication\". Aside from their representation in the AFL, the Kangaroos also field teams in the following competitions; [[AFL Women's]], [[VFL Women's]] and [[Victorian Football League]].\n\n==Club history==\n{{quote|In two aspects North Melbourne stands second to none.

Founding father of the NMFC.]]\n\nNorth Melbourne Football Club was founded in [[North Melbourne]] in 1869 by local cricketers desiring to keep fit over the winter months. One thought is that the club was connected to the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club, now the St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, whose colours \u2013 blue and white \u2013 are reflected in the club's colours today.<ref>Rickard, John, An assemblage of decent men and women : a history of the Anglican parish of St Mary's North Melbourne 1853\u20132000. / John Rickard St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, North Melbourne, Vic. :  2008</ref> The association between the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club and the establishment of the North Melbourne Football Club is believed to have been an informal gathering to play some competitive sport. Information on the club's first ever match is limited, but it is known that it took place in [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]], which also served as the club's home ground until 1882. The ball used in the match was purchased by a local resident called Tom Jacks, who sold some roofing iron to pay for it.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[James Henry Gardiner]] is considered the founder of the club. He continued an active role with North Melbourne until his death in 1921.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nRegular premiership matches of Australian Football commenced in Victoria in 1870. Although North Melbourne was a part of this, it was classed as a \"junior club\". ''The Australasian'' noted them as being \"one of the best of many junior clubs\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe club continued to develop, graduating to senior ranks in 1874, finishing 4th. Along with the promotion, the club adopted its first uniform of blue and white horizontal stripes.<ref name=\"Timetoast 2019\">{{cite web |title=The evolution of the football jumper - North Melbourne Football Club 1874 |website=Timetoast |date=4 May 2019 |url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-evolution-of-the-football-jumper-north-melbourne-football-club-1874-2015 |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1876, North Melbourne disbanded, and many of its player and members joined [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park]],<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=North Melbourne Advertiser |location=North Melbourne, VIC |title=Football |author=Tonball |page=3 |date=26 May 1876}}</ref> giving the club such a strong North Melbourne character that many described it as \"Albert-park ''cum'' North Melbourne\". In 1877, the club was re-established as a stand-alone club under the new name of \"Hotham\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Leader |location=Melbourne, VIC |title=Football Notes |author=Nomad |date=9 July 1877 |page=12}}</ref>\n\n===Association years===\n[[File:NMFCchart.png|thumb|Chart showing the progress of North Melbourne F.C. through the VFA and V/AFL]]\n\nFootball took a giant step forward in 1877, with the formation of Victoria's first colonial football league, the VFA. Hotham were prime movers in establishing this league and were afforded a place in light of their previous contributions to Australian Football.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe 1880s marked the emergence of the modern identity we now associate with North today. In 1882, the club amalgamated with the Hotham Cricket Club and moved into the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve (Arden St Oval), which remains the home of the club today. The joint venture was aimed at affecting improvements at the Hotham Cricket Ground, which was the name of the Reserve at the time. Four years later the club adopted the traditional uniform of blue and white vertical stripes at the insistence of the VFA, who wanted a visible contrast between Geelong's and Hotham's uniforms. The third significant development occurred in 1888 with the club returning to its original name of the North Melbourne Football Club. This followed the name of the local area reverting from Hotham to North Melbourne.\n\nThe 1880s saw the club develop a penchant for inter-colonial travel with trips to Tasmania (1881/1887) and South Australia (1889). Hotham also found itself well represented at the first ever inter-colonial representative game in 1879 with four players from the club gaining selection for Victoria.\n\n===Disregarded by the VFL===\n[[File:Nmfc1903.jpg|300px|thumb|[[1903 VFA season|\"The Inaugurals\"]]. The side that brought North premiership glory after 34 years of wait. To commemorate the achievement, club President [[George Prendergast|G/M Prendergast]] presented the 26 players and head trainer with a gold medal at the club's general meeting that year.]]\n\nThe VFA grew to 13 senior clubs in the 1890s. Led by Geelong and Essendon, the largest clubs of the VFA formed their own break away league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), in 1896. Despite finishing 6th in 1896, North Melbourne was not invited to the breakaway competition. The main reasons for being excluded were:\n* North had not won a premiership yet, and thus was not considered a powerful club\n* The industrialisation of the locality had drained the club's income streams\n* The club had a strong reputation for hooliganism from their fans\n* There was a lot of bad blood between Collingwood and North following a torrid engagement in the previous season\n* Essendon felt threatened by the proximity of North Melbourne\n* A court case against the North Melbourne Cricket Club had damaged the Football Club's status\n\nNorth continued on in the depleted VFA, emerging as a powerhouse, finishing 2nd in 1897, 1898 and 1899. In 1903, after 34 years of competing, the club won its first premiership, defeating Richmond in the final. The club became back to back premiers in 1904 after Richmond [[1904 VFA Grand Final|forfeited the grand final]] due to the appointment of an umpire whose performance when the two teams met earlier in the year was severely criticised by Richmond players and officials.<ref name=\"Atkinson\">{{cite book |last=Atkinson |first=Graeme |title=3AW Book of Footy Records |year=1989 |publisher=Magistra Publishing Company Pty Ltd |location=South Melbourne |isbn=1-86321-009-1 |pages=278}}.</ref>\n\nNorth merged with fellow VFA football club West Melbourne in 1907, which at the time had lost its home ground. The joint venture saw a chance of promotion, and the club applied for admission to the more prestigious VFL in 1908, but Richmond and University were admitted instead. North was kicked out of the VFA during the 1907/08 offseason as a result of applying to join the VFL,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=North Melbourne club |date=4 April 1908 |page=15 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> before the local community reestablished the North Melbourne Football Club under a new committee, successfully enabling the club to play in the VFA in the 1908 season.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |title=Football \u2013 the Victorian Association |date=18 April 1908 |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Invincibles\"===\nThe reformation of the Club necessitated a massive clean out of the team, leaving only two players remaining from the previous season. The 1910 season was marked by one of the most sensational transfers in Victorian football history, when Andy Curran masterminded the clearance of Carlton's famed \"Big Four\" of 'Mallee' Johnson, [[Fred Jinks]], [[Charlie Hammond]] and Frank 'Silver' Caine to North Melbourne. These signings secured the Northerners' third premiership in 1910.\n[[File:SBarkerNMelb.jpg|125px|thumb|[[Syd Barker, Sr.]], club legend and star ruckman of \"The Invincibles\" era.]]\nThe 1912 finals series was one of the most amazing ever, with the semi-final having to be played three times, after North and Brunswick drew twice. North was eventually victorious and moved on to the final, but lost the game by a mere four points with the last kick of the day.\n\nThe next few years were punctuated by \"The Invincibles\". In the Northerners' most illustrious period ever, the club went undefeated from 1914 to 1919, collecting premierships in 1914, 1915 and 1918 \u2013 the league was in recess in 1916 and 1917 due to [[World War I]]. As well as this, the club won the championship in both 1915 and 1918 for finishing on top of the ladder, and accounted for VFL side St Kilda comfortably. During this period the club won 58 consecutive matches including 49 successive premiership matches, a record that has remained unmatched in Association or League history since.\n\nDespite being rejected from the VFL in both 1896 and 1907, North persisted in trying to gain admission into the League. On 30 June 1921, North told its players it would disband and try to gain entry to the VFL by the 'back-door'. Essendon League Football Club had lost its playing ground at East Melbourne and had decided to acquire the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve as a new playing ground. North accepted their proposal in the idea that the clubs would amalgamate. All of North's players were urged to join the [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon League Club]] to help facilitate the amalgamation. The amalgamation was foiled when some members of the VFA launched a successful legal challenge.<ref name=\"12AugustArgus\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Argus |date=12 August 1921 |title=North Melbourne ground |page=6 |location=Melbourne, VIC}}</ref> As a result, the Essendon League Club moved instead to the Essendon Oval, replacing the ground's original occupants, [[Essendon Association Football Club|Essendon Association]].\n\nNorth was now without a playing team and the Essendon Association Club was now without a ground, so as a matter of convenience the two clubs amalgamated so they could compete in the 1922 season. As it had after the merger with West Melbourne, North once again managed to avert its destruction.\n\n===Entering the VFL===\n\nAfter three attempts, 29 years of waiting and numerous other applications to enter the VFL, finally North was rewarded for its persistence with admittance to the League in 1925, along with Footscray and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. Even then, the opportunity was almost lost as the League delegates debated into the early hours of the morning on which clubs should be invited to join the intake. It was only after much deliberation that North Melbourne's name was eventually substituted for [[Prahran FC|Prahran's]] making North \"the lucky side\" of the invitees that included Footscray and Hawthorn. North Melbourne was forced to change its uniform to avoid a clash when it joined the VFL.\n\nNorth Melbourne were cellar dwellers for its first twenty-five years of [[Australian Football League|VFL]] membership and struggled to win matches in the superior VFL competition, but by the late 1940s had developed a strong list and significant supporter base. In 1949 North secured the VFL Minor Premiership, finishing top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season with 14 wins and 5 losses. They failed to make the Grand Final that year (eventually won by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]), but in 1950 they did reach the final, defeated by a more efficient Essendon. It was in this year that the club adopted the \"Kangaroos\" mascot.<ref>Gerard Dowling, \"North Melbourne Football Club\", in Andrew Brown-May and [[Shurlee Swain]], ''The Encyclopedia of Melbourne'', Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2005, p.511.</ref>\n[[File:Gasometer North Melbourne 1928.jpg|thumb|North Melbourne and Arden St Oval after admission to the VFL. c. 1928]]\n\nIn February 1965, North Melbourne [[1965 VFA season#North Melbourne's move to Coburg Oval|moved its playing and training base]] from the Arden Street Oval to [[Coburg City Oval|Coburg Oval]], signing a seven-year lease with the [[City of Coburg]]<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=30 March 1965 |title=North gets lease}}</ref> after initially negotiating long-term leases for up to 40 years.<ref name=\"sun3nov\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=34 |author= |date=3 November 1964 |title=North can have a new oval}}</ref> The club came to an arrangement to merge with the VFA's [[Coburg Football Club]], whom it was displacing from the ground;<ref name=\"sun9dec\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |pages=63\u201364 |author=Scot Palmer |date=9 December 1964 |title=Coburg, North merger}}</ref> fourteen Coburg committeemen joined the North Melbourne committee, but the merger was never completed after Coburg established a rival committee which remained loyal to the VFA.<ref name=\"sun6feb\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=56 |author= |date=6 February 1965 |title=Coburg to stay in Association}}</ref> The lease at Coburg lasted only eight months; the Coburg council was hesitant to build a new grandstand without the security of a long-term lease, and neither party made the returns they expected, so it was terminated by mutual agreement in September 1965 and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=51 |author= |date=28 September 1965 |title=Coburg to drop stand?}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=52 |author= |date=29 September 1965 |title=North to quit Coburg}}</ref>\n\nOnfield, the 1950s and 1960s were lean years for North Melbourne, though the club did secure two consecutive Night Premierships in 1965 and 1966. [[Allen Aylett]] was a brilliant player in the late 1950s and early 1960s (and captain between 1961 and 1964), as was [[Noel Teasdale]], who lost the [[Brownlow Medal]] on a countback in 1965 (he was later awarded a retrospective medal when the counting system was amended).\n\n===Golden era===\nIn the late 1960s, under the leadership of [[Allen Aylett]], North Melbourne began its climb to supremacy.

In a major coup, the great [[Ron Barassi]] was appointed coach in 1973. Barrassi reversed the club's playing fortunes, taking a struggling team that was once regarded as the traditional cellar dwellers of the competition through to a golden era of success that transformed North Melbourne into one of the powerhouses of the VFL. Barassi took North to a Grand Final (losing to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] by 41 points) in 1974 and brought success in his 1975 and 1977 seasons.

The origins of the nickname are unknown but it may have had something to do with the club's reputation for targeting the shinbones of opposition players, or to do with local butchers who showed their support for North by dressing up beef leg-bones in the club colours.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} By 1926, the club was known as the \"Blue Birds\", but this nickname did not last.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It was Phonse Tobin, North president from 1953 to 1956, who oversaw the club adopting the kangaroo emblem in 1954; Tobin found the image of a shinbone unsavoury and wanted the club to have a mascot it could show with pride. In selecting a new name, he wanted something characteristically Australian and was inspired by a large kangaroo he saw on display outside a city store.<ref name=\"Heraldsun.com.au\">{{cite web | title=Subscribe to the Herald Sun for exclusive stories | website=Heraldsun.com.au | url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/what-your-footy-team-was-once-called-and-how-it-got-its-name/news-story/ebc68823888ac0000580d313422aca4c | access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Watson 2011 p. 23\">{{cite book | last=Watson | first=T. | title=Malcolm Blight | publisher=Hardie Grant Books | series=EBL ebooks online | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-74273-663-1 | url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=5pU9mmDQRwYC&pg=PT23 | access-date=4 May 2019 | page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe official name of the club is North Melbourne, but the club has gone under several other aliases over the years.

In 1998 the club proposed changing its name to the \"Northern Kangaroos\", but it was rejected by the AFL. From 1999 to 2007, the club traded without much success as \"The Kangaroos\" in a bid to increase its appeal nationally; this decision was reversed at the end of 2007 and the club has again reverted to the name \"North Melbourne\".<ref name=\"Navaratnam 2016\">{{cite web | last=Navaratnam | first=Dinny | title=Members force change to North's kangaroo logo | website=afl.com.au | date=4 November 2016 | url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-11-04/north-melbourne-unveils-new-fierce-roo-logo | access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Club song===\n\"Join in the Chorus\" is the official anthem of the North Melbourne Football Club.

It is also played before every match.\n\n\"Join in the Chorus\" is believed to be the oldest club anthem of any AFL club and has been associated with North from its early VFA days. The preamble of the song originates from a score of a theatre musical called ''Australia: Heart to Heart and Hand to Hand'', written by Toso Taylor in the 1890s in pre-federation Australia.<ref name=\"H2H\">{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.mus-an4784438 |title=Australia or Heart to heart and hand to hand}}</ref> The second verse is unknown in origin and was presumably added later by members of the club when the song was chosen. The chorus was appropriated from a song written and performed by Scottish musician [[Harry Lauder]]. The recording currently used by the club was performed by the Fable Singers in April 1972 and only includes the choruses.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-tunes-to-remember-20100723-10nyh.html AFL Tunes to Remember], ''The Age'', 23 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe song has a strong Victorian heritage and has been traditionally sung by the Victorian State Football and Victorian Cricket teams respectively. The lyrics have occasionally been changed, including updating the year in the song (e.g. \"North Melbourne will be premiers in 1993\"), or to remove the words \"North Melbourne\" during the period when the club was competing only as the  Kangaroos.\n\nFor the 2015 premiership season, [[You Am I]]'s lead singer, [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]], a North Melbourne supporter, announced that he would assist in an updated version of the song including the two verses.

Members of the club serve as the guarantees of capital and have full voting rights at AGMs to elect directors to the club's board.\n\nThe club's board of directors has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure of the terms of the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune to a lot of the in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.\n\nNorth Melbourne is unique in its structure, because from 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was floated in 1986 through a membership vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged to buy into the club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3&nbsp;million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade.\n\nIn 1991, the [[John Elliott (businessman)|John Elliott]]-led [[Carlton Football Club]] attempted a hostile take over North Melbourne by purchasing a large parcel of shares formerly owned by Bob Ansett. The Blues acquired 20 per cent of the capital but that stake was eventually bought back by John Magowan, the former head of Merrill Lynch Australia, in 2001. The resulting melodrama saw the formation of B-Class shareholders who had the effective power of veto over any attempt to merge or relocate the club.\n\nFurther takeover attempts were made in the first decade of the 21st century by the [[Southport Sharks]]. Then chairman Allan Aylett knocked back a proposal from the Sharks that would have seen them gain a majority stake in the club in exchange for an injection of capital. In early 2006, another proposal from Sharks to underwrite the Kangaroos' games on the Gold Coast, in exchange for a slice of the shareholder structure at the club was knocked back after AFL intervention.\n\nDue to an [[Australian Taxation Office]] ruling in 2006, the club proposed a shareholder restructure that would have seen the B Class shareholders power reduced significantly and some voting rights returned to members. This was done to avoid extraordinary taxes being placed on the club, but the move was blocked in December by Bob Ansett and his proxies who feared that the restructure would make the club vulnerable to further takeover bids.\n\nOn 28 February 2007, another meeting was called to resolve the shareholder issue. A motion was passed that would return see some voting rights return to members and stop any future tax increments.\n\nIn April 2007 it was revealed the AFL was attempting to buy out the shareholders of the club in a bid to gain full ownership, and force a relocation of the club to the Gold Coast.\n\nDuring October 2007, a group called [[We Are North Melbourne]] emerged and launched a public campaign, calling for ordinary members to be given the final say on the relocation issue. While the group became synonymous with the push to keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club's shareholder structure wound-up and control returned to ordinary members.\n\nNorth Melbourne reverted to public company in November 2008. A moratorium was passed at an extraordinary general meeting that will allow James Brayshaw's board to serve unopposed until 2010, so as to allow his ticket the maximum time to enact their policies to make the North Melbourne Football Club financially viable.\n\nOn 20 November 2016, former Aussie Rules footballer and Football Federation Australia chairman [[Ben Buckley]] replaced James Brayshaw as the new chairman of the club.\n\n===Sponsorship===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:75%;\"\n|-\n!

North supporters have long been bitter with [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] for excluding them from the VFL, and have blamed that for their small supporter base in comparison to Essendon's. North's first [[VFL Grand Final]] was against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in [[1950 VFL Grand Final|1950]]. The rivalry was reignited in the 90s as both teams were constantly in premiership contention. In 1998, following comments by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] coach labelling Kangaroos executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson \"marshmallows\", a reference to their softness, North supporters threw marshmallows at Sheedy after the opening Qualifying Final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sheeds still baiting the crowd on marshmallow anniversary |url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-06-30/marshmallow-moments-not-forgotten |website=AFL Website |accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> In 2014 North Melbourne versed Essendon in Elimination Final 2 Essendon was leading by 30 odd points then North came back to win by 12 points<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2014/24/nmfc-v-ess</ref>\n\n'''Hawthorn'''{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} \u2013 North and Hawthorn have a fierce rivalry that dates back to the 1970s when they played off against each other in three Grand Finals in the space of four years. From 1974 to 1978 the two clubs played against each other in ten finals, and took each other on for the Australian Championship in Adelaide in 1976. During the 1980s Hawthorn dominated North, and during the 90s the results were reversed with North dominating Hawthorn.\nNorth Melbourne defeated Hawthorn in the 1975 Grand Final by 55 points. However, Hawthorn defeated North Melbourne in the 1976 Grand Final by 30 points and in the 1978 Grand Final by 18 points.\nThe rivalry re-ignited in 2014 following a choking incident involving [[Brian Lake]] having North Melbourne forward [[Drew Petrie]] in a choking hold during a clash between the two sides at [[Docklands Stadium]] and reached fever pitch in 2015 following several fights including an all in during the first term of their round 5 clash.\n\n===Minor===\n'''Collingwood''' \u2013 North and Collingwood have a small kind of rivalry between them. As they drew in the [[1977 VFL Grand Final|1977 Grand Final]], which North went on to win in the replay by 27 points.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/afl-grand-final-countdown-no2-North-melbourne-v-collingwood-1977/story-e6frf3e3-1225778963326 AFL grand final countdown No.2: North Melbourne v Collingwood, 1977]</ref>\nIn 2019 [[North Melbourne]] and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] faced off in Round 15 and the Collingwood banner said \"Kanga, Kanga, Kanga Roo, Roo, Roo The Pies, Pies, Pies Will beat, Beat you\" Instead, North Melbourne Held Collingwood to their lowest score since 1994, and of course after a goal they chanted \"KANGA KANGA KANGA!\"ROO ROO\" To annoy Collingwood Supporters. Also the rivalry extends to the press with Collingwood President Edward Mcguire encouraging North to relocate to tasmania for being the smallest club in Melbourne and expansion if \"the game.\"<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2019/15/coll-v-nmfc</ref>\n  \n'''Carlton''' \u2013 Although not known for their on-field rivalry, North Melbourne and Carlton have endured a tumultuous off-field relationship. In 1965, North Melbourne moved to the [[Coburg City Oval]], which Carlton opposed as an invasion of its own territory: Coburg was located within Carlton's recruiting zone, and was home to about of quarter of Carlton's members at the time.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial |location=Melbourne, VIC |page=66 |author=Rex Pullen |date=5 November 1964 |title=North move to Coburg under fire}}</ref> Later, after North Melbourne was listed on the stock market in 1987, Carlton bought 20% of the shares to become part-owner of the rival club.

This was Port's only loss in the first 12 rounds of [[2014 AFL season|2014]].\n\nPort Adelaide lost their first finals appearance to North Melbourne in 1999 in the qualifying final, and in Port's premiership year of [[2004 AFL season|2004]], North beat Port by 92 points, however, Port beat North Melbourne in both the [[2005 AFL finals series#First Elimination Final (5 vs 8)|2005 Elimination Final]] and [[2007 AFL season#Preliminary Finals|2007 Preliminary Final]] by 87 points. In 2019 North beat Port Adelaide by 86 points to end Port's finals hopes for 2019, restarting the rivalry.\n\n'''Richmond''' \u2013 A rivalry that began as a result of North's loss to Richmond in the 1974 Grand Final, the two sides have shared an on and off rivalry ever since. Both sides since their 1975 preliminary final meeting (which North Melbourne won) have mostly been unsuccessful on the field. The rivalry re-ignited in the 2010s due to the clubs recent on field success and accumulated in a clash during the [[2015 AFL finals series]] which North won by 17 points and was preceded by a provocative banner which read, 'Tigers Don't Win Finals, We Do'.\n\n==Club honour board==\n\n===Honour roll===\n{{Main|North Melbourne Football Club honour roll}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#BDB76B;\"\n!

There was no minimum number of games set for selection. [[Wayne Carey]] was named as captain and [[Denis Pagan]] as coach. The selection panel was Geoff Poulter (journalist), Father Gerard Dowling (club historian), [[Keith McKenzie (Australian footballer)|Keith McKenzie]] (former coach), Lloyd Holyoak (former president), [[Max Ritchie]] (former player and chairman of selectors) and Greg Miller (chief executive).\n\n{{Aussie rules team | title = North Melbourne Team of the Century\n| backpocket1 = [[Glenn Archer]]\n| fullback = [[David Dench]]\n| backpocket2 = [[Mick Martyn (Australian footballer)|Mick Martyn]]\n| halfbackflank1 = [[John Rantall]]\n| centrehalfback = [[Ross Glendinning]]\n| halfbackflank2 = [[Ted Jarrard]]\n| wing1 = [[Keith Greig]]\n| centre = [[Les Foote]]\n| wing2 = [[Laurie Dwyer]]\n| halfforwardflank1 = [[Malcolm Blight]]\n| centrehalfforward = [[Wayne Carey]] (c)\n| halfforwardflank2 = [[Wayne Schimmelbusch]]\n| forwardpocket1 = [[John Dugdale (footballer)|John Dugdale]]\n| fullforward = [[Jock Spencer]]\n| forwardpocket2 = [[Allen Aylett]]\n| ruck = [[Noel Teasdale]]\n| ruckrover = [[Anthony Stevens]]\n| rover = [[Barry Cable]]\n| interchange1 = [[Brent Crosswell]]\n| interchange2 = [[Barry Davis (footballer)|Barry Davis]]\n| interchange3 = [[Peter Steward]]\n| interchange4 = [[Sam Kekovich]]\n| interchange5 = [[Jim Krakouer]]\n| interchange6 = [[Brent Harvey]]\n| emergency1 = [[David King]]\n| emergency2 = [[John Blakey]]\n| emergency3 = [[Wayne Schwass]]\n| emergency4 = [[Gary Dempsey]]\n| emergency5 =\n| emergency6 =\n| coach = [[Denis Pagan]]}}\n\n===Shinboner of the Century===\nOn 18 March 2005, the North Melbourne football club held a special gala dinner entitled the \"North Story\" to celebrate the 80th anniversary of North's admission to the VFL, and the 30th anniversary of the club's first VFL premiership. Over 3500 people attended the historic event held at the [[Royal Exhibition Building]], including almost all surviving North Melbourne players. [[Glenn Archer]] was voted the '''Shinboner of the Century''' by his peers as the player who most represents the 'Shinboner Spirit'. The following players were voted 'Shinboners' of their era:\n\n* [[Les Foote]] \u2013 Shinboner of the early era (1925\u20131950)\n* [[Allen Aylett]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 50s\n* [[Noel Teasdale]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 60s\n* [[Malcolm Blight]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 70s\n* [[Wayne Schimmelbusch]] \u2013 Shinboner of the 80s\n* [[Wayne Carey]] \u2013 Shinboner of the modern era (1990\u20132005)\n\n===150th year celebration===\n\nTo commemorate the 150th year of the founding of the North Melbourne Football Club a 150th Year Celebration was organised for the first weekend of August 2019 which commenced with a Friday Night blockbuster against arch rivals Hawthorn. Starting from 27 points down in the first quarter, the Roos fought back heroically against the Hawks to triumph as 22 point winners, and get the weekend celebrations underway. The following day the Roos VFL side took on Box Hill and similarly won in a heroic performance coming back from 31 points down at three quarter time to win by 2 points with just minutes to spare. To cap off the weekend, a 150th Year Celebration Dinner was held at the [[Melbourne Convention Centre]] where the 150 greatest ever North Melbourne players were announced with a top 10 greatest North Melbourne players announced on the night from the results of an expert panel.\n\n'''Top 10 Greatest North Players'''\n*1 \u2013 Wayne Carey\n*2 \u2013 Keith Greig\n*3 - David Dench\n*4 \u2013 Allen Aylett\n*5 \u2013 Brent Harvey\n*6 \u2013 Malcolm Blight\n*7 \u2013 Wayne Schimmelbusch\n*8 \u2013 Les Foote\n*9 \u2013 Anthony Stevens\n*10 \u2013 Ross Glendinning\n\n===Achievements===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" align=\"center\"| '''Premierships'''\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!Competition\n!Level\n!Wins\n!Years Won\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Seniors||4||[[1975 VFL Grand Final|1975]], [[1977 VFL Grand Final|1977]], [[1996 AFL Grand Final|1996]], [[1999 AFL Grand Final|1999]]\n|-\n|'''[[Victorian Football League|VFA]]'''||Seniors||6||1903, 1904, 1910, 1914, 1915, 1918\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Reserves||7||1947, 1957, 1967, 1978, 1979, 1995, 1996\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Under 19s||7||1946, 1976, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" align=\"center\"| '''Other titles and honours'''\n|-\n|'''[[Championship of Australia]]'''||Seniors||1||[[1975 Championship of Australia|1975]]\n|-\n|'''Australian Football Championships'''||[[AFC Night Series|Night Premiership]]||1||1980\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||[[McClelland Trophy]]||4|| 1976, 1978, 1983, 1998\n|-\n|'''[[VFL Night Series]]'''||Seniors||2||1965, 1966\n|-\n|'''[[Australian Football League|AFL]]'''||[[Australian Football League pre-season competition|Preseason premiership]]||1||1995, 1998\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#bdb76b;\" align=\"center\"| '''Finishing positions'''\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||[[List of Australian Football League minor premiers|Minor premiership]]||4||1949, 1978, 1983, 1998\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||Runners-up||5|| 1950, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1998\n|-\n||'''[[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]'''||[[Wooden spoon (award)|Wooden Spoons]]||13||\n1926, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1956, 1961, 1968, 1970, 1972\n|-\n||'''[[Victorian Football League|VFA]]'''||Minor premiership||6||\n1905, 1910, 1914, 1915, 1918, 1919\n|}\n\n===Individual honours===\n{{Main|List of North Melbourne Football Club individual awards and records}}\n\n===Premiership results===\n{{Main|List of North Melbourne Football Club premiership results}}\n\n===Finals results===\n{{Main|List of North Melbourne Football Club finals results}}\n\n===Best and Fairest===\n{{Further|Syd Barker Medal}}\n{{Further|Syd Barker Medal#Harold Henderson Best Club-Man Award}}\n\n===VFL/AFL finishing positions (1925\u2013present)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#BDB76B;\"\n!

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]], and from 1992 to 1999 a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]], and North Melbourne fielded its reserves team in both of these competitions while it was in the VFL/AFL, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for North Melbourne in the lower grade. During that time, the North Melbourne reserves team won seven premierships (1947, 1957, 1967, 1978, 1979, 1995, 1996).\n\nFollowing the demise of the AFL reserves competition, North Melbourne's reserves team was dissolved, and over the following eighteen years the club entered [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliations]] with a range of [[Victorian Football League]] clubs.

The town's community liaison group chose to withdraw from this development in the early 1990s,<ref>http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/73397/1/j.1754-7121.1994.tb00885.x.pdf</ref> but as of May 2010 the township is still being considered for nuclear waste management/storage.<ref>http://www.nwmo.ca/uploads_managed/MediaFiles/1797_hornepayne-summaryreport.pdf</ref>\n\n==Geological history==\nHornepayne is situated in the Horseshoe of Rock, which forms the Pre-Cambrian area, which surrounds Hudson Bay.  It is the oldest rock in the world, containing the famous Keewatin Greenstone. Massive Granite intrusions, of which Tank Hill is a good example, is the predominate rock in the area\n\nGreenstone can be found six miles north along highway 631 and in numerous bands along Government Lake Road. Volcanoes were numerous, and specimens of their eruptions in the soil today. The Pre-Cambrian was covered by at least three Ice Ages which, with glaciers miles high, bulldozed the mountains away just as a bulldozer today would level a small hill. The rock and earth were moved as far south as Wisconsin.\n\nEvidence of glacial scratches can be found on Tank Hill. The sand hills near Cedar Point are eskers left by the Glaciers.  Boulders, small rocks, and clay, are scattered throughout the area, part of the glacial wash. A typical volcanic core is to be found about five miles north. The highway runs through it. Samples of Volcanics, such as garnets, surpentine, and rhyolite, can be found. Most of the Pre-Cambrian is covered by a thin layer of organic soil and clay. Hornepayne is approximately eight miles north of the height of land. Drainage is poor in the area, which has many muskeg swamps.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[Image:Hornepayne ON.jpg|none|300px|thumb|The Hallmark Centre in Hornepayne: built in 1980 and opened in 1982.

The town's community liaison group chose to withdraw from this development in the early 1990s,<ref>http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/73397/1/j.1754-7121.1994.tb00885.x.pdf</ref> but as of May 2010 the township is still being considered for nuclear waste management/storage.<ref>http://www.nwmo.ca/uploads_managed/MediaFiles/1797_hornepayne-summaryreport.pdf</ref>\n\n==Geological history==\nHornepayne is situated in the Horseshoe of Rock, which forms the Pre-Cambrian area, which surrounds Hudson Bay.  It is the oldest rock in the world, containing the famous Keewatin Greenstone. Massive Granite intrusions, of which Tank Hill is a good example, is the predominate rock in the area\n\nGreenstone can be found six miles north along highway 631 and in numerous bands along Government Lake Road. Volcanoes were numerous, and specimens of their eruptions in the soil today. The Pre-Cambrian was covered by at least three Ice Ages which, with glaciers miles high, bulldozed the mountains away just as a bulldozer today would level a small hill. The rock and earth were moved as far south as Wisconsin.\n\nEvidence of glacial scratches can be found on Tank Hill. The sand hills near Cedar Point are eskers left by the Glaciers.  Boulders, small rocks, and clay, are scattered throughout the area, part of the glacial wash. A typical volcanic core is to be found about five miles north. The highway runs through it. Samples of Volcanics, such as garnets, surpentine, and rhyolite, can be found. Most of the Pre-Cambrian is covered by a thin layer of organic soil and clay. Hornepayne is approximately eight miles north of the height of land. Drainage is poor in the area, which has many muskeg swamps.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[Image:Hornepayne ON.jpg|none|300px|thumb|The Hallmark Centre in Hornepayne: built in 1980 and opened in 1982.

Mark Hoppus, the band's bassist, had become friends with Gaskarth over the years and the two had always spoken about collaborating at some point. Following completion of the ''California'' tour dates in 2017, Hoppus fell into a depression, and re-entered the studio hoping to record with artists he had always wanted to work with. He called Gaskarth first, and the two ended up writing several songs in the first sessions together.<ref name=\"ap1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/mark-hoppus-alex-gaskarth-simple-creatures-influences-ep/|title=Mark Hoppus Talks Simple Creatures Influences, Plans to Release Music|date=January 28, 2019|work=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|first= Natasha|last=Heinz|accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> The project, Simple Creatures, was announced in January 2019, with the lead single \"Drug\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplecreaturesmusic.com/|title=Simple Creatures|website=Simple Creatures|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/01/25/blink-182s-mark-hoppus-and-all-time-lows-alex-gaskarth-debut-new-band/|title=blink-182\u2019s Mark Hoppus and All Time Low\u2019s Alex Gaskarth debut new band|last=brownypaul|date=2019-01-24|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/> The duo's first extended play, ''Strange Love'', was released March 29 via [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]].<ref name=\"k2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/simple-creatures-announce-new-ep-strange-love-release-title-track/|title=Simple Creatures Announce Debut EP Strange Love; Release Title-Track|date=February 21, 2019|work=[[Kerrang!]]|accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> The duo also announced a four date tour of the US and UK during March and April 2019,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.98online.com/2019/03/12/simple-creatures-announce-debut-us-tour-dates/|title=Simple Creatures announce debut US tour dates|date=March 12, 2019|publisher=98 Rock Baltimore}}</ref> alongside two music festivals in Europe during Summer 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/simple-creatures-first-show-download-festival-2019/|title=Simple Creatures (Mark Hoppus, Alex Gaskarth) announce first show|first=Collin|last=Goeman|date=February 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, shortly after the release of their ''Strange Love'' EP, the band confirmed in an interview that they have a second EP and a debut album ready to release in the near future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-simple-creatures-have-a-second-ep-and-a-debut-album-ready/,%20https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-simple-creatures-have-a-second-ep-and-a-debut-album-ready/|title=NEWS: Simple Creatures have a second EP and a debut album ready! &#124; DEAD PRESS! &#124; It's more than \"just music\" to us}}</ref>\n\nOn June 12, 2019, the band released \"Special\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/simple-creatures-special/|title=Simple Creatures release more trash-pop goodness with \"Special\"|first=Whitney|last=Shoemaker|date=June 13, 2019}}</ref>.

Mark Hoppus, the band's bassist, had become friends with Gaskarth over the years and the two had always spoken about collaborating at some point. Following completion of the ''California'' tour dates in 2017, Hoppus fell into a depression, and re-entered the studio hoping to record with artists he had always wanted to work with. He called Gaskarth first, and the two ended up writing several songs in the first sessions together.<ref name=\"ap1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/mark-hoppus-alex-gaskarth-simple-creatures-influences-ep/|title=Mark Hoppus Talks Simple Creatures Influences, Plans to Release Music|date=January 28, 2019|work=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|first= Natasha|last=Heinz|accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> The project, Simple Creatures, was announced in January 2019, with the lead single \"Drug\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplecreaturesmusic.com/|title=Simple Creatures|website=Simple Creatures|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/01/25/blink-182s-mark-hoppus-and-all-time-lows-alex-gaskarth-debut-new-band/|title=blink-182\u2019s Mark Hoppus and All Time Low\u2019s Alex Gaskarth debut new band|last=brownypaul|date=2019-01-24|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/> The duo's first extended play, ''Strange Love'', was released March 29 via [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]].<ref name=\"k2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/simple-creatures-announce-new-ep-strange-love-release-title-track/|title=Simple Creatures Announce Debut EP Strange Love; Release Title-Track|date=February 21, 2019|work=[[Kerrang!]]|accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> The duo also announced a four date tour of the US and UK during March and April 2019,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.98online.com/2019/03/12/simple-creatures-announce-debut-us-tour-dates/|title=Simple Creatures announce debut US tour dates|date=March 12, 2019|publisher=98 Rock Baltimore}}</ref> alongside two music festivals in Europe during Summer 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/simple-creatures-first-show-download-festival-2019/|title=Simple Creatures (Mark Hoppus, Alex Gaskarth) announce first show|first=Collin|last=Goeman|date=February 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, shortly after the release of their ''Strange Love'' EP, the band confirmed in an interview that they have a second EP and a debut album ready to release in the near future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-simple-creatures-have-a-second-ep-and-a-debut-album-ready/,%20https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-simple-creatures-have-a-second-ep-and-a-debut-album-ready/|title=NEWS: Simple Creatures have a second EP and a debut album ready! &#124; DEAD PRESS! &#124; It's more than \"just music\" to us}}</ref>\n\nOn June 12, 2019, the band released \"Special\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/simple-creatures-special/|title=Simple Creatures release more trash-pop goodness with \"Special\"|first=Whitney|last=Shoemaker|date=June 13, 2019}}</ref>.
