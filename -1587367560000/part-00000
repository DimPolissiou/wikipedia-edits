Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs.  It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees.  Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date.  In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus. Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N.

To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}}   Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J. Brandon]] sent a telegram to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and Secretary of State [[Frank B. Kellogg]] opposing the deportation of a Mexican archbishop.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}}   That same year, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico.\n\nThe order subsequently launched a $1-million campaign to educate Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the church in the [[Cristero War]].<ref name=\"legacy\" /> The organization produced pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the anticlerical Mexican government and its policies. So much printed material was smuggled into Mexico that the government directed border guards be aware of women bringing Catholic propaganda into the country hidden in their clothes.{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=108\u2013109}}<ref name=\"king\" /> Twenty-five [[Saints of the Cristero War|martyrs from the conflict]] would eventually be canonized, including six knights.<ref name=\"martyr\" />{{sfn|Meyer|1976}}\n\nSupreme Treasurer Daniel J.

Roosevelt]] and other government officials, to send the children to live with Basque families who had fled to France so that the children could speak their own language and practice their own religion.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}}  If the children did come to the United States, the Knights and the [[Catholic Order of Foresters]] said they would try to place the children in Catholic homes.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}}\n\nThe Knights supported the embargo on all arms into Spain.<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" />  To remove it, they said, would be to aid a \"vicious and despotic government\" who had forced their own citizens to flee to escape \"annihilation or slavery.\"<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" />  They also opposed the screening of documentaries that were used to recruit volunteers and raise funds for the loyalists.{{sfn|Rob\u00e9|2010|p=83}}  The Knights believed these films were pro-Marxist and anti-Catholic, and as a result wrote to [[Will H.

the 20th century and especially the [[Cold War]], the order had a history of anti-anarchist, anti-socialist and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] crusades.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=364\u2013365}} It also established the Commission on Religious Prejudices and the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission to combat racism.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}} It was supportive of [[trade unionism]] and published the works of men including [[George Ernest Schuster|George Schuster]], [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]], [[Allan Nevins]], and [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs.  It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees.  Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date.  In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K.

Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said,''The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance \u2014 one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar \u201cdual loyalty\u201d smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.''<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semiticism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N.

To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}}   Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J.

Today it is home to the Union des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s savantes and the Bemberg Foundation.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\">Explanatory comments of ''Toulouse Renaissance'' exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche.</ref> It is one of the first manifestations of French classicism.\n\n==History==\nThe H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat was likely built by Toulouse architect [[Nicolas Bachelier]] for Pierre d'Ass\u00e9zat, an internationally renowned Toulouse [[Isatis tinctoria|woad merchant]]. The construction of the H\u00f4tel began in 1555 and was not yet completed when Pierre d'Ass\u00e9zat died in 1581. It is an outstanding example of Renaissance palaces architecture of southern France, with an elaborate decoration of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'' (''courtyard'') influenced by Italian [[Mannerism]] and by [[classicism]]. The use of brick is typical of Toulouse. The H\u00f4tel now belongs to the City of Toulouse and was restored in the 1980s.\n\n==Presentation==\nPierre Ass\u00e9zat was at the height of his social and professional success when he launched the construction of his mansion close to the Merchant Exchange, of which he had been one of the founders. Nevertheless, he did get caught up in the religious troubles of the time. A Calvinist convert, he was obliged to leave Toulouse after attempting to seize the town along with his fellows [[capitouls]] in 1562. He recanted ten years later and returned to his townhouse in Toulouse where he died in 1581.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\nAss\u00e9zat launched the first phase of construction in 1555\u20131557. The main L-shaped structure was built along with the staircase pavilion in the corner. The stonemason Jean Castagni\u00e9 was entrusted with carrying out the masonry works defined by the architect [[Nicolas Bachelier]]. The designs of the fa\u00e7ades, featuring twin columns which develop regularly over three floors (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian), takes their inspiration from the great classical models such as the [[Coliseum]]. The capitals also precisely adhere to classical models, known from engravings. The erudite architecture\u2014its source can also be traced to the treatises of the royal architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]]\u2014expresses order and regularity. On the deaths of Castagni\u00e9 and Bachelier the construction work stopped; it was restarted in 1560 under the direction of Dominique Bachelier, son of Nicolas. He undertook the creation of the loggia and the passageway, which divided up the courtyard, and the street gate. Much polychrome interplay (brick/stone) and various ornaments (cabochons, diamonds, masks) evoke luxury, surprise and abundance, themes peculiar to mannerist architecture.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Main gate==\nThe monumental gate designed by Dominique Bachelier combines power with delicacy. The gateway arch takes a certain rhythm from several projecting stones decorated with small dots. Serlio's Extraordinary Book of Doors contain this type of composition and it was used on several occasions by Toulousain architects ([[H\u00f4tel de Felzins|H\u00f4tel de Molinier]] and H\u00f4tel de Massas). The Doric pilasters that frame the gate display an alternating succession of diamond-shaped stone, which gives the ensemble a precious aspect. In the upper section the Ionic pilasters around the mullioned window are fluted and delicately ornamented. And with the table that surmounts it, the composition imparts a refined sophistication. Thus, Dominique Bachelier was able to offer the owner a complete composition which evoked both power and a delicate erudition.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==The passageway and the consoles==\nIn the courtyard, the passageway features arches decorated with diamond-shaped stone. They rest on large scrolled consoles, whose fronts are decorated with grotesque masks of different design. On the side, the rolls of the scrolls engender plant pods and cloves. Each console is borne upon a lion foot standing on a section of pilaster capped underneath with a magnificent rose. These consoles illustrate, by themselves, the manneristic aesthetic on the unusual and the association of opposites, combining mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. These refined motifs, heightened through the polychrome interplay and relief of the passageway, were much appreciated by contemporaries and inspired details on other buildings, such as H\u00f4tel de Massas and [[Lar\u00e9ole]] Castle.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Staircase term==\nIn the stairwell, on the landing of the first floor, stands the impressive figure of a male term. Half man, half pilaster, his face grimacing and his hands holding a cushion placed on his head to reduce the pain, this term was condemned to support the weight of the console. Although a symbol of knowledge in the sense that it alludes to mythology (Atlas and Hercules), this motif also amuses thanks to an association of opposites, such as the straining muscles and the soft cushion. Cariatid termes and other telamons were much appreciated in Renaissance Toulouse, notable examples can be found on the windows of [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] and on the main gate of [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]].<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Bemberg Foundation==\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''[[Charles IX of France]]'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]].]]\n[[File:Entr\u00e9e de la Fondation Bemberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Entrance of the Foundation seen from the courtyard.]]\nSince 1994, the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat has housed the '''Bemberg Foundation''' (''Fondation Bemberg''), an art gallery which presents to the public one of the major private collections of art in Europe: the personal collection of the wealthy Argentine Georges Bemberg (1915\u20132011).

Today it is home to the Union des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s savantes and the Bemberg Foundation.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\">Explanatory comments of ''Toulouse Renaissance'' exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche.</ref> It is one of the first manifestations of French classicism.\n\n==History==\nThe H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat was likely built by Toulouse architect [[Nicolas Bachelier]] for Pierre d'Ass\u00e9zat, an internationally renowned Toulouse [[Isatis tinctoria|woad merchant]]. The construction of the H\u00f4tel began in 1555 and was not yet completed when Pierre d'Ass\u00e9zat died in 1581. It is an outstanding example of Renaissance palaces architecture of southern France, with an elaborate decoration of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'' (''courtyard'') influenced by Italian [[Mannerism]] and by [[classicism]]. The use of brick is typical of Toulouse. The H\u00f4tel now belongs to the City of Toulouse and was restored in the 1980s.\n\n==Presentation==\nPierre Ass\u00e9zat was at the height of his social and professional success when he launched the construction of his mansion close to the Merchant Exchange, of which he had been one of the founders. Nevertheless, he did get caught up in the religious troubles of the time. A Calvinist convert, he was obliged to leave Toulouse after attempting to seize the town along with his fellows [[capitouls]] in 1562. He recanted ten years later and returned to his townhouse in Toulouse where he died in 1581.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\nAss\u00e9zat launched the first phase of construction in 1555\u20131557. The main L-shaped structure was built along with the staircase pavilion in the corner. The stonemason Jean Castagni\u00e9 was entrusted with carrying out the masonry works defined by the architect [[Nicolas Bachelier]]. The designs of the fa\u00e7ades, featuring twin columns which develop regularly over three floors (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian), takes their inspiration from the great classical models such as the [[Coliseum]]. The capitals also precisely adhere to classical models, known from engravings. The erudite architecture\u2014its source can also be traced to the treatises of the royal architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]]\u2014expresses order and regularity. On the deaths of Castagni\u00e9 and Bachelier the construction work stopped; it was restarted in 1560 under the direction of Dominique Bachelier, son of Nicolas. He undertook the creation of the loggia and the passageway, which divided up the courtyard, and the street gate. Much polychrome interplay (brick/stone) and various ornaments (cabochons, diamonds, masks) evoke luxury, surprise and abundance, themes peculiar to mannerist architecture.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Main gate==\nThe monumental gate designed by Dominique Bachelier combines power with delicacy. The gateway arch takes a certain rhythm from several projecting stones decorated with small dots. Serlio's Extraordinary Book of Doors contain this type of composition and it was used on several occasions by Toulousain architects ([[H\u00f4tel de Felzins|H\u00f4tel de Molinier]] and H\u00f4tel de Massas). The Doric pilasters that frame the gate display an alternating succession of diamond-shaped stone, which gives the ensemble a precious aspect. In the upper section the Ionic pilasters around the mullioned window are fluted and delicately ornamented. And with the table that surmounts it, the composition imparts a refined sophistication. Thus, Dominique Bachelier was able to offer the owner a complete composition which evoked both power and a delicate erudition.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==The passageway and the consoles==\nIn the courtyard, the passageway features arches decorated with diamond-shaped stone. They rest on large scrolled consoles, whose fronts are decorated with grotesque masks of different design. On the side, the rolls of the scrolls engender plant pods and cloves. Each console is borne upon a lion foot standing on a section of pilaster capped underneath with a magnificent rose. These consoles illustrate, by themselves, the manneristic aesthetic on the unusual and the association of opposites, combining mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. These refined motifs, heightened through the polychrome interplay and relief of the passageway, were much appreciated by contemporaries and inspired details on other buildings, such as H\u00f4tel de Massas and [[Lar\u00e9ole]] Castle.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Staircase term==\nIn the stairwell, on the landing of the first floor, stands the impressive figure of a male term. Half man, half pilaster, his face grimacing and his hands holding a cushion placed on his head to reduce the pain, this term was condemned to support the weight of the console. Although a symbol of knowledge in the sense that it alludes to mythology (Atlas and Hercules), this motif also amuses thanks to an association of opposites, such as the straining muscles and the soft cushion. Cariatid termes and other telamons were much appreciated in Renaissance Toulouse, notable examples can be found on the windows of [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] and on the main gate of [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]].<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Bemberg Foundation==\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''[[Charles IX of France]]'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]].]]\n[[File:Entr\u00e9e de la Fondation Bemberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Entrance of the Foundation seen from the courtyard.]]\nSince 1994, the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat has housed the '''Bemberg Foundation''' (''Fondation Bemberg''), an art gallery which presents to the public one of the major private collections of art in Europe: the personal collection of the wealthy Argentine Georges Bemberg (1915\u20132011).

A Rajasthani mung bean paratha uses both the layering technique together with mung dal mixed into the dough. Some so-called ''stuffed parathas'' resemble a filled pie squashed flat and shallow fried, using two discs of dough sealed around the edges. Then by alternatively using a single disc of dough to encase a ball of filling and sealed with a series of pleats pinched into the dough around the top, gently flattened with the palm against the working surface before being rolled into a circle. Most stuffed parathas are not layered.\n\nParathas can be eaten as a breakfast dish or as a tea-time ([[tiffin]]) snack. The flour used is finely ground wholemeal ([[atta flour|atta]]) and the dough is shallow fried.\n\nPerhaps the most common stuffing for parathas is mashed, spiced potatoes (''aloo ka parantha'') followed perhaps by dal (lentils). Many other alternatives exist such as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[radish]]es, [[cauliflower]] or [[paneer]].  A paratha (especially a stuffed one) can be eaten simply with a pat of butter spread on top or with chutney, pickles, ketchup, [[Yogurt|dahi]] or a [[raita]] or with meat or vegetable curries. Some roll the paratha into a tube and eat it with tea, often dipping the paratha.\n\nTo achieve the  [[laminated dough|layered dough]] for plain parathas, a number of different traditional techniques exist. These include covering the thinly rolled out pastry with oil, folding back and forth like a paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on the [[tava]] and shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the centre to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas.  Plain parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.\n\n== Serving ==\n\nThe paratha is an important part of a traditional breakfast from the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it is made using [[ghee]] but oil is also used. Some people may even bake it in the oven for health reasons. Usually, the paratha is eaten with dollops of white butter on top of it. Side dishes which go very well with paratha are curd, fried egg, omelette, mutton kheema (ground mutton cooked with vegetables and spices), [[nihari]] (a lamb dish), jeera aloo (potatoes lightly fried with cumin seeds), daal, and [[raita]] as part of a breakfast meal. It may be stuffed with potatoes, [[paneer]], [[onion]]s, [[qeema]] or [[chili pepper]]s.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:A Aesthetic Parota making part 1.ogv|thumb|right|200px|Video showing one method of stretching the dough.]]\n[[File:Parathas being made.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Image showing parathas being made.]]\n* Ajwain paratha (layered paratha laced with [[ajwain]])\n* [[Aloo paratha]] (stuffed with spicy boiled potato and onions mix)\n* Aloo cheese paratha\n* Anda paratha (stuffed with spiced egg)\n* Band gobi wala paratha or Patta gobhi paratha (stuffed with [[cabbage]])\n* Batuha paratha (Lamb's quarter, Chenopodium album)\n* Boondi paratha (stuffed with salty boondi & baked with ghee)\n* Ceylon paratha (from Sri Lanka)\n* Chana paratha (chick peas)\n* Channa dal paratha (stuffed with channa [[dal]])\n* Chicken paratha\n* [[Chili parotha]] or mirchi paratha (small, spicy shredded pieces)\n* Dal paratha (stuffed with boiled, spiced and mashed dal mostly available in northwestern and western India)\n* Dhakai paratha (a type of layered paratha found in Dhaka, Bangladesh)\n* Dhaniya paratha (coriander)\n* Gajar paratha (carrot)\n* [[Gobi paratha]] (stuffed with flavoured cauliflower)\n* Jaipuri paratha\n* Kerala paratha (popular version pronounced \"porotta\")\n* Lachha paratha \u2013 tandoori (Punjabi in origin.

A Rajasthani mung bean paratha uses both the layering technique together with mung dal mixed into the dough. Some so-called ''stuffed parathas'' resemble a filled pie squashed flat and shallow fried, using two discs of dough sealed around the edges. Then by alternatively using a single disc of dough to encase a ball of filling and sealed with a series of pleats pinched into the dough around the top, gently flattened with the palm against the working surface before being rolled into a circle. Most stuffed parathas are not layered.\n\nParathas can be eaten as a breakfast dish or as a tea-time ([[tiffin]]) snack. The flour used is finely ground wholemeal ([[atta flour|atta]]) and the dough is shallow fried.\n\nPerhaps the most common stuffing for parathas is mashed, spiced potatoes (''aloo ka parantha'') followed perhaps by dal (lentils). Many other alternatives exist such as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[radish]]es, [[cauliflower]] or [[paneer]].  A paratha (especially a stuffed one) can be eaten simply with a pat of butter spread on top or with chutney, pickles, ketchup, [[Yogurt|dahi]] or a [[raita]] or with meat or vegetable curries. Some roll the paratha into a tube and eat it with tea, often dipping the paratha.\n\nTo achieve the  [[laminated dough|layered dough]] for plain parathas, a number of different traditional techniques exist. These include covering the thinly rolled out pastry with oil, folding back and forth like a paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on the [[tava]] and shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the centre to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas.  Plain parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.\n\n== Serving ==\n\nThe paratha is an important part of a traditional breakfast from the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it is made using [[ghee]] but oil is also used. Some people may even bake it in the oven for health reasons. Usually, the paratha is eaten with dollops of white butter on top of it. Side dishes which go very well with paratha are curd, fried egg, omelette, mutton kheema (ground mutton cooked with vegetables and spices), [[nihari]] (a lamb dish), jeera aloo (potatoes lightly fried with cumin seeds), daal, and [[raita]] as part of a breakfast meal. It may be stuffed with potatoes, [[paneer]], [[onion]]s, [[qeema]] or [[chili pepper]]s.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:A Aesthetic Parota making part 1.ogv|thumb|right|200px|Video showing one method of stretching the dough.]]\n[[File:Parathas being made.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Image showing parathas being made.]]\n* Ajwain paratha (layered paratha laced with [[ajwain]])\n* [[Aloo paratha]] (stuffed with spicy boiled potato and onions mix)\n* Aloo cheese paratha\n* Anda paratha (stuffed with spiced egg)\n* Band gobi wala paratha or Patta gobhi paratha (stuffed with [[cabbage]])\n* Batuha paratha (Lamb's quarter, Chenopodium album)\n* Boondi paratha (stuffed with salty boondi & baked with ghee)\n* Ceylon paratha (from Sri Lanka)\n* Chana paratha (chick peas)\n* Channa dal paratha (stuffed with channa [[dal]])\n* Chicken paratha\n* [[Chili parotha]] or mirchi paratha (small, spicy shredded pieces)\n* Dal paratha (stuffed with boiled, spiced and mashed dal mostly available in northwestern and western India)\n* Dhakai paratha (a type of layered paratha found in Dhaka, Bangladesh)\n* Dhaniya paratha (coriander)\n* Gajar paratha (carrot)\n* [[Gobi paratha]] (stuffed with flavoured cauliflower)\n* Jaipuri paratha\n* Kerala paratha (popular version pronounced \"porotta\")\n* Lachha paratha \u2013 tandoori (Punjabi in origin.
