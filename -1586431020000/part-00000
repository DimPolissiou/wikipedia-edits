The workpiece is reshaped by high intensity [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulsed]] [[magnetic field]]s that induce a current in the workpiece and a corresponding repulsive magnetic field, rapidly repelling portions of the workpiece. The workpiece can be reshaped without any contact from a tool, although in some instances the piece may be pressed against a die or former. The technique is sometimes called ''high velocity forming'' or ''electromagnetic pulse technology''.\n\n== Explanation ==\nA special coil is placed near the metallic workpiece, replacing the pusher in traditional forming. When the system releases its intense magnetic pulse, the coil generates a magnetic field which in turn accelerates the workpiece to hyper speed {{quantify|date=January 2016}} and onto the die.\nThe magnetic pulse and the extreme deformation speed transforms the metal into a visco-plastic state \u2013 increasing formability without affecting the native strength of the material. See the [http://www.bmax.com/technology/magnetic-pulse-forming/ magnetic pulse forming illustration] for a visualization.\n\nA rapidly changing magnetic field induces a circulating [[electric current]] within a nearby [[conductor (material)|conductor]] through [[electromagnetic induction]]. The induced current creates a corresponding magnetic field around the conductor (see [[Pinch (plasma physics)]]). Because of [[Lenz's Law]], the magnetic fields created within the conductor and work coil strongly repel each other.\n\n[[Image:Electromagnetic Forming 01.png|thumb|right|When the switch is closed, electrical energy stored in the ''capacitor bank'' (left) is discharged through the ''forming coil'' (orange) producing a rapidly changing magnetic field which induces a current to flow in the metallic ''workpiece'' (pink). The current flowing the workpiece produces a corresponding opposite magnetic field which rapidly repels the workpiece from the forming coil, reshaping the workpiece - in this case, compressing the diameter of the cylindrical tube. The reciprocal forces acting against the forming coil are resisted by the '''supportive coil casing'' (green).]]\n\nIn practice the metal workpiece to be fabricated is placed in proximity to a heavily constructed coil of wire (called the ''work coil''). A huge pulse of current is forced through the work coil by rapidly discharging a high voltage [[capacitor]] bank using an [[ignitron]] or a [[spark gap]] as a [[switch]]. This creates a rapidly oscillating, ultrastrong [[electromagnetic field]] around the work coil.\n\nThe high work coil current (typically tens or hundreds of thousands of [[amperes]]) creates ultrastrong magnetic forces that easily overcome the [[yield strength]] of the metal work piece, causing permanent deformation. The metal forming process occurs extremely quickly (typically tens of [[microsecond]]s) and, because of the large forces, portions of the workpiece undergo high [[acceleration]] reaching velocities of up to 300&nbsp;m/s.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe forming process is most often used to shrink or expand cylindrical tubing, but it can also form sheet metal by repelling the work piece onto a shaped [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] at a high   [[velocity]]. High-quality joints can be formed, either by electromagnetic pulse crimping with a mechanical interlock or by [[magnetic pulse welding|electromagnetic pulse welding]] with a true metallurgical weld. Since the forming operation involves high [[accelerate|acceleration]] and deceleration, mass of the work piece plays a critical role during the forming process. The process works best with good [[electrical conductor]]s such as copper or [[aluminum]], but it can be adapted to work with poorer conductors such as [[steel]].\n\n==Comparison with Mechanical Forming==\nElectromagnetic forming has a number of advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional mechanical forming techniques.\n\nSome of the advantages are;\n*Improved formability (the amount of stretch available without tearing)\n*Wrinkling can be greatly suppressed\n*Forming can be combined with joining and assembling with dissimilar components including glass, plastic, composites and other metals. \n*Close tolerances are possible as [[springback]] can be significantly reduced.\n*Single sided dies are sufficient which can reduce tooling costs\n*Lubricants are reduced or are unnecessary, so forming can be used in [[clean room]] conditions\n*Mechanical contact with the workpiece is not required, this avoids surface contamination and tooling marks. As a result, a surface finish can be applied to the workpiece before forming.\n\nThe principle disadvantages are;\n*Non conductive materials cannot be formed directly, but can be formed using a conductive drive plate\n*The high voltages and currents involved require careful safety considerations\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web|title=Materials and Manufacturing: Electromagnetic Forming of Aluminum Sheet |work=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory |url=http://natt.pnl.gov/tech/electro_alum.pdf |accessdate=2006-06-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218171044/http://natt.pnl.gov/tech/electro_alum.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-18 |url-status=dead }}\n* {{cite web|title=Electromagnetic Hemming Machine And Method For Joining Sheet Metal Layers |work=US Patent and Trademark Office |url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220050109769%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20050109769&RS=DN/20050109769 |accessdate=2005-09-02 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* {{cite web |title=Resources on Electromagnetic and High Velocity Forming |work=Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ohio State University |url=http://www.ecr6.ohio-state.edu/%7Edaehn/hyperplasticity.html |accessdate=2006-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219085116/http://www.ecr6.ohio-state.edu/~daehn/hyperplasticity.html |archivedate=2005-12-19 }}\n* {{cite web |title=Electromagnetic Metal Forming Handbook |work=An English translation of the Russian book by Belyy, Fertik, and Khimenko |url=http://www.mse.eng.ohio-state.edu/%7EDaehn/metalforminghb/index.html |accessdate=2006-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905155116/http://www.mse.eng.ohio-state.edu/~Daehn/metalforminghb/index.html |archivedate=2006-09-05 }}\n* {{cite web |title=FEA of electromagnetic forming using a new coupling algorithm |work=Ali M.

P. De Candolle. - Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal - October 1832 to April 1833 - Volume 14 - Pages 283 - 296 - https://books.google.com/books?id=WmQ7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA283</ref> of merchants and bankers with important ties to Geneva, [[Lyon]] and [[Paris]]. The Huber family had members in the highest institutions in the local community and was linked to other prominent local families.<ref name=FrancisSaucy2014>{{cite news | url = https://www.letemps.ch/opinions/genevois-mit-jour-secrets-abeilles| title = Le Genevois qui mit au jour les secrets des abeilles| last = Saucy| first = Francis| date = May 19, 2014| newspaper = Le Temps| publisher = Le Temps}}</ref> The family made significant contributions to the scientific and theological literature. His great-aunt, [[Marie Huber]], was known as a voluminous writer on religious and theological subjects, and as the translator and epitomizer of [[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]] (Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753). His father [[Jean Huber]] (1721\u20131786) was a prominent member of the coterie at [[Ferney]]. He was a well known artist who left several portraits of [[Voltaire]] who was a close friend.<ref name=Candolle/><ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/> He was also interested in falcons and his observations led to him writing his ''Observations sur le Vol des Oiseaux de Proie'' (Observations on the flight of birds of prey ; Geneva, 1784)<ref name=\"Britannica\">The Encyclopaedia Britannica - Volume 13 - page 845 - 1910</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait de Fran\u00e7ois Huber enfant par son p\u00e8re Jean Huber.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of young Fran\u00e7ois Huber by his father, [[Jean Huber]]]]\nFrom his early childhood, Francois was instructed in the field of literature as well as natural history, a passion he shared with his father. He attended the Coll\u00e8ge de Saussure but his health soon deteriorated. His sight started failing at the age of fifteen. His father requested the assistance of [[Th\u00e9odore Tronchin]] to treat him. He sent the young Huber to the village of [[Stains,_Seine-Saint-Denis|Stains]] near [[Paris]] to recover. There, he lived the simple existence of a peasant away from the pressure of the high society. The treatment was very successful for his health and he had fond recollection of the simple life there and of the hospitality through out his life.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nHowever, his eyesight was considered incurable by the oculist Venzel and he was facing a total blindness. He had however already met [[Marie Aim\u00e9e Lullin]], the daughter of the syndics of the Swiss Republic. They had both been companions during dances and had grown up together. Her father refused to consent to their union because of his blindness as he did not want his fortune to end in the hands of a blind man when his daughter inherited. However, Marie refused to abandon Fran\u00e7ois and decided to wait the lawful age of twenty-five when she would be able to make that decision on her own. He could still see light and interacted with others as if he could see. He later lost his sight completely but throughout his life he would say: ''I have seen, I have seen with my own eyes'' when recalling this youth and when others described things to him.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\n===Marriage===\nMarie resisted the pressures from her father to not marry this disabled man. She had, however, to wait to attain her majority, 25 years old at the time, in order to marry Fran\u00e7ois. She walked down to the altar with Fran\u00e7ois on April 28, 1776<ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/> with her maternal uncle, M. Rilliet Fatio, and married Fran\u00e7ois Huber. She was 25 years and 23 days old. At her side was a close friend and confidant, Louise El\u00e9onore Bri\u00e8re de Candolle, [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]]'s mother.  Marie later shared this story of her marriage to the young scientist, and in later life, she would honor him and recount his life after his passing.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nMarie became his reader, his secretary, and his observer, and she was very attentive in order to prevent any embarrassments in public that could have occurred from his disability. This strong loving relationship was noticed by many, including Voltaire who mentioned it in his correspondence, and it was inspiration for [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] when she described the Belmont family in her novel [[Delphine (novel)|Delphine]].<ref name=Candolle/><ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/>\n\n===Early research===\n[[File:Francois Huber Hive.png|thumb|150px|Fran\u00e7ois Huber's Folio Hive]]\nHe became interested in [[honey bee]]s after being read the works of [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|Ren\u00e9 de R\u00e9aumur]] and [[Charles Bonnet]]. He also had a conversation with the latter who was also based in Geneva. His curiosity was focused on the history of these insects. His initial desire was to verify some facts and then fill in missing information. Since he was now blind, he had to rely on the help of others. This included his wife but also his servant Fran\u00e7ois Burnens, who was fully devoted to his master. Fran\u00e7ois Burnens (1760-1837) was the son of peasants from [[Oulens-sous-\u00c9challens]] from the [[Canton of Vaud]] who arrived in 1780.<ref name=LeTemps>{{cite news | url = https://www.letemps.ch/culture/letonnante-histoire-genevois-francois-huber-apiculteur-aveugle-visionnaire| title = L'\u00e9tonnante Histoire du Genevois Fran\u00e7ois Huber, apiculteur aveugle et visionnaire| last = Koutchoumoff| first = Lisbeth| date = November 16, 2018| newspaper = Le Temps| publisher = Le Temps}}</ref><ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/> Huber taught him how to observe and directed him through questioning. He leveraged his memories of his youth and the testimonials of his wife and friends.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nThrough his \"observation\", he discovered that the [[queen bee]] did not mate in the hive but in the air and detailed how the timing of this event was essential. He also confirmed the discovery by A.M. Schirach that bees are able to convert eggs into queens by the use of food ([[royal jelly]]) and that worker bees can also lay eggs. He described the battles between queens, the killing of [[Drone (bee)|drones]] at the end of the summer and what happens when a queen is replaced by a newly introduced queen. He also proved that bees used their antennae to communicate. He looked at the dimensions of the cells and how they influence the shape of the insects, the way the larvae spins silk to make its cocoons. He showed that queens are [[Oviparity|oviparitous]]. He looked at the ways swarms formed and was the first to provide an accurate biological history of bee colonies.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nThese observations were made using a new type of hive in which each comb had glass sides, which Huber developed; these hives were the ancestors of our modern observation hives. Until then, hives had been circular and made of straw. These new hives opened as books with each frame visible to view.<ref name=LeTemps/> These allowed the team to observe the bees and follow them around. These discoveries would not have been possible without the skills and bravery of Fran\u00e7ois Burnens, who was fully committed to discovering the truth. It is said that he would face the attacks of an entire hive just to learn a fact.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\n===First publication===\n[[File:Drone Organs - Francois Huber.png|thumb|150px|Drone Organs illustrated by Pierre Huber]]\nThe results of these observations were the publication of ''Nouvelles Observations sur les Abeilles'' (New observations on bees) in Geneva in 1792. The 800-page volume was made of the letters that Fran\u00e7ois had sent to Charles Bonnet, who happened to be his uncle. It was soon translated into English (1806) and into German.<ref name=LeTemps/> It was very well received by the scientific community not just because of the discoveries but also because he had overcome such a disability. He was also welcomed by most of the academies of Europe, especially the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. It influenced other scientists, including the renowned naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], who owned a copy and made a commentary of the book in his famous [[On the Origin of Species]].<ref>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin - 1859 - page 230</ref> He also mentions Pierre Huber.<ref name=LeTemps/><ref name=Candolle/><ref>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin - 1859 - https://books.google.com/books?id=cAtfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP5</ref>\n\nThe poet [[Jacques Delille]] in his ''Chant VII, R\u00e8gne Animal'' celebrated Huber's blindness and discovery:<ref>\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de J.

P. De Candolle. - Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal - October 1832 to April 1833 - Volume 14 - Pages 283 - 296 - https://books.google.com/books?id=WmQ7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA283</ref> of merchants and bankers with important ties to Geneva, [[Lyon]] and [[Paris]]. The Huber family had members in the highest institutions in the local community and was linked to other prominent local families.<ref name=FrancisSaucy2014>{{cite news | url = https://www.letemps.ch/opinions/genevois-mit-jour-secrets-abeilles| title = Le Genevois qui mit au jour les secrets des abeilles| last = Saucy| first = Francis| date = May 19, 2014| newspaper = Le Temps| publisher = Le Temps}}</ref> The family made significant contributions to the scientific and theological literature. His great-aunt, [[Marie Huber]], was known as a voluminous writer on religious and theological subjects, and as the translator and epitomizer of [[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]] (Amsterdam, 3 vols., 1753). His father [[Jean Huber]] (1721\u20131786) was a prominent member of the coterie at [[Ferney]]. He was a well known artist who left several portraits of [[Voltaire]] who was a close friend.<ref name=Candolle/><ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/> He was also interested in falcons and his observations led to him writing his ''Observations sur le Vol des Oiseaux de Proie'' (Observations on the flight of birds of prey ; Geneva, 1784)<ref name=\"Britannica\">The Encyclopaedia Britannica - Volume 13 - page 845 - 1910</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait de Fran\u00e7ois Huber enfant par son p\u00e8re Jean Huber.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of young Fran\u00e7ois Huber by his father, [[Jean Huber]]]]\nFrom his early childhood, Francois was instructed in the field of literature as well as natural history, a passion he shared with his father. He attended the Coll\u00e8ge de Saussure but his health soon deteriorated. His sight started failing at the age of fifteen. His father requested the assistance of [[Th\u00e9odore Tronchin]] to treat him. He sent the young Huber to the village of [[Stains,_Seine-Saint-Denis|Stains]] near [[Paris]] to recover. There, he lived the simple existence of a peasant away from the pressure of the high society. The treatment was very successful for his health and he had fond recollection of the simple life there and of the hospitality through out his life.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nHowever, his eyesight was considered incurable by the oculist Venzel and he was facing a total blindness. He had however already met [[Marie Aim\u00e9e Lullin]], the daughter of the syndics of the Swiss Republic. They had both been companions during dances and had grown up together. Her father refused to consent to their union because of his blindness as he did not want his fortune to end in the hands of a blind man when his daughter inherited. However, Marie refused to abandon Fran\u00e7ois and decided to wait the lawful age of twenty-five when she would be able to make that decision on her own. He could still see light and interacted with others as if he could see. He later lost his sight completely but throughout his life he would say: ''I have seen, I have seen with my own eyes'' when recalling this youth and when others described things to him.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\n===Marriage===\nMarie resisted the pressures from her father to not marry this disabled man. She had, however, to wait to attain her majority, 25 years old at the time, in order to marry Fran\u00e7ois. She walked down to the altar with Fran\u00e7ois on April 28, 1776<ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/> with her maternal uncle, M. Rilliet Fatio, and married Fran\u00e7ois Huber. She was 25 years and 23 days old. At her side was a close friend and confidant, Louise El\u00e9onore Bri\u00e8re de Candolle, [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]]'s mother.  Marie later shared this story of her marriage to the young scientist, and in later life, she would honor him and recount his life after his passing.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nMarie became his reader, his secretary, and his observer, and she was very attentive in order to prevent any embarrassments in public that could have occurred from his disability. This strong loving relationship was noticed by many, including Voltaire who mentioned it in his correspondence, and it was inspiration for [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] when she described the Belmont family in her novel [[Delphine (novel)|Delphine]].<ref name=Candolle/><ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/>\n\n===Early research===\n[[File:Francois Huber Hive.png|thumb|150px|Fran\u00e7ois Huber's Folio Hive]]\nHe became interested in [[honey bee]]s after being read the works of [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|Ren\u00e9 de R\u00e9aumur]] and [[Charles Bonnet]]. He also had a conversation with the latter who was also based in Geneva. His curiosity was focused on the history of these insects. His initial desire was to verify some facts and then fill in missing information. Since he was now blind, he had to rely on the help of others. This included his wife but also his servant Fran\u00e7ois Burnens, who was fully devoted to his master. Fran\u00e7ois Burnens (1760-1837) was the son of peasants from [[Oulens-sous-\u00c9challens]] from the [[Canton of Vaud]] who arrived in 1780.<ref name=LeTemps>{{cite news | url = https://www.letemps.ch/culture/letonnante-histoire-genevois-francois-huber-apiculteur-aveugle-visionnaire| title = L'\u00e9tonnante Histoire du Genevois Fran\u00e7ois Huber, apiculteur aveugle et visionnaire| last = Koutchoumoff| first = Lisbeth| date = November 16, 2018| newspaper = Le Temps| publisher = Le Temps}}</ref><ref name=FrancisSaucy2014/> Huber taught him how to observe and directed him through questioning. He leveraged his memories of his youth and the testimonials of his wife and friends.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nThrough his \"observation\", he discovered that the [[queen bee]] did not mate in the hive but in the air and detailed how the timing of this event was essential. He also confirmed the discovery by A.M. Schirach that bees are able to convert eggs into queens by the use of food ([[royal jelly]]) and that worker bees can also lay eggs. He described the battles between queens, the killing of [[Drone (bee)|drones]] at the end of the summer and what happens when a queen is replaced by a newly introduced queen. He also proved that bees used their antennae to communicate. He looked at the dimensions of the cells and how they influence the shape of the insects, the way the larvae spins silk to make its cocoons. He showed that queens are [[Oviparity|oviparitous]]. He looked at the ways swarms formed and was the first to provide an accurate biological history of bee colonies.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\nThese observations were made using a new type of hive in which each comb had glass sides, which Huber developed; these hives were the ancestors of our modern observation hives. Until then, hives had been circular and made of straw. These new hives opened as books with each frame visible to view.<ref name=LeTemps/> These allowed the team to observe the bees and follow them around. These discoveries would not have been possible without the skills and bravery of Fran\u00e7ois Burnens, who was fully committed to discovering the truth. It is said that he would face the attacks of an entire hive just to learn a fact.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\n===First publication===\n[[File:Drone Organs - Francois Huber.png|thumb|150px|Drone Organs illustrated by Pierre Huber]]\nThe results of these observations were the publication of ''Nouvelles Observations sur les Abeilles'' (New observations on bees) in Geneva in 1792. The 800-page volume was made of the letters that Fran\u00e7ois had sent to Charles Bonnet, who happened to be his uncle. It was soon translated into English (1806) and into German.<ref name=LeTemps/> It was very well received by the scientific community not just because of the discoveries but also because he had overcome such a disability. He was also welcomed by most of the academies of Europe, especially the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. It influenced other scientists, including the renowned naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], who owned a copy and made a commentary of the book in his famous [[On the Origin of Species]].<ref>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin - 1859 - page 230</ref> He also mentions Pierre Huber.<ref name=LeTemps/><ref name=Candolle/><ref>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin - 1859 - https://books.google.com/books?id=cAtfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP5</ref>\n\nThe poet [[Jacques Delille]] in his ''Chant VII, R\u00e8gne Animal'' celebrated Huber's blindness and discovery:<ref>\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de J.

It had been speculated without sufficient proof that it came from the honey.

He started his apprenticeship with his father as an observer. He would go on to publish his own books, not on bees but on ants.

He was able to prove that bees consume oxygen like other animals. This begged the question of how they survived with such a large population in enclosed hives with only a small entrance for fresh air. He was able to prove for the first time that bees used their wings to circulate the air, creating adequate ventilation. In order to analyse the air, he worked with [[Jean Senebier]], another Geneva scientist who was researching this question with regards to vegetables. The two became friends and they published the ''M\u00e9moires sur l'Influence de l'Air et de Diverses Substances Gazeuses dans la Germination de Diff\u00e9rentes Graines'' (Memoirs on the Influence of Air and of Various Gaseous Substances on the Germination of Different Seeds) in which they demonstrated the need for oxygen in germination.<ref name=Candolle/>\n\n===Last years===\nFrancois Huber spent his last years in [[Lausanne]] being cared for by his daughter, Marie Anne de Molin.

The main advantage of this process is the ability of using sunlight with light sensitivity up to 450&nbsp;nm, thus avoiding the high costs of UV lamps and electrical energy. These reactions have been proven more efficient than the other photocatalysis but the disadvantages of the process are the low pH values which are required, since iron precipitates at higher pH values and the fact that iron has to be removed after treatment.\n\n===Heterogeneous photocatalysis===\nHeterogeneous catalysis has the catalyst in a different phase from the reactants. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a discipline which includes a large variety of reactions: mild or total oxidations, dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer, <sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>\u2013<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and deuterium-alkane isotopic exchange, metal deposition, water detoxification, gaseous pollutant removal, etc.\n\nMost common heterogeneous photocatalysts are transition metal oxides and semiconductors, which have unique characteristics. Unlike the metals which have a continuum of electronic states, semiconductors possess a void energy region where no energy levels are available to promote recombination of an electron and hole produced by photoactivation in the solid. The void region, which extends from the top of the filled valence band to the bottom of the vacant conduction band, is called the band gap.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr00035a013|title=Photocatalysis on TiO2 Surfaces: Principles, Mechanisms, and Selected Results|year=1995|last1=Linsebigler|first1=Amy L.|last2=Lu|first2=Guangquan.|last3=Yates|first3=John T.|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=95|issue=3|pages=735\u2013758}}</ref> When a photon with energy equal to or greater than the materials band gap is absorbed by the semiconductor, an electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band, generating a positive hole in the valence band. Such a photogenerated electron-hole pair is termed an ''exciton''. The excited electron and hole can recombine and release the energy gained from the excitation of the electron as heat. Exciton recombination is undesirable and higher levels lead to an inefficient photocatalyst.

Higher amounts of oxygen and UV radiation increased the degradation of the model organics. These particles can be placed on floating substrates, making it easier to recover and catalyze the reaction. This is relevant since oil slicks float on top of the ocean and photons from the sun target the surface more than the inner depth of the ocean. By covering floating substrates like woodchips with epoxy adhesives, water logging can be prevented and TiO<sub>2</sub> particles can stick to the substrates. With more research, this method should be applicable to other organics.\n*Decontamination of water with photocatalysis and adsorption: the removal and destruction of organic contaminants in groundwater can be addressed through the impregnation of adsorbents with photoactive catalysts. These adsorbents attract contaminating organic atoms/molecules like [[tetrachloroethylene]] to them. The photoactive catalysts impregnated inside speed up the degradation of the organics. Adsorbents are placed in packed beds for 18 hours, which would attract and degrade the organic compounds. The spent adsorbents would then be placed in regeneration fluid, essentially taking away all organics still attached by passing hot water counter-current to the flow of water during the adsorption process to speed up the reaction. The regeneration fluid then gets passed through the fixed beds of silica gel photocatalysts to remove and decompose the rest of the organics left. Through the use of fixed bed reactors, the regeneration of adsorbents can help increase the efficiency.\n*Some photoactive catalysts have been introduced over the last decade, such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO nano rodes.

The main advantage of this process is the ability of using sunlight with light sensitivity up to 450&nbsp;nm, thus avoiding the high costs of UV lamps and electrical energy. These reactions have been proven more efficient than the other photocatalysis but the disadvantages of the process are the low pH values which are required, since iron precipitates at higher pH values and the fact that iron has to be removed after treatment.\n\n===Heterogeneous photocatalysis===\nHeterogeneous catalysis has the catalyst in a different phase from the reactants. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a discipline which includes a large variety of reactions: mild or total oxidations, dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer, <sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>\u2013<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and deuterium-alkane isotopic exchange, metal deposition, water detoxification, gaseous pollutant removal, etc.\n\nMost common heterogeneous photocatalysts are transition metal oxides and semiconductors, which have unique characteristics. Unlike the metals which have a continuum of electronic states, semiconductors possess a void energy region where no energy levels are available to promote recombination of an electron and hole produced by photoactivation in the solid. The void region, which extends from the top of the filled valence band to the bottom of the vacant conduction band, is called the band gap.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr00035a013|title=Photocatalysis on TiO2 Surfaces: Principles, Mechanisms, and Selected Results|year=1995|last1=Linsebigler|first1=Amy L.|last2=Lu|first2=Guangquan.|last3=Yates|first3=John T.|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=95|issue=3|pages=735\u2013758}}</ref> When a photon with energy equal to or greater than the materials band gap is absorbed by the semiconductor, an electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band, generating a positive hole in the valence band. Such a photogenerated electron-hole pair is termed an ''exciton''. The excited electron and hole can recombine and release the energy gained from the excitation of the electron as heat. Exciton recombination is undesirable and higher levels lead to an inefficient photocatalyst. For this reason efforts to develop functional photocatalysts often emphasize extending exciton lifetime, improving electron-hole separation using diverse approaches that often rely on structural features such as phase hetero-junctions (e.g. [[anatase]]-[[rutile]] interfaces), noble-metal [[nanoparticle]]s, [[silicon nanowire]]s and substitutional cation doping.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karvinen, S.;Hirva, P;Pakkanen|first=T.A.|date=2003|title=Ab initio quantum chemical studies of cluster models for doped anatase and rutile TiO2|url=|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure THEOCHEM|volume=626|issue=1\u20133|pages=271\u2013277|doi=10.1016/S0166-1280(03)00108-8}}</ref>  The ultimate goal of photocatalyst design is to facilitate reactions between the excited electrons with oxidants to produce reduced products, and/or reactions between the generated holes with reductants to produce oxidized products. Due to the generation of positive holes and electrons, oxidation-reduction reactions take place at the surface of semiconductors.\n\nIn one mechanism of the oxidative reaction, the positive holes react with the moisture present on the surface and produce a hydroxyl radical.

Higher amounts of oxygen and UV radiation increased the degradation of the model organics. These particles can be placed on floating substrates, making it easier to recover and catalyze the reaction. This is relevant since oil slicks float on top of the ocean and photons from the sun target the surface more than the inner depth of the ocean. By covering floating substrates like woodchips with epoxy adhesives, water logging can be prevented and TiO<sub>2</sub> particles can stick to the substrates. With more research, this method should be applicable to other organics.\n*Decontamination of water with photocatalysis and adsorption: the removal and destruction of organic contaminants in groundwater can be addressed through the impregnation of adsorbents with photoactive catalysts. These adsorbents attract contaminating organic atoms/molecules like [[tetrachloroethylene]] to them. The photoactive catalysts impregnated inside speed up the degradation of the organics. Adsorbents are placed in packed beds for 18 hours, which would attract and degrade the organic compounds. The spent adsorbents would then be placed in regeneration fluid, essentially taking away all organics still attached by passing hot water counter-current to the flow of water during the adsorption process to speed up the reaction. The regeneration fluid then gets passed through the fixed beds of silica gel photocatalysts to remove and decompose the rest of the organics left. Through the use of fixed bed reactors, the regeneration of adsorbents can help increase the efficiency.\n*Some photoactive catalysts have been introduced over the last decade, such as TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO nano rodes.

It is on [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] east of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and had a population of 23,229 at the 2016 census. It is part of the Windsor census metropolitan area, and is a part of the Windsor-Essex County region along with [[Amherstburg]], [[Kingsville, Ontario|Kingsville]], [[Lakeshore, Ontario|Lakeshore]], [[LaSalle, Ontario|LaSalle]] and [[Leamington, Ontario|Leamington.]]\n\nTecumseh enjoys long summers and mild winters. Originally a small [[Franco-Ontarian]] settlement, Tecumseh now offers many restaurants, shopping areas, medical facilities, as well as industrial and commercial enterprises.\n\nFood processing is a major industry in Tecumseh, as [[Bonduelle]] owns a food processing plant near the heart of the town. The plant originally was Green Giant 1931 (Fine Foods of Canada) and [[Pillsbury Company]].  [[Green Giant]] sold in the late 1990s to Family Tradition Foods. Family Traditions sold the food processing plant to Carri\u00e8re Foods in 2006. Carri\u00e8re Foods was then purchased in 2007 by [[Bonduelle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20070607/281943128460688|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref>\n\nThe Tecumseh Corn Festival has been recognized as one of the Top 50 Festivals in Ontario by Festivals and Events Ontario, which is quite an honour considering over 3000 festivals taking place in Ontario each year.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.festivalsandeventsontario.ca/main.cfm?id=B7BB6628-B6A7-8AA0-65E46F7E43B99780\n |title       = Top 100 Ontario Festivals Program\n |publisher   = Festivals and Events Ontario\n |accessdate  = August 19, 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827014232/http://www.festivalsandeventsontario.ca/main.cfm?id=B7BB6628-B6A7-8AA0-65E46F7E43B99780\n |archivedate = August 27, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nTecumseh is surrounded by Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tecumseh.ca/business/economic-development/climate|title=Climate|date=2009-02-18|publisher=Town of Tecumseh|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref> [[Detroit]] is easily accessible to Tecumseh residents by the [[Ambassador Bridge]] or the [[Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel]], both of which are located within the neighbouring municipality of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1792, Tecumseh, then known as Ryegate Postal Station, had only three families. Ryegate Postal Station was renamed in 1912 during the death [[centennial]] of [[Tecumseh]], leader of the [[Shawnee Tribe]] who was killed at battle in the [[War of 1812]]. Tecumseh had a large [[Franco-Ontarian]] population. When nearby Windsor started to grow into the area, there arose conflict between the [[Loyalists]] and the [[Canadiens]].\n\nThe creation of Tecumseh Road in 1838 and the establishment of the [[Great Western Railway]] opened up the area for settlement. The town became an important railway depot and stopover for travellers. County residents took horse and buggy into Tecumseh and then transferred onto the train, journeying by rail the rest of the way into Windsor. Several hotels were started in Tecumseh to accommodate travellers. The Bedell Hotel, the Soulliere Inn, the Hebert and the Hotel Perreault were some of the places most frequented by travellers and locals alike.\n\nThe French were for the most part the original settlers of Tecumseh, the majority of them descendants of the Frenchmen who had established their seigneural land holdings along the banks of the [[Detroit River]] in 1700s.\n\nAs the Town of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] grew, Tecumseh began to experience new blood when the overflow of immigrants coming to the city began to settle in the peripheral regions as well. Indicative of the change was the mix-up created by the introduction of the tomato to the area of Tecumseh. Many of the English residents of the community refused to touch the suspicious red vegetable believing it to be a \u2033Love Potion\u2033 concocted by the amorous Frenchmen. The first post office was located on the northeast corner of Tecumseh and Lesperance Roads and was operated by a Mr. Christie. Some of the first businesses in Tecumseh included a lumber mill operated by J.B.Cada; a grocery store operated by Arthur Cecile; a cheese factory on Banwell Road operated by Joseph Breault; a bakery owned by John Dugell; three butcher shops; a canning factory and a brewery eventually closed under [[Carling Brewery]]. In 1921 it was felt that Tecumseh was not getting its fair share of improvements in proportion to the taxes paid to the municipality of Sandwich East. A group of people headed by Malcolm Clapp petitioned the legislature to separate from the township and incorporate as the Town of Tecumseh with a population of 978. Dr. Paul Poisson was appointed as the first mayor of the town. The real growth in Tecumseh occurred in 1931 with the establishment of the Green Giant Factory as Fine Foods of Canada. Green Giant (now Bonduelle) is still located in Tecumseh and continues to employ full and part-time workers.\n\nAs the population grew, so did the demands for services. The [[Ontario Provincial Police]] started policing the Town in 1948 with 2 officers. In 1922 a fire chief was appointed although no fire department was in existence, the fires were fought by town volunteers.\n\nIn 1999, as part of a reorganization of [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]], Tecumseh was merged with the Village of [[St. Clair Beach, Ontario|St. Clair Beach]], and the [[Sandwich South Township, Ontario|Township of Sandwich South]] into the Town of Tecumseh. In 2003, the [[Windsor, Ontario|City of Windsor]] annexed approximately {{convert|23|km2}} from the Town of Tecumseh.  Now considered to be a [[bedroom community]] of Windsor, Tecumseh is often cited as an example of [[urban sprawl]]; new subdivisions have developed on some of Canada's most valuable agricultural land beginning in the late 1980s.\n\n==Communities==\nBesides the town proper of Tecumseh itself, the town of Tecumseh comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including Fairplay, Maidstone, Oldcastle, Paquette, Paquette Corners (partially) and St. Clair Beach (formerly from Maidstone Township).\n\n==Governance==\n=== Town Council ===\nThe 2018 Municipal Election in the Town of Tecumseh, which took place on October 22, had a voter turnout of 37.43%.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=2018 Elections Official Results |url=http://www.tecumseh.ca/system/files/2018%20FINAL%20Results.pdf |publisher=Town of Tecumseh |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> The official results  for the municipal election were signed off by Laura Moy, Director of Corporate Services/Clerk for the Town of Tecumseh.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Mayor: Gary McNamara \n* Deputy Mayor: Joe Bachetti \n* Ward 1: Andrew Dowie \n* Ward 2: William Altenhof \n* Ward 3: Rick (Rico) Tonial \n* Ward 4: Brian Houston \n* Ward 5: Tania Jobin\n\nThe positions of Mayor, Ward 1 Councillor, Ward 2 Councillor, and Ward 5 Councillor were all acclaimed.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1871|200\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|300\n|1921|978\n|1931|2129\n|1941|2412\n|1951|3543\n|1961|4476\n|1971|5165\n|1981|6364\n|1991|10495\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|23151\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|25105\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|24224\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|23610\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|23229\n}}\n\nTecumseh has a population of 23,229 people, a decrease of 1.6% from the 2011 census count.

It is on [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] east of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and had a population of 23,229 at the 2016 census. It is part of the Windsor census metropolitan area, and is a part of the Windsor-Essex County region along with [[Amherstburg]], [[Kingsville, Ontario|Kingsville]], [[Lakeshore, Ontario|Lakeshore]], [[LaSalle, Ontario|LaSalle]] and [[Leamington, Ontario|Leamington.]]\n\nTecumseh enjoys long summers and mild winters. Originally a small [[Franco-Ontarian]] settlement, Tecumseh now offers many restaurants, shopping areas, medical facilities, as well as industrial and commercial enterprises.\n\nFood processing is a major industry in Tecumseh, as [[Bonduelle]] owns a food processing plant near the heart of the town. The plant originally was Green Giant 1931 (Fine Foods of Canada) and [[Pillsbury Company]].  [[Green Giant]] sold in the late 1990s to Family Tradition Foods. Family Traditions sold the food processing plant to Carri\u00e8re Foods in 2006. Carri\u00e8re Foods was then purchased in 2007 by [[Bonduelle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20070607/281943128460688|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref>\n\nThe Tecumseh Corn Festival has been recognized as one of the Top 50 Festivals in Ontario by Festivals and Events Ontario, which is quite an honour considering over 3000 festivals taking place in Ontario each year.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.festivalsandeventsontario.ca/main.cfm?id=B7BB6628-B6A7-8AA0-65E46F7E43B99780\n |title       = Top 100 Ontario Festivals Program\n |publisher   = Festivals and Events Ontario\n |accessdate  = August 19, 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827014232/http://www.festivalsandeventsontario.ca/main.cfm?id=B7BB6628-B6A7-8AA0-65E46F7E43B99780\n |archivedate = August 27, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nTecumseh is surrounded by Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tecumseh.ca/business/economic-development/climate|title=Climate|date=2009-02-18|publisher=Town of Tecumseh|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref> [[Detroit]] is easily accessible to Tecumseh residents by the [[Ambassador Bridge]] or the [[Detroit\u2013Windsor Tunnel]], both of which are located within the neighbouring municipality of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1792, Tecumseh, then known as Ryegate Postal Station, had only three families. Ryegate Postal Station was renamed in 1912 during the death [[centennial]] of [[Tecumseh]], leader of the [[Shawnee Tribe]] who was killed at battle in the [[War of 1812]]. Tecumseh had a large [[Franco-Ontarian]] population. When nearby Windsor started to grow into the area, there arose conflict between the [[Loyalists]] and the [[Canadiens]].\n\nThe creation of Tecumseh Road in 1838 and the establishment of the [[Great Western Railway]] opened up the area for settlement. The town became an important railway depot and stopover for travellers. County residents took horse and buggy into Tecumseh and then transferred onto the train, journeying by rail the rest of the way into Windsor. Several hotels were started in Tecumseh to accommodate travellers. The Bedell Hotel, the Soulliere Inn, the Hebert and the Hotel Perreault were some of the places most frequented by travellers and locals alike.\n\nThe French were for the most part the original settlers of Tecumseh, the majority of them descendants of the Frenchmen who had established their seigneural land holdings along the banks of the [[Detroit River]] in 1700s.\n\nAs the Town of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] grew, Tecumseh began to experience new blood when the overflow of immigrants coming to the city began to settle in the peripheral regions as well. Indicative of the change was the mix-up created by the introduction of the tomato to the area of Tecumseh. Many of the English residents of the community refused to touch the suspicious red vegetable believing it to be a \u2033Love Potion\u2033 concocted by the amorous Frenchmen. The first post office was located on the northeast corner of Tecumseh and Lesperance Roads and was operated by a Mr. Christie. Some of the first businesses in Tecumseh included a lumber mill operated by J.B.Cada; a grocery store operated by Arthur Cecile; a cheese factory on Banwell Road operated by Joseph Breault; a bakery owned by John Dugell; three butcher shops; a canning factory and a brewery eventually closed under [[Carling Brewery]]. In 1921 it was felt that Tecumseh was not getting its fair share of improvements in proportion to the taxes paid to the municipality of Sandwich East. A group of people headed by Malcolm Clapp petitioned the legislature to separate from the township and incorporate as the Town of Tecumseh with a population of 978. Dr. Paul Poisson was appointed as the first mayor of the town. The real growth in Tecumseh occurred in 1931 with the establishment of the Green Giant Factory as Fine Foods of Canada. Green Giant (now Bonduelle) is still located in Tecumseh and continues to employ full and part-time workers.\n\nAs the population grew, so did the demands for services. The [[Ontario Provincial Police]] started policing the Town in 1948 with 2 officers. In 1922 a fire chief was appointed although no fire department was in existence, the fires were fought by town volunteers.\n\nIn 1999, as part of a reorganization of [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]], Tecumseh was merged with the Village of [[St. Clair Beach, Ontario|St. Clair Beach]], and the [[Sandwich South Township, Ontario|Township of Sandwich South]] into the Town of Tecumseh. In 2003, the [[Windsor, Ontario|City of Windsor]] annexed approximately {{convert|23|km2}} from the Town of Tecumseh.  Now considered to be a [[bedroom community]] of Windsor, Tecumseh is often cited as an example of [[urban sprawl]]; new subdivisions have developed on some of Canada's most valuable agricultural land beginning in the late 1980s.\n\n==Communities==\nBesides the town proper of Tecumseh itself, the town of Tecumseh comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including Fairplay, Maidstone, Oldcastle, Paquette, Paquette Corners (partially) and St. Clair Beach (formerly from Maidstone Township).\n\n==Governance==\n=== Town Council ===\nThe 2018 Municipal Election in the Town of Tecumseh, which took place on October 22, had a voter turnout of 37.43%.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=2018 Elections Official Results |url=http://www.tecumseh.ca/system/files/2018%20FINAL%20Results.pdf |publisher=Town of Tecumseh |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> The official results  for the municipal election were signed off by Laura Moy, Director of Corporate Services/Clerk for the Town of Tecumseh.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Mayor: Gary McNamara \n* Deputy Mayor: Joe Bachetti \n* Ward 1: Andrew Dowie \n* Ward 2: William Altenhof \n* Ward 3: Rick (Rico) Tonial \n* Ward 4: Brian Houston \n* Ward 5: Tania Jobin\n\nThe positions of Mayor, Ward 1 Councillor, Ward 2 Councillor, and Ward 5 Councillor were all acclaimed.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1871|200\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|300\n|1921|978\n|1931|2129\n|1941|2412\n|1951|3543\n|1961|4476\n|1971|5165\n|1981|6364\n|1991|10495\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|23151\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|25105\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|24224\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|23610\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|23229\n}}\n\nTecumseh has a population of 23,229 people, a decrease of 1.6% from the 2011 census count.

He served as the only governor of the [[Illinois Territory]] from 1809 to 1818, as one of the first two [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|United States Senators from Illinois]] from 1818 to 1824, and as the third [[Governor of Illinois]] from 1826 to 1830.

Jensen]] (1978), ''Illinois: A History'', [[University of Illinois Press]], 27.</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Maryland]], Edwards began his political career in [[Kentucky]], where he served as a legislator and judge. He rose to the position of Chief Justice of the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] in 1808, at the time Kentucky's highest court. In 1809, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James Madison]] appointed him to govern the newly created Illinois Territory. He held that post for three terms, overseeing the territory's transition first to democratic \"second grade\" government, and then to statehood in 1818.  On its second day in session, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] elected Edwards to the U.S. Senate, where conflict with rivals damaged him politically.<ref>Robert P. Howard (1988), ''Mostly Good and Competent Men: Illinois Governors, 1818\u20131988'', ''Illinois Issues'' and the Illinois State Historical Society, 33.</ref>\n\nEdwards won an unlikely 1826 election to become Governor of Illinois.<ref name=\"Howard, 35\">Howard, 35.</ref> Conflict with the legislature over state bank regulations marked Edwards' administration, as did the pursuit of [[Indian removal]]. As governor or territorial governor he twice sent Illinois militia against Native Americans, in the [[Illinois Territory in the War of 1812|War of 1812]] and the [[Winnebago War]], and signed treaties for the cession of Native American land. Edwards returned to private life when his term ended in 1830 and died of [[cholera]] two years later.\n\n==Early life==\nNinian Edwards was born in 1775 to the prominent [[Edwards-Lincoln-Porter family|Edwards family]] in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]].

Its European-American and African-American populations were almost entirely concentrated in the south, in the region later known as [[Little Egypt (region)|Egypt]].  President [[James Madison]] first appointed Kentucky politician [[John Boyle (congressman)|John Boyle]] as its governor. Boyle collected his salary for the position for 21&nbsp;days but then resigned to take Edwards' job as Kentucky Chief Justice, while friends in Washington helped secure Edwards' appointment as territorial governor. In the meantime, Territorial Secretary [[Nathaniel Pope]], a cousin of Edwards, had to assume the powers of acting governor, creating Illinois' first counties and appointing officials to form the new government.<ref>Howard, 39\u201340.</ref> Only 34&nbsp;years old at the time of his appointment, Ninian Edwards is the youngest man ever to govern Illinois as either a state or a territory.<ref name=\"Howard, 39\"/>\n\nEdwards settled in the [[American Bottom]] on land he received as a grant upon his appointment as governor. He named his new farm Elvirade, after his wife. Along with his family, Edwards brought a number of slaves, whom he did not free even though the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 had made slavery illegal in the territory. An 1803 \"Law Concerning Servants\" had been promulgated for the [[Indiana Territory]] by then-Governor [[William Henry Harrison]] that maintained the status of people brought into the territory \"under contract to serve another in any trade or occupation.\" The law, which remained in force in the Illinois territory, permitted slavery to persist for decades under the guise of [[indentured servant|indentured servitude]].<ref>Solon J.

Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion as much as he could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents.<ref>Buck, 194.</ref> He attempted to do the same for militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.<ref>Howard, 40.</ref>\n\nIn 1812, Edwards successfully persuaded Congress to modify a provision of the 1787 Ordinance limiting voting rights to freeholders of {{convert|50|acre}} of land. Due to long-running disputes over fraudulently sold lands, very few Illinois frontiersmen could qualify. At Edwards' urging, Congress granted the Illinois Territory [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]], making it the most democratic U.S. territory at the time.<ref>Howard, 41.</ref> In April, Edwards held a referendum on moving to second-grade government, allowing the people of Illinois to elect a legislature and a non-voting delegate to Congress.

Relations between Illinois settlers and Native Americans worsened throughout the territory during 1810 and 1811. By June 1811, Governor Edwards ordered the construction of a series of [[blockhouse]]s and called out three companies of militia.<ref>Holden, Robert J.

In his capacity as commander in chief, Edwards gathered 350 mounted rangers and volunteers near [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]] and personally led an expedition north to [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. After burning two Kickapoo villages on the [[Sangamon River]] along the way, the militia advanced on Peoria itself.<ref>Holden, 164.</ref>  All told, the short campaign burned several villages and inflicted dozens of casualties before returning.

Thomas continued for the rest of his time as governor.  Edwards, along with much of the legislature, criticized the territory's judges for their inactivity. Among their complaints were that the judges did not hold court often enough and spent too much time absent from the territory. The legislature passed a bill in 1814 to reform the territory's judicial system. The judges refused to acknowledge the act, claiming that they were outside the jurisdiction of the legislature. In 1815 the issue was resolved by Congress, which passed a law supporting Edwards and the legislature.<ref>Howard, 43; Buck, 205.</ref>\n\nIn December 1817, Edwards, responding to a movement for statehood led by his ally [[Daniel Pope Cook]], recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow [[Missouri]] to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.<ref>Buck, 215.</ref>\n\nIn order to emphasize to Congress that Illinois would be a free state, the legislature passed in January 1818 a bill that would both abolish Illinois' \"indentured servant\" system of ''de facto'' slavery, and prohibit Illinois' future Constitution from reinstating it.<ref>Buck, 216\u2013217.</ref>  Governor Edwards issued his only veto to send the bill back to the legislature, and it was never revised. He made his objections on constitutional grounds, but he also had a conflict of interest as the owner of several slaves himself.<ref>Buck, 218, and Howard, 43.</ref>\n\nDuring Edwards' terms as territorial governor, Illinois' population more than tripled, from 12,282 in 1810 to 40,258 in 1818 (a census was finally conducted later that year).<ref>\"Resident Population and Apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives: Illinois\", [[United States Census Bureau]], [https://www.census.gov/dmd/www/resapport/states/illinois.pdf].

Its [[Constitution of Illinois|constitution]] was finished in August 1818; elections were held in September; and in October, the first [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] met in Kaskaskia. On October 6, Ninian Edwards stepped down, and Shadrach Bond was inaugurated as Illinois' first governor. The following day the new state legislature voted for Illinois' two members of the U.S. Senate. Edwards was quickly chosen on the first ballot; his rival Thomas was only elected after the fourth.<ref>Buck, 303\u2013304.</ref>  Edwards and Thomas then drew straws to determine their respective terms: Thomas was placed in [[Classes of United States Senators|Class II of the Senate]] and could serve until 1823, while Edwards was placed in Class III and had to face reelection in February 1819.

He resigned his Senate seat on March 4, 1824, to take a job he wanted as the first United States [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|Minister to Mexico]]. While en route to his new position, Edwards was called back to Washington to testify before a special House committee concerning the \"A.B. Plot\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Unable to substantiate his claims, Edwards resigned his diplomatic post, to be replaced by [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]].\n\nBack in Illinois, Edwards settled in [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]], a town whose site he had once owned before selling off its lots at a profit.<ref>Howard, 44.</ref>\n\n==State governorship==\n\n===Election of 1826===\nWhen he returned to Illinois, Edwards appeared to be a discredited politician. He no longer had a loyal coalition in the General Assembly to re-elect him to the U.S. Senate. His actions in the \"A.B. Plot\" had made him lose favor with President Adams; therefore he could not expect another federal appointment.<ref name=\"Howard, 34\"/> In addition, supporters of [[Andrew Jackson]] were becoming a force in Illinois politics.  Illinois frontier voters so admired Jackson that soon, for the first time, they would give their support to a national party, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>Jensen, 28.</ref> Ninian Edwards never criticized Jackson, but as an Adams-Clay Republican Senator he was not part of Jackson's growing coalition. Jacksonians deeply resented Edwards' ally Cook, who had voted against Jackson when the [[1824 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1824]] was decided in the House of Representatives.<ref name=\"Howard, 35\"/>\n\nHowever, when he ran for governor in 1826, Edwards had the good fortune to enter a three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator [[Thomas Sloo]] and Lieutenant Governor [[Adolphus Hubbard]]. As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5&nbsp;percent of the vote to Sloo's 46&nbsp;percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.<ref>Howard, 354.</ref>\n\n===Administration===\nEdwards' gubernatorial term was another period of rapid growth for Illinois. In the decade from 1820 to 1830, the population again nearly tripled from 55,211 to 157,445.<ref>U.S. Census Bureau.</ref> During this era, Illinois was the fastest-growing territory in the world.<ref>Jensen, 32.</ref>\n\nEdwards' administration was hampered by his conflict with the legislature, primarily over the struggling [[Bank of Illinois]]. The bank had been established in 1821, and from the beginning it had been underfunded, its notes had badly depreciated, and it had helped put the state deeply in debt. In his inaugural address Edwards undiplomatically attacked bank officials and politicians alike, accusing them of fraud and perjury.  From that point, Edwards had a poor relationship with the General Assembly. During his term the Assembly did eventually pass a bank regulation bill, but it also passed a measure to relieve debtors despite Edwards' objections that the state could not afford it.<ref>Howard, 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nIn 1827 Illinois established [[Alton Military Prison|its first penitentiary]], at [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]].

Thomas continued for the rest of his time as governor.  Edwards, along with much of the legislature, criticized the territory's judges for their inactivity. Among their complaints were that the judges did not hold court often enough and spent too much time absent from the territory. The legislature passed a bill in 1814 to reform the territory's judicial system. The judges refused to acknowledge the act, claiming that they were outside the jurisdiction of the legislature. In 1815 the issue was resolved by Congress, which passed a law supporting Edwards and the legislature.<ref>Howard, 43; Buck, 205.</ref>\n\nIn December 1817, Edwards, responding to a movement for statehood led by his ally [[Daniel Pope Cook]], recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow [[Missouri]] to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.<ref>Buck, 215.</ref>\n\nIn order to emphasize to Congress that Illinois would be a free state, the legislature passed in January 1818 a bill that would both abolish Illinois' \"indentured servant\" system of ''de facto'' slavery, and prohibit Illinois' future Constitution from reinstating it.<ref>Buck, 216\u2013217.</ref>  Governor Edwards issued his only veto to send the bill back to the legislature, and it was never revised.

Its [[Constitution of Illinois|constitution]] was finished in August 1818; elections were held in September; and in October, the first [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] met in Kaskaskia. On October 6, Ninian Edwards stepped down, and Shadrach Bond was inaugurated as Illinois' first governor.

Edwards was quickly chosen on the first ballot; his rival Thomas was only elected after the fourth.<ref>Buck, 303\u2013304.</ref>  Edwards and Thomas then drew straws to determine their respective terms: Thomas was placed in [[Classes of United States Senators|Class II of the Senate]] and could serve until 1823, while Edwards was placed in Class III and had to face reelection in February 1819. Edwards and Thomas still had to wait for Congress to formally ratify Illinois' constitution and admission to the Union, which it did on November 25.<ref>Buck, 306, 316.</ref> On December 3 the two Senators were finally seated, leaving Edwards with a mere three months in his first term.<ref>''Senators of the United States: 1789 -2010'' (2010), Senate Historical Office, [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/chronlist.pdf].

Crawford]].  Edwards alleged that Crawford had known of the impending failure of Illinois' Bank of Edwardsville in 1821, but had not withdrawn federal money from it.<ref>Howard, 37\u201338.</ref> Edwards found that none of Crawford's rivals was willing to support his charges, and he was unable to produce corroborating evidence. He resigned his Senate seat on March 4, 1824, to take a job he wanted as the first United States [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|Minister to Mexico]]. While en route to his new position, Edwards was called back to Washington to testify before a special House committee concerning the \"A.B. Plot\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Unable to substantiate his claims, Edwards resigned his diplomatic post, to be replaced by [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]].\n\nBack in Illinois, Edwards settled in [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]], a town whose site he had once owned before selling off its lots at a profit.<ref>Howard, 44.</ref>\n\n==State governorship==\n\n===Election of 1826===\nWhen he returned to Illinois, Edwards appeared to be a discredited politician. He no longer had a loyal coalition in the General Assembly to re-elect him to the U.S. Senate. His actions in the \"A.B. Plot\" had made him lose favor with President Adams; therefore he could not expect another federal appointment.<ref name=\"Howard, 34\"/> In addition, supporters of [[Andrew Jackson]] were becoming a force in Illinois politics.  Illinois frontier voters so admired Jackson that soon, for the first time, they would give their support to a national party, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>Jensen, 28.</ref> Ninian Edwards never criticized Jackson, but as an Adams-Clay Republican Senator he was not part of Jackson's growing coalition. Jacksonians deeply resented Edwards' ally Cook, who had voted against Jackson when the [[1824 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1824]] was decided in the House of Representatives.<ref name=\"Howard, 35\"/>\n\nHowever, when he ran for governor in 1826, Edwards had the good fortune to enter a three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator [[Thomas Sloo]] and Lieutenant Governor [[Adolphus Hubbard]]. As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it.

The bank had been established in 1821, and from the beginning it had been underfunded, its notes had badly depreciated, and it had helped put the state deeply in debt. In his inaugural address Edwards undiplomatically attacked bank officials and politicians alike, accusing them of fraud and perjury.  From that point, Edwards had a poor relationship with the General Assembly. During his term the Assembly did eventually pass a bank regulation bill, but it also passed a measure to relieve debtors despite Edwards' objections that the state could not afford it.<ref>Howard, 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nIn 1827 Illinois established [[Alton Military Prison|its first penitentiary]], at [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]].
