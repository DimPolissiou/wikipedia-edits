The judges were from Derna, a town neighboring Benghazi. Judges from Tripoli and Benghazi refused to take on the case due to the high level of public sentiment in those cities. Tight security measures were in place. Police officers with submachine guns guarded the venue as relatives of the children gathered in front.\n\nThe prosecutor stated that the case documents did not reflect the real number of children. The real number of children is 429. A report by prominent AIDS experts Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi was admitted in evidence.\n\nLuc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzito were called to testify in person on behalf of the medics.\n\nProfessor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV), testified that the virus in the 393 children studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection was not the only possible means of infection: Any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even multiple use of the same oxygen mask, could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was familiar with the case before his first visit to Libya in 1999 because he was in the process of studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, some of the children did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Montagnier stated that it is possible to preserve the virus and then reactivate it if it has been held in plasma. It could be kept active for several days, depending on how it is stored. He testified that he was not aware of the existence of the technical capacity in Libya for monitoring this kind of storage, either during the epidemic or currently. Montagnier testified that during his first visit, the health authorities in Libya and the management of the Benghazi hospital showed serious concern over the infection, and that at the time they had no idea of the cause of the epidemic's spread.\n\nWhen questioned by the Bulgarian defense, he affirmed that the infection could have started outside the hospital ward where the Bulgarians were working.\n\nThe Court ordered a new expert study of the case record. It received the report from the Libyan panel in December. Contrary to the findings of Prof. Luc Montagnier and Prof. Vittorio Colizzi, this panel concluded that there was no evidence that an in-hospital infection led to the AIDS outbreak at the Benghazi hospital that affected 426 children. The Libyan doctors concluded that the mass infections were more likely due to deliberate actions.\n\nTwo of the Libyan experts were brought in to testify for the prosecution, Awad Abudjadja of the Libyan national committee on AIDS and Busha Allo, head of the infectious diseases ward of the Al Jamahiriya hospital in Tripoli. They testified that the virus load in the blood of the infected children was too high, an indication that the infection was intentional.\n\nAnother Libyan virologist Salim Al-Agiri was summoned by the defense. He told the court that the infection at the Benghazi children's hospital was due to lack of prevention and poor control.\n\nThe prosecutors called for the death penalty based on Nassya Nenova's confession. Nenova admitted in writing to injecting children with contaminated products that she had gotten from the Palestinian [[Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh]]. According to the confession she was unaware that they contained HIV, and believed she was testing a new drug. Nenova withdrew her confession before the Libyan People's Court in 2001 and told that court they were extracted under duress. Libyan law disregards confessions extracted with violence.\n\nThe prosecutors claimed that Kristiana Vulcheva acted as the mastermind. They introduced transcripts of her bank accounts and said she performed money transfers, paying the other defendants. The prosecutors averred that Vulcheva had a luxurious lifestyle and that she speaks Arabic, citing that as a further proof of her guilt.\n\nOne piece of material evidence which they said called for the death penalty were five containers of plasma protein found to contain four varieties of HIV according to a report by Awad Abudadjadja, a coordinator of the Libyan national committee on AIDS.\n\nOn 6 May 2004 the Criminal Court in Benghazi sentenced to death by firing squad; [[Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh]], Kristiyana Valtcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova, finding them guilty for the intentional infection of 426 Libyan children with AIDS. Dr Zdravko Georgiev was found guilty of illegal transactions in foreign currency and sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 600 dinars. He was ordered released for time served.\n\nIn public after the conviction Colizzi called the scientific evidence used against them \"so irrational it's unbelievable\" and said the verdict read \"like a bad spy film.\"<ref name=\"HIV Injustice in Libya-Scapegoating Foreign Medical Professionals\"/>\n\n===Retrial===\nThe convictions were appealed to the [[Libyan Supreme Court]] which heard the case beginning on 29 March 2005. The defense urged the court to revoke the death sentences and remand the case to the lower courts for retrial. Under Libyan law, the court could not accept any new evidence, although the defense team argued that there was wrongly interpreted evidence during the court sessions so far.

The judges were from Derna, a town neighboring Benghazi. Judges from Tripoli and Benghazi refused to take on the case due to the high level of public sentiment in those cities. Tight security measures were in place. Police officers with submachine guns guarded the venue as relatives of the children gathered in front.\n\nThe prosecutor stated that the case documents did not reflect the real number of children. The real number of children is 429. A report by prominent AIDS experts Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi was admitted in evidence.\n\nLuc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzito were called to testify in person on behalf of the medics.\n\nProfessor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV), testified that the virus in the 393 children studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection was not the only possible means of infection: Any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even multiple use of the same oxygen mask, could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was familiar with the case before his first visit to Libya in 1999 because he was in the process of studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, some of the children did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Montagnier stated that it is possible to preserve the virus and then reactivate it if it has been held in plasma. It could be kept active for several days, depending on how it is stored. He testified that he was not aware of the existence of the technical capacity in Libya for monitoring this kind of storage, either during the epidemic or currently. Montagnier testified that during his first visit, the health authorities in Libya and the management of the Benghazi hospital showed serious concern over the infection, and that at the time they had no idea of the cause of the epidemic's spread.\n\nWhen questioned by the Bulgarian defense, he affirmed that the infection could have started outside the hospital ward where the Bulgarians were working.\n\nThe Court ordered a new expert study of the case record. It received the report from the Libyan panel in December. Contrary to the findings of Prof. Luc Montagnier and Prof. Vittorio Colizzi, this panel concluded that there was no evidence that an in-hospital infection led to the AIDS outbreak at the Benghazi hospital that affected 426 children. The Libyan doctors concluded that the mass infections were more likely due to deliberate actions.\n\nTwo of the Libyan experts were brought in to testify for the prosecution, Awad Abudjadja of the Libyan national committee on AIDS and Busha Allo, head of the infectious diseases ward of the Al Jamahiriya hospital in Tripoli. They testified that the virus load in the blood of the infected children was too high, an indication that the infection was intentional.\n\nAnother Libyan virologist Salim Al-Agiri was summoned by the defense. He told the court that the infection at the Benghazi children's hospital was due to lack of prevention and poor control.\n\nThe prosecutors called for the death penalty based on Nassya Nenova's confession. Nenova admitted in writing to injecting children with contaminated products that she had gotten from the Palestinian [[Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh]]. According to the confession she was unaware that they contained HIV, and believed she was testing a new drug. Nenova withdrew her confession before the Libyan People's Court in 2001 and told that court they were extracted under duress. Libyan law disregards confessions extracted with violence.\n\nThe prosecutors claimed that Kristiana Vulcheva acted as the mastermind. They introduced transcripts of her bank accounts and said she performed money transfers, paying the other defendants. The prosecutors averred that Vulcheva had a luxurious lifestyle and that she speaks Arabic, citing that as a further proof of her guilt.\n\nOne piece of material evidence which they said called for the death penalty were five containers of plasma protein found to contain four varieties of HIV according to a report by Awad Abudadjadja, a coordinator of the Libyan national committee on AIDS.\n\nOn 6 May 2004 the Criminal Court in Benghazi sentenced to death by firing squad; [[Ashraf al-Hadzhudzh]], Kristiyana Valtcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova, finding them guilty for the intentional infection of 426 Libyan children with AIDS. Dr Zdravko Georgiev was found guilty of illegal transactions in foreign currency and sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 600 dinars. He was ordered released for time served.\n\nIn public after the conviction Colizzi called the scientific evidence used against them \"so irrational it's unbelievable\" and said the verdict read \"like a bad spy film.\"<ref name=\"HIV Injustice in Libya-Scapegoating Foreign Medical Professionals\"/>\n\n===Retrial===\nThe convictions were appealed to the [[Libyan Supreme Court]] which heard the case beginning on 29 March 2005. The defense urged the court to revoke the death sentences and remand the case to the lower courts for retrial. Under Libyan law, the court could not accept any new evidence, although the defense team argued that there was wrongly interpreted evidence during the court sessions so far.

The Odyssey offered two sliding doors as standard equipment, whereas some minivans of the time only offered one, a second door being optional. The Odyssey offered power sliding doors which were standard on the EX trim, but not available on the LX trim. The Odyssey kept the fold-into-the-floor rear seat, an innovation adopted by many other minivans. The van continued to receive upgrades, such as offering both VHS and [[DVD]]-based entertainment systems. There was also an available Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System, introduced during 1999, which became the first navigation system ever offered in a minivan.\n\nThe 2004 model was the only second generation Odyssey model year to receive reliability ratings of five out of five according to Automotive Information Systems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} IIHS gave the Odyssey a Good rating in the Frontal Offset Test from 1999 to 2004.<ref name=\"iihs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/honda/odyssey-minivan/ | title=Honda Odyssey Vehicle Details|publisher=IIHS}}</ref>\n\nThe second generation was praised for its powerful V6, its handling from its four-wheel [[independent suspension]], and its features such as a large cabin, power sliding doors (manual sliding doors on LX models) and the stow-away third-row seat. Some {{Who|date=April 2018}} found it noisier than competitors.

Also added was a five-speed automatic transmission, side torso airbags (not side curtain airbags), rear disc brakes, and a few minor cosmetic improvements on the outside as well as the inside. Other than an AUTO power driver's window, the Odyssey remained unchanged for 2003 and 2004, before being replaced with the third generation model.\n\n===Transmission problems===\nThe 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] in 1999 to 2001 models had serious problems with transmission durability. Honda spokesman Mike Spencer stated that four-speed models were afflicted with a bad bearing that could break apart, scattering fragments of metal that clogged fluid passageways in the transmission, causing it to shift erratically.<ref name=\"LAT\">{{cite news|title = Honda's Unexpected Gear Shift |newspaper=The L.A. Times |first=John |last=O'dell |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/11/autos/hy-acura11 |date=September 11, 2002 |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Honda responded to the problems by extending the warranty on the transmission on American 1999\u20132001 models to 7 years or {{convert|100000|mi|km|-2}}. A class action settlement further extended coverage to {{convert|109000|mi|km|-2}} or 93 months for some 1999\u20132001 Odysseys in the US.<ref>[http://www.hondatransmissionsettlement.com Honda Transmission Settlement]</ref> Canada is not included. The five-speed automatic was first installed in the Odyssey for the 2002 model, but general reliability of the 1999\u20132003 transmission was poor according to Consumer Reports. Spencer said that the five-speed models typically were damaged by premature wear of the third-gear clutch pack. As the clutch friction material abraded, it scattered bits inside the transmission case, clogging fluid lines and causing erratic shifting. Drivers might suffer slipping, poor or no shifts, or sudden down-shifts from fifth gear to second gear.<ref name=\"LAT\"/>\n\nUnder some conditions, a different 5-speed transmission problem arose. Second gear could overheat and break, causing the transmission to lock. An oil jet was added to lubricate this gear but this did not solve the third gear clutch problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhthqnwws111.odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/docservlet/Artemis/Public/Recalls/2004/V/RCRIT-04V176-2519.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331141537/http://nhthqnwws111.odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/docservlet/Artemis/Public/Recalls/2004/V/RCRIT-04V176-2519.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 31, 2010 |title=Odyssey Transmission Recall |format=PDF |accessdate=October 9, 2010 }}</ref> The addition of the Honda transmission cooler with the towing package still allows transmission fluid temperatures that are too high.

The headrests could now be left in place when tumbling the rear seat. Some notable features of the redesign were dual glove boxes and an in-floor [[lazy susan]] storage compartment, located in the previous generation's spare tire well.

The Odyssey offered two sliding doors as standard equipment, whereas some minivans of the time only offered one, a second door being optional. The Odyssey offered power sliding doors which were standard on the EX trim, but not available on the LX trim. The Odyssey kept the fold-into-the-floor rear seat, an innovation adopted by many other minivans. The van continued to receive upgrades, such as offering both VHS and [[DVD]]-based entertainment systems. There was also an available Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System, introduced during 1999, which became the first navigation system ever offered in a minivan.\n\nThe 2004 model was the only second generation Odyssey model year to receive reliability ratings of five out of five according to Automotive Information Systems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} IIHS gave the Odyssey a Good rating in the Frontal Offset Test from 1999 to 2004.<ref name=\"iihs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/honda/odyssey-minivan/ | title=Honda Odyssey Vehicle Details|publisher=IIHS}}</ref>\n\nThe second generation was praised for its powerful V6, its handling from its four-wheel [[independent suspension]], and its features such as a large cabin, power sliding doors (manual sliding doors on LX models) and the stow-away third-row seat. Some {{Who|date=April 2018}} found it noisier than competitors. It won consecutive [[Edmunds.com]] Editors' Most Wanted awards from 1999 to 2003 in the minivan category.<ref name=\"edmunds.com\"/>\n\nThis is also the only generation of the Honda Odyssey where the power windows are only on the driver's and front passenger's doors.\n\n===Mid-generational refresh===\n[[File:2002-2004 Honda Odyssey.jpg|thumb|left|2002\u20132004 Honda Odyssey EX (US)]]\nThe Odyssey also received a significant increase in power from {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} during 2001. Also added was a five-speed automatic transmission, side torso airbags (not side curtain airbags), rear disc brakes, and a few minor cosmetic improvements on the outside as well as the inside. Other than an AUTO power driver's window, the Odyssey remained unchanged for 2003 and 2004, before being replaced with the third generation model.\n\n===Transmission problems===\nThe 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] in 1999 to 2001 models had serious problems with transmission durability. Honda spokesman Mike Spencer stated that four-speed models were afflicted with a bad bearing that could break apart, scattering fragments of metal that clogged fluid passageways in the transmission, causing it to shift erratically.<ref name=\"LAT\">{{cite news|title = Honda's Unexpected Gear Shift |newspaper=The L.A. Times |first=John |last=O'dell |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/11/autos/hy-acura11 |date=2002-09-11 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref> Honda responded to the problems by extending the warranty on the transmission on American 1999\u20132001 models to 7 years or {{convert|100000|mi|km|-2}}. A class action settlement further extended coverage to {{convert|109000|mi|km|-2}} or 93 months for some 1999\u20132001 Odysseys in the US.<ref>[http://www.hondatransmissionsettlement.com Honda Transmission Settlement]</ref> Canada is not included. The five-speed automatic was first installed in the Odyssey for the 2002 model, but general reliability of the 1999\u20132003 transmission was poor according to Consumer Reports. Spencer said that the five-speed models typically were damaged by premature wear of the third-gear clutch pack. As the clutch friction material abraded, it scattered bits inside the transmission case, clogging fluid lines and causing erratic shifting. Drivers might suffer slipping, poor or no shifts, or sudden down-shifts from fifth gear to second gear.<ref name=\"LAT\"/>\n\nUnder some conditions, a different 5-speed transmission problem arose. Second gear could overheat and break, causing the transmission to lock. An oil jet was added to lubricate this gear but this did not solve the third gear clutch problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhthqnwws111.odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/docservlet/Artemis/Public/Recalls/2004/V/RCRIT-04V176-2519.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331141537/http://nhthqnwws111.odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/docservlet/Artemis/Public/Recalls/2004/V/RCRIT-04V176-2519.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-03-31 |title=Odyssey Transmission Recall |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-09 }}</ref> The addition of the Honda transmission cooler with the towing package still allows transmission fluid temperatures that are too high.

Current King of Jordan, His Majesty [[King Abdullah II]], passed legislation requiring a quota for the number of women in parliament. Since the quota was established, 15 of the 130 seats in the Lower House of Parliament have consistently and successfully been reserved for women. However, women won 19 seats in the 2013 elections.<ref name=\"WB50\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file.

In 1996, the Jordanian cabinet made the JNCW the official government \u201creference point\u201d on all issues pertaining to women and now reports directly to the [[Prime Minister]].

Article 20, in fact, makes elementary education required for all Jordanians and free of charge in public, government schools.<ref name=\"WB41\" /> This provision is elaborated on and reinforced in the [[Education Act]]. The Jordanian government spends more than 5% on education  every year and has had positive results.  Since 1980, the [[literacy rate]] in Jordan has increased from 69.2% to 91% in 2002. With a female literacy rate of 85.9%, Jordan has the highest female literacy rate in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 3</ref> So, while the majority of Jordanian women are both literate and well educated, the differences in career expectations based on gender stem from cultural practices and not the fact that women are not as capable as men.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\"/>\n\nFemale enrollment at all levels of school is high and Jordanian women have the highest average number of years of schooling in comparison with women in both Kuwait and [[Bahrain]]. While men in Jordan receive 1.7 years more schooling that women in Jordan receive, the difference is considered very low for the region.<ref name=\"WB27\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 27</ref>  The drop out rate is not excessive, but women claim their primary reason for dropping out of school (at various levels) is [[marriage]] and their responsibilities in the home while men claim they drop out primarily to get jobs and help their families make money.<ref name=\"WB27\" />\n\nFamily approval of a woman's education is crucial. When a poorer family is unable to put more than one child through school, the boy gets the education and the girl is expected to focus on homemaking skills. While women have access to basic schooling, access to technological training is limited as women are expected to study topics that directly relate to their dominant roles as wives and mothers \u2013 such as art, humanities, and teaching.<ref name=\"WB28\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 28</ref>  Though females are fairly equally represented in school, there is excessive gender stereotyping in Jordanian textbooks.<ref name=\"WB27\" />\n\n===Employment===\nThere are constitutional provisions that affirm Jordanian citizens\u2019 basic rights to work and there is nothing in [[Islam]] that forbids women from doing so.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ54\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print.

Page 87</ref> There will be no discrimination between Jordanians regarding rights and duties based on [[race (human classification)|race]], [[language]] or [[religion]].\" <ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" /> The [[Labor Laws]] clarify the Constitution further: \"By Jordanians are meant both men and women.\" <ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" /> The Labor Code defines a worker/laborer/employee as \u201ceach person, male or female, who performs a job in return for wages.\u201d The Constitution asserts that the government \u201cshall ensure work and education within the limits of its possibilities, and it shall ensure a state of tranquility and [[equal opportunities]] to all Jordanians.\u201d <ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" /> Work is \u201cthe right of every citizen,\u201d and \u201cthe State shall provide opportunities for work to all citizens by directing the national economy and raising its standards.\u201d  Jordanian labor laws protect women from losing their jobs during [[pregnancy]] and give them assistance with [[childcare]].<ref name=\"WB40\" /> While the laws themselves promote justice and equality, the traditional ideals of masculinity and femininity and the \"[[patriarchal]] nature of the [[legal system]]\" contribute to women's noticeable absence from the workplace and the inequalities they face once there.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" />\n\nGender inequalities in Jordan today also stem from traditional gender roles that have embedded themselves in Jordanian culture. \u201cAt the root of the barriers to women's labor force participation are traditional attitudes that place a high value on women's roles in the private sphere and within the family that is important in Jordanian society.\u201d <ref name=\"WB40\" /> These stereotypes are based on the notions that: \u201c(a) men and women differ biologically and that these biological differences determine their social function; (b) men and women carry different and complementary responsibilities within the family; and (c) they have different but equitable rights associated with those responsibilities.\u201d <ref name=\"WB40\" />\n\nThe \"traditional paradigm\" of Jordanian gender expects women to marry early and contribute to the family as a homemaker, wife and mother.<ref name=\"WB40\" /> It assumes that the man will be in charge of the household and that he will provide for his family financially. Women, as wives and mothers, are perceived as vulnerable and in need of protection that should be provided by the husband. Men's responsibility to protect their wives and children is considered sufficient justification for their exercise of authority over women in all areas of decision-making regarding both the public and private spheres. Due to this traditional paradigm, women's interaction with and representation in politics and society are mediated by her husband.<ref name=\"WB40\" /> While this paradigm exists to some extent all over the world, it is particularly prominent in Jordan as it has become institutionalized and pervades the legal framework.\n[[File:Women doing beadwork in Jordan.jpg|thumb|left|Women assembling mosaics in a government-sponsored program|alt=Four women, one in a wheelchair and two wearing headscarves, sitting around a table assembling mosaics with tools and materials]]\n[[Unemployment]], [[underemployment]], differences in wages and [[occupational segregation]] are the four main factors in the economy that impact women's level of labor.<ref name=\"WB10\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 10</ref> In terms of unemployment, 15% of men are unemployed while 25% of women are unemployed and 82% of young women ages 15\u201329 are unemployed.  Women are underemployed as they tend to be hired less than men with lesser education because large sections of the Jordanian economy are and have traditionally been closed off to women.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\"/> Less educated men often hold more jobs while women are often better educated, leading to many women settling for jobs requiring lesser education than they have. [[Wage discrimination]] in Jordan is no different from anywhere else in the world, but in combination with traditional and cultural factors \u2013 like being responsible for the private sphere (the family and the home) \u2013 women are driven away from the workforce. Jordanian law suggests that wives should be obedient to their husbands because the men financially support the family, and if she is disobedient her husband can discontinue financial support.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ15\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 15</ref> In addition, men have assumed the power to forbid their wives from working, and the Jordanian courts have upheld these laws.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ15\"/> Furthermore, as [[honor killings]] consistently occur and are currently on the rise, women are less motivated to leave the safety of their homes.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ16\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 16</ref> Laws in Jordan regarding honor killings continue to make it possible for courts to deal with perpetrators leniently.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ16\"/>\n\nOccupational segregation exists in all aspect of the Jordanian workforce as both vertical and horizontal segregation is present.<ref name=\"WB22\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 22</ref> Vertical segregation refers to the concept of the [[glass ceiling]], where women are concentrated in lower paying, lower-ranking jobs and cannot break through to the higher levels. Horizontal segregation occurs when certain occupations are more female intensive. For example, more Jordanian men are civil servants and fill high-ranking positions while Jordanian women are concentrated in middle-ranking jobs. The consequences of women's limited economic advancement and low female participation in the workforce leads to low utilization of national production capacity (World Bank estimates it is currently at half its potential), lower average household income and lower per capita [[GDP]].<ref name=\"WB22\"/> The greatest challenge to incorporating women equally into the workplace is overcoming traditional attitudes towards women and their expected duties as mothers and wives.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\"/> A change in attitude will inevitably lead to the changing of \"gendered laws\" and the role of women as homemakers.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ7\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary.

Instead of functioning like a traditional \u201ccharity,\u201d these Islamic charity institutions are founded on a more social basis.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, Janine A. Islam, Charity, and Activism. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2004. Print</ref> While these they are not officially connected to the state, they impact the country both socially and politically. Other community groups in Jordan, like the [[The Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development|Jordanian Hashemite Fund]], encourage women to form their own committees, run for local elections, and form small female-only cooperatives. When many of these initiatives began in the 1980s, they received marked opposition from community leaders, with some threatening to shut down women's committees in their area.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Rethinking an NGO: Development, Donors and Civil Society in Jordan|last = bint Talal|first = Basma|publisher = IB Tauris|year = 2004|isbn = 1 86064 925 4|location = London|pages = 135\u2013184}}</ref> The current political landscape is comparatively more amenable to female political participation and networking, although challenges remain.\n\n==Family rights==\n===Marriage===\nJordanian husbands determine their wives\u2019 abilities to employ their constitutionally guaranteed rights to work and other public activities. Jordanian legislation and culture suggests that men have a certain control over their wives to mediate their interaction with the public. Men expect their wives to be obedient because they work in order to support the family financially.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ15\"/> Some amendments postpone this \u201cownership\u201d for young girls. For example, the Jordanian Parliament increased the legal age of marriage to 18 for both boys and girls, as the previous law set the legal age for marriage at 16 for boys and 15 for girls, which promoted early marriages and subsequent school drop out for married girls.<ref name=\"WB47\"/>\n\n===Divorce===\nDivorce law is based almost entirely on Islamic Shari'a law, which is considered \"unquestionable authority.\" <ref name=\"Sonbol WFD10\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 10</ref> Variations in interpretation and application, however, do exist among [[Sharia|Islamic courts]] across the Middle East. Divorces in Jordan, in particular, often ignore women's rights and leave women with nothing if they are not supported by their families. In recent years, the government has worked to fix this problem by altering the [[judicial system]]. For example, \"a new law has been drafted to force men to pay [[alimony]] for three years instead of six months, which was previously the case.\u201d <ref name=\"Sonbol WFD10\"/> Because men are free to divorce and stop supporting their wives if they are \"disobedient,\" another law created an obligatory fund for divorced women, guaranteeing them a settlement from their ex-husband.<ref name=\"Alami\">Alami, Mona. \"Women Make Progress But Honour Killings Persist.\" IPS.

The JNCW has become a quasi-governmental institution accountable in large part for drafting national policies regarding women's rights and economic advancement.<ref name=\"WB48\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 48</ref>\n\n==Social representation==\n===Education===\n[[File:Young girls reading - Government primary school in Amman, Jordan.jpg|thumbnail|Jordan has the highest literacy rate in the [[Middle East]].]]\nThere are constitutional provisions that affirm Jordanian citizens\u2019 basic rights to [[education]]. Article 20, in fact, makes elementary education required for all Jordanians and free of charge in public, government schools.<ref name=\"WB41\" /> This provision is elaborated on and reinforced in the [[Education Act]]. The Jordanian government spends more than 5% on education  every year and has had positive results.  Since 1980, the [[literacy rate]] in Jordan has increased from 69.2% to 91% in 2002. With a female literacy rate of 85.9%, Jordan has the highest female literacy rate in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 3</ref> So, while the majority of Jordanian women are both literate and well educated, the differences in career expectations based on gender stem from cultural practices and not the fact that women are not as capable as men.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\"/>\n\nFemale enrollment at all levels of school is high and Jordanian women have the highest average number of years of schooling in comparison with women in both Kuwait and [[Bahrain]]. While men in Jordan receive 1.7 years more schooling that women in Jordan receive, the difference is considered very low for the region.<ref name=\"WB27\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 27</ref>  The drop out rate is not excessive, but women claim their primary reason for dropping out of school (at various levels) is [[marriage]] and their responsibilities in the home while men claim they drop out primarily to get jobs and help their families make money.<ref name=\"WB27\" />\n\nFamily approval of a woman's education is crucial. When a poorer family is unable to put more than one child through school, the boy gets the education and the girl is expected to focus on homemaking skills. While women have access to basic schooling, access to technological training is limited as women are expected to study topics that directly relate to their dominant roles as wives and mothers \u2013 such as art, humanities, and teaching.<ref name=\"WB28\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 28</ref>  Though females are fairly equally represented in school, there is excessive gender stereotyping in Jordanian textbooks.<ref name=\"WB27\" />\n\n===Employment===\nThere are constitutional provisions that affirm Jordanian citizens\u2019 basic rights to work and there is nothing in [[Islam]] that forbids women from doing so.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ54\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 54</ref> The Constitution states, \"Work is the right of all citizens,\" \"Jobs are based on capability,\" and \"All Jordanians are equal before the law.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 87</ref> There will be no discrimination between Jordanians regarding rights and duties based on [[race (human classification)|race]], [[language]] or [[religion]].\" <ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" /> The [[Labor Laws]] clarify the Constitution further: \"By Jordanians are meant both men and women.\" <ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" /> The Labor Code defines a worker/laborer/employee as \u201ceach person, male or female, who performs a job in return for wages.\u201d The Constitution asserts that the government \u201cshall ensure work and education within the limits of its possibilities, and it shall ensure a state of tranquility and [[equal opportunities]] to all Jordanians.\u201d <ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" /> Work is \u201cthe right of every citizen,\u201d and \u201cthe State shall provide opportunities for work to all citizens by directing the national economy and raising its standards.\u201d  Jordanian labor laws protect women from losing their jobs during [[pregnancy]] and give them assistance with [[childcare]].<ref name=\"WB40\" /> While the laws themselves promote justice and equality, the traditional ideals of masculinity and femininity and the \"[[patriarchal]] nature of the [[legal system]]\" contribute to women's noticeable absence from the workplace and the inequalities they face once there.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ87\" />\n\nGender inequalities in Jordan today also stem from traditional gender roles that have embedded themselves in Jordanian culture. \u201cAt the root of the barriers to women's labor force participation are traditional attitudes that place a high value on women's roles in the private sphere and within the family that is important in Jordanian society.\u201d <ref name=\"WB40\" /> These stereotypes are based on the notions that: \u201c(a) men and women differ biologically and that these biological differences determine their social function; (b) men and women carry different and complementary responsibilities within the family; and (c) they have different but equitable rights associated with those responsibilities.\u201d <ref name=\"WB40\" />\n\nThe \"traditional paradigm\" of Jordanian gender expects women to marry early and contribute to the family as a homemaker, wife and mother.<ref name=\"WB40\" /> It assumes that the man will be in charge of the household and that he will provide for his family financially. Women, as wives and mothers, are perceived as vulnerable and in need of protection that should be provided by the husband. Men's responsibility to protect their wives and children is considered sufficient justification for their exercise of authority over women in all areas of decision-making regarding both the public and private spheres. Due to this traditional paradigm, women's interaction with and representation in politics and society are mediated by her husband.<ref name=\"WB40\" /> While this paradigm exists to some extent all over the world, it is particularly prominent in Jordan as it has become institutionalized and pervades the legal framework.\n[[File:Women doing beadwork in Jordan.jpg|thumb|left|Women assembling mosaics in a government-sponsored program|alt=Four women, one in a wheelchair and two wearing headscarves, sitting around a table assembling mosaics with tools and materials]]\n[[Unemployment]], [[underemployment]], differences in wages and [[occupational segregation]] are the four main factors in the economy that impact women's level of labor.<ref name=\"WB10\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 10</ref> In terms of unemployment, 15% of men are unemployed while 25% of women are unemployed and 82% of young women ages 15\u201329 are unemployed.  Women are underemployed as they tend to be hired less than men with lesser education because large sections of the Jordanian economy are and have traditionally been closed off to women.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\"/> Less educated men often hold more jobs while women are often better educated, leading to many women settling for jobs requiring lesser education than they have. [[Wage discrimination]] in Jordan is no different from anywhere else in the world, but in combination with traditional and cultural factors \u2013 like being responsible for the private sphere (the family and the home) \u2013 women are driven away from the workforce. Jordanian law suggests that wives should be obedient to their husbands because the men financially support the family, and if she is disobedient her husband can discontinue financial support.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ15\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 15</ref> In addition, men have assumed the power to forbid their wives from working, and the Jordanian courts have upheld these laws.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ15\"/> Furthermore, as [[honor killings]] consistently occur and are currently on the rise, women are less motivated to leave the safety of their homes.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ16\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 16</ref> Laws in Jordan regarding honor killings continue to make it possible for courts to deal with perpetrators leniently.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ16\"/>\n\nOccupational segregation exists in all aspect of the Jordanian workforce as both vertical and horizontal segregation is present.<ref name=\"WB22\">The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 22</ref> Vertical segregation refers to the concept of the [[glass ceiling]], where women are concentrated in lower paying, lower-ranking jobs and cannot break through to the higher levels. Horizontal segregation occurs when certain occupations are more female intensive. For example, more Jordanian men are civil servants and fill high-ranking positions while Jordanian women are concentrated in middle-ranking jobs. The consequences of women's limited economic advancement and low female participation in the workforce leads to low utilization of national production capacity (World Bank estimates it is currently at half its potential), lower average household income and lower per capita [[GDP]].<ref name=\"WB22\"/> The greatest challenge to incorporating women equally into the workplace is overcoming traditional attitudes towards women and their expected duties as mothers and wives.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ3\"/> A change in attitude will inevitably lead to the changing of \"gendered laws\" and the role of women as homemakers.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ7\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 7</ref>\n\n===Networking===\nThe Islamic Center Charity Society in Jordan is an example of one way middle class Jordanian women are able to network and connect over mutual experiences. Instead of functioning like a traditional \u201ccharity,\u201d these Islamic charity institutions are founded on a more social basis.<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, Janine A. Islam, Charity, and Activism. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2004. Print</ref> While these they are not officially connected to the state, they impact the country both socially and politically. Other community groups in Jordan, like the [[The Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development|Jordanian Hashemite Fund]], encourage women to form their own committees, run for local elections, and form small female-only cooperatives. When many of these initiatives began in the 1980s, they received marked opposition from community leaders, with some threatening to shut down women's committees in their area.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Rethinking an NGO: Development, Donors and Civil Society in Jordan|last = bint Talal|first = Basma|publisher = IB Tauris|year = 2004|isbn = 1 86064 925 4|location = London|pages = 135\u2013184}}</ref> The current political landscape is comparatively more amenable to female political participation and networking, although challenges remain.\n\n==Family rights==\n===Marriage===\nJordanian husbands determine their wives\u2019 abilities to employ their constitutionally guaranteed rights to work and other public activities. Jordanian legislation and culture suggests that men have a certain control over their wives to mediate their interaction with the public. Men expect their wives to be obedient because they work in order to support the family financially.<ref name=\"Sonbol WoJ15\"/> Some amendments postpone this \u201cownership\u201d for young girls. For example, the Jordanian Parliament increased the legal age of marriage to 18 for both boys and girls, as the previous law set the legal age for marriage at 16 for boys and 15 for girls, which promoted early marriages and subsequent school drop out for married girls.<ref name=\"WB47\"/>\n\n===Divorce===\nDivorce law is based almost entirely on Islamic Shari'a law, which is considered \"unquestionable authority.\" <ref name=\"Sonbol WFD10\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 10</ref> Variations in interpretation and application, however, do exist among [[Sharia|Islamic courts]] across the Middle East. Divorces in Jordan, in particular, often ignore women's rights and leave women with nothing if they are not supported by their families. In recent years, the government has worked to fix this problem by altering the [[judicial system]]. For example, \"a new law has been drafted to force men to pay [[alimony]] for three years instead of six months, which was previously the case.\u201d <ref name=\"Sonbol WFD10\"/> Because men are free to divorce and stop supporting their wives if they are \"disobedient,\" another law created an obligatory fund for divorced women, guaranteeing them a settlement from their ex-husband.<ref name=\"Alami\">Alami, Mona. \"Women Make Progress But Honour Killings Persist.\" IPS.

Web. 15 Apr. 2012. <http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51150></ref>\n\n===Children===\nThe father was technically responsible for the children's [[property]], maintenance and education while the mother was responsible for the \"physical care and nurturing\" of the children.<ref name=\"Sonbol WFD225\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print.

Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 226</ref> Today, however, children \"belong\" to both parents but the mother generally stays home to raise the children.\n\n===Property===\nWhile studies of women and their [[property rights]] evidence that Islamic courts have \"upheld women's rights to property,\" women in Jordan legally own and [[Inheritance|inherit]] less than their male relatives do.<ref name=\"Sonbol WFD220\">Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 220</ref> Throughout history and still today, when women have owned and inherited property, they have been frequently and intensely pressured to give up their land to male family members.<ref name=\"Alami\"/> As a result, less than four percent of all property in Jordan is owned by women.<ref name=\"Sonbol WFD220\"/>\n\n===Honor killings===\nHonor crimes are acts of violence committed by family members against women who are perceived to have shamed the family in some way. Women can \"shame\" their family by engaging in \"[[marital infidelity]], [[pre-marital sex]] and [[flirting]]\", or getting raped <ref name=\"Mayell1\">Mayell, Hillary. Thousands of Women Killed for Family \"Honor.\" N.p.: National Geographic Society, February 12, 2002. National Geographic Society. Web. 17 Apr. 2012. Page 1. <http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/pf/15061734.html></ref> The Jordanian Penal Code today still includes provisions that excuse honor crimes by granting the perpetrator leniency in punishment. Many of these killings go unreported, but each year tens of women are killed by family members in order to \"restore honor.\" <ref name=\"Mayell1\"/> Honor killings occur across the Middle East and around the world. The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] reports of honor killings in [[Bangladesh]], [[Great Britain]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Morocco]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], and [[Uganda]] expose that this practice \"goes across cultures and across religions.\" <ref name=\"Mayell1\"/>\n\nIt has been difficult to change legislation (particularly Article 340 of the Jordanian Penal Code) because violence against women has traditionally been considered a \"private matter\" rather than the \"responsibility of the state.\" <ref name=\"Ruane1529\">{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/emint14&div=43&g_sent=1&collection=journals|title=Murder in the name of honor: violence against women in Jordan and Pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=heinonline.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> In fact, there has been a nationwide women's human rights campaign, supported by King Abullah and Queen Rania, to modify Article 340, which grants perpetrators of honor killings leniency in Jordanian courts <ref name=\"Ruane1528\">Ruane, Rachel A.
