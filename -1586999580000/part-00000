The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, \"the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way.\"[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that \"common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument.\" C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense \"often means\" is \"the elementary mental outfit of the normal man.\"</ref> The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as \"the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done\". The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], \"signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought\". The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}</ref>\n\nIn a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as \"the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language\" and notes, \"A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sj\u00f6berg|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79\u201382|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9450.1982.tb00416.x}}</ref>\n\nThe everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin ''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}'', Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f34\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1f74}} (''{{transl|grc|a\u00edsth\u0113sis koin\u1e15}}''), and French ''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}'', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: \"good sense\" is sometimes seen as equivalent to \"common sense\", and sometimes not.<ref>For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.</ref>\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed \"common sense\", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd}}, {{transl|grc|phrone\u00een}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd]]}}, {{transl|grc|noe\u00een}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]\n\"Common sense\" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae#Ancient Greek|\u03c8\u1fe1\u03c7\u03ae]]}}, {{transl|grc|ps\u016bkh\u1e17}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.\n\nThe second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.<ref>The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives four meanings of \"common sense\":  An archaic meaning is \"An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses\"; \"Ordinary, normal, or average understanding\" without which a man would be \"foolish or insane\", \"the general sense of mankind, or of a community\" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity); A philosophical meaning, the \"faculty of primary truths\".</ref> Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.\n\nAll these meanings of \"common sense\", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning science, politics and economics.<ref>See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''\"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]\"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].</ref> The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.<ref>See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: \"today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere\".</ref>\n\nSince the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term \"common sense\" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to vulgar [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.<ref name=\"hund\">{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}</ref> It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: \"Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common Sense: A Political History|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23|title-link=Common Sense: A Political History}}</ref>\nThis began with [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]]'s criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between \"[[rationalism]]\" and \"[[empiricism]]\". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.<ref>{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is \"{{lang|fr|bon sens}}\" sometimes translated as \"good sense\". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|\"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.\"}}</ref> In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.<ref name=\"hund\" /> Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].\n\n==Aristotelian==\nThe origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.<ref>There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}.</ref> The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of \"perceptible\" or \"sensible\" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the \"common sensibles\" (or \"common perceptibles\"). In this discussion, \"common\" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae]]}}, {{transl|grc|koin\u00e9}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|t\u00e1 koin\u00e1}} ({{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03ac \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fb0\u0301}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.<ref>Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03ba\u1fd1\u0301\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u1fd0\u03c2]]}}, {{transl|grc|k\u012b\u0301n\u0113sis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of \"common sense\".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as \"[[primary qualities]]\" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term \"primary qualities\"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c\u2013d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example \"are\" versus \"are not\"; are \"similar\" versus \"dissimilar\"; are the \"same\" versus being \"different\"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.</ref> Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.<ref>These \"common sensibles\" or {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called \"[[universals]]\", although Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|no\u00fbs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle\n|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.</ref>\n\nIn this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a \"common sense\" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|a\u00edsth\u0113sis koin\u1e15}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u1fb0\u03c4\u1fb0\u0301 \u03c3\u1fe0\u03bc\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}}, {{transl|grc|kat\u00e1 sumbeb\u0113k\u00f3s}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|id\u00e9\u0101}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that \"when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured\". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.<ref>''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of \"common sense\".</ref> Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have \"some one thing\" that can distinguish black from sweet.<ref>''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a\u2013c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.</ref> The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd]]}}, {{transl|grc|s\u0113me\u00eeon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sachs|2001|page=132}}</ref> The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, \"for it makes us aware of having sensations at all\". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.<ref name=\"brann43\" />\n\nThe discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogue]], the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.<ref>Approximately [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Theaet.+185a&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 185a]\u2013[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D187a 187a].</ref> But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.<ref name=\"greg\">{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]\n\nThe passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}, Introduction.</ref> {{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|pages=204\u2013205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1#Ancient Greek|\u03c6\u1fb0\u03bd\u03c4\u1fb0\u03c3\u1fd0\u0301\u1fb1]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantas\u00ed\u0101}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same.<ref name=\"brann43\">{{harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=43}}</ref><ref name=\"greg\" /> Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Al-Farabi]] felt they were distinct, but later, [[Avicenna]] emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers.<ref name=\"hr42\" /><ref name=\"walz\">{{citation|title=Al-Farabi on the Perfect State|first=Richard |last=Walzer| isbn=978-1871031768|year=1998|page=389}}.</ref> {{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|page=205}} argues that Aristotle used the term \"common sense\" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregori\u0107 calls \"the perceptual capacity of the soul\", or the higher level \"sensory capacity of the soul\" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregori\u0107, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koin\u1e15 a\u00edsth\u0113sis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|page=125}}</ref>\n\nCompared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|ps\u016bkh\u1e17}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|no\u00fbs]]}} or \"intellect\"\u2014which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|l\u00f3gos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|no\u00fbs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's \"common sense\" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|l\u00f3gos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive \"common perceptibles\" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|no\u00fbs}}.<ref>''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.</ref> Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|pages=5\u20136}}.</ref> Gregori\u0107 additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phrone\u00een}} and {{transl|grc|noe\u00een}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.</ref> Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|no\u00fbs}}.\n\nAristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koin\u1e15 a\u00edsth\u0113sis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|pr\u00f4ton aisth\u0113tik\u00f3n}} ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u1fd0\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregori\u0107, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).<ref name=\"walz\" /> [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the \"inner sense\".<ref name=\"hr42\" /> The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. \"Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory. Avicenna, followed by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Albert the Great]], and [[Roger Bacon]], argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, and memory.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|page=10}}. The \"cogitative\" or \"estimative\" capacity, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, \"enables the animal to extract vital information about its environment from the form processed by the common sense and imagination.\"</ref> By the time of [[Descartes]] and [[Hobbes]], in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to ''[[five wits]]'', which complemented the more well-known five \"external\" senses.<ref name=\"hr42\">{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=42}}.</ref> Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior [[Galen]]ic [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] of the brain. The great anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|page=11}}. See below concerning Descartes.</ref>\n\n{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008}} writes that \"In different ways the philosophers of medieval Latin and Arabic tradition, from Al-Farabi to Avicenna, [[Averro\u00ebs]], [[Albertus Magnus|Albert]], and [[Thomas of Aquinas|Thomas]], found in the ''De Anima'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' the scattered elements of a coherent doctrine of the \"central\" faculty of the sensuous soul.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=36}}</ref> It was \"one of the most successful and resilient of Aristotelian notions\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Roman==\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius statue.01.JPG|right|thumb|Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, and an important influence upon the concept of \"humanist\" common sense.]]\n\"{{lang|la|Sensus communis}}\" is the Latin translation of the Greek {{transl|grc|koin\u1e15 a\u00edsth\u0113sis}}, which came to be recovered by Medieval [[scholastics]] when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception.

And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. {{lang|fr|Bon sens}} is the equivalent of modern English \"common sense\" or \"good sense\". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of {{lang|fr|bon sens}} gave a new way of defining {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, but treated them as two separate things).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&nbsp;282.

The Latin term Descartes uses, {{lang|la|bona mens}} ({{literal translation|'good mind'}}), derives from the Stoic author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] who only used it in the second sense.

It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}</ref>\n{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation \"rational\" rather than \"traditional\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.</ref>}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.\n\n==The Enlightenment after Descartes==\n\n===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the \"external world\" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.<ref name=\"gil1\">{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.</ref> Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a \"revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense\".<ref>{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Descartes and the Cartesian \"[[rationalists]]\", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or \"{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}\" [[knowledge]] in the human mind\u2014a controversial proposal.\n\nIn contrast to the rationalists, the \"[[Empiricism|empiricists]]\" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the \"[[idols of the mind]]\", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.<ref>{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] \"introduced him as the \"father\" of the [[scientific method]]\" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to \"common sense\" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]}}.<ref name=\"hund\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of \"common sensibles\" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.<ref name=\"rosenfeld21\">{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.</ref> [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:\n{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable?

Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]\nOnce Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19\u201326}}.</ref> Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.\n\nShaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of \"Good Breeding\". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:\n{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind.

And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.\n\nBy the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the \"moral sense\" or \"[[moral sentiment]]\" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the \"moral sentiments\" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:\n{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.<ref>Chapter II, \"OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY\", in \"[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]\".</ref>}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term \"common sense\" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}</ref> In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday \"common sense\".\n\nAccording to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25\u201327}}</ref> But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. \"{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]].\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}</ref> The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} \"was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}</ref> But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.\n\nGadamer notes one less-known exception\u2014the [[W\u00fcrttemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Giambattista Vico===\n[[File:Giovan Battista Vico.jpg|right|thumb|Giambattista Vico. A defender of classical education in rhetoric, who analysed evidence of ancient wisdom in common sense.]]\nVico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].<ref name=\"Bugter1987\" /> Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.</ref> Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to \"break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached\", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities\u2014as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a \"guiding standard of [[eloquence]]\" but also \"the standard of [[practical judgment]]\". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koin\u1e15 a\u00edsth\u0113sis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the \"fund\" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.</ref>\n\nIn its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as \"judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race\". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],<ref>As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.</ref> Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.<ref>{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii \"Elements\" (\u00a7\u00a7141-146) and I.iv \"Method\" (\u00a7\u00a7347-350).</ref> This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence|access-date=2013-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055102/http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-21|url-status=dead}}.

While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.\n\nReid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.\n\nDespite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.\n\n==Kant: In aesthetic taste==\n[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]\n[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:\n\n{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.\n\nBut under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].</ref>}}\n\nKant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: \"the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition\".<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}</ref>\n\nBut Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's \"{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}\", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using \"the magic wand of common sense\", and not properly confronting the \"metaphysical\" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically\u2014the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.\n\nKant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&nbsp;312, note 2.</ref>\n\nAccording to Gadamer, in contrast to the \"wealth of meaning\" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant \"developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of \"moral feeling\" that had been worked out in English philosophy\". The [[moral imperative]] \"cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32\u201334}}. Note: The source makes it clear that \"English\" includes Scottish authors.</ref> For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34\u201341}}</ref> Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from \"the free play of all our cognitive powers\", and is communal only in that it \"abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}</ref>\n\nKant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:\n{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant\u2014so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.<ref>{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=978-0812205503}}, p.&nbsp;120.</ref>}}\n\n==Contemporary philosophy==\n\n===Epistemology===\nContinuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was \"Critical Common-Sensism\". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.\n\nAnother example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 \"[[A Defence of Common Sense]]\", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/</ref>\n\n===Ethics: what the community would think===\nIn twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Ranci\u00e8re]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] and refer to the \"[[postmodern]]\" condition as one where there is \"{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}\".<ref>{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a \"Kantian\" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a \"[[euphony]]\" in \"dis-sensus\". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.<ref>{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}</ref>\n\nIn a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an \"extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry\".<ref>{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}</ref> In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.\n\nGadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment \"prejudice against prejudice\" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the \"Afterword\" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', \"I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue\".\n\n[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a \"basic kind of knowing on which others rest\".<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology\n|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}</ref> But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.<ref>{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}</ref>\n\nA recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it \"privatized\" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===\"Moral sense\" as opposed to \"rationality\"===\nThe other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.\n\nWhile the term \"common sense\" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).<ref>See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], \"Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse.\" Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11\u201328.</ref> As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.\n\n==Catholic theology==\nAmong Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661\u20131737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Th\u00e9odore Simon Jouffroy|Th\u00e9odore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koina\u00ed d\u00f3xai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.<ref name=\"gil1\" /> In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[\u00c9tienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].<ref name=\"murph\">{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}</ref> Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.<ref name=\"gil1\" />}}\n\nGilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that \"as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted\".<ref name=\"murph\" />\n\n== Projects ==\n* [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy]]'s [[advice taker|advice-taker]] proposal of 1958 represents an early proposal to use logic for representing common-sense knowledge in [[mathematical logic]] and using an [[automated theorem prover]] to derive answers to questions expressed in logical form.

The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, \"the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way.\"[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that \"common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument.\" C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense \"often means\" is \"the elementary mental outfit of the normal man.\"</ref> The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as \"the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done\". The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], \"signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought\". The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}</ref>\n\nIn a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as \"the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language\" and notes, \"A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sj\u00f6berg|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79\u201382|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9450.1982.tb00416.x}}</ref>\n\nThe everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin ''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}'', Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f34\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1f74}} (''{{transl|grc|a\u00edsth\u0113sis koin\u1e15}}''), and French ''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}'', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: \"good sense\" is sometimes seen as equivalent to \"common sense\", and sometimes not.<ref>For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.</ref>\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed \"common sense\", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd}}, {{transl|grc|phrone\u00een}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd]]}}, {{transl|grc|noe\u00een}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]\n\"Common sense\" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae#Ancient Greek|\u03c8\u1fe1\u03c7\u03ae]]}}, {{transl|grc|ps\u016bkh\u1e17}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.\n\nThe second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.<ref>The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives four meanings of \"common sense\":  An archaic meaning is \"An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses\"; \"Ordinary, normal, or average understanding\" without which a man would be \"foolish or insane\", \"the general sense of mankind, or of a community\" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity); A philosophical meaning, the \"faculty of primary truths\".</ref> Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.\n\nAll these meanings of \"common sense\", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning science, politics and economics.<ref>See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''\"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]\"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].</ref> The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.<ref>See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: \"today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere\".</ref>\n\nSince the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term \"common sense\" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to vulgar [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.<ref name=\"hund\">{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}</ref> It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: \"Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common Sense: A Political History|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23|title-link=Common Sense: A Political History}}</ref>\nThis began with [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]]'s criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between \"[[rationalism]]\" and \"[[empiricism]]\". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.<ref>{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is \"{{lang|fr|bon sens}}\" sometimes translated as \"good sense\". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|\"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.\"}}</ref> In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.<ref name=\"hund\" /> Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].\n\n==Aristotelian==\nThe origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.<ref>There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}.</ref> The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of \"perceptible\" or \"sensible\" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the \"common sensibles\" (or \"common perceptibles\"). In this discussion, \"common\" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae]]}}, {{transl|grc|koin\u00e9}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|t\u00e1 koin\u00e1}} ({{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03ac \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fb0\u0301}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.<ref>Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03ba\u1fd1\u0301\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u1fd0\u03c2]]}}, {{transl|grc|k\u012b\u0301n\u0113sis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of \"common sense\".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as \"[[primary qualities]]\" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term \"primary qualities\"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c\u2013d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example \"are\" versus \"are not\"; are \"similar\" versus \"dissimilar\"; are the \"same\" versus being \"different\"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.</ref> Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.<ref>These \"common sensibles\" or {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called \"[[universals]]\", although Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|no\u00fbs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle\n|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.</ref>\n\nIn this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a \"common sense\" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|a\u00edsth\u0113sis koin\u1e15}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u1fb0\u03c4\u1fb0\u0301 \u03c3\u1fe0\u03bc\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}}, {{transl|grc|kat\u00e1 sumbeb\u0113k\u00f3s}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|id\u00e9\u0101}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koin\u00e1}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that \"when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured\". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.<ref>''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of \"common sense\".</ref> Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have \"some one thing\" that can distinguish black from sweet.<ref>''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a\u2013c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.</ref> The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd]]}}, {{transl|grc|s\u0113me\u00eeon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sachs|2001|page=132}}</ref> The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, \"for it makes us aware of having sensations at all\".

Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.<ref name=\"greg\">{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]\n\nThe passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}, Introduction.</ref> {{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|pages=204\u2013205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1#Ancient Greek|\u03c6\u1fb0\u03bd\u03c4\u1fb0\u03c3\u1fd0\u0301\u1fb1]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantas\u00ed\u0101}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time.

According to Gregori\u0107, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koin\u1e15 a\u00edsth\u0113sis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|page=125}}</ref>\n\nCompared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|ps\u016bkh\u1e17}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|no\u00fbs]]}} or \"intellect\"\u2014which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|l\u00f3gos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|no\u00fbs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's \"common sense\" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|l\u00f3gos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive \"common perceptibles\" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|no\u00fbs}}.<ref>''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.</ref> Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gregori\u0107|2007|pages=5\u20136}}.</ref> Gregori\u0107 additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phrone\u00een}} and {{transl|grc|noe\u00een}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gregori\u0107|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.</ref> Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|no\u00fbs}}.\n\nAristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koin\u1e15 a\u00edsth\u0113sis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|pr\u00f4ton aisth\u0113tik\u00f3n}} ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u1fd0\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregori\u0107, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).<ref name=\"walz\" /> [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the \"inner sense\".<ref name=\"hr42\" /> The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. \"Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory.

Shaftesbury and others felt it represented the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit.

Descartes was being original.<ref>{{citation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDpKI8JoLPAC&pg=PA82|page=82| title=Discours de la m\u00e9thode| chapter=Premi\u00e8re Partie; Commentaire Historique| first=Etienne |last=Gilson| year=1925|isbn=9782711601806}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of [[skeptical]] [[reason]]ing.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=30}}</ref> The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}</ref>\n{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation \"rational\" rather than \"traditional\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.</ref>}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.\n\n==The Enlightenment after Descartes==\n\n===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the \"external world\" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.<ref name=\"gil1\">{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.</ref> Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a \"revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense\".<ref>{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Descartes and the Cartesian \"[[rationalists]]\", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or \"{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}\" [[knowledge]] in the human mind\u2014a controversial proposal.\n\nIn contrast to the rationalists, the \"[[Empiricism|empiricists]]\" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the \"[[idols of the mind]]\", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.<ref>{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] \"introduced him as the \"father\" of the [[scientific method]]\" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to \"common sense\" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]}}.<ref name=\"hund\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of \"common sensibles\" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.<ref name=\"rosenfeld21\">{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.</ref> [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:\n{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?<ref>{{Harvtxt|Hume|1987}} Chapter: ESSAY XVIII: THE SCEPTIC</ref>}}\n\n===Ethics: \"humanist\"===\n[[File:Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3. Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]\nOnce Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19\u201326}}.</ref> Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.\n\nShaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of \"Good Breeding\". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:\n{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being ''Partners'' in this ''Sense'', or sharers in this ''common Affection'', as they who scarcely know ''an {{Not a typo|Equal|l}}'', nor consider themselves as subject to any law of ''Fellowship'' or ''Community''. And thus Morality and good Government go together.<ref>{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, Volume I, Part III, section 1.</ref>}}\n\nHutcheson described it as, \"a Publick Sense, viz. \"our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery.\"\" which, he explains, \"was sometimes called {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7}}<ref>Although Greek, this term {{lang|grc|koinono\u0113mos\u00fan\u0113}} is from the ''Meditations'' of the Roman emperor-philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, and was possibly coined by him. However Shaftesbury and others suspect it is a Stoic term. (Not many Stoic texts have survived.)</ref> or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients\".<ref>{{citation|first=Francis |last=Hutcheson| title=An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, ed.

Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.\n\nBy the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the \"moral sense\" or \"[[moral sentiment]]\" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the \"moral sentiments\" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:\n{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.<ref>Chapter II, \"OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY\", in \"[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]\".</ref>}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term \"common sense\" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}</ref> In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday \"common sense\".\n\nAccording to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25\u201327}}</ref> But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. \"{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]].\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}</ref> The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} \"was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}</ref> But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.\n\nGadamer notes one less-known exception\u2014the [[W\u00fcrttemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Giambattista Vico===\n[[File:Giovan Battista Vico.jpg|right|thumb|Giambattista Vico. A defender of classical education in rhetoric, who analysed evidence of ancient wisdom in common sense.]]\nVico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].<ref name=\"Bugter1987\" /> Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.</ref> Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to \"break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached\", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities\u2014as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a \"guiding standard of [[eloquence]]\" but also \"the standard of [[practical judgment]]\". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koin\u1e15 a\u00edsth\u0113sis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the \"fund\" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.</ref>\n\nIn its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as \"judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race\". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],<ref>As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.</ref> Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.<ref>{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii \"Elements\" (\u00a7\u00a7141-146) and I.iv \"Method\" (\u00a7\u00a7347-350).</ref> This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence|access-date=2013-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055102/http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-21|url-status=dead}}.

While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.\n\nReid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.\n\nDespite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.\n\n==Kant: In aesthetic taste==\n[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]\n[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:\n\n{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.\n\nBut under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].</ref>}}\n\nKant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: \"the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition\".<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}</ref>\n\nBut Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's \"{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}\", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using \"the magic wand of common sense\", and not properly confronting the \"metaphysical\" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically\u2014the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.\n\nKant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&nbsp;312, note 2.</ref>\n\nAccording to Gadamer, in contrast to the \"wealth of meaning\" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant \"developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of \"moral feeling\" that had been worked out in English philosophy\". The [[moral imperative]] \"cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32\u201334}}. Note: The source makes it clear that \"English\" includes Scottish authors.</ref> For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34\u201341}}</ref> Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from \"the free play of all our cognitive powers\", and is communal only in that it \"abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion\".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}</ref>\n\nKant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:\n{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant\u2014so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.<ref>{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=978-0812205503}}, p.&nbsp;120.</ref>}}\n\n==Contemporary philosophy==\n\n===Epistemology===\nContinuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was \"Critical Common-Sensism\". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.\n\nAnother example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 \"[[A Defence of Common Sense]]\", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/</ref>\n\n===Ethics: what the community would think===\nIn twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Ranci\u00e8re]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] and refer to the \"[[postmodern]]\" condition as one where there is \"{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}\".<ref>{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a \"Kantian\" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a \"[[euphony]]\" in \"dis-sensus\". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.<ref>{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}</ref>\n\nIn a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an \"extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry\".<ref>{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}</ref> In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.\n\nGadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment \"prejudice against prejudice\" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the \"Afterword\" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', \"I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue\".\n\n[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a \"basic kind of knowing on which others rest\".<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology\n|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}</ref> But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.<ref>{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}</ref>\n\nA recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it \"privatized\" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===\"Moral sense\" as opposed to \"rationality\"===\nThe other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.\n\nWhile the term \"common sense\" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).<ref>See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], \"Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse.\" Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11\u201328.</ref> As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.\n\n==Catholic theology==\nAmong Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661\u20131737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Th\u00e9odore Simon Jouffroy|Th\u00e9odore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koina\u00ed d\u00f3xai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.<ref name=\"gil1\" /> In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[\u00c9tienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].<ref name=\"murph\">{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}</ref> Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.<ref name=\"gil1\" />}}\n\nGilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that \"as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted\".<ref name=\"murph\" />\n\n== Projects ==\n* [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy]]'s [[advice taker|advice-taker]] proposal of 1958 represents an early proposal to use logic for representing common-sense knowledge in [[mathematical logic]] and using an [[automated theorem prover]] to derive answers to questions expressed in logical form.

However, within the pack, citations did not influence their ranking: \"citations appear to be foundational but not a competitive advantage.\"\n* The authors were instead surprised that [[geotargeting]] elements (city & state) in the title of the GMB landing page did not have any impact on GMB rankings.

Their heads, on the other hand, had unusual adaptations depending on the subfamily. 'Traditional' noasaurids, sometimes grouped in the subfamily Noasaurinae, had sharp teeth which splayed outwards from a downturned lower jaw.

''Masiakasaurus'' had an unusually downturned jaw, with long and sharply pointed spoon-shaped teeth. Some of these teeth were nearly horizontal in orientation. ''Limusaurus'', on the other hand, was completely toothless as an adult and likely possessed a horny beak. This large disparity means that it is difficult to find any skull features shared by members of Noasauridae as a whole.\n[[File:Masiakasaurus knopfleri skull reconstruction.jpg|thumb|264x264px|A skull diagram of ''[[Masiakasaurus]]'', the most complete and well-known noasaurine|left]]\nNoasaurids had longer arms than their relatives the abelisaurids, whose arms were tiny and diminished. Although by no means as large or specialized as the arms of advanced bird-like theropods, noasaurid arms were nevertheless capable of movement and use, possibly even for hunting in large-clawed genera such as ''Noasaurus''. Some genera such as ''Limusaurus'' did have somewhat reduced arms and hands, but far from the extent that abelisaurids acquired. Noasaurids were also nimble and lightly built, with feet showing adaptations for running such as a long central foot bone (metatarsal III). Noasaurids varied in size, from the small ''[[Velocisaurus]]'' which was under 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, to much larger genera such as ''Elaphrosaurus'' and ''[[Deltadromeus]]'', which were more than 20 feet (6.2 meters) in length.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA collection of features which characterize noasaurids in particular has been compiled by Rauhut & Carrano (2016), who included controversial taxa such as ''Deltadromeus'' and the elaphrosaurines within Noasauridae. If these groups did not belong to Noasauridae as the study claims, then these similarities are examples of [[convergent evolution]]. Among the most prominent traits relate to the shoulder region. In this family, the long, upward-stretching [[scapula]] (shoulder blade) merges with the smaller and more compact [[coracoid]] (shoulder girdle), forming a fused shoulder bone known as a [[scapulocoracoid]]. While the presence of a scapulocoracoid is by no means unique to this family, noasaurids do have particularly large and wide scapulocoracoids, with a tall and semicircular coracoid region. The hooked rear edge of the coracoid region is also offset from the glenoid (shoulder socket) by a large U-shaped notch. The [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) was thin and straight, with a low and somewhat rounded humeral head (the portion which attached to the shoulder). In contrast, abelisaurids had a large and bulbous humeral head (although similarly rounded) while that of other theropods was flattened from front to back.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Limusaurus inextricabilis skeleton.jpg|thumb|347x347px|A skeletal diagram of ''[[Limusaurus]]'', the most complete and well-known elaphrosaurine]]\nThe leg is also somewhat characteristic in members of this family. The [[tibia]] (large innermost bone of the lower leg) was flattened from the front near the foot, although it was rounded further up the leg. As in other theropods, the femur (thigh bone) of a noasaurid had a ridge along the inner rear surface, known as a [[fourth trochanter]].

The cervical (neck) vertebrae, on the other hand, were quite varied within this family. In noasaurines and a few other genera (such as ''[[Laevisuchus]]''), the neural spines of vertebrae at the front of the neck were positioned towards the front part of their respective vertebrae. This is quite unusual compared to other theropods, which have neural spines roughly midway down their vertebrae. These genera also have long and spine-like epipophyses on the cervicals of most of the neck, although they diminish near the neck.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Epipophyses]] are bony projections located above the postzygapophyses (joints on the rear edge of a vertebra connecting to the front edge of the following vertebra). Elaphrosaurines, on the other hand, have cervical epipophyses which are much more diminished or even absent in the case of ''Elaphrosaurus''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Many noasaurids are only known from vertebrae, including both valid (''Laevisuchus'', ''[[Spinostropheus]]'') and dubious (''[[Compsosuchus|Composuchus]], [[Jubbulpuria]], [[Ornithomimoides]], [[Coeluroides]]'') genera.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Noasaurinae ==\n[[File:Velocisaurus.jpg|thumb|''Velocisaurus'', a small and swift noasaurine|left]]\nNoasaurines are [[Late Cretaceous]] noasaurids known exclusively from southern continents and islands such as [[South America]], [[Madagascar]], and [[India]] (which was an island near Madagascar during the Cretaceous).

Many members of this subfamily are quite fragmentary, and as a result the appearance and biology of the average noasaurine must be inferred from the most complete member of the group, ''Masiakasaurus''. Rauhut & Carrano (2016) define Noasaurinae as \"all noasaurids more closely related to ''Noasaurus'' than to ''Elaphrosaurus'', ''[[Abelisaurus]]'', ''Ceratosaurus'', or ''[[Allosaurus]]\"''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''Masiakasaurus'' (and presumably other noasaurines) had a downturned lower jaw with long teeth splaying forwards. These teeth were spoon-shaped with sharply pointed tips and serrations along their outer edge. The rest of the teeth in the mouth were similar to the teeth of more conventional theropods. The rest of the body was also more similar to that of conventional theropods, with a neck, arms, and legs of moderate length. At least one noasaurine, the eponymous ''Noasaurus'', had a large and deeply curved \"sickle-shaped\" claw of the hand. The diet of noasaurines is difficult to determine, with hypotheses ranging from fish to insects or other small animals.\n\nRauhut & Carrano (2016) found only a single unambiguous trait used to diagnose noasaurines to the exception of other noasaurids. That trait is the fact that their metatarsal II has a diminished proximal (near) end.<ref name=\":2\" /> One noasaurine, ''Velocisaurus'', took this trait even further, with both its metatarsal II and IV reduced to very thin rod-like bones along their entire length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== Elaphrosaurinae ==\n[[File:Elaphrosaurus (flipped).jpg|thumb|325x325px|''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', an elaphrosaurine and also one of the largest putative noasaurids]]\nIt is not entirely certain if elaphrosaurines are legitimate examples of noasaurids. Both ''Limusaurus'' and ''Elaphrosaurus'' have been considered basal ceratosaurians by many studies, with most of these studies considering them even more primitive than ''Ceratosaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"tortosa2013\" /> The most well-known elaphrosaurines lived during the [[Jurassic]] period, much older than the Late Cretaceous period noasaurines. Nevertheless, the existence of ''[[Eoabelisaurus]]'' shows that even abelisaurids had evolved by the [[Middle Jurassic]], and Cretaceous elaphrosaurines such as ''[[Huinculsaurus]]'' have been discovered. It would make sense for Noasauridae (the sister taxa to Abelisauridae) to have evolved during the Jurassic, meaning that the early appearance of elaphrosaurines would not preclude a within Noasauridae. In 2016, a redescription of ''Elaphrosaurus'' by Oliver Rauhut and Matthew Carrano argued against earlier hypotheses that elaphrosaurines were basal ceratosaurs, instead placing them alongside noasaurines within a monophyletic Noasauridae. This study formally defined Elaphrosaurinae as \"all noasaurids more closely related to ''Elaphrosaurus'' than to ''Noasaurus'', ''Abelisaurus'', ''Ceratosaurus'', or ''Allosaurus\".''<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nGenerally speaking, elaphrosaurines were lightly built theropods, with small skulls and long necks and legs. If ''Limusaurus'' is any indication, adult elaphrosaurines were completely toothless, and their mouths were probably edged with a horny beak. It is likely that ''Limusaurus'' and other elaphrosaurines were primarily herbivorous as adults, due to mature ''Limusaurus'' specimens preserving [[gastrolith]]s and chemical signatures resembling those of herbivorous dinosaurs. However, juvenile ''Limusaurus'' specimens retained teeth and lacked these signs of herbivory, meaning that young elaphrosaurines may have been more capable of a carnivorous or omnivorous diet.<ref name=\"onto\" /> The largest known noasaurid, ''Elaphrosaurus'', is the namesake of Elaphrosaurinae. Members of this genus could grow up to 20 feet (6.2 meters) long, although they were significantly lighter than similarly-sized carnivorous contemporaries such as ''Ceratosaurus''.\n\nRauhut & Carrano (2016) listed several features which could be used to diagnose Elaphrosaurinae. Elaphrosaurine cervical vertebrae are amphicoelous, meaning that both their front and rear faces are concave, particularly the front face which is quite strongly concave. While strongly concave front faces are common among many archosaurs, they are quite rare in all but the most basal theropods. [[Carnosauria|Carnosaurs]], [[Megalosauroidea|megalosauroids]], coelurosaurs, and most other ceratosaurians (including noasaurines) all have vertebrae which have front faces ranging from very weakly concave to flat (platycoelous) or convex (opisthocoelous). Another notable feature of elaphrosaurine cervical vertebrae is that their [[cervical rib]]s are completely fused to the centrum (main body) of their corresponding vertebrae.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nElaphrosaurines also have several diagnostic hip features. The hip is quite small compared to their long legs. The [[femur]] (thigh bone) is more than 1.3 times the length of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] (upper plate-like bone of the hip) in members of this subfamily, while most other ceratosaurians have shorter legs and a femur approximately the same length of the ilium. The connection between the ilium and the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] (forward-projecting rod-like lower bone of the hip) is also more simple than in other ceratosaurians. While other ceratosaurians have a peg-and-socket connection between the two bones, elaphrosaurines simply have a flat contact between the two.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Classification==\nThe following [[cladogram]] is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut and Carrano in 2016, showing the relationships among the Noasauridae:<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:100%;line-height:85%\n|label1=[[Abelisauroidea]]&nbsp;\n|1={{clade\n  |1=[[Abelisauridae]]\n   |label2=&nbsp;'''Noasauridae'''&nbsp;\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=''[[Laevisuchus]]''\n      |2=''[[Deltadromeus]]''\n      |3={{clade\n          |label1='''Elaphrosaurinae'''\n          |1={{clade\n             |1=''[[Limusaurus]]''\n             |2={{clade\n                |1=CCG 20011\n                |2=''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'' }} }}\n          |label2='''Noasaurinae'''\n          |2={{clade\n             |1=''[[Velocisaurus]]''\n             |2=''[[Noasaurus]]''\n             |3=''[[Masiakasaurus]]''}} }} }} }} }}\n\nEven in recent studies, the composition of noasauridae has been difficult to resolve.

Their heads, on the other hand, had unusual adaptations depending on the subfamily. 'Traditional' noasaurids, sometimes grouped in the subfamily Noasaurinae, had sharp teeth which splayed outwards from a downturned lower jaw. The most complete and well-known example of these kinds of noasaurids was ''[[Masiakasaurus knopfleri]]'' from Madagascar.<ref>Andrew H. Lee & Patrick M.

''Masiakasaurus'' had an unusually downturned jaw, with long and sharply pointed spoon-shaped teeth. Some of these teeth were nearly horizontal in orientation. ''Limusaurus'', on the other hand, was completely toothless as an adult and likely possessed a horny beak. This large disparity means that it is difficult to find any skull features shared by members of Noasauridae as a whole.\n[[File:Masiakasaurus knopfleri skull reconstruction.jpg|thumb|264x264px|A skull diagram of ''[[Masiakasaurus]]'', the most complete and well-known noasaurine|left]]\nNoasaurids had longer arms than their relatives the abelisaurids, whose arms were tiny and diminished. Although by no means as large or specialized as the arms of advanced bird-like theropods, noasaurid arms were nevertheless capable of movement and use, possibly even for hunting in large-clawed genera such as ''Noasaurus''. Some genera such as ''Limusaurus'' did have somewhat reduced arms and hands, but far from the extent that abelisaurids acquired. Noasaurids were also nimble and lightly built, with feet showing adaptations for running such as a long central foot bone (metatarsal III). Noasaurids varied in size, from the small ''[[Velocisaurus]]'' which was under 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, to much larger genera such as ''Elaphrosaurus'' and ''[[Deltadromeus]]'', which were more than 20 feet (6.2 meters) in length.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA collection of features which characterize noasaurids in particular has been compiled by Rauhut & Carrano (2016), who included controversial taxa such as ''Deltadromeus'' and the elaphrosaurines within Noasauridae. If these groups did not belong to Noasauridae as the study claims, then these similarities are examples of [[convergent evolution]]. Among the most prominent traits relate to the shoulder region. In this family, the long, upward-stretching [[scapula]] (shoulder blade) merges with the smaller and more compact [[coracoid]] (shoulder girdle), forming a fused shoulder bone known as a [[scapulocoracoid]]. While the presence of a scapulocoracoid is by no means unique to this family, noasaurids do have particularly large and wide scapulocoracoids, with a tall and semicircular coracoid region. The hooked rear edge of the coracoid region is also offset from the glenoid (shoulder socket) by a large U-shaped notch. The [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) was thin and straight, with a low and somewhat rounded humeral head (the portion which attached to the shoulder). In contrast, abelisaurids had a large and bulbous humeral head (although similarly rounded) while that of other theropods was flattened from front to back.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Limusaurus inextricabilis skeleton.jpg|thumb|347x347px|A skeletal diagram of ''[[Limusaurus]]'', the most complete and well-known elaphrosaurine]]\nThe leg is also somewhat characteristic in members of this family. The [[tibia]] (large innermost bone of the lower leg) was flattened from the front near the foot, although it was rounded further up the leg. As in other theropods, the femur (thigh bone) of a noasaurid had a ridge along the inner rear surface, known as a [[fourth trochanter]]. However, in noasaurines and elaphrosaurines (but not necessarily other genera such as ''Deltadromeus''), this fourth trochanter was much smaller and lower than the enlarged crest-like structure present in the majority of basal theropods;<ref name=\":2\" /> only a few other groups of theropods ([[Coelophysoidea|coelophysoids]], [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], and a few species of abelisaurids) also have reduced fourth trochanters.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the two subfamilies have a [[Metatarsal bones|metatarsal]] II (the foot bone connected to the innermost major toe) which was flattened from the side. Further reductions to this metatarsal were present in noasaurines (particularly ''Velocisaurus'').<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal|last1=Egli|first1=F. B.|last2=Agnol\u00cdn|first2=F.

The cervical (neck) vertebrae, on the other hand, were quite varied within this family. In noasaurines and a few other genera (such as ''[[Laevisuchus]]''), the neural spines of vertebrae at the front of the neck were positioned towards the front part of their respective vertebrae. This is quite unusual compared to other theropods, which have neural spines roughly midway down their vertebrae. These genera also have long and spine-like epipophyses on the cervicals of most of the neck, although they diminish near the neck.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Epipophyses]] are bony projections located above the postzygapophyses (joints on the rear edge of a vertebra connecting to the front edge of the following vertebra). Elaphrosaurines, on the other hand, have cervical epipophyses which are much more diminished or even absent in the case of ''Elaphrosaurus''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Many noasaurids are only known from vertebrae, including both valid (''Laevisuchus'', ''[[Spinostropheus]]'') and dubious (''[[Compsosuchus|Composuchus]], [[Jubbulpuria]], [[Ornithomimoides]], [[Coeluroides]]'') genera.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Noasaurinae ==\n[[File:Velocisaurus.jpg|thumb|''Velocisaurus'', a small and swift noasaurine|left]]\nNoasaurines are [[Late Cretaceous]] noasaurids known exclusively from southern continents and islands such as [[South America]], [[Madagascar]], and [[India]] (which was an island near Madagascar during the Cretaceous).

Many members of this subfamily are quite fragmentary, and as a result the appearance and biology of the average noasaurine must be inferred from the most complete member of the group, ''Masiakasaurus''. Rauhut & Carrano (2016) define Noasaurinae as \"all noasaurids more closely related to ''Noasaurus'' than to ''Elaphrosaurus'', ''[[Abelisaurus]]'', ''Ceratosaurus'', or ''[[Allosaurus]]\"''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''Masiakasaurus'' (and presumably other noasaurines) had a downturned lower jaw with long teeth splaying forwards. These teeth were spoon-shaped with sharply pointed tips and serrations along their outer edge. The rest of the teeth in the mouth were similar to the teeth of more conventional theropods. The rest of the body was also more similar to that of conventional theropods, with a neck, arms, and legs of moderate length. At least one noasaurine, the eponymous ''Noasaurus'', had a large and deeply curved \"sickle-shaped\" claw of the hand. The diet of noasaurines is difficult to determine, with hypotheses ranging from fish to insects or other small animals.\n\nRauhut & Carrano (2016) found only a single unambiguous trait used to diagnose noasaurines to the exception of other noasaurids. That trait is the fact that their metatarsal II has a diminished proximal (near) end.<ref name=\":2\" /> One noasaurine, ''Velocisaurus'', took this trait even further, with both its metatarsal II and IV reduced to very thin rod-like bones along their entire length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== Elaphrosaurinae ==\n[[File:Elaphrosaurus (flipped).jpg|thumb|325x325px|''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', an elaphrosaurine and also one of the largest putative noasaurids]]\nIt is not entirely certain if elaphrosaurines are legitimate examples of noasaurids. Both ''Limusaurus'' and ''Elaphrosaurus'' have been considered basal ceratosaurians by many studies, with most of these studies considering them even more primitive than ''Ceratosaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"tortosa2013\" /> The most well-known elaphrosaurines lived during the [[Jurassic]] period, much older than the Late Cretaceous period noasaurines. Nevertheless, the existence of ''[[Eoabelisaurus]]'' shows that even abelisaurids had evolved by the [[Middle Jurassic]], and Cretaceous elaphrosaurines such as ''[[Huinculsaurus]]'' have been discovered. It would make sense for Noasauridae (the sister taxa to Abelisauridae) to have evolved during the Jurassic, meaning that the early appearance of elaphrosaurines would not preclude a within Noasauridae. In 2016, a redescription of ''Elaphrosaurus'' by Oliver Rauhut and Matthew Carrano argued against earlier hypotheses that elaphrosaurines were basal ceratosaurs, instead placing them alongside noasaurines within a monophyletic Noasauridae. This study formally defined Elaphrosaurinae as \"all noasaurids more closely related to ''Elaphrosaurus'' than to ''Noasaurus'', ''Abelisaurus'', ''Ceratosaurus'', or ''Allosaurus\".''<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nGenerally speaking, elaphrosaurines were lightly built theropods, with small skulls and long necks and legs. If ''Limusaurus'' is any indication, adult elaphrosaurines were completely toothless, and their mouths were probably edged with a horny beak. It is likely that ''Limusaurus'' and other elaphrosaurines were primarily herbivorous as adults, due to mature ''Limusaurus'' specimens preserving [[gastrolith]]s and chemical signatures resembling those of herbivorous dinosaurs. However, juvenile ''Limusaurus'' specimens retained teeth and lacked these signs of herbivory, meaning that young elaphrosaurines may have been more capable of a carnivorous or omnivorous diet.<ref name=\"onto\" /> The largest known noasaurid, ''Elaphrosaurus'', is the namesake of Elaphrosaurinae. Members of this genus could grow up to 20 feet (6.2 meters) long, although they were significantly lighter than similarly-sized carnivorous contemporaries such as ''Ceratosaurus''.\n\nRauhut & Carrano (2016) listed several features which could be used to diagnose Elaphrosaurinae. Elaphrosaurine cervical vertebrae are amphicoelous, meaning that both their front and rear faces are concave, particularly the front face which is quite strongly concave. While strongly concave front faces are common among many archosaurs, they are quite rare in all but the most basal theropods. [[Carnosauria|Carnosaurs]], [[Megalosauroidea|megalosauroids]], coelurosaurs, and most other ceratosaurians (including noasaurines) all have vertebrae which have front faces ranging from very weakly concave to flat (platycoelous) or convex (opisthocoelous). Another notable feature of elaphrosaurine cervical vertebrae is that their [[cervical rib]]s are completely fused to the centrum (main body) of their corresponding vertebrae.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nElaphrosaurines also have several diagnostic hip features. The hip is quite small compared to their long legs. The [[femur]] (thigh bone) is more than 1.3 times the length of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] (upper plate-like bone of the hip) in members of this subfamily, while most other ceratosaurians have shorter legs and a femur approximately the same length of the ilium. The connection between the ilium and the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] (forward-projecting rod-like lower bone of the hip) is also more simple than in other ceratosaurians. While other ceratosaurians have a peg-and-socket connection between the two bones, elaphrosaurines simply have a flat contact between the two.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Classification==\nThe following [[cladogram]] is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut and Carrano in 2016, showing the relationships among the Noasauridae:<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:100%;line-height:85%\n|label1=[[Abelisauroidea]]&nbsp;\n|1={{clade\n  |1=[[Abelisauridae]]\n   |label2=&nbsp;'''Noasauridae'''&nbsp;\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=''[[Laevisuchus]]''\n      |2=''[[Deltadromeus]]''\n      |3={{clade\n          |label1='''Elaphrosaurinae'''\n          |1={{clade\n             |1=''[[Limusaurus]]''\n             |2={{clade\n                |1=CCG 20011\n                |2=''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'' }} }}\n          |label2='''Noasaurinae'''\n          |2={{clade\n             |1=''[[Velocisaurus]]''\n             |2=''[[Noasaurus]]''\n             |3=''[[Masiakasaurus]]''}} }} }} }} }}\n\nEven in recent studies, the composition of noasauridae has been difficult to resolve.
