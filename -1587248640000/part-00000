Females often disliked the idea that computers \"become their life.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.\n\nA two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that \"Girls approach the computer as a \"tool\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \"toy\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse \"real\" power and power on a screen. \"I see a computer as a tool,\" a high school girl declares. \"You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way.\"<ref>AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000).

Most people do not realize that the \"extra help\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.\n\n===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===\nThe need for experience helped women a lot better than the requirement of a college degree.<ref name=\":09\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> They had more chances of gaining experience at a workplace than attaining a college degree.<ref name=\":010\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> \n\nWomen in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\"]. Catalyst.</ref> This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" /> The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\".<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" />\n\nHowever, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\">(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies \"Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies\"]. Catalyst.</ref> Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.\n\n===Stereotyping computer scientists===\nOther research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.<ref name=\"Ortutay 2017\">{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}</ref> Nonetheless, it has been found that a women\u2019s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.<ref name=\"Trusty 2002\">{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors.

Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.<ref>[http://www.cips.ca/women \"Women in IT\"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.</ref> Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.\n\nAdditionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.\n\n===Twenty-first century efforts===\n{{Globalize section|US|date=February 2020}}\n\n====National Center for Women & Information Technology====\n[[National Center for Women & Information Technology]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC).

WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2014/02/10/harvard-wecode-conference-welcomes-more-women-into-tech/jAlzh5KVabxMJQjhsjZa9N/blog.html|title=Harvard's WECode conference welcomes more women into tech|work=Boston.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/02/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science/|title=Closing the gender gap in computer science|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=2014-02-11}}</ref>\n\n====Pacesetters====\nIn an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called \"Pacesetters\". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J.

Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.\n\nA two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that \"Girls approach the computer as a \"tool\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \"toy\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium.

The MIT Press.</ref> has highlighted such factors as:\n\n* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the \"weedout\" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.\n* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.\n* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that \"women can do computing as well as men\".\n* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.\n\nJust like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need \"extra help\" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the \"extra help\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.\n\n===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===\nThe need for experience helped women a lot better than the requirement of a college degree.<ref name=\":09\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> They had more chances of gaining experience at a workplace than attaining a college degree.<ref name=\":010\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> \n\nWomen in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\"]. Catalyst.</ref> This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" /> The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\".<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" />\n\nHowever, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\">(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies \"Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies\"]. Catalyst.</ref> Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.\n\n===Stereotyping computer scientists===\nOther research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired.

Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.<ref>[http://www.cips.ca/women \"Women in IT\"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.</ref> Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.\n\nAdditionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum.

Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC).

Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J. Mcgrath| last2 =  Nigai| first2 =  Sergey| last3 =  Kaye| first3 =  Joseph \"Jofish\"| year = 2011 | title = Gender And Computing Conference Papers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 72\u201380 | doi=10.1145/1978542.1978561}}</ref> A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single, brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

{"title_page": "Darkness (poem)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n\"'''Darkness'''\" is a poem written by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] in July 1816. That year was known as the [[Year Without a Summer]], because [[Mount Tambora]] had erupted in the [[Dutch East Indies]] the previous year, casting enough sulphur into the atmosphere to reduce global temperatures and cause abnormal weather across much of north-east America and northern Europe. This pall of darkness inspired Byron to write his poem. Literary critics were initially content to classify it as a \"last man\" poem, telling the apocalyptic story of the last man on earth. More recent critics have focused on the poem's historical context, as well as the [[Criticism of the Bible|anti-biblical nature]] of the poem, despite its many references to the Bible. The poem was written only months after the end of Byron's marriage to [[Anne Isabella Milbanke]].\n\n==Historical context==\n[[Image:1815 tambora explosion.png|thumb|350px|A diagram of the estimated ash fallout from the 1815 [[Mount Tambora]] eruption. Ash clouds travelled much farther.]]\nByron's poem was written during the [[Romantic period]]. During this period, several events occurred which resembled (to some) the biblical signs of the [[apocalypse]]. Many authors at the time saw themselves as prophets with a duty to warn others about their impending doom.<ref>Introduction, 7</ref> However, at the same time period, many were questioning their faith in a loving God, due to recent fossil discoveries revealing records of the deaths of entire species buried in the earth.<ref>Gordon 614</ref>\n\n1816, the year in which the poem was written, was called \"the year without summer\", as strange weather and an inexplicable darkness caused record-cold temperatures across Europe, especially in Geneva.<ref>Paley, 2</ref> Byron claimed to have received his inspiration for the poem, saying he \"wrote it... at Geneva, when there was a celebrated dark day, on which the fowls went to roost at noon, and the candles were lighted as at midnight\".<ref>Paley, 3</ref> The darkness was (unknown to those of the time) caused by the volcanic ash spewing from the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia (Vail 184). The search for a cause of the strange changes in the light of day only grew as scientists discovered [[Sunspot|sunspots]] on the sun so large that they could be seen with the naked eye.<ref>Vail, 184</ref> Newspapers such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'' reported on the panic:\n{{quote|The large spots which may now be seen upon the sun's disk have given rise to ridiculous apprehensions and absurd predictions. These spots are said to be the cause of the remarkable and wet weather we have had this Summer; and the increase of these spots is represented to announce a general removal of heat from the globe, the extinction of nature, and the end of the world.<ref>qtd. in Vail 184</ref>}}\nA scientist in Italy even predicted that the sun would go out on 18 July,<ref>Vail 183</ref> shortly before Byron's writing of \"Darkness\". His \"prophecy\" caused riots, suicides, and religious fervour all over Europe.<ref>Vail 186</ref> For example: \n{{quote|A Bath girl woke her aunt and shouted at her that the world was ending, and the woman promptly plunged into a coma. In Liege, a huge cloud in the shape of a mountain hovered over the town, causing alarm among the \"old women\" who expected the end of the world on the eighteenth. In Ghent, a regiment of cavalry passing through the town during a thunderstorm blew their trumpets, causing \"three-fourths of the inhabitants\" to rush forth and throw themselves on their knees in the streets, thinking they had heard the seventh trumpet.<ref>qtd. in Vail 186</ref>}}\nThis prediction, and the strange behavior of nature at this time, stood in direct contrast with many of the feelings of the age. [[William Wordsworth]] often expresses in his writing a belief in the connection of God and nature which for much of the Romantic Era's poetry is typical. His \"[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]\", for example, says \"Nature never did betray / The heart that loved her\".<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 122\u2013123</ref> His poetry also carries the idea that nature is a kind thing, living in peaceful co-existence with man. He says in the same poem, referring to nature, that \"all which we behold / is full of blessings.\"<ref>qtd. in Schroeder 116</ref> In other poems, such as \"[[I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud]]\", he uses language for flowers and clouds that is commonly used for heavenly hosts of angels.<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 4</ref> Even the more frightening Gothic poems of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], another famous poet of the time, argue for a kind treatment of nature that is only cruel if treated cruelly, as in ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner|The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', unlike Byron's sun, which goes out with no human mistreatment mentioned at all.<ref>Schroeder, 116</ref>\n\n==Criticism and analysis==\nIn the past, critics were happy to classify \"Darkness\" as a \"Last Man\" poem, following a general theme of end of the world scenes from the view of the last man on earth. However, recent scholarship has pointed out the poem's lack of any single \"Last Man\" character.<ref>Schroeder 117</ref>\n\n===Biblical imagery===\nByron also uses the hellish biblical language of the apocalypse to carry the real possibility of these events to his readers. The whole poem can be seen as a reference to Matthew 24:29: \"the sun shall be darkened.\"  In line 32 it describes men \"gnash[ing] their teeth\" at the sky, a clear biblical parallel of hell.<ref>see Matt 24:51</ref> Vipers twine \"themselves among the multitude, / Hissing.\"<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 35\u201337</ref> Two men left alive of \"an enormous city\" gather \"holy things\" around an altar, \"for an unholy usage\"\u2014to burn them for light. Seeing themselves in the light of the fire, they die at the horror of seeing each other \"unknowing who he was upon whose brow Famine had written Fiend.\"<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 55\u201369</ref> In this future, all men are made to look like fiends, emaciated, dying with \"their bones as tombless as their flesh.\"<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 45</ref> They also act like fiends, as Byron says: \"no love was left,\"<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 41</ref> matching the biblical prophecy that at the end of the world, \"the love of many shall wax cold.\"<ref>see Matt 24:12</ref>  In doing this, Byron is merely magnifying the events already occurring at the time.  The riots, the suicides, the fear associated with the strange turn in the weather and the predicted destruction of the sun, had besieged not only people's hope for a long life, but their beliefs about God's creation and about themselves as well.  By bringing out this diabolical imagery, Byron is communicating that fear; that \"Darkness [or nature] had no need / of aid from them\u2014She was the universe.\"<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 81\u201382</ref>\n\nByron's pessimistic views continue, as he mixes Biblical language with the apparent realities of science at the time. As Paley points out, it is not so much significant that Byron uses Biblical passages as that he deviates from them to make a point.<ref>Paley, 6</ref> For example, the thousand-year peace mentioned in the book of Revelation as coming after all the horror of the apocalypse does not exist in Byron's \"Darkness.\"  Instead, \"War, which for a moment was no more, / Did glut himself again.\"<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 38\u201339</ref> In other words, swords are only beaten temporarily into plowshares, only to become swords of war once again. Also, the fact that the vipers are \"stingless\"<ref>\"Darkness,\" ll. 37</ref> parallels the Biblical image of the peace to follow destruction: \"And the sucking child shall play in the whole of the asp.\"<ref>Paley 6</ref>  In the poem, though, the snake is rendered harmless, but the humans take advantage of this and the vipers are \"slain for food.\"  Paley continues, saying \"associations of millennial imagery are consistently invoked to be bitterly frustrated.\"<ref>Paley, 6</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Gordon, George. \u201cDarkness.\u201d ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''.
