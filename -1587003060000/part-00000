This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system. The difference is that it was right-of-centre in the Sunshine State and it is left-of-centre here in Victoria.[...] I don\u2019t think Aborigines were treated as prejudicially by even the worst of 19th-century judges.\"<ref name=\"travesty\">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/travesty-of-justice-trusted-institutions-fail-pell-public/news-story/04a4dabedeb056f5c6d83d37fed07f01 Travesty of justice: \u2018trusted\u2019 institutions fail Pell, public]; The Australian; 11 April 2020</ref> \n\nThe Victoria Police have been criticised for failing to properly test the accusations against Pell by interviewing relevant witnesses prior to laying charges. They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system. The difference is that it was right-of-centre in the Sunshine State and it is left-of-centre here in Victoria.[...] I don\u2019t think Aborigines were treated as prejudicially by even the worst of 19th-century judges.\"<ref name=\"travesty\">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/travesty-of-justice-trusted-institutions-fail-pell-public/news-story/04a4dabedeb056f5c6d83d37fed07f01 Travesty of justice: \u2018trusted\u2019 institutions fail Pell, public]; The Australian; 11 April 2020</ref> \n\nThe Victoria Police have been criticised for failing to properly test the accusations against Pell by interviewing relevant witnesses prior to laying charges. They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

Chillicothe is a designated [[Tree City USA]] by the [[Arbor Day|National Arbor Day Foundation]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chillicothe, Ohio sign.jpg|left|thumb|First capital sign at edge of the city]]\nThe region around Chillicothe was the center of the ancient [[Hopewell tradition]], which flourished from 200 BC until 500 AD.  This Amerindian culture had trade routes extending to the [[Rocky Mountains]].

Migrants from [[Virginia]] and [[Kentucky]] moved west along the Ohio River in search of land. The community Chillicothe was founded in 1796 by a party led by General [[Nathaniel Massie]] on his land grant. The town's name comes from the [[Shawnee language|Shawnee]] ''[[Chalahgawtha|Chala\u00b7ka\u00b7tha]]'' (Chillicothe in English), meaning \"principal town\", because it was the chief settlement of that division (one of five major divisions) of the [[Shawnee people]].\n\nIn 1798, [[Ross County, Ohio|Ross County]] became incorporated with Chillicothe as the county seat.  Chillicothe was named the capital of the remnant [[Northwest Territory]] in 1800, when [[Indiana Territory]] was split off, and the Northwest Territory was reduced to Ohio, eastern [[Michigan]] and a sliver of southeastern [[Indiana]]. In 1802 as Ohio moved toward statehood, the city hosted the Ohio Constitutional Convention.

Its stage has been graced by such greats as [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Milton Berle]], [[George Arliss]], [[Sophie Tucker]], and many others.  In 1853 the Masonic Hall was built, as the first incarnation of what is now the Majestic Theatre. \nThe two-story brick building was a combination lodge room, dance hall, and theatre.  Stock companies stayed for as long as a month, performing a repertory of plays.  In 1876 the Masons appointed a building committee to enlarge their building. The original building was 40&nbsp;ft. x 100&nbsp;ft. and was extended to 50&nbsp;ft. x 120&nbsp;ft. Upon completion in December 1876 it was announced that the Masonic Opera House was one of the finest theatres in the state. After the remodeling and with the completion of the Clough Opera House across the city, theatre offerings were tremendous, and varied drama, comedy, farce, minstrel shows and operas were presented.\n\nIn 1904 A. R. Wolf bought the Masonic Opera House. Mr. Wolf remodeled the theatre and enlarged the stage.  He replaced all the windows in the front of the building with stained glass windows. The Masonic Opera House continued under Wolf's managerial abilities until he sold it to the Myers Brothers in 1915. They again made some improvements and repairs and installed a movie screen and equipment. The Myers Brothers changed the name to the Majestic Theatre.  They occasionally had live theatre productions on the stage but finally switched exclusively to motion pictures. \nIn July 1971, Harley and Evelyn Bennett became the new owners of the Majestic Theatre. They did careful restoration with reference to the original wall painting.\nThree Chillicothe businessmen bought the theatre as a non-profit organization in 1990. All new wiring throughout the theatre, fire safety, and security systems were installed.\n\n===Fairs and festivals===\n[[File:Story Mound in Chillicothe.jpg|thumb|Chillicothe's Story Mound State Memorial]]\nChillicothe, rich in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] history, hosts the annual Feast of the Flowering Moon Festival. Started in 1984, the May festival draws crowds of approximately 85,000. Yoctangee Park, in the historic downtown, is the setting for this family-oriented, three-day event featuring Native American music, dancing, traders and exhibits, a mountain men encampment, rendezvous with working craftsmen and demonstrations, and an extensive arts and crafts show with more than 80 crafters and commercial exhibits.  The main stage has a schedule of family-friendly entertainment, such as local school bands and performers.  The streets are lined with food booths and games/contests.  Events are free to the public.\n\nOn the Friday and Saturday after [[Labor Day]] in September, Chillicothe hosts the annual [[Southern Ohio Storytelling Festival]]. The festival features concert performances by several highly acclaimed and award-winning storytellers.  Storytelling concerts are held throughout the day on both Friday and Saturday. Thousands of students participate during the day on Friday in various venues, including the Majestic Theatre, a tent at the Pump House Art Gallery in [[Yoctangee Park]], and local school auditoriums.\n\n===Athletic events===\nThe [[Chillicothe Paints]] are a baseball team that was established in February 1993.

Migrants from [[Virginia]] and [[Kentucky]] moved west along the Ohio River in search of land. The community Chillicothe was founded in 1796 by a party led by General [[Nathaniel Massie]] on his land grant. The town's name comes from the [[Shawnee language|Shawnee]] ''[[Chalahgawtha|Chala\u00b7ka\u00b7tha]]'' (Chillicothe in English), meaning \"principal town\", because it was the chief settlement of that division (one of five major divisions) of the [[Shawnee people]].\n\nIn 1798, [[Ross County, Ohio|Ross County]] became incorporated with Chillicothe as the county seat.  Chillicothe was named the capital of the remnant [[Northwest Territory]] in 1800, when [[Indiana Territory]] was split off, and the Northwest Territory was reduced to Ohio, eastern [[Michigan]] and a sliver of southeastern [[Indiana]]. In 1802 as Ohio moved toward statehood, the city hosted the Ohio Constitutional Convention.

The square building left of center is a replica of Ohio's first capitol building and serves as the office of the ''[[Chillicothe Gazette]]''.]]\n\n===Majestic Theatre===\nChillicothe is home to the 158-year-old continuously operating Majestic Theatre.  Its stage has been graced by such greats as [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Milton Berle]], [[George Arliss]], [[Sophie Tucker]], and many others.  In 1853 the Masonic Hall was built, as the first incarnation of what is now the Majestic Theatre. \nThe two-story brick building was a combination lodge room, dance hall, and theatre.  Stock companies stayed for as long as a month, performing a repertory of plays.  In 1876 the Masons appointed a building committee to enlarge their building. The original building was 40&nbsp;ft. x 100&nbsp;ft. and was extended to 50&nbsp;ft. x 120&nbsp;ft. Upon completion in December 1876 it was announced that the Masonic Opera House was one of the finest theatres in the state. After the remodeling and with the completion of the Clough Opera House across the city, theatre offerings were tremendous, and varied drama, comedy, farce, minstrel shows and operas were presented.\n\nIn 1904 A. R. Wolf bought the Masonic Opera House. Mr. Wolf remodeled the theatre and enlarged the stage.  He replaced all the windows in the front of the building with stained glass windows. The Masonic Opera House continued under Wolf's managerial abilities until he sold it to the Myers Brothers in 1915. They again made some improvements and repairs and installed a movie screen and equipment. The Myers Brothers changed the name to the Majestic Theatre.  They occasionally had live theatre productions on the stage but finally switched exclusively to motion pictures. \nIn July 1971, Harley and Evelyn Bennett became the new owners of the Majestic Theatre. They did careful restoration with reference to the original wall painting.\nThree Chillicothe businessmen bought the theatre as a non-profit organization in 1990. All new wiring throughout the theatre, fire safety, and security systems were installed.\n\n===Fairs and festivals===\n[[File:Story Mound in Chillicothe.jpg|thumb|Chillicothe's Story Mound State Memorial]]\nChillicothe, rich in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] history, hosts the annual Feast of the Flowering Moon Festival. Started in 1984, the May festival draws crowds of approximately 85,000. Yoctangee Park, in the historic downtown, is the setting for this family-oriented, three-day event featuring Native American music, dancing, traders and exhibits, a mountain men encampment, rendezvous with working craftsmen and demonstrations, and an extensive arts and crafts show with more than 80 crafters and commercial exhibits.  The main stage has a schedule of family-friendly entertainment, such as local school bands and performers.  The streets are lined with food booths and games/contests.  Events are free to the public.\n\nOn the Friday and Saturday after [[Labor Day]] in September, Chillicothe hosts the annual [[Southern Ohio Storytelling Festival]]. The festival features concert performances by several highly acclaimed and award-winning storytellers.  Storytelling concerts are held throughout the day on both Friday and Saturday. Thousands of students participate during the day on Friday in various venues, including the Majestic Theatre, a tent at the Pump House Art Gallery in [[Yoctangee Park]], and local school auditoriums.\n\n===Athletic events===\nThe [[Chillicothe Paints]] are a baseball team that was established in February 1993. The team was previously a member of the [[Frontier League]], playing there from founding until 2008.  They were one of the original teams in the league.  The Paints are now a member of the summer collegiate [[Prospect League]], The Paints play their home games at [[V.A. Memorial Stadium]], which opened in 1954.\n\nAs the V.A. Memorial Stadium can be turned into a field for many uses, it also plays host to numerous sports events such as the M.A.C. Division baseball playoffs, OHSAA soccer playoffs, and OHSAA baseball playoffs.\n\nIn June, the streets of Chillicothe near [[Yoctangee Park]] are blocked off to accommodate temporary courts for the [[Gus Macker]] three-on-three basketball competition.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jimmy Strausbaugh]], football player\n* [[Thomas M.

Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive [[Clovis point]], a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of [[carbon dating]] methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|BP]] (roughly 9100 to 8850&nbsp; BCE).\n\nNumerous [[Paleoindian]] cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the [[Great Plains]] and [[Great Lakes]] of the modern United States of America and Canada, as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional [[creation stories]].

Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of [[Neolithic Revolution]] to sustain such large villages over long periods. Native American cultures are not included in characterizations of advanced stone age cultures as \"[[Neolithic]],\" which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in Eurasia, Africa, and other regions.\n\n[[Image: Watson Brake Aerial Illustration HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Watson Brake Aerial Illustration]]\nThe prime example is [[Watson Brake]] in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE, making it the oldest dated site in the Americas for such complex construction.

At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the [[Southeastern Woodlands]] into the northern shores of [[Lake Ontario]].

The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over North America.\n\n[[File: Coles Creek culture map HRoe 2010.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|A map showing the extent of the Coles Creek cultural period and some important sites.]]\nThe [[Coles Creek culture]] was an indigenous development of the Lower Mississippi Valley that took place between the late [[Woodland period]] and the later [[Plaquemine culture]] period. The period is marked by the increased use of flat-topped [[platform mound]]s arranged around central plazas, more complex political institutions, and a subsistence strategy still grounded in the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] and hunting rather than on the [[maize]] plant as would happen in the succeeding [[Plaquemine Mississippian]] period. The culture was originally defined by the unique decoration on [[Temper (pottery)|grog-tempered]] ceramic ware by [[James A. Ford]] after his investigations at the [[Mazique Archeological Site]]. He had studied both the Mazique and Coles Creek Sites, and almost went with the ''Mazique culture'', but decided on the less historically involved sites name. It is ancestral to the [[Plaquemine culture]].\n\n{{Main|Mississippian culture}}\nThe Mississippian culture which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the Southeast created the largest [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] in North America north of Mexico, most notably at [[Cahokia]], on a tributary of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois.\n\n**The ten-story [[Monks Mound]] at Cahokia has a larger circumference than the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] at [[Teotihuacan]] or the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Egypt]]. The {{convert|6|mi2}} city complex was based on the culture's cosmology; it included more than 100&nbsp;mounds, positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of [[astronomy]], and built with knowledge of varying soil types. The society began building at this site about 950&nbsp;CE, and reached its peak population in 1,250&nbsp;CE of 20,000\u201330,000 people, which was not equalled by any city in the present-day United States until after 1800.\n**Cahokia was a major regional [[chiefdom]], with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n**[[Kincaid Mounds State Historic Site|Kincaid]]<ref>{{cite thesis | author= Buchanan, Meghan E. | publisher= [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] | year= 2007 | page= 40 | title= Patterns of Faunal Utilization at Kincaid Mounds, Massac County, Illinois | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yGVh4vIPX0MC}}</ref> c. 1050\u20131400 CE,<ref name=\"SH\">{{cite journal|title=Kincaid: A Prehistoric Cultural and Religious Center| author=John E.

Those involved in the [[fur trade]] in the northern areas tended to ally with French forces against British colonial militias. Native Americans fought on both sides of the conflict. The greater number of tribes fought with the French in the hopes of checking British expansion. The British had made fewer allies, but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories.

Most Native Americans who joined the struggle sided with the British, based both on their trading relationships and hopes that colonial defeat would result in a halt to further colonial expansion onto Native American land. Many native communities were divided over which side to support in the war and others wanted to remain neutral. The first native community to [[Treaty of Fort Pitt (1778)|sign a treaty with the new United States Government]] was the [[Lenape]]. For the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy, based in New York, the American Revolution resulted in [[civil war]]. The only Iroquois tribes to ally with the colonials were the Oneida and Tuscarora.\n\n[[Frontier warfare during the American Revolution]] was particularly brutal, and numerous atrocities were committed by settlers and native tribes alike. Noncombatants suffered greatly during the war. Military expeditions on each side destroyed villages and food supplies to reduce the ability of people to fight, as in frequent raids by both sides in the [[Mohawk Valley]] and western New York.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9077648/Wyoming-Massacre Wyoming Massacre], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref> The largest of these expeditions was the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779, in which American colonial troops destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages to neutralize Iroquois raids in [[upstate New York]].

The United States initially treated the Native Americans who had fought as allies with the British as a conquered people who had lost their lands. Although most members of the Iroquois tribes went to Canada with the Loyalists, others tried to stay in New York and western territories to maintain their lands.

Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the [[Hopewell Treaty|Hopewell Treaty of 1785]]. Under President [[Andrew Jackson]], [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the [[Mississippi River]] for lands west of the river.\n\nAs many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this [[Indian Removal]] policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties.\n\nThe most egregious violation of the stated intention of the removal policy took place under the [[Treaty of New Echota]], which was signed by a dissident faction of [[Cherokee]]s but not the principal chief. The following year, the Cherokee conceded to removal, but Georgia included their land in a lottery for European-American settlement before that. President Jackson used the military to gather and transport the Cherokee to the west, whose timing and lack of adequate supplies led to the deaths of an estimated 4,000 Cherokees on the [[Trail of Tears]]. About 17,000 Cherokees, along with approximately 2,000 enslaved blacks held by Cherokees, were taken by force migration to Indian Territory.<ref>Carter (III), Samuel (1976).

Since the rise of self-determination for Native Americans, they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live. In addition, many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures. Beginning in the 1970s, tribes have also founded [[Tribal colleges and universities|colleges]] at their reservations, controlled and operated by Native Americans, to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures.\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:Wilson - Address to the American Indians.ogg|alt=President Wilson's speech|thumb|left|President [[Woodrow Wilson]] speaking to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans,]] 1913]]\n[[File:Charles Curtis-portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Charles Curtis]], of [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Potawatomi]], [[French people|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] ancestry, was 31st&nbsp;Vice President of the United States, 1929\u20131933.]]\nOn August 29, 1911 [[Ishi]], generally considered to have been the last Native American to live most of his life without contact with [[European-American]] culture, was discovered near [[Oroville, California]] after a forest fire drove him from nearby mountains.

It involved more people than any migration since the [[Indian Removal|removals]] from areas east of the Mississippi River of the early 19th century.\n\nThe men's service with the US military in the international conflict was a turning point in Native American history. The overwhelming majority of Native Americans welcomed the opportunity to serve; they had a voluntary enlistment rate that was 40% higher than those who were drafted. War Department officials said that if the entire population had enlisted in the same proportion as the Native Americans, the response would have rendered the draft unnecessary.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/topics/natam/natam-wwii.html\n|title = Native Americans in World War II\n|accessdate = 2011-05-01\n|author = Thomas D. Morgan\n|publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}</ref>\n\nTheir fellow soldiers often held them in high esteem, in part since the legend of the tough Native American warrior had become a part of the fabric of American historical legend. White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them \"chief\". Native American cultures were profoundly changed after their young men returned home, because of their wide contact with the world outside of the reservation system. \"The war\", said the U.S.&nbsp;Indian Commissioner in 1945, \"caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era\", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref>\n\nThe most significant of these changes was the opportunity\u2014as a result of wartime labor shortages\u2014to find well-paying work in cities. After the war many Native Americans relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry. In the 1950s the federal government had a relocation policy encouraging them to do so because of economic opportunity in cities. But Native Americans struggled with discrimination and the great cultural changes in leaving their reservations behind.\n\nThere were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200&nbsp;[[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War&nbsp;II; only about half came home alive. In addition many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as [[Code talker]]s for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.\n\n===Self-determination===\n{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}\n\nMilitary service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969\u20131971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300&nbsp;[[Oglala Lakota]] and [[American Indian Movement]]&nbsp;(AIM) activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February 27,&nbsp;1973.<ref name=\"Waldron\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/shot-kills-indian-at-wounded-knee-another-insurgent-is-hurt-during.html |title=Shot Kills Indian At Wounded Knee |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 28, 1973|accessdate=2010-08-22|first=Martin|last=Waldron}}</ref>\n\nIndian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71&nbsp;days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed. In late April a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<ref name=\"Waldron\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range. The AIM activist [[Leonard Peltier]] was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the FBI deaths.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crosson |first=Judith |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/05/appeals_court_denies_peltiers_parole_bid/ |title=Appeals court denies Peltier's parole bid |publisher=Boston.com |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 the government enacted the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968|Indian Civil Rights Act]]. This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 Idaho Law Review 465 (1998).</ref> In 1975 the U.S.&nbsp;government passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of 15&nbsp;years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s&nbsp;policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S.&nbsp;government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians, however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Federal Trust Obligation to American Indians, 19 BYU J. PUB. L. 1 (December 2004)</ref>\n\nBy this time, tribes had already started to establish community schools to replace the BIA&nbsp;boarding schools. Led by the [[Navajo Nation]] in&nbsp;1968, tribes started [[tribal colleges and universities]], to build their own models of education on reservations, preserve and revive their cultures, and develop educated workforces. In&nbsp;1994 the U.S.&nbsp;Congress passed legislation recognizing the tribal colleges as [[land-grant colleges]], which provided opportunities for funding. Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]]. By the early 21st&nbsp;century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools.\n\nIn addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish [[Native American studies]] programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians.\n\nIn&nbsp;1981, [[Tim Giago]] founded the ''[[Lakota Times]]'', an independent Native American newspaper, located at the Pine Ridge Reservation but not controlled by tribal government. He later founded the [[Native American Journalists Association]]. Other independent newspapers and media corporations have been developed, so that Native American journalists are contributing perspective on their own affairs and other policies and events.\n\nIn&nbsp;2004 Senator [[Sam Brownback]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Kansas]]) introduced a joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution&nbsp;37) to \"offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States\" for past \"ill-conceived policies\" by the U.S.&nbsp;government regarding Indian Tribes.<ref name=\"HISTORIC RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES INTRODUCED IN U.S. CONGRESS May 6, 2004\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.nativevillage.org/Messages%20from%20the%20People/resolution_of_apology_to_native_.htm\n|title = Senate Joint Resolution 37: Apology to Native Peoples\n|accessdate = 2004-05-06\n|author = Sam Brownback (R)}}</ref> President [[Barack Obama]] signed the historic apology into law in 2009, as Section 8113 of the 2010 defense appropriations bill.<ref>{{cite news |last=McKinnon |first=John D. |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/12/22/us-offers-an-official-apology-to-native-americans/ |title=U.S. Offers An Official Apology to Native Americans |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=December 22, 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref>\n{{Wikisource|Native American Apology Resolution}}\n\nAfter years of investigation and independent work by Native American journalists, in&nbsp;2003 the U.S.&nbsp;government indicted suspects in the December 1975 murder of [[Anna Mae Aquash]] at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. A ''[[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]],'' Aquash was the highest-ranking woman activist in the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) at the time.

Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive [[Clovis point]], a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of [[carbon dating]] methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|BP]] (roughly 9100 to 8850&nbsp; BCE).\n\nNumerous [[Paleoindian]] cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the [[Great Plains]] and [[Great Lakes]] of the modern United States of America and Canada, as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest.

A major culture of the Archaic stage was the [[Mound builders]], who stretched from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi]] and [[Ohio]] rivers. Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of [[Neolithic Revolution]] to sustain such large villages over long periods. Native American cultures are not included in characterizations of advanced stone age cultures as \"[[Neolithic]],\" which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in Eurasia, Africa, and other regions.\n\n[[Image: Watson Brake Aerial Illustration HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Watson Brake Aerial Illustration]]\nThe prime example is [[Watson Brake]] in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE, making it the oldest dated site in the Americas for such complex construction.

At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the [[Southeastern Woodlands]] into the northern shores of [[Lake Ontario]]. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activities was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over North America.\n\n[[File: Coles Creek culture map HRoe 2010.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|A map showing the extent of the Coles Creek cultural period and some important sites.]]\nThe [[Coles Creek culture]] was an indigenous development of the Lower Mississippi Valley that took place between the late [[Woodland period]] and the later [[Plaquemine culture]] period. The period is marked by the increased use of flat-topped [[platform mound]]s arranged around central plazas, more complex political institutions, and a subsistence strategy still grounded in the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] and hunting rather than on the [[maize]] plant as would happen in the succeeding [[Plaquemine Mississippian]] period. The culture was originally defined by the unique decoration on [[Temper (pottery)|grog-tempered]] ceramic ware by [[James A. Ford]] after his investigations at the [[Mazique Archeological Site]]. He had studied both the Mazique and Coles Creek Sites, and almost went with the ''Mazique culture'', but decided on the less historically involved sites name. It is ancestral to the [[Plaquemine culture]].\n\n{{Main|Mississippian culture}}\nThe Mississippian culture which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the Southeast created the largest [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] in North America north of Mexico, most notably at [[Cahokia]], on a tributary of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois.\n\n**The ten-story [[Monks Mound]] at Cahokia has a larger circumference than the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] at [[Teotihuacan]] or the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Egypt]]. The {{convert|6|mi2}} city complex was based on the culture's cosmology; it included more than 100&nbsp;mounds, positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of [[astronomy]], and built with knowledge of varying soil types. The society began building at this site about 950&nbsp;CE, and reached its peak population in 1,250&nbsp;CE of 20,000\u201330,000 people, which was not equalled by any city in the present-day United States until after 1800.\n**Cahokia was a major regional [[chiefdom]], with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n**[[Kincaid Mounds State Historic Site|Kincaid]]<ref>{{cite thesis | author= Buchanan, Meghan E. | publisher= [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] | year= 2007 | page= 40 | title= Patterns of Faunal Utilization at Kincaid Mounds, Massac County, Illinois | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yGVh4vIPX0MC}}</ref> c. 1050\u20131400 CE,<ref name=\"SH\">{{cite journal|title=Kincaid: A Prehistoric Cultural and Religious Center| author=John E.

Some of the horses escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild. The early [[Equus scotti|American horse]] had been game for the earliest humans on the continent. It was hunted to extinction about 7000&nbsp;BCE, just after the end of the [[last glacial period]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Native Americans benefited from the reintroduction of horses, as they adopted the use of the animals, they began to change their cultures in substantial ways, especially by extending their nomadic ranges for hunting.\n\nThe reintroduction of the horse to [[North America]] had a profound impact on [[Plains Indian|Native American culture of the Great Plains]]. The tribes trained and used horses to ride and to carry packs or pull [[travois]]. The people fully incorporated the use of horses into their societies and expanded their territories. They used horses to carry goods for exchange with neighboring tribes, to hunt [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[American Bison|bison]], and to conduct wars and horse raids.\n\n==16th Century==\nThe 16th century saw the first contacts between Native Americans in what was to become the United States and European explorers and settlers. One of the first major contacts, in what would be called the American [[Deep South]], occurred when the conquistador [[Juan Ponce de&nbsp;Le\u00f3n]] landed in [[Florida|La Florida]] in April 1513. De Le\u00f3n returned in 1521 in an attempt at colonisation, but after fierce resistance from the [[Calusa]] people, the attempt was abandoned. He was later followed by other Spanish explorers, such as [[P\u00e1nfilo de&nbsp;Narv\u00e1ez]] in 1528 and [[Hernando de Soto]] in&nbsp;1539.\n\n==17th century==\nThrough the mid 17th century the [[Beaver Wars]] were fought over the fur trade between the [[Iroquois]] and the [[Wyandot people|Hurons]], the northern [[Algonquin people|Algonquians]], and their French allies. During the war the Iroquois destroyed several large tribal confederacies\u2014including the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erielhonan|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]], and [[Shawnee]], and became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory.\n\n===King Philip's War===\n{{Main|King Philip's War}}\n\n[[King Philip's War]], also called [[Metacomet|Metacom]]'s War or Metacom's Rebellion, was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present-day southern [[New England]] and English colonists and their Native American allies from 1675 to 1676. It continued in northern New England (primarily on the Maine frontier) even after King Philip was killed, until a [[Treaty of Casco (1678)|treaty was signed]] at [[Casco Bay]] in April 1678.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} According to a combined estimate of loss of life in Schultz and Tougias' ''King Philip's War, The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict'' (based on sources from the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Census, and the work of Colonial historian Francis Jennings), 800 out of 52,000 English colonists of [[New England]] (1 out of every 65) and 3,000 out of 20,000 natives (3 out of every 20) lost their lives due to the war, which makes it proportionately one of the bloodiest and costliest in the history of America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} More than half of New England's 90 towns were assaulted by Native American warriors.

Those involved in the [[fur trade]] in the northern areas tended to ally with French forces against British colonial militias. Native Americans fought on both sides of the conflict. The greater number of tribes fought with the French in the hopes of checking British expansion. The British had made fewer allies, but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories. They were often disappointed when such treaties were later overturned. The tribes had their own purposes, using their alliances with the European powers to battle traditional Native enemies.\n\n===Native American influence===\n{{Further|Great Law of Peace}}\n[[File:Treaty of Penn with Indians by Benjamin West.jpg|thumb|''[[The Treaty of Penn with the Indians]]'' by [[Benjamin West]] painted in 1771.]]\nNative American culture began to have an influence on European thought in this period.

Most Native Americans who joined the struggle sided with the British, based both on their trading relationships and hopes that colonial defeat would result in a halt to further colonial expansion onto Native American land. Many native communities were divided over which side to support in the war and others wanted to remain neutral. The first native community to [[Treaty of Fort Pitt (1778)|sign a treaty with the new United States Government]] was the [[Lenape]]. For the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy, based in New York, the American Revolution resulted in [[civil war]]. The only Iroquois tribes to ally with the colonials were the Oneida and Tuscarora.\n\n[[Frontier warfare during the American Revolution]] was particularly brutal, and numerous atrocities were committed by settlers and native tribes alike. Noncombatants suffered greatly during the war. Military expeditions on each side destroyed villages and food supplies to reduce the ability of people to fight, as in frequent raids by both sides in the [[Mohawk Valley]] and western New York.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9077648/Wyoming-Massacre Wyoming Massacre], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref> The largest of these expeditions was the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779, in which American colonial troops destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages to neutralize Iroquois raids in [[upstate New York]].

The [[Northwest Indian War]] was led by Native American tribes trying to repulse American settlers. The United States initially treated the Native Americans who had fought as allies with the British as a conquered people who had lost their lands. Although most members of the Iroquois tribes went to Canada with the Loyalists, others tried to stay in New York and western territories to maintain their lands.

Manifest Destiny was a justification for expansion and westward movement, or, in some interpretations, an ideology or doctrine that helped to promote the progress of civilization. Advocates of Manifest Destiny believed that expansion was not only good, but that it was obvious and certain. The term was first used primarily by [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] in the 1840s to promote the annexation of much of what is now the [[Western United States]] (the [[Oregon Territory]], the [[Texas Annexation]], and the [[Mexican Cession]]).\n\n{{quote|What a prodigious growth this English race, especially the American branch of it, is having!

Although Indian Removal from the Southeast had been proposed by some as a humanitarian measure to ensure their survival away from Americans, conflicts of the 19th century led some European-Americans to regard the natives as \"savages\".\n\nThe period of the [[Gold Rush]] was marked by the [[California Genocide]]. Under US sovereignty,  the indigenous population plunged from approximately 150,000 in 1848 to 30,000 in 1870 and reached its nadir of 16,000 in 1900. Thousands of California Native Americans, including women and children, are documented to have been killed by non-Native Americans in this period. The dispossession and murder of California Native Americans was aided by institutions of the state of California, which encouraged indigenous peoples to be killed with impunity.<ref>Madley, Benjamin (2016).

Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the [[Hopewell Treaty|Hopewell Treaty of 1785]]. Under President [[Andrew Jackson]], [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the [[Mississippi River]] for lands west of the river.\n\nAs many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this [[Indian Removal]] policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties.\n\nThe most egregious violation of the stated intention of the removal policy took place under the [[Treaty of New Echota]], which was signed by a dissident faction of [[Cherokee]]s but not the principal chief. The following year, the Cherokee conceded to removal, but Georgia included their land in a lottery for European-American settlement before that. President Jackson used the military to gather and transport the Cherokee to the west, whose timing and lack of adequate supplies led to the deaths of an estimated 4,000 Cherokees on the [[Trail of Tears]]. About 17,000 Cherokees, along with approximately 2,000 enslaved blacks held by Cherokees, were taken by force migration to Indian Territory.<ref>Carter (III), Samuel (1976).

It involved more people than any migration since the [[Indian Removal|removals]] from areas east of the Mississippi River of the early 19th century.\n\nThe men's service with the US military in the international conflict was a turning point in Native American history. The overwhelming majority of Native Americans welcomed the opportunity to serve; they had a voluntary enlistment rate that was 40% higher than those who were drafted. War Department officials said that if the entire population had enlisted in the same proportion as the Native Americans, the response would have rendered the draft unnecessary.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/topics/natam/natam-wwii.html\n|title = Native Americans in World War II\n|accessdate = 2011-05-01\n|author = Thomas D.

White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them \"chief\". Native American cultures were profoundly changed after their young men returned home, because of their wide contact with the world outside of the reservation system. \"The war\", said the U.S.&nbsp;Indian Commissioner in 1945, \"caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era\", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref>\n\nThe most significant of these changes was the opportunity\u2014as a result of wartime labor shortages\u2014to find well-paying work in cities. After the war many Native Americans relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry. In the 1950s the federal government had a relocation policy encouraging them to do so because of economic opportunity in cities. But Native Americans struggled with discrimination and the great cultural changes in leaving their reservations behind.\n\nThere were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200&nbsp;[[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War&nbsp;II; only about half came home alive. In addition many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as [[Code talker]]s for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.\n\n===Self-determination===\n{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}\n\nMilitary service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969\u20131971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300&nbsp;[[Oglala Lakota]] and [[American Indian Movement]]&nbsp;(AIM) activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February 27,&nbsp;1973.<ref name=\"Waldron\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/shot-kills-indian-at-wounded-knee-another-insurgent-is-hurt-during.html |title=Shot Kills Indian At Wounded Knee |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 28, 1973|accessdate=2010-08-22|first=Martin|last=Waldron}}</ref>\n\nIndian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71&nbsp;days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed. In late April a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<ref name=\"Waldron\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range. The AIM activist [[Leonard Peltier]] was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the FBI deaths.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crosson |first=Judith |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/05/appeals_court_denies_peltiers_parole_bid/ |title=Appeals court denies Peltier's parole bid |publisher=Boston.com |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 the government enacted the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968|Indian Civil Rights Act]]. This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 Idaho Law Review 465 (1998).</ref> In 1975 the U.S.&nbsp;government passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of 15&nbsp;years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s&nbsp;policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S.&nbsp;government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians, however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Federal Trust Obligation to American Indians, 19 BYU J. PUB. L. 1 (December 2004)</ref>\n\nBy this time, tribes had already started to establish community schools to replace the BIA&nbsp;boarding schools. Led by the [[Navajo Nation]] in&nbsp;1968, tribes started [[tribal colleges and universities]], to build their own models of education on reservations, preserve and revive their cultures, and develop educated workforces. In&nbsp;1994 the U.S.&nbsp;Congress passed legislation recognizing the tribal colleges as [[land-grant colleges]], which provided opportunities for funding. Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]]. By the early 21st&nbsp;century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools.\n\nIn addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish [[Native American studies]] programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians.\n\nIn&nbsp;1981, [[Tim Giago]] founded the ''[[Lakota Times]]'', an independent Native American newspaper, located at the Pine Ridge Reservation but not controlled by tribal government. He later founded the [[Native American Journalists Association]]. Other independent newspapers and media corporations have been developed, so that Native American journalists are contributing perspective on their own affairs and other policies and events.\n\nIn&nbsp;2004 Senator [[Sam Brownback]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Kansas]]) introduced a joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution&nbsp;37) to \"offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States\" for past \"ill-conceived policies\" by the U.S.&nbsp;government regarding Indian Tribes.<ref name=\"HISTORIC RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES INTRODUCED IN U.S. CONGRESS May 6, 2004\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.nativevillage.org/Messages%20from%20the%20People/resolution_of_apology_to_native_.htm\n|title = Senate Joint Resolution 37: Apology to Native Peoples\n|accessdate = 2004-05-06\n|author = Sam Brownback (R)}}</ref> President [[Barack Obama]] signed the historic apology into law in 2009, as Section 8113 of the 2010 defense appropriations bill.<ref>{{cite news |last=McKinnon |first=John D. |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/12/22/us-offers-an-official-apology-to-native-americans/ |title=U.S. Offers An Official Apology to Native Americans |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=December 22, 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref>\n{{Wikisource|Native American Apology Resolution}}\n\nAfter years of investigation and independent work by Native American journalists, in&nbsp;2003 the U.S.&nbsp;government indicted suspects in the December 1975 murder of [[Anna Mae Aquash]] at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

Advocates of independence moved to have reluctant colonial governments revise instructions to their delegations, or even replace those governments which would not authorize independence. On May 10, 1776, Congress passed a resolution recommending that any colony with a government that was not inclined toward independence should form one that was. On May 15, they adopted a more radical preamble to this resolution, drafted by [[John Adams]], which advised throwing off oaths of allegiance and suppressing the authority of the Crown in any colonial government that still derived its authority from the Crown. That same day, the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] instructed its delegation in Philadelphia to propose a resolution that called for a declaration of independence, the formation of foreign alliances, and a confederation of the states.

It convened on May 10, 1775 with representatives from 12 of the colonies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania shortly after the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]], succeeding the [[First Continental Congress]] which met in Philadelphia from September 5 to October 26, 1774. The Second Congress functioned as a ''de facto'' national government at the outset of the Revolutionary War by raising armies, directing strategy, appointing diplomats, and writing treatises such as the [[Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms]] and the [[Olive Branch Petition]].<ref>Cogliano, ''Revolutionary America, 1763\u20131815'', p. 113</ref> All thirteen colonies were represented by the time that the Congress adopted the [[Lee Resolution]] which declared independence from Britain on July 2, 1776, and the congress agreed to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] two days later. \n\nAfterward, the Congress functioned as the provisional government of the United States of America through March 1, 1781. During this period, its achievements included: successfully managing the war effort; drafting the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first U.S. Constitution; securing diplomatic recognition and support from foreign nations; and resolving state land claims west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].\n\nMany of the delegates who attended the Second Congress had also attended the First.

The Second Continental Congress met on May 10, 1775 to plan further responses if the British government had not repealed or modified the acts; however, the [[American Revolutionary War]] had already started by that time with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], and the Congress was called upon to take charge of the war effort.\n\nFor the first few months of the war, the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] carried on their struggle in an ad-hoc and uncoordinated manner.

Advocates of independence moved to have reluctant colonial governments revise instructions to their delegations, or even replace those governments which would not authorize independence. On May 10, 1776, Congress passed a resolution recommending that any colony with a government that was not inclined toward independence should form one that was. On May 15, they adopted a more radical preamble to this resolution, drafted by [[John Adams]], which advised throwing off oaths of allegiance and suppressing the authority of the Crown in any colonial government that still derived its authority from the Crown. That same day, the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] instructed its delegation in Philadelphia to propose a resolution that called for a declaration of independence, the formation of foreign alliances, and a confederation of the states. The [[resolution of independence]] was delayed for several weeks, as advocates of independence consolidated support in their home governments.\n\nOn June 7, 1776, [[Richard Henry Lee]] offered a resolution before the Congress declaring the colonies independent.
