He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded. Bandi\u0107 played a role in the crisis by becoming a city councilman in 1995 and the leader of the Zagreb SDP in 1997.<ref name=javno_biografija>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.javno.com/hr/hrvatska/clanak.php?id=49365\n |title       = Biografija: Milan Bandi\u0107\n |date        = 2007-06-02\n |accessdate  = 2008-08-01\n |work        = Javno.hr\n |language    = Croatian\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/68EJ2pyfI?url=http://dalje.com/hr-hrvatska/biografija--milan-bandic/49365\n |archivedate = 2012-06-06\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first campaign his [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] background became an issue, as the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) suggested that only a native citizen of Zagreb could become the city's mayor. HSS also launched a propaganda campaign against [[Herzegovinians]] in an effort to undermine Bandi\u0107's campaign. The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107. Those expectations were not fulfilled and Bandi\u0107 later used his Herzegovinian background as an advantage, broadening his support among the ordinary citizens of Zagreb.\n\nThe HDZ under Bandi\u0107 eventually lost power in the Croatian capital in 2000.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\n==={{anchor|First and second term (2000\u20132002)}}First and second terms (2000\u20132002)===\n{{see also|2000 Zagreb local elections|2001 Zagreb local elections}}\n\nBandi\u0107 was elected [[mayor]] of Zagreb in 2000<ref name=izbori>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | title = Izbori odr\u017eani 7. svibnja 2000.\n | work = Gradski zavod za automatsku obradu podataka\n | accessdate = 2008-07-27\n | language = Croatian\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100129103926/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | archive-date = 2010-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> and re-elected in the city election in 2001.<ref name=izbori_2001>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| title = Izbori odr\u017eani 20. svibnja 2001.\n| work = City Bureau for Automatic Data Processing\n| accessdate = 2008-08-04\n| language = Croatian\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316190322/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| archive-date = 2008-03-16\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> His rise in influence among SDP politicians and on the Zagreb political scene created a backlash by the [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), the other left-of-center party led by [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]], who did not trust his nationalist populism and his occasional run-ins with the courts. The HNS campaigned against the SDP in the 2000 elections. However, the HNS entered into a coalition with the SDP in 2001.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

Then the audience is shown footage of the Japanese ambassador negotiating while [[Pearl Harbor]] is being [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombed]], and, in quick succession, the reverses at [[Battle of Wake Island|Wake Island]], [[Manila]], [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan]] and [[Battle of Dutch Harbor|Dutch Harbor]]. The American public realizes that it wasn't as self-sufficient as it had thought. A list of raw materials that were needed is given, along with the areas the United States was importing it from, now under Japanese control (including, incidentally, Philippine [[hemp]], as mentioned in ''[[Hemp for Victory]]'').\n\nThe narrator tells the audience that there were stores of those raw materials in the [[Western Hemisphere]], but someone had to get them, and want to get them. So the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance|Rio conference of 1942]] is organized, and the various republics commit to solidarity to the US and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cause. The film shows the many vital uses these resources are put to, including rubber and [[quinine]].\n\nThen the military aspects of Latin American involvement are discussed. The mobilization of the Latin America armies in anticipation of any Axis threat is discussed, as well as the clearing out of [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]] and submarine watches. But most important, in the eyes of the film, is the base at Naha, Brazil, which was used to quickly transport military supplies from the US or Latin America, over the Atlantic, to Africa, and thence to the British armies in Egypt.\n\nThe [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''Gracias Amigos'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=https://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=gracias+amigos&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref> The film is part of the Academy War Film Collection, one of the largest collections of World War II era short films held outside government archives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Academy War Film Collection|url=http://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/academy-war-film-collection|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Allied propaganda films of World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive short film|id=GraciasA1944|name=Gracias Amigos}}\n\n[[Category:1944 films]]\n[[Category:American World War II propaganda shorts]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n\n\n{{WWII-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Gracias Amigos\n| image = Gracias Amigos (1944).ogv\n| image_size =\n| caption =\n| director =\n| producer = [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]]\n| writer =\n| narrator = [[Lowell Thomas]]\n| starring =\n| music =\n| cinematography =\n| editing =\n| distributor =\n| released = {{Film date|1944}}\n| runtime = 16 minutes\n| country = United States\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n| budget =\n| website =\n}}\n'''''Gracias Amigos''''' was a 1944 [[Propaganda film|propaganda short]] produced by the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] to educate the American public about the contributions of [[Latin America]] during [[World War II]].\n\nThe short begins by describing the \"island\" of the United States, how self-sufficient it thought it was, and how it felt that the rise of the [[Axis powers]] wouldn't affect it.

But most important, in the eyes of the film, is the base at Naha, Brazil, which was used to quickly transport military supplies from the US or Latin America, over the Atlantic, to Africa, and thence to the British armies in Egypt.\n\nThe [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''Gracias Amigos'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=https://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=gracias+amigos&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref> The film is part of the Academy War Film Collection, one of the largest collections of World War II era short films held outside government archives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Academy War Film Collection|url=http://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/academy-war-film-collection|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Allied propaganda films of World War II]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive short film|id=GraciasA1944|name=Gracias Amigos}}\n\n[[Category:1944 films]]\n[[Category:American World War II propaganda shorts]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n\n\n{{WWII-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracias_Amigos"}
