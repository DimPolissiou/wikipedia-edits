There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] the previous day.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|title=An Unearthly Child|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2012|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626184328/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|archive-date=26 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

[[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\">Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Panini Comics 2003</ref> Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]], broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as an [[international co-production]] between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC and [[BBC Worldwide]]. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1&nbsp;million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\" />\n\nLicensed media such as novels and audio plays provided [[Doctor Who spin-offs|new stories]], but as a television programme ''Doctor Who'' remained dormant until 2003.

The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set.

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite|date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=12 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725043928/https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228115219/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030501/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|archive-date=1 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986).

Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop.

In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.\n\nSince 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F.

Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role.

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nThe incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke (composer)|Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].\n\nThe Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.\n\nFrom the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|title=Doctor Who: Bradley Walsh WON'T work with two big stars after they confirm their exits|first=Rory|last=O'Connor|publisher=Express|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232906/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> all incidental music for the series was composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]], and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" onwards.

It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|work=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215163911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|archive-date=15 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.

The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

The rapid development of technology has added [[cyberwarfare|cyber warfare]] to their mission.

In such cases covert assistance allows the US to assist without damaging these elements in the process.\n\n==Overview==\nSAC provides the [[United States National Security Council]] with alternative options when overt military and/or diplomatic actions are not viable or politically feasible. SAC can be directly tasked by the president or the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] at the president's direction, unlike other U.S. special mission forces.

The primary strengths of SAC Paramilitary Officers are operational agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically made up of two to ten operatives (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all usually with extensive military tactical experience and a set of specialized skills that does not exist in any other unit.<ref name='Waller'/> As fully trained intelligence case officers, Paramilitary Operations Officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 and most importantly&nbsp;\u2013 to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out [[direct action (military)|direct action]] (including [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[sabotage]]), [[counter-intelligence]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]/[[unconventional warfare]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage crisis|hostage rescue]] missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via [[Human intelligence (espionage)|HUMINT]] assets.\n\nThere are four principal elements within SAC's Special Operations Group: the '''Air Branch''', the '''Maritime Branch''', the '''Ground Branch''', and the '''Armor and Special Programs Branch'''. The Armor and Special Programs Branch is charged with development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. Congressional directives.\n\nTogether, the SAC/SOG comprises a complete [[combined arms]] covert paramilitary force. Paramilitary Operations Officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG.<ref name=\"so\"/> As such, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to operate in a multitude of environments. Because these officers are taken from the most highly trained units in the U.S. military and then provided with extensive additional training to become CIA clandestine intelligence officers, many U.S. security experts assess them as the most elite of the U.S. special missions units.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLu2K11cXSMC&pg=PA24&dq=special+ops:+america%27s+elite+forces+delta+the+best+period#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat |author= Fred J.

Roosevelt]]. Major General [[William Joseph Donovan]] was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient from [[World War I]]. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of FDR at [[Columbia Law School]].<ref>Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero, Anthony Cave Brown, New York City, Times Books, 1982</ref>  Like its successor, the CIA, OSS included both [[HUMINT|human intelligence functions]] and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence division was responsible for espionage, while its [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] teams, a joint U.S.-UK-French unit, were forerunners of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. OSS' Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. OSS operated primarily in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) and to some extent in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], while [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945, the OSS also played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in China and Burma, and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]]. OSS also helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], espionage, [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]], and post-war planning.\n\nOne of the OSS' greatest accomplishments during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists, socialist party members, [[labor activist]]s, [[anti-Nazi]] [[POW]]s, and German and [[Jewish refugees]]. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |title=Chef Julia Child, others part of World War II spy network\n |accessdate=2008-08-14\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814145107/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |archivedate=August 14, 2008\n |df=mdy\n}}, CNN, August 14, 2008</ref>\n\nOSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands. In Crete, OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside [[Greek resistance]] forces against the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].\n\nOSS was disbanded shortly after [[World War II]], with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions went into the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] set up in 1948. Between the original creation of the CIA by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the [[United States Army Special Forces]], but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] of the CIA. In 1962, the paramilitary operations of CIA centralized in the Special Operations Division (SOD), the predecessor of SAC.

Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]], who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or [[Contras|Contra]]. CIA paramilitary teams from Special Activities Division were deployed to train and lead these rebel forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in Honduras and Costa Rica. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the [[Boland Amendment]] of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department, but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref>{{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Draper |title=A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affair |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8090-9613-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/verythinlineiran00drap }}</ref><ref name='Woodward 1987'>{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Woodward |year=1987 |title=VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981\u20131987 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-60117-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/veilsecretwarsof0000wood |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe Boland Amendment was a compromise because the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300&nbsp;million.

The primary strengths of SAC Paramilitary Officers are operational agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically made up of two to ten operatives (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all usually with extensive military tactical experience and a set of specialized skills that does not exist in any other unit.<ref name='Waller'/> As fully trained intelligence case officers, Paramilitary Operations Officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 and most importantly&nbsp;\u2013 to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out [[direct action (military)|direct action]] (including [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[sabotage]]), [[counter-intelligence]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]/[[unconventional warfare]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage crisis|hostage rescue]] missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via [[Human intelligence (espionage)|HUMINT]] assets.\n\nThere are four principal elements within SAC's Special Operations Group: the '''Air Branch''', the '''Maritime Branch''', the '''Ground Branch''', and the '''Armor and Special Programs Branch'''. The Armor and Special Programs Branch is charged with development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. Congressional directives.\n\nTogether, the SAC/SOG comprises a complete [[combined arms]] covert paramilitary force. Paramilitary Operations Officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG.<ref name=\"so\"/> As such, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to operate in a multitude of environments. Because these officers are taken from the most highly trained units in the U.S. military and then provided with extensive additional training to become CIA clandestine intelligence officers, many U.S. security experts assess them as the most elite of the U.S. special missions units.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLu2K11cXSMC&pg=PA24&dq=special+ops:+america%27s+elite+forces+delta+the+best+period#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat |author= Fred J.

Roosevelt]]. Major General [[William Joseph Donovan]] was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient from [[World War I]]. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of FDR at [[Columbia Law School]].<ref>Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero, Anthony Cave Brown, New York City, Times Books, 1982</ref>  Like its successor, the CIA, OSS included both [[HUMINT|human intelligence functions]] and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence division was responsible for espionage, while its [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] teams, a joint U.S.-UK-French unit, were forerunners of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. OSS' Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. OSS operated primarily in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) and to some extent in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], while [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945, the OSS also played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in China and Burma, and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]]. OSS also helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], espionage, [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]], and post-war planning.\n\nOne of the OSS' greatest accomplishments during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists, socialist party members, [[labor activist]]s, [[anti-Nazi]] [[POW]]s, and German and [[Jewish refugees]]. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |title=Chef Julia Child, others part of World War II spy network\n |accessdate=2008-08-14\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814145107/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |archivedate=August 14, 2008\n |df=mdy\n}}, CNN, August 14, 2008</ref>\n\nOSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands. In Crete, OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside [[Greek resistance]] forces against the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].\n\nOSS was disbanded shortly after [[World War II]], with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions went into the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] set up in 1948. Between the original creation of the CIA by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the [[United States Army Special Forces]], but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] of the CIA. In 1962, the paramilitary operations of CIA centralized in the Special Operations Division (SOD), the predecessor of SAC.

In 1970, for example, communist officials near [[Da Nang]] in northern South Vietnam instructed their agents to \"kill 400 persons\" deemed to be government \"tyrant[s]\" and to \"annihilate\" anyone involved with the \"pacification\" program.

Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]], who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or [[Contras|Contra]]. CIA paramilitary teams from Special Activities Division were deployed to train and lead these rebel forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in Honduras and Costa Rica. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the [[Boland Amendment]] of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department, but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref>{{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Draper |title=A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affair |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8090-9613-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/verythinlineiran00drap }}</ref><ref name='Woodward 1987'>{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Woodward |year=1987 |title=VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981\u20131987 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-60117-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/veilsecretwarsof0000wood |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe Boland Amendment was a compromise because the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300&nbsp;million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990.<ref name='Woodward 1987'/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Riesenfeld |first=Stefan A. |year=1987 |title=The Powers of Congress and the President in International Relations: Revisited |journal=[[California Law Review]] |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=405\u201314 |jstor=3480586 |doi=10.2307/3480586 |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |access-date=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427220228/https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |archive-date=April 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Sandinista]] leader [[Daniel Ortega]] was re-elected as President of [[Nicaragua]] in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.\n\n===El Salvador===\nCIA personnel were also involved in the [[Salvadoran civil war]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uXCpB-D0LLEC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=cia+el+salvador|title=Killer Elite|author=Michael Smith|page=52|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007 | isbn=978-0-312-36272-0}}</ref>  Some allege that the techniques used to interrogate prisoners in El Salvador foreshadowed those later used in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|title=Prisoner Abuse: Patterns from the Past|author1=Thomas Blanton|author2=Peter Kornbluh|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=The National Security Archive|date=December 5, 2004|access-date=March 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124020135/http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|archive-date=November 24, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> In fact, when a similar counter-insurgency program was proposed in Iraq, it was referred to as \"the Salvador Option\".

Doroshevich-Sakhalin. Part I.

Katorga camps were established in the 17th century in underpopulated areas of Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]] \u2013 regions that had few towns or food sources and lacked any organised transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, a few prisoners successfully escaped to populated areas. After the change in Russian penal law in 1847, exile and katorga became the common punishment for participants in nationalistic uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing numbers of [[Poles]] sent to Siberia for katorga. From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system. According to historian [[Anne Applebaum]], approximately 6,000 [[katorga]] convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 in 1916.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /><ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/books/review/11MINERT.html {{-'}}Gulag': The Other Killing Machine]\".

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties. The letter caught the attention of a number of high communist officials including [[Genrikh Yagoda]] and Frenkel soon went from being an inmate to becoming a camp commander and an important Gulag official.

Hence it is followed by one more important reason for the constancy of the repressive policy, namely, the state's interest in unremitting rates of receiving a cheap labour force that was forcibly used, mainly in the extreme conditions of the east and north.<ref name=\"\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\" /> The Gulag possessed both punitive and economic functions.<ref name=\"Ellman\">{{cite journal|last=Ellman|first=Michael|title=Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|year=2002|volume=54|issue=2|pages=1151\u20131172|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/ELM-Repression_Statistics.pdf|accessdate=August 14, 2011|doi=10.1080/0966813022000017177}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation and expansion under Stalin ===\n\nThe Gulag was officially established on April 25, 1930 as the ULAG by the OGPU order 130/63 in accordance with the Sovnarkom order 22 p.&nbsp;248 dated April 7, 1930.

The growth of the camp system coincided with the peak of the Soviet [[industrialisation]] campaign. Most of the camps established to accommodate the masses of incoming prisoners were assigned distinct economic tasks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These included the exploitation of natural resources and the colonisation of remote areas, as well as the realisation of enormous infrastructural facilities and industrial construction projects. The plan to achieve these goals with \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" instead of labor camps was dropped after the revealing of the [[Nazino affair]] in 1933; subsequently the Gulag system was expanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe 1931\u201332 archives indicate the Gulag had approximately 200,000 prisoners in the camps; while in 1935, approximately 800,000 were in camps and 300,000 in colonies (annual averages).<ref name=Kozlov />\n\n[[File:Korolev posle aresta 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Rocket engineer [[Sergei Korolev]] shortly after his arrest in 1938]]\nIn the early 1930s, a tightening of Soviet penal policy caused significant growth of the prison camp population.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HYSGZs6mW5wC|title=Gulag: A History of the Soviet Camps|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2012-08-02|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141975269|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Camps Expand}}</ref> During the [[Great Purge]] of 1937\u201338, mass arrests caused another increase in inmate numbers.

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labour provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb| The [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labour.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127121250/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanisation of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official work time regulations were extended by local camp administrators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[Andrei Vyshinsky]], procurator of the Soviet Union, wrote a memorandum to [[NKVD]] chief [[Nikolai Yezhov]] in 1938 which stated:\n\n<blockquote>Among the prisoners there are some so ragged and lice-ridden that they pose a sanitary danger to the rest.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.\n\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]].

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die.

It is well known that practically every one of them had several branches, many of which were quite large. In addition to the large numbers of camps, there were no less than 2,000 colonies. It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union. Most camp administrations oversaw several single camp units, some as many as dozens or even hundreds.<ref name=\"Anne Applebaum \u2014 Inside the Gulag\">[http://www.anneapplebaum.com/communism/2000/06_15_nyrb_gulag.html Anne Applebaum \u2014 Inside the Gulag]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015012139/http://www.anneapplebaum.com/communism/2000/06_15_nyrb_gulag.html |date=October 15, 2008 }}</ref> The infamous complexes were those at [[Kolyma]], [[Norilsk]], and [[Vorkuta]], all in arctic or subarctic regions.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds. Thereby, the system attempted to eliminate any capacity for resistance or self-directed action in the greater population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Archival documents ===\nStatistical reports made by the [[OGPU]]-[[NKVD]]-[[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]]-[[MVD]] between the 1930s and 1950s are kept in the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] formerly called Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR).

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.\n* [[Frantsishak Alyakhnovich]] \u2013 Solovki prisoner\n* [[Blagoy Popov]], a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the [[Leipzig trial]], along with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Tanev]], was arrested in 1937 during the [[Stalinist purges]] and spent seventeen years in [[Norillag]]. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438|last=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432|first=\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\"|year=2012|isbn=978-619-152-025-1|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|pages=37, 57}}</ref> He wrote his autobiographical account in the book ''From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps'' (''\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438'', \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2012 {{ISBN|978-619-152-025-1}}).\n* [[Mkrtich Armen]], an Armenian writer who was imprisoned in 1937 and rehabilitated in 1945, published a collection of his memories under the title \"They Ordered to Give You\" in 1964.\n* [[Gurgen Mahari]], an Armenian writer and poet, who was arrested in 1936, released in 1947, arrested again in 1948 and sent into Siberian exile as an \"unreliable type\" until 1954, wrote \"Barbed Wires in Blossom\", a novella based largely on his personal experiences in a Soviet gulag.\n\n=== Colonisation ===\n[[File:Vorkuta r.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Vorkuta]]]]\nSoviet [[wikisource:\u041e\u0431 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445|state documents]] show that the goals of the gulag included colonisation of sparsely populated remote areas.

In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for \"free settlement\" and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.\n\nThe gulag inherited this approach from the [[katorga]] system.\n\nIt is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.<ref>Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) {{ISBN|978-0-230-60646-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Life after term served ===\nPersons who served a term in a camp or in a prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs.

Katorga camps were established in the 17th century in underpopulated areas of Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]] \u2013 regions that had few towns or food sources and lacked any organised transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, a few prisoners successfully escaped to populated areas. After the change in Russian penal law in 1847, exile and katorga became the common punishment for participants in nationalistic uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing numbers of [[Poles]] sent to Siberia for katorga. From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system.

In 1927 the official in charge of prison administration wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The exploitation of prison labour, the system of squeezing \"golden sweat\" from them, the organisation of production in places of confinement, which while profitable from a commercial point of view is fundamentally lacking in corrective significance \u2013 these are entirely inadmissible in Soviet places of confinement.<ref>D.J.

In 1923 he was arrested for illegally crossing borders and smuggling. He was sentenced to 10 years' hard labor at [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], which later came to be known as the \"first camp of the Gulag\". While serving his sentence he wrote a letter to the camp administration detailing a number of \"productivity improvement\" proposals including the infamous system of labor exploitation whereas the inmates' food rations were to be linked to their rate of production, a proposal known as nourishment scale (\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f). This notorious you-eat-as-you-work system would often kill weaker prisoners in weeks and caused countless casualties. The letter caught the attention of a number of high communist officials including [[Genrikh Yagoda]] and Frenkel soon went from being an inmate to becoming a camp commander and an important Gulag official.

Hence it is followed by one more important reason for the constancy of the repressive policy, namely, the state's interest in unremitting rates of receiving a cheap labour force that was forcibly used, mainly in the extreme conditions of the east and north.<ref name=\"\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\" /> The Gulag possessed both punitive and economic functions.<ref name=\"Ellman\">{{cite journal|last=Ellman|first=Michael|title=Soviet Repression Statistics: Some Comments|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|year=2002|volume=54|issue=2|pages=1151\u20131172|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/ELM-Repression_Statistics.pdf|accessdate=August 14, 2011|doi=10.1080/0966813022000017177}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation and expansion under Stalin ===\n\nThe Gulag was officially established on April 25, 1930 as the ULAG by the OGPU order 130/63 in accordance with the Sovnarkom order 22 p.&nbsp;248 dated April 7, 1930.

The growth of the camp system coincided with the peak of the Soviet [[industrialisation]] campaign. Most of the camps established to accommodate the masses of incoming prisoners were assigned distinct economic tasks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These included the exploitation of natural resources and the colonisation of remote areas, as well as the realisation of enormous infrastructural facilities and industrial construction projects. The plan to achieve these goals with \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" instead of labor camps was dropped after the revealing of the [[Nazino affair]] in 1933; subsequently the Gulag system was expanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe 1931\u201332 archives indicate the Gulag had approximately 200,000 prisoners in the camps; while in 1935, approximately 800,000 were in camps and 300,000 in colonies (annual averages).<ref name=Kozlov />\n\n[[File:Korolev posle aresta 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Rocket engineer [[Sergei Korolev]] shortly after his arrest in 1938]]\nIn the early 1930s, a tightening of Soviet penal policy caused significant growth of the prison camp population.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HYSGZs6mW5wC|title=Gulag: A History of the Soviet Camps|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2012-08-02|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141975269|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Camps Expand}}</ref> During the [[Great Purge]] of 1937\u201338, mass arrests caused another increase in inmate numbers.

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonise the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivisation and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|Collectivisation]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakisation process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labour work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realised the problem, and began to reform the dekulakisation process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakisation process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labour force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labour provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, aircraft, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labour camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labour was less efficient than free labour. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free labourers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labour scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labour, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labour-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many labourers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labour resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all labourers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labour, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of labourers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb| The [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meagre food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labour.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127121250/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanisation of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onward), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfilment and overfulfilment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onward), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardised \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfil high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\n=== Gulag and famine (1932\u20131933) ===\nA severe [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1931\u20131933]] swept across many different regions in the Soviet Union. During this time, it is estimated that around six to seven million people starved to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> On 7 August 1932, a new edict drafted by Stalin specified a minimum sentence of ten years or execution for theft from collective farms or of cooperative property. Over the next few months, prosecutions rose fourfold. A large share of cases prosecuted under the law were for the theft of small quantities of grain worth less than fifty rubles. The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Soviet Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed \"not to spare bullets\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=61}}</ref> The bodies of inmates who tried to escape were commonly displayed in the courtyards of the camps, and the administrators would forcibly escort the inmates around the dead bodies as a message. Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilise the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labour with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96605-8|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labour, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialisation of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.\n\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]].

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimised]] by escaped thieves. Tantalised by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die. Sometimes it took several waves of colonists before any one group survived to establish the camp.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe area along the [[Indigirka river]] was known as ''the Gulag inside the Gulag''.

It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.<ref name=\"Ivanova 2000\" /></blockquote>\n\nSince many of these existed only for short periods, the number of camp administrations at any given point was lower. It peaked in the early 1950s, when there were more than 100 camp administrations across the Soviet Union.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favoured by historian Robert Conquest, amongst others). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalised the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labour\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labour camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labour camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organised for labour purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticises other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labour. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labour and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematised, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximising cruelty and by organising the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds.

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330205748/http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917-1990).pdf |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9000-6|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted. Thus, Sergei Maksudov alleged that although literary sources, for example the books of [[Lev Razgon]] or [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], did not envisage the total number of the camps very well and markedly exaggerated their size, on the other hand, Viktor Zemskov, who published many documents by the NKVD and [[KGB]], was far from understanding of the Gulag essence and the nature of socio-political processes in the country. He added that without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutises the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth. As a result, Maksudov charges that Zemskov attempts to make generalized statements with reference to a particular document, as a rule, do not hold water.<ref name=\"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\">{{cite journal|last=\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432|first=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439|title=\u041e \u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0432 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435 \"\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0441\"|journal=\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|year=1995|issue=\u2116 9|pages=114\u2013118|url=http://scepsis.ru/library/id_956.html|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Frenkel2.jpg|thumb|[[OGPU]] chiefs responsible for construction of the [[White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal]]: right: [[Naftaly Frenkel|Frenkel]]; center: [[Matvei Berman|Berman]]; left: Afanasev (Head of the southern part of BelBaltLag)]]\n\nIn response, Zemskov wrote that the charge that Zemskov allegedly did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers is that they do not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with \"old\" one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatise the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.<ref name=\"\u041a \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0443\" />\n\nAccording to French historian [[Nicolas Werth]], the mountains of the materials of the Gulag archives, which are stored in funds of the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] and are being constantly exposed during the last fifteen years, represent only a very small part of bureaucratic prose of immense size left over the decades of \"creativity\" by the \"dull and reptile\" organisation managing the Gulag.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual number of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n[[File:1929-ShalamovV.jpg|thumb|[[Varlam Shalamov]] after first arrest, 1929]]\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''[[I Chose Freedom (book)|I Chose Freedom]]'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labour camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labour camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labour camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/ | title=One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich}}</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with three years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.\n* [[Frantsishak Alyakhnovich]] \u2013 Solovki prisoner\n* [[Blagoy Popov]], a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the [[Leipzig trial]], along with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Tanev]], was arrested in 1937 during the [[Stalinist purges]] and spent seventeen years in [[Norillag]]. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438|last=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432|first=\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\"|year=2012|isbn=978-619-152-025-1|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|pages=37, 57}}</ref> He wrote his autobiographical account in the book ''From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps'' (''\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438'', \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2012 {{ISBN|978-619-152-025-1}}).\n* [[Mkrtich Armen]], an Armenian writer who was imprisoned in 1937 and rehabilitated in 1945, published a collection of his memories under the title \"They Ordered to Give You\" in 1964.\n* [[Gurgen Mahari]], an Armenian writer and poet, who was arrested in 1936, released in 1947, arrested again in 1948 and sent into Siberian exile as an \"unreliable type\" until 1954, wrote \"Barbed Wires in Blossom\", a novella based largely on his personal experiences in a Soviet gulag.\n\n=== Colonisation ===\n[[File:Vorkuta r.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Vorkuta]]]]\nSoviet [[wikisource:\u041e\u0431 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445|state documents]] show that the goals of the gulag included colonisation of sparsely populated remote areas.

In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for \"free settlement\" and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.\n\nThe gulag inherited this approach from the [[katorga]] system.\n\nIt is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.<ref>Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) {{ISBN|978-0-230-60646-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Life after term served ===\nPersons who served a term in a camp or in a prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs.
