He was ranked as the #2 recruit in the nation behind only Kobe Bryant whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two dominated together in the 1996 HS All-Star Magic Johnson Roundball Classic game.\n\n==NCAA Career==\nThomas made his mark in his one season in college at Villanova University. Joining a future NBA talent-laden team with Alvin Williams, Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year Kerry Kittles from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a BIG EAST Regular Season Championship under coach Steve Lappas.  Villanova would place 2nd in the Big East tournament but Thomas would be named to both ALL-BIG EAST and ALL-BIG EAST Tournament teams as well as win BIG EAST ROOKIE OF THE YEAR while sporting a 17PPG and 6Reb avg.  Villanova would make the NCAA Tourney but lose in round 2.\n\n==NBA career==\nFollowing his freshman year at [[Villanova Wildcats basketball|Villanova University]], he was drafted seventh overall by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]] and was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the Sixers' draft pick ([[Keith Van Horn]]).\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11.0 points per game, and was named to the NBA's All-Rookie 2nd Team. The Sixers would grow impatient with a [[sophomore slump]] from Thomas, though, and in 1999 he and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] were traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Jerald Honeycutt]] and [[Tyrone Hill]].\n\n===Milwaukee Bucks===\nMilwaukee was enamored with Thomas's raw talent and versatility, and hoped he could blossom into a star with more seasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2002/10/28/8118866/6-milwaukee-bucks-with-glenn-robinson-gone-tim-thomas-has-a-chance-to-prove-that-hes-worth-his-big-contractand-that-he-can-fetch-more-wins-than-big-dog|title=6 Milwaukee Bucks With Glenn Robinson gone, Tim Thomas has a chance to prove that he's worth his big contract--and that he can fetch more wins than Big Dog|last=Burns|first=Marty|website=Vault|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> It looked like things were coming together for Thomas during the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]], when he averaged a career-high 13.4 ppg for the Bucks.

school and college career==\nA versatile 6'10\" forward with a soft shooting touch, Thomas was tabbed as a future NBA star when he was still in high school, and was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American]] team after averaging 25.3 points and 14.5 rebounds per game as a senior at [[Paterson Catholic High School]]. Following his freshman year at [[Villanova Wildcats basketball|Villanova University]], he was drafted seventh overall by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]] and was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the Sixers' draft pick ([[Keith Van Horn]]).\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11.0 points per game, and was named to the NBA's All-Rookie 2nd Team.
