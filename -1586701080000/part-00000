[[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby [[Union of the Crowns|uniting the crowns]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in a [[personal union]], although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]]. Hence Wales as a home country has no representation on the flag.

One theory goes that for some years it would have been called just the \"Jack\", or \"Jack flag\", or the \"King's Jack\", but by 1674, while formally referred to as \"His Majesty's Jack\", it was commonly called the \"Union Jack\", and this was officially acknowledged.<ref name=\"flaginst\" />\n\nAmongst the proclamations issued by King George III at the time of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union]] of 1801 was a proclamation concerning flags at sea, which repeatedly referred to \"Ensigns, Flags, Jacks, and Pendants\" and forbade merchant vessels from wearing \"Our Jack, commonly called the Union Jack\" nor any pendants or colours used by the King's ships.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\">{{London Gazette|issue=15325|date=3 January 1801|pages=25\u201327}}</ref>  Reinforcing the distinction the King's proclamation of the same day concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom (not colours at sea) called the new flag \"the Union Flag\".<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15325|date=3 January 1801|pages=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nThe size and power of the [[Royal Navy]] internationally at the time could also explain why the flag was named the \"Union Jack\"; considering the navy was so widely utilised and renowned by the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|colonies]], it is possible that the term ''jack'' occurred because of its regular use on all British ships using the jackstaff (a flag pole attached to the bow of a ship). The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.<ref name=Flagsofworld>{{FOTW|id=gb|title=United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack.

Its original [[blazon]], as decreed by [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on 1 January 1801, reads: \n<blockquote>\"the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter changed argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second  [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The European Magazine: And London Review|volume=39|publisher=Philological Society of London|year=1801|page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qV83AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA74}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Specification===\n[[File:United Kingdom Flag Specifications.svg|350px|right|Diagram of the Union Flag's design]]\nThe Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but 1:2 is for most purposes. In 2008, MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/unionflag.html |accessdate=2014-04-09 |title=Union Flag Bill 2007\u201308 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\n* The red [[St George's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|5}} of the flag's height with a {{frac|1|15}} flag height [[fimbriation]]\n* The white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] width is {{frac|6|30}} of the flag's height, visible on either side of the St Patrick's Cross in diagonals of  {{frac|3|30}} and {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height, respectively.\n* The red diagonal [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height. It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

It was then adopted by land forces as well, although the blue field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.\n\nVarious shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \"[[navy blue|navy]]\" blue ([[Pantone]] 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the [[Blue Ensign]] of the [[Royal Navy]]'s historic \"Blue Squadron\". (Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver). The [[blazon]] for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is ''azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.''\n\n[[Wales]] had no explicit recognition in the Union Jack as it had been a part of the Kingdom of England since being annexed by [[Edward I of England]] in 1282 and its full integration by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]], and was therefore represented by the flag of England.<ref name=\"KnowBritain\"/>\n[[File:Flag of the Commonwealth (1658-1660).svg|thumb|alt=Red cross with a white border over a white saltire and dark blue background.

The new design added a red [[saltire]], the [[Saint Patrick's Flag|cross of Saint Patrick]], for Ireland. This is [[counterchanging|counterchanged]] with the saltire of St Andrew, such that the white always follows the red clockwise. The arrangement has introduced a requirement to display the flag \"the right way up\"; see [[#Specifications for flag use|specifications for flag use]], below. As with the red cross, so too the red saltire is separated by a white fimbriation from the blue field.<ref name=Flagsofworld /> This fimbriation is repeated for symmetry on the white portion of the saltire, which thereby appears wider than the red portion. The fimbriation of the cross of St George separates its red from the red of the saltire.\n\nApart from the Union Jack, Saint Patrick's cross has seldom been used to represent Ireland, and with little popular recognition or enthusiasm; it is usually considered to derive from the arms of the powerful [[FitzGerald]] family rather than any association with the saint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hayes-McCoy |first=Gerard Anthony |authorlink=Gerard Anthony Hayes-McCoy |title=A history of Irish flags from earliest times |editor-first=P\u00e1draig |editor-last=\u00d3 Snodaigh |editor-link=P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Snodaigh |publisher=Academy Press |location=Dublin |year=1979 |isbn=0-906187-01-X |page=38}}\n</ref>\n\n====Flag speculation after Irish independence====\nWhen the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was concluded on 6 December 1921 and the creation of the new [[Irish Free State]] was an imminent prospect, the question arose as to whether the cross of Saint Patrick should remain in the Union Jack. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that on 22 January 1922:\n\n{{quote|text=At the College of Arms it was stated that certain modifications were under consideration and that if any action were taken it would be done by the King in Council. No parliamentary action would be necessary. Heraldry experts say that alterations in arms are very expensive. Some years ago there was a demand from Irish quarters that the blue ground of the golden harp on the royal standard should be changed to green. It was then estimated that the alteration would cost at least \u00a32,000,000. To remove all reference to Ireland from the present Union Jack and Royal Arms would be vastly more expensive.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/14/109830879.pdf |title=May Alter The Union Jack |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 1922 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n\nThere was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:\n{{quote|text=...the removal of the cross of St. Patrick Cross after 120 years will transform the appearance of the flag. It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great. Probably it will be found that the deletion is not absolutely necessary. Other possible changes include the abolition of the title of the United Kingdom, and the removal of the harp from the Royal Standard and the Coat of Arms, and the substitution of the Ulster emblem.<ref name=\"ashburton\">{{cite news |title=Signs of Heraldry |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=AG19211213.2.31.5&srpos=2&e=-------10--1----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all |newspaper=[[Ashburton Guardian]] |volume=XLII |issue=9409 |date=13 December 1921 |page=5 |publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]] |accessdate=2012-01-09}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the fact that it was likely that [[Northern Ireland]] would choose not to remain part of the Irish Free State after its foundation and remain in the United Kingdom, gave better grounds for keeping the cross of St. Patrick in the Union Jack.

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton.

It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag.

On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]].

The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.<ref name=Flagsofworld>{{FOTW|id=gb|title=United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack.

In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but 1:2 is for most purposes. In 2008, MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/unionflag.html |accessdate=2014-04-09 |title=Union Flag Bill 2007\u201308 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\n* The red [[St George's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|5}} of the flag's height with a {{frac|1|15}} flag height [[fimbriation]]\n* The white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] width is {{frac|6|30}} of the flag's height, visible on either side of the St Patrick's Cross in diagonals of  {{frac|3|30}} and {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height, respectively.\n* The red diagonal [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height. It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

(Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver).

It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great.

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.  The Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 provided that the flags of the Union were (a) the Union Jack, to denote the association with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and (b) the new [[Flag of South Africa (1928-1994)|National Flag]].  The Union Jack was to be flown alongside the National Flag at the [[Parliament of South Africa|Houses of Parliament]], from the principal government buildings in the capitals, at Union ports, on government offices abroad, and at such other places as the government might determine.<ref name=unfa>Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 (renamed 'Flags Act 1927' in 1949).</ref><ref name=sava>Radburn, A.

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as [[Indian Military Flags|India]] and [[List of Jamaican flags#Ensigns|Jamaica]]) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Naval Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[White Ensign|Royal Navy White Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] [[Red Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|[[Royal Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[British Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Government Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Blue Ensign]]\n|Flag of Her Majesty's Coastguard.png|[[HM Coastguard]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the British Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses.svg|Ensign of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]\n|Civil Ensign of the Isle of Man.svg|[[Isle of Man]] Red Ensign\n|Government Ensign of Gibraltar.svg|Gibraltar State Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of the Cayman Islands.svg|[[Cayman Islands]] Red Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Royal Australian Navy]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the Royal Australian Air Force.svg|[[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Red Ensign|Australian Civil Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[New Zealand Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Navy]] Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of New Zealand.svg|New Zealand Civil Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Fiji.svg|[[Fiji|Fijian]] Naval Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Ensign\n|Civil Air Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Air Ensign\n}}\n\n===Pilot or Civil Jack===\n[[File:Civil Jack of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|alt=Union Flag with thick white border comprising about half of the area of the flag.|The Union Jack with a white border]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2011|reason=needs more refs}}\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the '''Pilot Jack'''. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival [[North West Company]] had a similar flag as well. The HBC jack is no longer in use and replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company's coat of arms.\n\nThe Union Jack is the third [[quartering (heraldry)|quarter]] of the 1939 [[coat of arms of Alabama]], which is also used on the flag of the Governor of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\n\nIn the former International Settlement of [[Kulangsu]] the Kulangsu Municipal Police had a badge contained multiple flags, including the Union Flag.

In March 1899 the young Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called ''The Anglo-Saxon Review''. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, 'Your title \"The Anglo Saxon\" with its motto \"Blood is thicker than water\" only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.'<ref>{{cite letter |url=http://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/page?contextId=CHAR%2028%2F26%2F11-12#image=0 |last=Churchill |first=Winston |recipient=Jeanette, Lady Randolph Churchill |date=2 March 1899}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of [[fashion]] since the [[British Invasion]] movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American [[Stars and Stripes flag]], and came back into fashion in the mid-1990s '[[Cool Britannia]] era, notably [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Geri Halliwell]]'s iconic [[Union Jack dress]] of the [[1997 Brit Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a40047/story-of-geri-halliwell-union-jack-brits-dress/|title=It has been 20 years since Geri Halliwell wore the Union Jack dress|author=Amy de Klerk|date=22 February 2017|work=Harper's Bazaar}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201202027142/geri-halliwell-launches-new-union-jack-range/ |title=Geri revisits Spice Girls' heyday in Union Jack dress |work=Hello Magazine |accessdate=3 February 2015 |date=2 February 2012 }}</ref> A notable increase in popularity was seen in [[Cuba]] following the [[2012 London Olympics]], with clothing, nail decoration, tattoos, and hairstyles in youths being observed featuring the pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21082793 |title=Close Up: Cuba's new love for the Union flag |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\nCommonly the Union Flag is used on computer software and Internet pages as an [[Computer icon|icon]] representing a choice of the [[English language]] where a choice among multiple languages may be presented to the user, though the American flag is also commonly used for this purpose.

The railway tunnel is {{convert|1.83|mi|km}} in length, straight, and descends on a 1 in 100 gradient from its eastern end. The west portal is [[Grade II* listed]]<ref>{{NHLE |num=1271441 |desc=West Portal of Box Tunnel |access-date=11 April 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}</ref> and the east portal is [[Grade II listed]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1271441 |desc=Box Tunnel East Portal (MLN19912) |access-date=11 April 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}</ref>\n\nBox Tunnel was constructed between December 1838 and June 1841 for the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) under the direction of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. Building such a tunnel was considered dangerous at the time because of its length and the composition of the underlying strata. The main contractor was George Burge of Herne Bay. For many years, it was rumoured that Brunel had aligned the tunnel so that the rising sun would be visible through it on his birthday, April 9. On 30 June 1841, it was opened with little ceremony. When completed, it was the world's longest railway tunnel.\n\nIn the build-up to [[World War II]], a military Central Ammunition Depot (CAD) facility was established alongside, reusing existing mine workings. The GWR established freight facilities including two sidings just outside the eastern entrance to the tunnel to facilitate the movement of ammunition to and from the CAD. The facility was closed after the war. During the 2010s, the tunnel was modified to accommodate [[Catenary (railways)|overhead catenaries]] as part of the GWML electrification scheme.<ref name=dftelec>{{cite book |last=Department for Transport |title=Britain's transport infrastructure: Rail electrification |year=2009 |publisher=DfT Publications |location=London |isbn=978-1-84864-018-4 |page=30 |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/rail-electrification.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170123080842/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/rail-electrification.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> In summer 2015, the tunnel was closed for preparatory work including lowering the track.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news |title=Box tunnel reopens after Network Rail electrification work |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34112951 |work=BBC News |accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nDuring the 1830s, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] developed a plan for a railway running east-west between London and Bristol.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> The [[Great Western Main Line]], would maintain either level ground or gentle gradients of no greater than 1 in 1000 along most of its route. Between [[Swindon]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], at the highest point of the line a  tunnel was proposed through [[Box Hill, Wiltshire|Box Hill]], outside [[Corsham]].<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nThe tunnel would have a steep gradient of 1 in 100. At the time, the use of such a gradient inside the tunnel allegedly provoked criticism by some of Brunel's contemporaries.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> Box Tunnel would be the longest railway tunnel at almost {{convert|1+3/4|mi}} in length.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\n===Geology===\nWhile  a tunnel had been included in the [[1835 Great Western Railway Act]], contemporary engineers considered the construction of Box Tunnel to be an impossibility at worst and a dangerous undertaking at best. The challenge posed was not only its length but the difficult underlying strata it would have to pass through. The rocks through which it passes comprise [[Great Oolite]] overlying [[fuller's earth]], and [[Inferior Oolite]] and [[Bridport Sand]] beneath, a combination with which tunnellers were familiar.\n\nThe Great Oolite limestone, known as ''[[Bath Stone]]'', is easily worked and had been used for construction since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was extracted by the [[room and pillar]] method and used for many buildings in [[Bath, Somerset]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Combe Down Stone Mines Land Stabilisation Project |work=BANES |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilinformation/areainformation/combedownstonemines/default.htm |accessdate=13 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117002821/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilinformation/areainformation/combedownstonemines/default.htm |archivedate=17 January 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\nTo assess the geology more accurately, between 1836 and 1837, Brunel sank eight shafts at intervals along the tunnel's projected alignment.<ref name=NetRailBox>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/VirtualArchive/box-tunnel/ |title=Box Tunnel |publisher=[[Network Rail]] |accessdate=2 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719071845/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/VirtualArchive/box-tunnel/ |archive-date=19 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe GWR selected George Burge of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] as the major contractor,<ref name=NetRailBox/> being responsible for undertaking 75 per cent of overall tunnel length, working from the western end.

One of Brunel's personal assistants, William Glennie, was in overall charge until completion.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n[[Image:Network Rail Virtual Archive Box Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Engineering drawing of the longitudinal cross-section of Box Tunnel]]\nDuring December 1838,  construction commenced. Work was divided into six sections; access to each was via a {{convert|25|foot}} diameter ventilation shaft, which ranged in depth from {{convert|70|ft}} at the eastern end to {{convert|300|ft}} towards the western end.<ref name=NetRailBox/> The men, equipment, materials and {{convert|247000|cuyd}} of extract had to go in and come out of the shafts assisted by [[steam engine|steam-powered]] winches. The shafts were the safety exits from the tunnel.<ref name=NetRailBox/>\n\nCandles provided the only lighting in the workings and were consumed at a rate of one tonne per week, which was equalled by the weekly consumption of explosives.<ref name=NetRailBox/> Due to the considerable time required for men to enter and exit the workings, [[Rock blasting|blasting]]  took place while they were in the tunnel. This practice and water ingress exceeding the calculated volumes, has been attributed as causing most of the deaths that occurred. About 100 [[navvy|navvies]] were killed during the tunnel's construction. Additional pumping and drainage were required during and after its construction. Large amounts of water entering the tunnel in the winter months impeded progress.<ref name=NetRailBox/><ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nOnce the eastern section had been blasted out, it was cut to form a gothic arch and left unlined.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> The western section was excavated using picks and shovels and the walls were lined with brick. Over 30 million bricks were used which were manufactured in nearby [[Chippenham]]{{clarification|Chippenham?|date=September 2019}} and transported in horse-drawn carts. Horses were used to remove much of the spoil.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nThe restrictions imposed by the site contributed to a delay in the tunnel's completion. By August 1839, only 40 per cent of the works had been finished.<ref name=NetRailBox/> By summer 1840, the {{stnlnk|London Paddington}} to {{stnlnk|Faringdon Road}} section of the [[Great Western Main Line]] (GWML) had been completed, as was the track from [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath]] to {{stnlnk|Bristol Temple Meads}}. The Box Tunnel was the last section of the GWML to be finished, although not for lack of effort on the part of Brunel.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nDuring January 1841, Brunel came to an agreement with Burge and Yockney, to increase their workforce from {{formatnum:1200}} to {{formatnum:4,000}} and the tunnel was completed in April 1841.<ref name=NetRailBox/> The completed tunnel was {{convert|30|ft|||abbr=}} wide and capable of accommodating a pair of [[broad-gauge]] tracks. When the ends of the tunnel were joined, there was less than {{convert|2|in|mm|-1}} of error in their alignment.<ref name=NetRailBox/> Brunel was so delighted that he reportedly removed a ring from his finger and gave it to the works foreman.<ref name = \"eng time\">[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=38 \u201cBox Tunnel.\u201d] \u2018\u2019engineering-timelines.com\u2019\u2019, Retrieved: 13 June 2018.</ref>\n\n===Opening===\nOn 30 June 1841, the tunnel was opened to traffic with little in the way of ceremony.  A special train departed London Paddington and traversed the whole of the GWR to complete the first rail journey to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Temple Meads Station]] in Bristol in about four hours.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nAfter the opening, for several months, work continued to finish the tunnel's western portal near [[Box, Wiltshire]] which Brunel had designed in a grand [[classical architecture|classical style]]<nowiki/>. The eastern portal at [[Corsham]] has a more modest brick face, with [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] stone dressings.<ref name=NetRailBox/>\n\nCommentators and critics voiced concerns and disapproval about the unlined section of the tunnel; they believed that it lacked solidity and was a danger to traffic.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> The GWR responded to these complaints by building a brick arch underneath part of the unlined section close to the entrance which was prone to frost damage.

The railway tunnel is {{convert|1.83|mi|km}} in length, straight, and descends on a 1 in 100 gradient from its eastern end. The west portal is [[Grade II* listed]]<ref>{{NHLE |num=1271441 |desc=West Portal of Box Tunnel |access-date=11 April 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}</ref> and the east portal is [[Grade II listed]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1271441 |desc=Box Tunnel East Portal (MLN19912) |access-date=11 April 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}</ref>\n\nBox Tunnel was constructed between December 1838 and June 1841 for the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) under the direction of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. Building such a tunnel was considered dangerous at the time because of its length and the composition of the underlying strata. The main contractor was George Burge of Herne Bay. For many years, it was rumoured that Brunel had aligned the tunnel so that the rising sun would be visible through it on his birthday, April 9. On 30 June 1841, it was opened with little ceremony. When completed, it was the world's longest railway tunnel.\n\nIn the build-up to [[World War II]], a military Central Ammunition Depot (CAD) facility was established alongside, reusing existing mine workings. The GWR established freight facilities including two sidings just outside the eastern entrance to the tunnel to facilitate the movement of ammunition to and from the CAD. The facility was closed after the war. During the 2010s, the tunnel was modified to accommodate [[Catenary (railways)|overhead catenaries]] as part of the GWML electrification scheme.<ref name=dftelec>{{cite book |last=Department for Transport |title=Britain's transport infrastructure: Rail electrification |year=2009 |publisher=DfT Publications |location=London |isbn=978-1-84864-018-4 |page=30 |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/rail-electrification.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170123080842/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/rail-electrification.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> In summer 2015, the tunnel was closed for preparatory work including lowering the track.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news |title=Box tunnel reopens after Network Rail electrification work |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34112951 |work=BBC News |accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nDuring the 1830s, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] developed a plan for a railway running east-west between London and Bristol.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> The [[Great Western Main Line]], would maintain either level ground or gentle gradients of no greater than 1 in 1000 along most of its route. Between [[Swindon]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], at the highest point of the line a  tunnel was proposed through [[Box Hill, Wiltshire|Box Hill]], outside [[Corsham]].<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nThe tunnel would have a steep gradient of 1 in 100. At the time, the use of such a gradient inside the tunnel allegedly provoked criticism by some of Brunel's contemporaries.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> Box Tunnel would be the longest railway tunnel at almost {{convert|1+3/4|mi}} in length.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\n===Geology===\nWhile  a tunnel had been included in the [[1835 Great Western Railway Act]], contemporary engineers considered the construction of Box Tunnel to be an impossibility at worst and a dangerous undertaking at best. The challenge posed was not only its length but the difficult underlying strata it would have to pass through. The rocks through which it passes comprise [[Great Oolite]] overlying [[fuller's earth]], and [[Inferior Oolite]] and [[Bridport Sand]] beneath, a combination with which tunnellers were familiar.\n\nThe Great Oolite limestone, known as ''[[Bath Stone]]'', is easily worked and had been used for construction since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was extracted by the [[room and pillar]] method and used for many buildings in [[Bath, Somerset]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Combe Down Stone Mines Land Stabilisation Project |work=BANES |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilinformation/areainformation/combedownstonemines/default.htm |accessdate=13 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117002821/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/councilinformation/areainformation/combedownstonemines/default.htm |archivedate=17 January 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\nTo assess the geology more accurately, between 1836 and 1837, Brunel sank eight shafts at intervals along the tunnel's projected alignment.<ref name=NetRailBox>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/VirtualArchive/box-tunnel/ |title=Box Tunnel |publisher=[[Network Rail]] |accessdate=2 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719071845/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/VirtualArchive/box-tunnel/ |archive-date=19 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe GWR selected George Burge of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] as the major contractor,<ref name=NetRailBox/> being responsible for undertaking 75 per cent of overall tunnel length, working from the western end.

Work was divided into six sections; access to each was via a {{convert|25|foot}} diameter ventilation shaft, which ranged in depth from {{convert|70|ft}} at the eastern end to {{convert|300|ft}} towards the western end.<ref name=NetRailBox/> The men, equipment, materials and {{convert|247000|cuyd}} of extract had to go in and come out of the shafts assisted by [[steam engine|steam-powered]] winches. The shafts were the safety exits from the tunnel.<ref name=NetRailBox/>\n\nCandles provided the only lighting in the workings and were consumed at a rate of one tonne per week, which was equalled by the weekly consumption of explosives.<ref name=NetRailBox/> Due to the considerable time required for men to enter and exit the workings, [[Rock blasting|blasting]]  took place while they were in the tunnel. This practice and water ingress exceeding the calculated volumes, has been attributed as causing most of the deaths that occurred. About 100 [[navvy|navvies]] were killed during the tunnel's construction. Additional pumping and drainage were required during and after its construction. Large amounts of water entering the tunnel in the winter months impeded progress.<ref name=NetRailBox/><ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nOnce the eastern section had been blasted out, it was cut to form a gothic arch and left unlined.<ref name = \"eng time\"/> The western section was excavated using picks and shovels and the walls were lined with brick. Over 30 million bricks were used which were manufactured in nearby [[Chipping Campden|Chippingham]]{{clarification|Chippenham?|date=September 2019}} and transported in horse-drawn carts. Horses were used to remove much of the spoil.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nThe restrictions imposed by the site contributed to a delay in the tunnel's completion.

The Box Tunnel was the last section of the GWML to be finished, although not for lack of effort on the part of Brunel.<ref name = \"eng time\"/>\n\nDuring January 1841, Brunel came to an agreement with Burge and Yockney, to increase their workforce from {{formatnum:1200}} to {{formatnum:4,000}} and the tunnel was completed in April 1841.<ref name=NetRailBox/> The completed tunnel was {{convert|30|ft|||abbr=}} wide and capable of accommodating a pair of [[broad-gauge]] tracks.

The logistics operation was designed to cope with a maximum of {{Formatnum:1000}} tons of ammunition per day.<ref name=\"SubBrit\" />\n\nA [[Royal Air Force]] station, [[RAF Rudloe Manor|RAF Box]], was established and used an area of the tunnels.<ref name=\"SubBrit\" /> In response to the [[Bristol Blitz]], during 1940, [[Alfred McAlpine]] developed a fallback aircraft engine factory for use by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] (BAC), although it never went into production.<ref name=\"SubBrit\" /> BAC used the facility to accommodate the company's experimental department, which was developing an engine to power [[bomber aircraft|bomber]]s and the [[Bristol Beaufighter]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Tony |title=The Road to Success: Alfred McAlpine 1935&nbsp;\u2013 1985  |publisher=Rainbird Publishing |year=1987}}</ref>\n\nThe CAD was closed at the end of the war but was maintained in operational condition until the 1950s. The sidings were cleared, and saw no further use until the mid-1980s when a museum was opened on the site for a short period. During the post-war years, portions of the ammunition depot were redeveloped for other facilities, including the [[Central Government War Headquarters]], RAF No.1 Signal Unit, Controller Defence Communication Network and the [[Corsham Computer Centre]].<ref name=\"SubBrit\" /> As of the present day, the only element of the complex that remains is the former computer centre and the visible north end of the tunnel has been sealed by concrete and rubble.

The Shaybanids, originally led the grey horde southeast of the Urals (also known as the Uzbegs ([[Uzbeks]])), converted to [[Islam]] in 1282. At its height, the khanate included parts of modern-day [[Afghanistan]] and parts of [[central Asia]].\n\nAs the [[Descent from Genghis Khan|lineages of Batu and Orda]] died out in the course of the great civil wars of the 14th century, the Shaybanids under [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]] declared themselves the only legitimate successors to Jochi and put forward claims to the whole of his enormous [[Ulus of Jochi|ulus]], which included parts of [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. Their rivals were the [[Timurid dynasty]], who claimed descent from Jochi's thirteenth son by a concubine. Several decades of strife left the Timurids in control of the [[Great Horde]] and its successor states in Europe, namely, the Khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]], [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], and [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]].\n\n==Shaybanid dynasty==\n[[File:Shaybani.jpg|thumb|\n[[Muhammad Shaybani]].]]\n\nUnder [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]] (who led the Shaybanids from 1428 to 1468), the dynasty began consolidating disparate Ozbeg (Uzbek) tribes, first in the area around [[Tyumen]] and the [[Tura River]] and then down into the [[Syr Darya]] region. His grandson [[Muhammad Shaybani]] (ruled 1500-10), who gave his name to the Shaybanid dynasty, conquered [[Samarkand]], [[Herat]],<ref name=\"Grousset478\" /> [[Balkh]]<ref name=\"Grousset478\" /> and [[Bukhara]],<ref name=\"Grousset478\" /> thus ending the Timurid dynasty and establishing the short-lived Shaybanid Empire.<ref>Svat Soucek, ''A History of Inner Asia'', (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 149.</ref> After his death at the hands of [[Shah Ismail I]], he was followed successively by an uncle, a cousin, and a brother, whose Shaybanid descendants would rule the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] from 1505 until 1598 and the [[Khanate of Khiva|Khanate of Khwarezm (Khiva)]] from 1511 until 1695.\n\nAnother state ruled by the Shaybanids was the [[Khanate of Sibir]], seizing the throne in 1563. Its last khan, [[Kuchum]], was [[Russian conquest of Siberia|deposed by the Russians]] in 1598. He escaped to [[Bukhara]], but his sons and grandsons were taken by the Tsar to [[Moscow]], where they eventually assumed the surname of [[Sibirsky (surname)|Sibirsky]]. Apart from this famous branch, several other noble families from [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] (e.g., Princes [[Valikhanov]]) petitioned the Russian imperial authorities to recognise their [[Shaybanid]] roots, but mostly in vain.\n\n==Khans of Shaybanid dynasty of [[Khanate of Bukhara]]==\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=27% | Titular Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=25% | Personal Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=25% | Reign \n|-\n|colspan=3 align=\"middle\"| They were the descendants of [[Shiban]], fifth son of [[Jochi]] ruling in Western [[Siberia]].

The Shaybanids originally led the grey horde southeast of the Urals, also known as the Uzbegs ([[Uzbeks]]), was converted to [[Islam]] in 1282. At its height, the khanate included parts of modern-day [[Afghanistan]] and parts of [[central Asia]].\n\nAs the [[Descent from Genghis Khan|lineages of Batu and Orda]] died out in the course of the great civil wars of the 14th century, the Shaybanids under [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]] declared themselves the only legitimate successors to Jochi and put forward claims to the whole of his enormous [[Ulus of Jochi|ulus]], which included parts of [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. Their rivals were the [[Timurid dynasty]], who claimed descent from Jochi's thirteenth son by a concubine. Several decades of strife left the Timurids in control of the [[Great Horde]] and its successor states in Europe, namely, the Khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]], [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], and [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]].\n\n==Shaybanid dynasty==\n[[File:Shaybani.jpg|thumb|\n[[Muhammad Shaybani]].]]\n\nUnder [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]] (who led the Shaybanids from 1428 to 1468), the dynasty began consolidating disparate Ozbeg (Uzbek) tribes, first in the area around [[Tyumen]] and the [[Tura River]] and then down into the [[Syr Darya]] region. His grandson [[Muhammad Shaybani]] (ruled 1500-10), who gave his name to the Shaybanid dynasty, conquered [[Samarkand]], [[Herat]],<ref name=\"Grousset478\" /> [[Balkh]]<ref name=\"Grousset478\" /> and [[Bukhara]],<ref name=\"Grousset478\" /> thus ending the Timurid dynasty and establishing the short-lived Shaybanid Empire.<ref>Svat Soucek, ''A History of Inner Asia'', (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 149.</ref> After his death at the hands of [[Shah Ismail I]], he was followed successively by an uncle, a cousin, and a brother, whose Shaybanid descendants would rule the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] from 1505 until 1598 and the [[Khanate of Khiva|Khanate of Khwarezm (Khiva)]] from 1511 until 1695.\n\nAnother state ruled by the Shaybanids was the [[Khanate of Sibir]], seizing the throne in 1563. Its last khan, [[Kuchum]], was [[Russian conquest of Siberia|deposed by the Russians]] in 1598. He escaped to [[Bukhara]], but his sons and grandsons were taken by the Tsar to [[Moscow]], where they eventually assumed the surname of [[Sibirsky (surname)|Sibirsky]]. Apart from this famous branch, several other noble families from [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] (e.g., Princes [[Valikhanov]]) petitioned the Russian imperial authorities to recognise their [[Shaybanid]] roots, but mostly in vain.\n\n==Khans of Shaybanid dynasty of [[Khanate of Bukhara]]==\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=27% | Titular Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=25% | Personal Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=25% | Reign \n|-\n|colspan=3 align=\"middle\"| They were the descendants of [[Shiban]], fifth son of [[Jochi]] ruling in Western [[Siberia]].

In 2002, architects created renderings of how the hospital could look; a multi-storey brick building.

The interior of the hospital has been designed to enable the delivery of family centred care.
