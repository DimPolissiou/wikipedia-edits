Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]]. Because of her short height and the lack of nonadjustable microphone, Seely had to stand on top of wooden containers to sing.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/>{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} At age 16, Seely became a regular performer on [[WICU (AM)|WICU]], a local television station in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"PBS\"/> She recounted being ridiculed by her high school peers in choosing to sing country music. \"They all made fun of me because I sang country. I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]]. In 1958, she graduated from Townville High School at age eighteen.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} \n\nInstead of attending college, Seely took a job at the Titusville Trust Company as a [[stenographer]]. She was later promoted to a secretarial position.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}}{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} Rather than taking collegiate-level courses, she enrolled at the [[American Bankers Association|American Institute of Banking]] and took night classes.<ref name=\"Meadville\"/> She later reflected that having background knowledge in finance and law helped her better understand the music business.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} Although Seely was living in Pennsylvania still, she was getting increasingly frustrated by the Pennsylvania winters. One winter day, her car got caught in a snow bank and she was forced to walk home. \"I decided right then and there that I was ready to make a change,\" she recounted on her website.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}}\n\n==Music career==\n===1961\u20131965: California and early songwriting===\nIn 1961, Seely made the decision to move to southern California.

However, Seely was more interested in the music business. After a year, she left the job to take a lower-paying secretarial position at [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Imperial Records]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}}{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} While working as a record label secretary, Seely wrote one of her first compositions as a songwriter, \"[[Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)]]\".

She began writing songs for [[Four Star Records|Four Star Music]].{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} As a songwriter, her songs were recorded by several country artists. One of the first vocalists to record a composition was [[Dottie West]]. In 1965, she cut \"It Just Take Practice\" for her second studio album ''[[Dottie West Sings]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dottie West -- ''Dottie West Sings'' (1965, Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Dottie-West-Sings/release/2211162 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The same year, [[Connie Smith]] recorded \"Senses\" which was co-written with [[Glen Campbell]].

Seely had built a friendship with Dottie West, who encouraged her to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. At first, Seely was hesitant about leaving southern California. West then replied, \"Nashville's where you learn.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Partridge |first1=Tamela Meredith |title=Jeannie Seely and David Frizzell co-headline at Nashville North |url=https://herald-review.com/entertainment/jeannie-seely-and-david-frizzell-co-headline-at-nashville-north/article_212d5efd-6874-571e-85b8-f359989fd882.html |website=[[Herald & Review]] |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, country songwriter [[Hank Cochran]] was passing through California at the time and was impressed by Seely's artistry. He also would encourage a Nashville move.<ref name=\"PBS\"/>\n\n===1966\u20131975: \"Don't Touch Me\" and breakthrough===\nIn 1965, Seely officially moved to Nashville. \"When  I  arrived  in  town,  I  only  had  $50  and  a  [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford  Falcon]]  to  my  name,\" Seely recalled on her official website biography.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} Once arriving, she attended the 1965 DJ Convention and found Hank Cochran at the event. Seely approached him saying, \"Well I'm here!

The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\". The marriage \u2013 the first for Seely but the fourth for Cochran \u2013 ended in a divorce.<ref name=webbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeannieseely.com/biography.cfm|title=Jeannie Seely Official Internet Home Page|website=Jeannieseely.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Jack Greene in the 1970s and revitalizing her solo career===\nWhile moving over to Decca in 1969, Seely teamed up with fellow country star [[Jack Greene]]. Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\". The album contains 14 tracks, all of which were written/co-written by Seely herself.<ref>{{cite

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\".

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\".

Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie.

As Pearce, Manz and Sims (2009) summarize, all definitions of shared leadership consistently include a \"process of influence\" that is \"built upon more than just downward influence on subordinates or followers by an appointed or elected leader.\"  Nearly all concepts of shared leadership entail the practice of \"broadly sharing power and influence among a set of individuals rather than centralizing it in the hands of a single individual who acts in the clear role of a dominant superior.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = C | last2 = Manz | first2 =  | last3 = Sims Jr | first3 = H.

In a 2002 paper, David Sally noted that shared leadership was present even in the early days of Republican Rome. Indeed, during those ancient times, [[Rome]] \"had a successful system of co-leadership that lasted for over four centuries. This structure of co-leadership was so effective that it extended from the lower levels of the Roman magistracy to the very top position, that of [[consul]].\" (Sally, 2002) Despite such early incantations of the practice, however, most of the scholarly work on leadership has still been predominantly focused on the study of leadership in its hierarchical form. Leadership is conceived around a single individual \u2013 the leader \u2013 and how that person inspires, entices, commands, cajoles and controls followers. Research on shared leadership instead departs from the notion that leadership may well be studied as a collective phenomenon, as activities involving several individuals beyond the formally appointed manager.<ref>Crevani et al, 2010; Denis et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are some earlier conceptualizations of shared leadership. In 1924, [[Mary Parker Follet]] wrote that \"one should not only look to the designated leader, but one should let logic dictate to whom one should look for guidance\" (as cited by Crainer, 2002, p.&nbsp;72).<ref>Crainer, S. (2000). The Management Century. New York: Jossey-Bass.</ref> Along similar lines, Gibb, in 1954, wrote that, \"Leadership is probably best conceived as a group quality, as a set of functions which must be carried out by the group.\"<ref>Gibb, C. A., Gilbert, D. T., & Lindzey, G. (1954). Leadership. New York: John Wiley & Sons (p.54)</ref>  Despite these early nods toward group leadership, the formalized construct of shared leadership did not become more developed and experimentally explored until recently. Current research suggest that shared leadership forms may imply significant advantages at individual-, team-, organizational- and societal levels.<ref>Crevani et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe shift in this scholarly paradigm might partly be explained by looking at the rise of studies on [[teamwork]]. Teamwork is becoming increasingly important in the workplace literature as many organizations recognize the benefits that teamwork can bring. Thus, organizations consider it important to investigate team effectiveness and the elements that increase this. Leaders have been pointed to as critical factors in team performance and effectiveness; some have even gone as far as to say they the most important ingredient for team effectiveness.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Additionally, problems associated with team leaders are often cited as the primary reason for failures of work involving teams.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nWith the complexity and ambiguity of tasks that teams often experience, it is becoming more apparent that a single leader is unlikely to have all of the skills and traits to effectively perform the necessary leadership functions.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref> Shared leadership has been identified as the optimal model of leadership when the knowledge characteristics of interdependence, creativity, and complexity <ref>Pearce (2004). The future of leadership: Combining vertical and shared leadership to transform knowledge work. ''Academy of Management Executive'', 18, 1, 47-57.</ref> are encountered.  Thus, shared leadership is becoming increasingly popular in teams, as multiple team members emerge as leaders, especially when they have the skills/knowledge/expertise that the team needs.\n\n== Measuring ==\nThere are two main ways that most researchers measure the existence and extent of shared leadership in a team: Ratings of the team's collective leadership behavior and Social Network Analysis. A less common technique of measuring shared leadership is with the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales.\n\n=== Ratings of team's collective leadership behavior ===\nMany studies measure shared leadership as team member perceptions of leader behavior exhibited by respective team leaders and team members.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2001</ref> Often this is done by distributing leader behavior questionnaires (surveys aimed at measuring the existence and frequency of different leader behaviors) to all members of a team. Team members are instructed to fill these out once for the appointed leader and then again for all other team members. Although this allows leadership quantity to be assessed, it does not pinpoint how many other team members are engaging in leadership behaviors or how many members are looking to the same people for leadership.\n\n=== Social network analysis ===\n[[Social network analysis]] (SNA) addresses some of the flaws of collective leader behavior ratings by assessing the patterns of connections that emerge in a team and providing a method for modeling both vertical and shared leadership within a team. SNA examines the relationships that form between individuals and uses these relationships as the units of analysis. In the leadership domain, a relationship, or \"tie\" as it is referred to in SNA literature, occurs when one team member perceives another as exerting leadership influence on the team. The proportion of actual ties that exist in a team to all potential ties that could have emerged in a team is called network density and can be used as a measure of shared leadership.<ref>Mehra, A., Smith, B. R., Dixon, A. L., & Robertson, B. (2006) Distributed leadership in teams: The network of leadership perceptions and team performance. ''The Leadership Quarterly'', 17, 3, 232-245</ref>\n\nSome researchers go further into SNA and analyze a network's centralization, which helps assess the distribution of leadership, as well as the quantity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Rentsch | first2 = J.R. | year = 2010 | title = Shared Leadership in Teams: A Matter of Distribution | url = | journal = Journal of Personnel Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 203\u2013211 | doi = 10.1027/1866-5888/a000017 }}</ref>  Network centralization is measured using [[centrality]] values that are calculated for each individual. A centrality value for an individual represents the number of connections that individual has with others. The sum of the differences between the maximum individual centrality value and every other individual centrality value, divided by the maximum possible sum of differences, produces a measure of network centralization between 0 and 1, which describes the extent to which connections are concentrated around one individual, or if multiple individuals are central to the leadership network.\n\nA shared leadership network can be further separated into distributed-coordinated or distributed-fragmented by SNA.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>  This distinction depends on whether the formal and emergent leaders in a network recognize each other as leaders and are able to coordinate and lead together efficiently.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) ===\nSome studies have sought to measure shared leadership through observations of actual leadership behaviors. [[Behaviorally anchored rating scales]] (BARS) are commonly used to assess and rate performances, and can be developed to assess different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012), for example, developed such a scale and had trained raters watch videotapes of team interactions and rate each team member's behavior in terms of the dimensions on the BARS. They then operationalized shared leadership as the number of members who performed leadership behaviors, as well as the amount of leadership behavior exhibited by the team (calculated by aggregating the leadership ratings for each team member to the team level).<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each measurement technique. Although all are attempting to measure the same phenomenon and all have been used in published studies, the particular measure that a researcher uses can impact his or her results.\n\n== Antecedents: internal and external conditions ==\nA host of scholars who have studied shared leadership found that in order for the dynamic to properly emerge, two preconditions must be met. First, team members must actually be willing to extend their feedback to the team in a way that aims to influence and motivate the direction of the group. Second, the team must overall be disposed to accept and rely on such feedback by other team members.<ref>Katz, D., & Kahn, R. L. (1978).</ref> The preconditions specified by Katz and Kahn (1978) tend to be met by leadership sharing in teams by the development of interpersonal alliances (measured by LMX-TEAM) between and among participants as several meta-analyses reported.<ref>Graen, G. B. (2013). The Oxford Handbook of Leadership, Oxford: Oxford University Press (Graen, G. B. (2013. The Social Psychology of Organizations, 2nd Ed. London: Wiley</ref> Carson et al. (2007) expanded these two requirements by describing them in a larger, two-part framework that includes the degree to which a strong internal team environment exists and the extent to which positive external team [[coaching]] occurs.<ref>Carson et al</ref>\n\n=== Internal team environment ===\nCarson et al. (2007) propose first that shared leadership is facilitated by an overall team environment that consists of three dimensions: shared purpose, social support, and voice. The three concepts are also drawn from a wide body of literature:\n\n* '''Shared [[purpose]]''' prevails when team members have similar understandings of their team's main objectives and take steps to ensure a focus on collective goals.\n* '''[[Social support]]''' is the extent to which team members actively provide emotional and psychological strength to one another. This may occur through overt acts of encouragement or expressed recognition of other team members' contributions and accomplishments.\n* '''[[Advice (opinion)|Voice]]''' is the degree to which a team's members have input into how the team carries out its purpose.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe three dimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, thereby \"representing a high order construct.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref> Carson et al. summarize the [[interconnectivity]] of these three concepts in a concise narrative: \nWhen team members are able to speak up and get involved (voice), the likelihood that many of them will exercise leadership increases greatly. The opportunity for voice also facilitates shared leadership by strengthening both a common sense of direction and the potential for positive interpersonal support in a team. When teams are focused on collective goals (shared purpose), there is a greater sense of meaning and increased motivation for team members to both speak up and invest themselves in providing leadership to the team and to respond to the leadership of others. The motivation to participate and provide input toward achieving common goals and a common purpose can also be reinforced by an encouraging and supportive climate. When team members feel recognized and supported within their team (social support) they are more willing to share responsibility, cooperate, and commit to the team's collective [[goal]]s. Thus, these three dimensions work together to create an internal team environment that is characterized by a shared understanding about purpose and goals, a sense of recognition and importance, and high levels of involvement, challenge, and cooperation.<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref>\n\n=== External team coaching ===\nScholars have also described the important role that external team leaders and support can have in the development of shared leadership.<ref>Manz, C. C., & Sims H. P. Jr. (1987). Leading worker to lead themselves: The external leadership for self-managing work team. ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 106-129.</ref>  When framing this dynamic or antecedent, scholars have stressed the importance of external [[coaching]] behaviors. One scholar defines these coaching behaviors as: \"direct interaction with a team intended to help team members make coordinated and task-appropriate use of their collective resources in accomplishing the team's task.\"<ref>Hackman, J. R., & Wageman, R. (2005). A theory of team coaching. ''Academy of Management Review'', 30,p. 269</ref> Researchers have identified two types of team coaching\u2014distinguishing between those that reinforce shared leadership (supportive [[coaching]]) and those that focus on identifying team problems through task [[interventions]] (functional approach).<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Through supportive coaching, external team managers can reinforce the development of shared leadership in a variety of ways. Through active encouragement and [[positive reinforcement]] of team members who demonstrate leadership, coaching can foster independence and a sense of self-competence nurtures among team members. Coaching can also nurture collective commitment to the team and its objectives, a shared promise that can reduce free riding and increase the possibility that team members will demonstrate personal initiative.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nA second, more indirect, way that external [[coaching]] may positively encourage shared leadership is based on a functional approach. Within this approach, the role of an external team leader is to do whatever is not being adequately managed by the team itself, to \"intervene on behalf of an incomplete task.\" This functional coaching can be redundant when teams have highly supportive internal environments and therefore are less critical to the overall development of shared leadership. When interventions are necessary, however, such as when teams lack a strong shared purpose, the functional approach asserts that this kind of external influence may be particularly important. In this sense, the functional approach can be understood as providing \"motivational and consultative functions that enable shared leadership but have not been adequately developed by the team internally.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1224</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\nThough there is an ongoing debate about the existence and importance of shared leadership, many studies have shown that shared leadership is a significant predictor for various team processes.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Team effectiveness/performance ===\nA commonly explored consequence of shared leadership is team effectiveness or [[job performance|team performance]], which can be measured either by self-reports of team members or by outsider ratings, such as supervisor or client ratings.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2002</ref>  Performance is also sometimes measured more objectively, by using a commonly agreed-upon scale or rubric to rate the execution of a task. Many studies have found a positive relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness and performance.<ref>Sivasubramaniam, N., Murray, W. D., Avolio, B. J., & Jung, D. I. (2002). A longitudinal model of the effects of team leadership and group potency on group performance ''Group & Organization Management'' 2, 1, 66-96; Carson et al, 2007</ref> Similarly, other studies have explored the extent to which shared leadership can predict a team's effectiveness or performance, and have found that it is a significant predictor\u2014often a better predictor than vertical leadership.<ref>Pearce and Sims, 2002; Pearce et al, 2004; Ensley, Hmieleski, & Pearce, 2006</ref>\nA meta-analysis by Nicolaides and colleagues (2014) found that one reason why shared leadership relates to performance is through increasing team confidence. The researchers also found that shared leadership contributed to performance, over and above the effects of vertical leadership.<ref>Nicolaides, V. C., LaPort, K. A., Chen, T. R., Tomassetti, A. J., Weis, E. J., Zaccaro, S. J., & Cortina, J. M. (2014). The shared leadership of teams: A meta-analysis of proximal, distal, and moderating relationships. ''The Leadership Quarterly'', 25(5), 923-942.</ref>\n\nThe causes for this positive effect on [[team effectiveness]] lie in feeling empowered through the perceived responsibility and self-control in the context of shared leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dumaine|first=Brian|title=The Trouble with Teams|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ487492|journal=Fortune|language=en|volume=130|issue=5|pages=86|issn=0015-8259}}</ref> This results in more engagement of the team members, more team [[Group cohesiveness|cohesion]], [[Psychological safety|trust]], a higher level of consensus and satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bergman|first=Jacqueline Z.|last2=Rentsch|first2=Joan R.|last3=Small|first3=Erika E.|last4=Davenport|first4=Shaun W.|last5=Bergman|first5=Shawn M.|date=2012-01-01|title=The Shared Leadership Process in Decision-Making Teams|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=152|issue=1|pages=17\u201342|doi=10.1080/00224545.2010.538763|issn=0022-4545|pmid=22308759}}</ref>\n\nAs discussed in the measurement section of this article, the technique used to measure shared leadership can influence the results that are found. For example, Mehra et al. (2006) first compared teams with a distributed (shared) leadership structure to teams with a more traditional (vertical) leadership structure. In contrast to other studies, they did not find that teams with shared leadership outperformed the traditional teams. However, when they separated the distributed teams into distributed-coordinated and distributed-fragmented (see measures section), they found that distributed-coordinated team structures were associated with higher performance than both traditional leader-centered teams and distributed-fragmented leadership networks. Thus, they theorized, having more leaders is not the only factor that matters to team performance; rather, leaders must recognize other leaders as such in order for them to contribute positively to team effectiveness.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Number and types of leadership ===\nNot surprisingly, shared leadership has been shown to increase the number and types of leadership (for example, [[transformational leadership]]; [[transactional leadership]]; [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|and consideration and initiating structure]]).\u00b7<ref>Bergman et al, 2012; Pearce and Sims, 2002</ref>   Shared leadership enables team members to express their different abilities, thus letting members of a team exhibit different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012) found that teams did, in fact, experience more types of leadership behaviors when multiple members of the team participated in the team's leadership. Additionally, they found that each leader only effectively engaged in one type of leadership, indicating that shared leadership lets more leadership behaviors be expressed than vertical leadership.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\n=== In schools ===\nThe effect of shared leadership at school is contingent on the key players involved and how they view their missions. Conflicting thoughts on how shared leadership influences [[student engagement]] result in a variety of interpretations by researchers. Sharing leadership also impacts how teachers interact with one another, whether they possess relationships where they reinforce one another or feel distant from the organization.\n\nOne view is that sharing leadership among more people does not necessarily bring positive student outcomes. Some researchers have called the influence of shared leadership into question, suggesting that the influence of shared leadership is statistically non-significant ([[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] & Jantzi, 1999),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Jantzi | first2 = D. | year = 1999 | title = The relative effects of principal and teacher sources of leadership on student engagement with school | url = | journal = Educational administration quarterly | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 679\u2013706 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x99355002 }}</ref> and indicating that shared leadership is \"not a significant factor for students' participation in or engagement with school\" (Silins et al., 2002).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silins | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Mulford | first2 = W.

S. | year = 2005 | title = Distributed leadership: Developing theory from practice | url = | journal = Journal of curriculum studies | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 395\u2013420 | doi = 10.1080/00220270500038545 }}</ref>\n\nConversely, it has been argued that shared leadership is positively related to students' achievement. In addition, shared leadership enables teachers to employ certain methodologies or instructional content. [[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] and Mascall(2008) conclude that shared leadership eventually influences students' math achievement indirectly by effecting teacher motivation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Mascall | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Collective leadership effects on student achievement | url = | journal = Educational Administration Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 529\u2013561 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x08321221 }}</ref> Similarly, a study by Heck and Hallinger(2009) shows that the development of school shared leadership has an indirect impact on students' academic growth in math, mutually reinforcing academic capacity of teachers and students over time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heck | first1 = R. H. | last2 = Hallinger | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = ''Assessing the contribution of distributed leadership to school improvement and growth in math achievement.

Camburn and Han's study (2009), however, does not present empirical evidence that shared leadership is associated with students' outcomes.<ref>Camburn, E. M., & Han, S. W. (2009). ''Investigating connections'' ''between distributed leadership and instructional change (pp. 25-45).'' Springer Netherlands.</ref>\n\nOther research focused on the impact of shared leadership notes the teacher perceptions. Work by Hulpia and Devos (2010) reveals that leadership practices such as the sharing of leadership roles, social interaction, cooperation of the leadership team, and inclusive decision-making, positively reinforce teachers' [[Organizational commitment|commitment to the organization.]]<ref>Hulpia, H., & Devos, G. (2010). How distributed leadership can make a difference in teachers' organizational commitment? A qualitative study. ''Teaching and'' Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies'', 26 (3),'' 565-575.</ref> It has been underscored that teachers' academic optimism, which refer to trust, teacher [[efficacy]], and [[organizational citizenship behavior]] as well, are heavily and positively associated with planned approaches to leadership distribution (Mascall et al.,2008)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mascall | first1 = B. | last2 = Leithwood | first2 = K. | last3 = Straus | first3 = T. | last4 = Sacks | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = ''The relationship between distributed leadership and teachers' academic optimism.

Shared traditional leadership refers to a task-oriented, [[Transactional leadership|transactional form of leadership]], which emphasizes maintaining the status quo. Shared new-genre leadership however focuses on [[transformational leadership]] and therefore a more inspirational, visionary, growth and change-oriented kind of leadership. Lastly, cumulative, overall leadership was assessed based on individual members\u2019 ratings of leadership influence for each of his/her peers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nThe studies showed that both shared new-genre leadership and cumulative, overall shared leadership show a stronger relationship with team effectiveness than shared traditional leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Work complexity ====\nWork complexity (also known as job complexity) acts as a moderator of the shared leadership-team effectiveness relationship, namely that the relationship is stronger when work is more complex compared with when it is less complex. This can be explained by the higher interdependence, coordination and information sharing that is necessary when work complexity is high.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n== Implications and further research directions ==\nScholars have pointed to 4 main areas in shared leadership that need more research: \n# Events that generate shared leadership\n# Facilitation factors\n# Most conducive influence approaches\n# Stages and life cycles in shared leadership settings (Carson et al., 2007; Pearce and Conger, 2002).\nAdditionally, more scholarship must be done on outcomes of shared leadership. The spike of recent scholarship in this field does indicate that scholars increasingly understand the significance of shared leadership as organizations in the field are also increasingly capitalizing on the many benefits a shared leadership approach can offer.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Group development]]\n* [[Group dynamics]]\n* [[Human resources]]\n* [[Leadership development]]\n* [[Leadership studies]]\n* [[Organizational development]]\n* [[Team building]]\n* [[Team composition]]\n* [[Three levels of leadership model]]\n* [[Trait leadership]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n# Bass, B.

In a 2002 paper, David Sally noted that shared leadership was present even in the early days of Republican Rome. Indeed, during those ancient times, [[Rome]] \"had a successful system of co-leadership that lasted for over four centuries. This structure of co-leadership was so effective that it extended from the lower levels of the Roman magistracy to the very top position, that of [[consul]].\" (Sally, 2002) Despite such early incantations of the practice, however, most of the scholarly work on leadership has still been predominantly focused on the study of leadership in its hierarchical form. Leadership is conceived around a single individual \u2013 the leader \u2013 and how that person inspires, entices, commands, cajoles and controls followers. Research on shared leadership instead departs from the notion that leadership may well be studied as a collective phenomenon, as activities involving several individuals beyond the formally appointed manager.<ref>Crevani et al, 2010; Denis et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are some earlier conceptualizations of shared leadership. In 1924, [[Mary Parker Follet]] wrote that \"one should not only look to the designated leader, but one should let logic dictate to whom one should look for guidance\" (as cited by Crainer, 2002, p.&nbsp;72).<ref>Crainer, S. (2000). The Management Century. New York: Jossey-Bass.</ref> Along similar lines, Gibb, in 1954, wrote that, \"Leadership is probably best conceived as a group quality, as a set of functions which must be carried out by the group.\"<ref>Gibb, C. A., Gilbert, D. T., & Lindzey, G. (1954). Leadership. New York: John Wiley & Sons (p.54)</ref>  Despite these early nods toward group leadership, the formalized construct of shared leadership did not become more developed and experimentally explored until recently. Current research suggest that shared leadership forms may imply significant advantages at individual-, team-, organizational- and societal levels.<ref>Crevani et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe shift in this scholarly paradigm might partly be explained by looking at the rise of studies on [[teamwork]]. Teamwork is becoming increasingly important in the workplace literature as many organizations recognize the benefits that teamwork can bring. Thus, organizations consider it important to investigate team effectiveness and the elements that increase this. Leaders have been pointed to as critical factors in team performance and effectiveness; some have even gone as far as to say they the most important ingredient for team effectiveness.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Additionally, problems associated with team leaders are often cited as the primary reason for failures of work involving teams.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nWith the complexity and ambiguity of tasks that teams often experience, it is becoming more apparent that a single leader is unlikely to have all of the skills and traits to effectively perform the necessary leadership functions.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref> Shared leadership has been identified as the optimal model of leadership when the knowledge characteristics of interdependence, creativity, and complexity <ref>Pearce (2004). The future of leadership: Combining vertical and shared leadership to transform knowledge work. Academy of Management Executive, 18, 1, 47-57.</ref> are encountered.  Thus, shared leadership is becoming increasingly popular in teams, as multiple team members emerge as leaders, especially when they have the skills/knowledge/expertise that the team needs.\n\n== Measuring ==\nThere are two main ways that most researchers measure the existence and extent of shared leadership in a team: Ratings of the team's collective leadership behavior and Social Network Analysis. A less common technique of measuring shared leadership is with the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales.\n\n=== Ratings of team's collective leadership behavior ===\nMany studies measure shared leadership as team member perceptions of leader behavior exhibited by respective team leaders and team members.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2001</ref> Often this is done by distributing leader behavior questionnaires (surveys aimed at measuring the existence and frequency of different leader behaviors) to all members of a team. Team members are instructed to fill these out once for the appointed leader and then again for all other team members. Although this allows leadership quantity to be assessed, it does not pinpoint how many other team members are engaging in leadership behaviors or how many members are looking to the same people for leadership.\n\n=== Social network analysis ===\n[[Social network analysis]] (SNA) addresses some of the flaws of collective leader behavior ratings by assessing the patterns of connections that emerge in a team and providing a method for modeling both vertical and shared leadership within a team. SNA examines the relationships that form between individuals and uses these relationships as the units of analysis. In the leadership domain, a relationship, or \"tie\" as it is referred to in SNA literature, occurs when one team member perceives another as exerting leadership influence on the team. The proportion of actual ties that exist in a team to all potential ties that could have emerged in a team is called network density and can be used as a measure of shared leadership.<ref>Mehra, A., Smith, B. R., Dixon, A. L., & Robertson, B. (2006) Distributed leadership in teams: The network of leadership perceptions and team performance. The Leadership Quarterly, 17, 3, 232-245</ref>\n\nSome researchers go further into SNA and analyze a network's centralization, which helps assess the distribution of leadership, as well as the quantity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Rentsch | first2 = J.R. | year = 2010 | title = Shared Leadership in Teams: A Matter of Distribution | url = | journal = Journal of Personnel Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 203\u2013211 | doi = 10.1027/1866-5888/a000017 }}</ref>  Network centralization is measured using [[centrality]] values that are calculated for each individual. A centrality value for an individual represents the number of connections that individual has with others. The sum of the differences between the maximum individual centrality value and every other individual centrality value, divided by the maximum possible sum of differences, produces a measure of network centralization between 0 and 1, which describes the extent to which connections are concentrated around one individual, or if multiple individuals are central to the leadership network.\n\nA shared leadership network can be further separated into distributed-coordinated or distributed-fragmented by SNA.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>  This distinction depends on whether the formal and emergent leaders in a network recognize each other as leaders and are able to coordinate and lead together efficiently.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) ===\nSome studies have sought to measure shared leadership through observations of actual leadership behaviors. [[Behaviorally anchored rating scales]] (BARS) are commonly used to assess and rate performances, and can be developed to assess different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012), for example, developed such a scale and had trained raters watch videotapes of team interactions and rate each team member's behavior in terms of the dimensions on the BARS. They then operationalized shared leadership as the number of members who performed leadership behaviors, as well as the amount of leadership behavior exhibited by the team (calculated by aggregating the leadership ratings for each team member to the team level).<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each measurement technique. Although all are attempting to measure the same phenomenon and all have been used in published studies, the particular measure that a researcher uses can impact his or her results.\n\n== Antecedents: internal and external conditions ==\nA host of scholars who have studied shared leadership found that in order for the dynamic to properly emerge, two preconditions must be met. First, team members must actually be willing to extend their feedback to the team in a way that aims to influence and motivate the direction of the group. Second, the team must overall be disposed to accept and rely on such feedback by other team members.<ref>Katz, D., & Kahn, R. L. (1978).</ref> The preconditions specified by Katz and Kahn (1978) tend to be met by leadership sharing in teams by the development of interpersonal alliances (measured by LMX-TEAM) between and among participants as several meta-analyses reported.<ref>Graen, G. B. (2013). The Oxford Handbook of Leadership, Oxford: Oxford University Press (Graen, G. B. (2013. The Social Psychology of Organizations, 2nd Ed. London: Wiley</ref> Carson et al. (2007) expanded these two requirements by describing them in a larger, two-part framework that includes the degree to which a strong internal team environment exists and the extent to which positive external team [[coaching]] occurs.<ref>Carson et al</ref>\n\n=== Internal team environment ===\nCarson et al. (2007) propose first that shared leadership is facilitated by an overall team environment that consists of three dimensions: shared purpose, social support, and voice. The three concepts are also drawn from a wide body of literature:\n\n* '''Shared [[purpose]]''' prevails when team members have similar understandings of their team's main objectives and take steps to ensure a focus on collective goals.\n* '''[[Social support]]''' is the extent to which team members actively provide emotional and psychological strength to one another. This may occur through overt acts of encouragement or expressed recognition of other team members' contributions and accomplishments.\n* '''[[Advice (opinion)|Voice]]''' is the degree to which a team's members have input into how the team carries out its purpose.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nThe three dimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, thereby \"representing a high order construct.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref> Carson et al. summarize the [[interconnectivity]] of these three concepts in a concise narrative: \nWhen team members are able to speak up and get involved (voice), the likelihood that many of them will exercise leadership increases greatly. The opportunity for voice also facilitates shared leadership by strengthening both a common sense of direction and the potential for positive interpersonal support in a team. When teams are focused on collective goals (shared purpose), there is a greater sense of meaning and increased motivation for team members to both speak up and invest themselves in providing leadership to the team and to respond to the leadership of others. The motivation to participate and provide input toward achieving common goals and a common purpose can also be reinforced by an encouraging and supportive climate. When team members feel recognized and supported within their team (social support) they are more willing to share responsibility, cooperate, and commit to the team's collective [[goal]]s. Thus, these three dimensions work together to create an internal team environment that is characterized by a shared understanding about purpose and goals, a sense of recognition and importance, and high levels of involvement, challenge, and cooperation.<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1223</ref>\n\n=== External team coaching ===\nScholars have also described the important role that external team leaders and support can have in the development of shared leadership.<ref>Manz, C. C., & Sims H. P. Jr. (1987). Leading worker to lead themselves: The external leadership for self-managing work team. Administrative Science Quarterly, 106-129.</ref>  When framing this dynamic or antecedent, scholars have stressed the importance of external [[coaching]] behaviors. One scholar defines these coaching behaviors as: \"direct interaction with a team intended to help team members make coordinated and task-appropriate use of their collective resources in accomplishing the team's task.\"<ref>Hackman, J. R., & Wageman, R. (2005). A theory of team coaching. Academy of Management Review, 30,p. 269</ref> Researchers have identified two types of team coaching\u2014distinguishing between those that reinforce shared leadership (supportive [[coaching]]) and those that focus on identifying team problems through task [[interventions]] (functional approach).<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>  Through supportive coaching, external team managers can reinforce the development of shared leadership in a variety of ways. Through active encouragement and [[positive reinforcement]] of team members who demonstrate leadership, coaching can foster independence and a sense of self-competence nurtures among team members. Coaching can also nurture collective commitment to the team and its objectives, a shared promise that can reduce free riding and increase the possibility that team members will demonstrate personal initiative.<ref>Carson et al, 2007</ref>\n\nA second, more indirect, way that external [[coaching]] may positively encourage shared leadership is based on a functional approach. Within this approach, the role of an external team leader is to do whatever is not being adequately managed by the team itself, to \"intervene on behalf of an incomplete task.\" This functional coaching can be redundant when teams have highly supportive internal environments and therefore are less critical to the overall development of shared leadership. When interventions are necessary, however, such as when teams lack a strong shared purpose, the functional approach asserts that this kind of external influence may be particularly important. In this sense, the functional approach can be understood as providing \"motivational and consultative functions that enable shared leadership but have not been adequately developed by the team internally.\"<ref>Carson et al, 2007, p.&nbsp;1224</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\nThough there is an ongoing debate about the existence and importance of shared leadership, many studies have shown that shared leadership is a significant predictor for various team processes.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Team effectiveness/performance ===\nA commonly explored consequence of shared leadership is team effectiveness or [[job performance|team performance]], which can be measured either by self-reports of team members or by outsider ratings, such as supervisor or client ratings.<ref>Pearce & Sims, 2002</ref>  Performance is also sometimes measured more objectively, by using a commonly agreed-upon scale or rubric to rate the execution of a task. Many studies have found a positive relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness and performance.<ref>Sivasubramaniam, N., Murray, W. D., Avolio, B. J., & Jung, D. I. (2002). A longitudinal model of the effects of team leadership and group potency on group performance ''Group & Organization Management'' 2, 1, 66-96; Carson et al, 2007</ref> Similarly, other studies have explored the extent to which shared leadership can predict a team's effectiveness or performance, and have found that it is a significant predictor\u2014often a better predictor than vertical leadership.<ref>Pearce and Sims, 2002; Pearce et al, 2004; Ensley, Hmieleski, & Pearce, 2006</ref>\nA meta-analysis by Nicolaides and colleagues (2014) found that one reason why shared leadership relates to performance is through increasing team confidence. The researchers also found that shared leadership contributed to performance, over and above the effects of vertical leadership.<ref>Nicolaides, V. C., LaPort, K. A., Chen, T. R., Tomassetti, A. J., Weis, E. J., Zaccaro, S. J., & Cortina, J. M. (2014). The shared leadership of teams: A meta-analysis of proximal, distal, and moderating relationships. The Leadership Quarterly, 25(5), 923-942.</ref>\n\nThe causes for this positive effect on [[team effectiveness]] lie in feeling empowered through the perceived responsibility and self-control in the context of shared leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dumaine|first=Brian|title=The Trouble with Teams|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ487492|journal=Fortune|language=en|volume=130|issue=5|pages=86|issn=0015-8259}}</ref> This results in more engagement of the team members, more team [[Group cohesiveness|cohesion]], [[Psychological safety|trust]], a higher level of consensus and satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bergman|first=Jacqueline Z.|last2=Rentsch|first2=Joan R.|last3=Small|first3=Erika E.|last4=Davenport|first4=Shaun W.|last5=Bergman|first5=Shawn M.|date=2012-01-01|title=The Shared Leadership Process in Decision-Making Teams|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=152|issue=1|pages=17\u201342|doi=10.1080/00224545.2010.538763|issn=0022-4545|pmid=22308759}}</ref>\n\nAs discussed in the measurement section of this article, the technique used to measure shared leadership can influence the results that are found. For example, Mehra et al. (2006) first compared teams with a distributed (shared) leadership structure to teams with a more traditional (vertical) leadership structure. In contrast to other studies, they did not find that teams with shared leadership outperformed the traditional teams. However, when they separated the distributed teams into distributed-coordinated and distributed-fragmented (see measures section), they found that distributed-coordinated team structures were associated with higher performance than both traditional leader-centered teams and distributed-fragmented leadership networks. Thus, they theorized, having more leaders is not the only factor that matters to team performance; rather, leaders must recognize other leaders as such in order for them to contribute positively to team effectiveness.<ref>Mehra et al, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Number and types of leadership ===\nNot surprisingly, shared leadership has been shown to increase the number and types of leadership (for example, [[transformational leadership]]; [[transactional leadership]]; [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|and consideration and initiating structure]]).\u00b7<ref>Bergman et al, 2012; Pearce and Sims, 2002</ref>   Shared leadership enables team members to express their different abilities, thus letting members of a team exhibit different leadership behaviors. Bergman et al. (2012) found that teams did, in fact, experience more types of leadership behaviors when multiple members of the team participated in the team's leadership. Additionally, they found that each leader only effectively engaged in one type of leadership, indicating that shared leadership lets more leadership behaviors be expressed than vertical leadership.<ref>Bergman et al, 2012</ref>\n\n=== In schools ===\nThe effect of shared leadership at school is contingent on the key players involved and how they view their missions. Conflicting thoughts on how shared leadership influences [[student engagement]] result in a variety of interpretations by researchers. Sharing leadership also impacts how teachers interact with one another, whether they possess relationships where they reinforce one another or feel distant from the organization.\n\nOne view is that sharing leadership among more people does not necessarily bring positive student outcomes. Some researchers have called the influence of shared leadership into question, suggesting that the influence of shared leadership is statistically non-significant ([[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] & Jantzi, 1999),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Jantzi | first2 = D. | year = 1999 | title = The relative effects of principal and teacher sources of leadership on student engagement with school | url = | journal = Educational administration quarterly | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 679\u2013706 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x99355002 }}</ref> and indicating that shared leadership is \"not a significant factor for students' participation in or engagement with school\" (Silins et al., 2002).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silins | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Mulford | first2 = W.

S. | year = 2005 | title = Distributed leadership: Developing theory from practice | url = | journal = Journal of curriculum studies | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 395\u2013420 | doi = 10.1080/00220270500038545 }}</ref>\n\nConversely, it has been argued that shared leadership is positively related to students' achievement. In addition, shared leadership enables teachers to employ certain methodologies or instructional content. [[Kenneth Leithwood|Leithwood]] and Mascall(2008) conclude that shared leadership eventually influences students' math achievement indirectly by effecting teacher motivation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leithwood | first1 = K. | last2 = Mascall | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Collective leadership effects on student achievement | url = | journal = Educational Administration Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 529\u2013561 | doi = 10.1177/0013161x08321221 }}</ref> Similarly, a study by Heck and Hallinger(2009) shows that the development of school shared leadership has an indirect impact on students' academic growth in math, mutually reinforcing academic capacity of teachers and students over time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heck | first1 = R. H. | last2 = Hallinger | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = ''Assessing the contribution of distributed leadership to school improvement and growth in math achievement. ''American | url = | journal = Educational Research Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 659\u2013689 | doi = 10.3102/0002831209340042 }}</ref> Researchers and writers, such as Camburn and Han(2009), have also remarked that widespread leadership promotes teachers exposure to plentiful instructional resources and the likelihood that they will employ these instruction practices. Camburn and Han's study (2009), however, does not present empirical evidence that shared leadership is associated with students' outcomes.<ref>Camburn, E. M., & Han, S. W. (2009). ''Investigating connections'' ''between distributed leadership and instructional change (pp. 25-45).'' Springer Netherlands.</ref>\n\nOther research focused on the impact of shared leadership notes the teacher perceptions. Work by Hulpia and Devos (2010) reveals that leadership practices such as the sharing of leadership roles, social interaction, cooperation of the leadership team, and inclusive decision-making, positively reinforce teachers' [[Organizational commitment|commitment to the organization.]]<ref>Hulpia, H., & Devos, G. (2010). How distributed leadership can make a difference in teachers' organizational commitment? A qualitative study. ''Teaching and'' Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies'', 26 (3),'' 565-575.</ref> It has been underscored that teachers' academic optimism, which refer to trust, teacher [[efficacy]], and [[organizational citizenship behavior]] as well, are heavily and positively associated with planned approaches to leadership distribution (Mascall et al.,2008)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mascall | first1 = B. | last2 = Leithwood | first2 = K. | last3 = Straus | first3 = T. | last4 = Sacks | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = ''The relationship between distributed leadership and teachers' academic optimism.

Shared traditional leadership refers to a task-oriented, [[Transactional leadership|transactional form of leadership]], which emphasizes maintaining the status quo. Shared new-genre leadership however focuses on [[transformational leadership]] and therefore a more inspirational, visionary, growth and change-oriented kind of leadership. Lastly, cumulative, overall leadership was assessed based on individual members\u2019 ratings of leadership influence for each of his/her peers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nThe studies showed that both shared new-genre leadership and cumulative, overall shared leadership show a stronger relationship with team effectiveness than shared traditional leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Work complexity ====\nWork complexity (also known as job complexity) acts as a moderator of the shared leadership-team effectiveness relationship, namely that the relationship is stronger when work is more complex compared with when it is less complex. This can be explained by the higher interdependence, coordination and information sharing that is necessary when work complexity is high.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Danni|last2=Waldman|first2=David A.|last3=Zhang|first3=Zhen|title=A meta-analysis of shared leadership and team effectiveness.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=99|issue=2|pages=181\u2013198|doi=10.1037/a0034531|pmid=24188392|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n== Implications and further research directions ==\nScholars have pointed to 4 main areas in shared leadership that need more research: \n# Events that generate shared leadership\n# Facilitation factors\n# Most conducive influence approaches\n# Stages and life cycles in shared leadership settings (Carson et al., 2007; Pearce and Conger, 2002).\nAdditionally, more scholarship must be done on outcomes of shared leadership. The spike of recent scholarship in this field does indicate that scholars increasingly understand the significance of shared leadership as organizations in the field are also increasingly capitalizing on the many benefits a shared leadership approach can offer.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Group development]]\n* [[Group dynamics]]\n* [[Human resources]]\n* [[Leadership development]]\n* [[Leadership studies]]\n* [[Organizational development]]\n* [[Team building]]\n* [[Team composition]]\n* [[Three levels of leadership model]]\n* [[Trait leadership]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n# Bass, B.
