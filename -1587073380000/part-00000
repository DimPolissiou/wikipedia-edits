He wrote on the history of [[analytic philosophy]], notably as an interpreter of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], and made original contributions particularly in [[philosophy of mathematics|the philosophies of mathematics]], [[philosophy of logic|logic]], [[philosophy of language|language]] and [[metaphysics]]. He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between [[philosophical realism|realism]] and [[anti-realism]], a term he helped to popularize. He devised the [[Quota Borda system]] of proportional voting, based on the [[Borda count]]. In [[mathematical logic]], he developed an [[intermediate logic]], already studied by [[Kurt Godel|Kurt G\u00f6del]]: the [[G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic]].\n\n==Education and army service==\nBorn 27 June 1925, Dummett was the son of George Herbert Dummett (1880\u20131970), a silk merchant, and Mabel Iris n\u00e9e Eardley-Wilmot (1893\u20131980).<ref>{{cite web |last1=ISAACSON |first1=DANIEL |last2=RUMFITT |first2=IAN |title=Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Memoirs_17-12%20Dummett.pdf |website=The British Academy |accessdate=31 May 2019}}</ref> He studied at [[Sandroyd School]] in Wiltshire, at [[Winchester College]] (as a Scholar), and at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], which awarded him a Major Scholarship in 1943. He was called up for military service that year, and served until 1947, first as a private in the [[Royal Artillery]], then in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] in India and Malaya. In 1950 he graduated with a First in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Oxford and was elected a Prize Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite ODNB |author=Daniel Isaacson |title=In Memoriam: Michael Dummett (1925\u20132011) |url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/news__events/older_news/in_memoriam_michael_dummett_1925\u20132011}}</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\nIn 1979, Dummett became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at Oxford, a post he held until retiring in 1992. During his term as Wykeham Professor, he held a Fellowship at [[New College, Oxford]]. He has also held teaching posts at [[Birmingham University]], [[UC Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Harvard University]]. He won the [[Schock Prize|Rolf Schock]] prize in 1995,<ref>[http://www.philosophy.su.se/english/research/2.26526 philosophy.su.se.]</ref> and was [[knight]]ed in 1999. He was the 2010 winner of the Lauener Prize for an Outstanding \u0152uvre in Analytical Philosophy.<ref>[http://lauener-foundation.ch/award.php Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Oeuvre in Analytical Philosophy].</ref>\n\nDuring his career at Oxford, Dummett supervised many philosophers who went on to distinguished careers, including [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|Adrian Moore]], [[Ian Rumfitt]], and [[Crispin Wright]].\n\n==Philosophical work<!--''Semantic realism (epistemology)'', ''Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)'' and ''Semantic antirealism (epistemology)'' redirect here-->==\nHis work on the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] has been acclaimed. His first book ''[[Frege: Philosophy of Language]]'' (1973), written over many years, is now regarded as a classic. The book was instrumental in the rediscovery of Frege's work, and influenced a generation of British philosophers.\n\nIn his 1963 paper \"Realism\", he popularised a controversial approach to understanding the historical dispute between [[philosophical realism|realist]] and other non-realist philosophy such as [[idealism]], [[nominalism]], [[Irrealism (philosophy)|Irrealism]].<ref>Originally a lecture to the Philosophical Society at Oxford in 1963, first published in 1978 in his book ''Truth and Other Enigmas''. See ''Truth and Other Enigmas'', p. ix.</ref> He classed all the latter as [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth. For Dummett, realism is best understood as '''semantic realism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, i. e., as the view accepting that every declarative sentence of one's language is [[bivalence|bivalent]] (determinately true or false) and [[evidence-transcendent]] (independent of our means of coming to know which),<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/ Logicism and Neologicism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref><ref name=IEP/> while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#ReaTru Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).]</ref> Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as [[natural numbers]]), moral categories, the material world, or even thought. The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as at base, analogous to the dispute between [[Intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].\n\nFranzane Abella commented that Dummett was really interested not in understanding problems via classical logic but via intuitionistic logic, and Abella stated that \"such mathematical entities are more likely to be an ontological myth for Dummett... because truth cannot be unidentified via intuition, and of course it will fall on the notion of ''logical opaqueness'', which statements are not likely to be understood easily in the first place.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=Dummettian Truth |url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/epistclass/dummett.pdf |journal= |volume= |pages= |via=}}</ref> Franzane Abella further added that \"Dummett has an astounding influence when he brought forward the ''deep-order justificationist semantics''; this influenced the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]] and the classification of understanding via practices, whether the statement can be refuted or not based on its meaning.\" Abella summed up by saying that Dummett refuted the theory brought forward by realism about the cognisance of meaning. For example, the psychological change in our conceptions of meaning of any statements should be properly grasped, because if not, there exists an alteration and confusion of meaning, and of course a failure in grasping truth-values.\n\nDummett espoused '''semantic anti-realism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, a position suggesting that truth cannot serve as the central notion in the theory of meaning and must be replaced by [[Verificationism|verifiability]].<ref>Panu Raatikainen, [http://newprairiepress.org/biyclc/vol5/iss1/10/ \"The Semantic Realism/Anti-Realism Dispute and Knowledge of Meanings\"], ''The Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication'' '''5'''(1): 1\u201313. 2010.</ref> Semantic anti-realism is sometimes related to [[semantic inferentialism]].<ref>R. Ramanujam and Sundar Sarukkai (eds), ''Logic and Its Applications'', Springer, 2009, p. 260.</ref>\n\n==Activism==\nDummett was politically active, through his work as a campaigner against racism. He let his philosophical career stall in order to influence civil rights for minorities during what he saw as a crucial period of reform in the late 1960s. He also worked on the theory of voting, which led to his introduction of the [[Quota Borda system]].\n\nDummett drew heavily on his work in this area in writing his book ''On Immigration and Refugees'', an account of what justice demands of states in relationship to movement between states. Dummett, in that book, argues that the vast majority of opposition to immigration has been founded in racism and says that this has especially been so in the UK.\n\nHe has written of his shock on finding anti-Semitic and fascist opinions in the diaries of [[Frege]], to whose work he had devoted such a high proportion of his professional career.<ref>Dummett, Michael, \"Preface to the first edition\" in ''Frege: Philosophy of Language, Second Edition'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 1981), p. xii.</ref>\n\nIn 1955\u20131956, while staying in [[Berkeley, California]], Dummett and his wife joined [[NAACP]]. In June 1956 he met with [[Martin Luther King]], who visited San Francisco, and heard from him of [[Alistair Cooke]] providing the British public with what King defined as \"biased and hostile reports\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and specifically of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Dummett travelled to Montgomery and wrote his own account. However, ''[[The Guardian]]'' refused to publish Dummett's article and his refutation of Cook's version of the Montgomery events, even in a shortened account as a Letter to the Editor; the ''[[BBC]]'', too, also refused to publish it.<ref>Michael Dummett, \"Montgomery (and A.

He also wrote a shorter overview of the theory of voting for the educated public.\n\n==Card games and tarot==\nDummett was a scholar in the field of [[card games|card-game]] history, with numerous books and articles to his credit. He was a founding member of the [[International Playing-Card Society]], in whose journal ''[[The Playing-Card]]'' he regularly published opinions, research and reviews of current literature on the subject; he was also a founder of the [[Accademia del Tarocchino Bolognese]] in [[Bologna]]. His historical work on the use of the tarot pack in [[card games]] \u2014 \"(t)he fortune telling and occult part of it has never been my principal interest...\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rudolf Farra and Maurice Salles |title=An Interview with Michael Dummett: From analytical philosophy to voting analysis and beyond |journal=Social Choice and Welfare |volume=27 |issue=2 |date=October 2006 |doi=10.1007/s00355-006-0128-9 |pages=347\u2013364|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/552/1/VPP05_01.pdf}}</ref> \u2014 ''The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City'', attempted to establish that the invention of Tarot could be set in 15th-century [[Italy]]. He laid the foundation for most of the subsequent research on the game of [[Tarot card games|tarot]], including exhaustive accounts of the rules of all hitherto known forms of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nDummett's analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown before the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that the middle of the 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. \"The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or than it has ever been since....\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=2004 |title=A History of Games Played With the Tarot Pack: The Game of Triumphs, Vol. 1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Dummett collaborated with [[Giordano Berti]] and Andrea Vitali on the project of a great Tarot exhibition at Castello Estense in Ferrara. On that occasion he wrote some texts for the catalogue of the exhibition.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=1987 |title=\"Sulle origini dei Tarocchi popolari\" and \"Tarocchi popolari e Tarocchi fantastici\", in Le carte di Corte.

He remained a practising Catholic thereafter. Throughout his career, Dummett published a number of articles on various issues then facing the Catholic Church, mainly in the English [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] journal ''New Blackfriars''. Dummett published an essay in the bulletin of the Adoremus Society on the subject of liturgy, and a philosophical essay defending the intelligibility of the Catholic Church's teaching on the [[Eucharist]].<ref>\"The Intelligibility of Eucharistic Doctrine\" in William J. Abraham and Steven W. Holzer, eds., ''The Rationality of Religious Belief: Essays in Honour of Basil Mitchell'', Clarendon Press, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn October 1987, one of his contributions to ''New Blackfriars'' sparked controversy, when he seemingly attacked currents of Catholic theology which appeared to him to diverge from orthodox Catholicism and to \"imply that, from the very earliest times, the Catholic Church, claiming to have a mission from God to safeguard divinely revealed truth, has taught and insisted on the acceptance of falsehoods.\" Dummett argued that \"the divergence which now obtains between what the Catholic Church purports to believe and what large or important sections of it in fact believe ought, in my view, to be tolerated no longer: not if there is to be a rationale for belonging to that Church; not if there is to be any hope of reunion with the other half of Christendom; not if the Catholic Church is not to be a laughing-stock in the eyes of the world.\" A debate in the journal over these remarks continued for months, attracting contributions from the theologian [[Nicholas Lash]] and the historian [[Eamon Duffy]], among others.<ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1741-2005/issues 1987 ''New Blackfriars'' '''68'''(809, 811).]</ref>\n\n==Later years and family==\nDummett retired in 1992 and was knighted in 1999 for \"services to philosophy and to racial justice\". He received the [[Lakatos Award]] in the philosophy of science in 1994.\n\nDummett died on 27 December 2011 aged 86, leaving his wife [[Ann Dummett|Ann]] (married in 1951, died in 2012) and three sons and two daughters.

He wrote on the history of [[analytic philosophy]], notably as an interpreter of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], and made original contributions particularly in [[philosophy of mathematics|the philosophies of mathematics]], [[philosophy of logic|logic]], [[philosophy of language|language]] and [[metaphysics]]. He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between [[philosophical realism|realism]] and [[anti-realism]], a term he helped to popularize. He devised the [[Quota Borda system]] of proportional voting, based on the [[Borda count]]. In [[mathematical logic]], he developed an [[intermediate logic]], already studied by [[Kurt Godel|Kurt G\u00f6del]]: the [[G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic]].\n\n==Education and army service==\nBorn 27 June 1925, Dummett was the son of George Herbert Dummett (1880\u20131970), a silk merchant, and Mabel Iris n\u00e9e Eardley-Wilmot (1893\u20131980).<ref>{{cite web |last1=ISAACSON |first1=DANIEL |last2=RUMFITT |first2=IAN |title=Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett |url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Memoirs_17-12%20Dummett.pdf |website=The British Academy |accessdate=31 May 2019}}</ref> He studied at [[Sandroyd School]] and was a First Scholar at [[Winchester College]], later winning a Major Scholarship to study History at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1943. He was called up that year and served, initially as a private in the [[Royal Artillery]] before joining the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] in India and Malaya. He was also awarded a fellowship to [[All Souls College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite ODNB |author=Daniel Isaacson |title=In Memoriam: Michael Dummett (1925\u20132011) |url=http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/news__events/older_news/in_memoriam_michael_dummett_1925\u20132011}}</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\nIn 1979, Dummett became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at Oxford, a post he held until retiring in 1992. During his term as Wykeham Professor, he held a Fellowship at [[New College, Oxford]]. He has also held teaching posts at [[Birmingham University]], [[UC Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Harvard University]]. He won the [[Schock Prize|Rolf Schock]] prize in 1995,<ref>[http://www.philosophy.su.se/english/research/2.26526 philosophy.su.se.]</ref> and was [[knight]]ed in 1999. He was the 2010 winner of the Lauener Prize for an Outstanding \u0152uvre in Analytical Philosophy.<ref>[http://lauener-foundation.ch/award.php Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Oeuvre in Analytical Philosophy].</ref>\n\nDuring his career at Oxford, Dummett supervised many philosophers who went on to distinguished careers, including [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|Adrian Moore]], [[Ian Rumfitt]], and [[Crispin Wright]].\n\n==Philosophical work<!--''Semantic realism (epistemology)'', ''Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)'' and ''Semantic antirealism (epistemology)'' redirect here-->==\nHis work on the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] has been acclaimed. His first book ''[[Frege: Philosophy of Language]]'' (1973), written over many years, is now regarded as a classic. The book was instrumental in the rediscovery of Frege's work, and influenced a generation of British philosophers.\n\nIn his 1963 paper \"Realism\", he popularised a controversial approach to understanding the historical dispute between [[philosophical realism|realist]] and other non-realist philosophy such as [[idealism]], [[nominalism]], [[Irrealism (philosophy)|Irrealism]].<ref>Originally a lecture to the Philosophical Society at Oxford in 1963, first published in 1978 in his book ''Truth and Other Enigmas''. See ''Truth and Other Enigmas'', p. ix.</ref> He classed all the latter as [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth. For Dummett, realism is best understood as '''semantic realism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, i. e., as the view accepting that every declarative sentence of one's language is [[bivalence|bivalent]] (determinately true or false) and [[evidence-transcendent]] (independent of our means of coming to know which),<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logicism/ Logicism and Neologicism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref><ref name=IEP/> while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#ReaTru Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).]</ref> Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as [[natural numbers]]), moral categories, the material world, or even thought. The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as at base, analogous to the dispute between [[Intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].\n\nFranzane Abella commented that Dummett was really interested not in understanding problems via classical logic but via intuitionistic logic, and Abella stated that \"such mathematical entities are more likely to be an ontological myth for Dummett... because truth cannot be unidentified via intuition, and of course it will fall on the notion of ''logical opaqueness'', which statements are not likely to be understood easily in the first place.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=Dummettian Truth |url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/epistclass/dummett.pdf |journal= |volume= |pages= |via=}}</ref> Franzane Abella further added that \"Dummett has an astounding influence when he brought forward the ''deep-order justificationist semantics''; this influenced the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]] and the classification of understanding via practices, whether the statement can be refuted or not based on its meaning.\" Abella summed up by saying that Dummett refuted the theory brought forward by realism about the cognisance of meaning. For example, the psychological change in our conceptions of meaning of any statements should be properly grasped, because if not, there exists an alteration and confusion of meaning, and of course a failure in grasping truth-values.\n\nDummett espoused '''semantic anti-realism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, a position suggesting that truth cannot serve as the central notion in the theory of meaning and must be replaced by [[Verificationism|verifiability]].<ref>Panu Raatikainen, [http://newprairiepress.org/biyclc/vol5/iss1/10/ \"The Semantic Realism/Anti-Realism Dispute and Knowledge of Meanings\"], ''The Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication'' '''5'''(1): 1\u201313. 2010.</ref> Semantic anti-realism is sometimes related to [[semantic inferentialism]].<ref>R. Ramanujam and Sundar Sarukkai (eds), ''Logic and Its Applications'', Springer, 2009, p. 260.</ref>\n\n==Activism==\nDummett was politically active, through his work as a campaigner against racism. He let his philosophical career stall in order to influence civil rights for minorities during what he saw as a crucial period of reform in the late 1960s. He also worked on the theory of voting, which led to his introduction of the [[Quota Borda system]].\n\nDummett drew heavily on his work in this area in writing his book ''On Immigration and Refugees'', an account of what justice demands of states in relationship to movement between states. Dummett, in that book, argues that the vast majority of opposition to immigration has been founded in racism and says that this has especially been so in the UK.\n\nHe has written of his shock on finding anti-Semitic and fascist opinions in the diaries of [[Frege]], to whose work he had devoted such a high proportion of his professional career.<ref>Dummett, Michael, \"Preface to the first edition\" in ''Frege: Philosophy of Language, Second Edition'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 1981), p. xii.</ref>\n\nIn 1955\u20131956, while staying in [[Berkeley, California]], Dummett and his wife joined [[NAACP]]. In June 1956 he met with [[Martin Luther King]], who visited San Francisco, and heard from him of [[Alistair Cooke]] providing the British public with what King defined as \"biased and hostile reports\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and specifically of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Dummett travelled to Montgomery and wrote his own account. However, ''[[The Guardian]]'' refused to publish Dummett's article and his refutation of Cook's version of the Montgomery events, even in a shortened account as a Letter to the Editor; the ''[[BBC]]'', too, also refused to publish it.<ref>Michael Dummett, \"Montgomery (and A.

He also wrote a shorter overview of the theory of voting for the educated public.\n\n==Card games and tarot==\nDummett was a scholar in the field of [[card games|card-game]] history, with numerous books and articles to his credit. He was a founding member of the [[International Playing-Card Society]], in whose journal ''[[The Playing-Card]]'' he regularly published opinions, research and reviews of current literature on the subject; he was also a founder of the [[Accademia del Tarocchino Bolognese]] in [[Bologna]]. His historical work on the use of the tarot pack in [[card games]] \u2014 \"(t)he fortune telling and occult part of it has never been my principal interest...\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rudolf Farra and Maurice Salles |title=An Interview with Michael Dummett: From analytical philosophy to voting analysis and beyond |journal=Social Choice and Welfare |volume=27 |issue=2 |date=October 2006 |doi=10.1007/s00355-006-0128-9 |pages=347\u2013364|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/552/1/VPP05_01.pdf}}</ref> \u2014 ''The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City'', attempted to establish that the invention of Tarot could be set in 15th-century [[Italy]]. He laid the foundation for most of the subsequent research on the game of [[Tarot card games|tarot]], including exhaustive accounts of the rules of all hitherto known forms of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nDummett's analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown before the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that the middle of the 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. \"The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or than it has ever been since....\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=2004 |title=A History of Games Played With the Tarot Pack: The Game of Triumphs, Vol. 1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Dummett collaborated with [[Giordano Berti]] and Andrea Vitali on the project of a great Tarot exhibition at Castello Estense in Ferrara. On that occasion he wrote some texts for the catalogue of the exhibition.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |year=1987 |title=\"Sulle origini dei Tarocchi popolari\" and \"Tarocchi popolari e Tarocchi fantastici\", in Le carte di Corte.

He remained a practising Catholic thereafter. Throughout his career, Dummett published a number of articles on various issues then facing the Catholic Church, mainly in the English [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] journal ''New Blackfriars''. Dummett published an essay in the bulletin of the Adoremus Society on the subject of liturgy, and a philosophical essay defending the intelligibility of the Catholic Church's teaching on the [[Eucharist]].<ref>\"The Intelligibility of Eucharistic Doctrine\" in William J. Abraham and Steven W.

In the same year, he composed music for the theatre show ''Il Lieto Fine'' by [[Luciano Salce]].\n\nThe 1960s began on a positive note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's ''[[The Fascist|Il Federale (The Fascist)]]''. In an interview with American composer [[Fred Karlin]], Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, ''My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors''.<ref name=\"Biography of Ennio Morricone\">{{cite web|url=http://ennio-morricone.com/#/biography.html|title= Biography of Ennio Morricone|publisher=ennio-morricone.com |date= |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Il Federale'' marked the beginning of a long-run collaboration with Luciano Salce.

The Rome-based avant-garde ensemble was dedicated to the development of [[improvisation]] and new music methods. The ensemble functioned as a laboratory of sorts, working with anti-musical systems and sound techniques in an attempt to redefine the new music ensemble and explore \"New Consonance.\"<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gruppo-di-improvvisazione-nuova-consonanza-mn0001409455 Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza], biography, Allmusic, Sylvie Harrison.

Perhaps the most famous of these is their album entitled ''The Feed-back'', which combines [[free jazz]] and avant-garde classical music with [[funk]]; the album is frequently sampled by [[hip hop]] DJs and is considered to be one of the most collectable records in existence, often fetching over $1,000 at auction.<ref>Alvin Lucia, liner notes, ''Niente''.

The ensemble's groundbreaking work informed their work in composition. The ensemble also performed in varying capacities with Morricone, contributing to some of his '60s and '70s Italian soundtracks, including ''[[A Quiet Place in the Country]]'' (1969) and ''[[Cold Eyes of Fear]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz2dxDNaEDgC&pg=PA267#v=onepage&q=Gruppo%20di%20Improvvisazione%20Morricone |title=''Film And Television Scores, 1950\u20131979: A Critical Survey by Genre'', Kristopher Spencer, McFarland, September 9, 2008 |publisher=Books.google.be |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Film music genres===\n\n==== Comedy ====\n\nHis earliest scores were Italian light comedy and costume pictures, where Morricone learned to write simple, memorable themes. During the sixties and seventies he composed the scores for comedies such as ''[[Eighteen in the Sun|Diciottenni al sole]]'' (1962), ''[[Il Successo]]'' (1963), [[Lina Wertm\u00fcller]]'s ''[[I basilischi]]'' (1963),<ref name=\"Biography of Ennio Morricone\"/> ''[[Slalom (film)|Slalom]]'' (1965), ''[[Menage all'italiana]]'' (1965), ''[[How I Learned to Love Women]]'' (1966), ''[[Her Harem|L'harem]]'' (1967), ''[[A Fine Pair]]'' (1968), ''[[Alibi (1969 film)|L'Alibi]]'' (1969), ''[[This Kind of Love (film)|Questa specie d'amore]]'' (1972), ''[[Winged Devils|Forza \"G\"]]'' (1972) and ''[[Fiorina la vacca]]'' (1972).\n\nHis best-known scores for comedies includes ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1978) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles II]]'' (1980), both directed by [[\u00c9douard Molinaro]], ''[[Il ladrone]]'' (1980), [[Georges Lautner]]'s ''[[La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding]]'' (1985), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]'s ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'' (1990) and Warren Beatty's ''Bulworth'' (1998). Morricone has never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy ''Tutte le Donne della mia Vita'' by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series ''Il Papa Buono''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Nick Vivarelli International Correspondent @NickVivarelli |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/morricone-i-can-do-anything-1117959621/ |title=Morricone: 'I can do anything' |magazine=Variety.com |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Westerns ====\nThough his first films were undistinguished, Morricone's arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone had already composed some music for less-known western movies such as ''[[Duello nel Texas]]'' (aka ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger [[Peter Tevis]], who is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's songs such as \"A Gringo Like Me\" (from ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') and \"Lonesome Billy\" (from ''Bullets Don't Argue'').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Tjh55dlDUC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=morricone%20first%20western%20films Christopher Frayling, ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone''], I. B. Tauris, 2 April 2006.</ref>\n\n===== Association with Sergio Leone =====\n\nThe turning point in Morricone's career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, [[Andrea Morricone]], who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's [[Spaghetti Western|different version]] of the [[Western (genre)|Western]], ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964).\n\n'''The ''Dollars'' trilogy'''\n{{main|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (soundtrack)}}\n\nBecause budget strictures limited Morricone's access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, [[jew's harp]], trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards \u00e0 la [[John Ford]]. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action\u2014cluing in the audience to the [[silence|taciturn]] man's ironic stance. Though sonically bizarre for a movie score, Morricone's music was [[wikt:viscerally|viscerally]] true to Leone's vision.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Ennio_Morricone-The_Good,_The_Bad_And_The_Ugly.ogg\n|title=The Good, The Bad and The Ugly main theme\n|description=From [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] film score\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nAs memorable as Leone's [[close-up]]s, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone's work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Morricone was initially billed on the film as Dan Savio. ''A Fistful of Dollars'' came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularizing the so-called [[Spaghetti Western]] genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone decided to adopt American-sounding names, so they called themselves respectively Bob Robertson and Dan Savio. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point.<ref name=\"Hughes7\">Hughes, p. 7.</ref> The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed {{USD|4.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} for the year.<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> It eventually grossed $14.5&nbsp;million in its American release,<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> against its budget of {{USD}}200\u2013250,000.<ref name=\"Hughes4\">Hughes, p. 4.</ref><ref name=\"Munn48\">Munn, p. 48.</ref>\n\nWith the score of ''A Fistful of Dollars'', Morricone began his 20-year collaboration with his childhood friend [[Alessandro Alessandroni]] and his Cantori Moderni.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Ennio-Morricone-Bianco-Rosso-E-Morricone-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtracks-From-Un-Sacco-Bello-Bia/release/3609543 Ennio Morricone Bianco, Rosso E Morricone \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtracks From \"Un Sacco Bello\" & \"Bianco, Rosso E Verdone\"], retrieved 28 January 2013</ref> Alessandroni provided the whistling and the twanging guitar on the film scores, while his Cantori Moderni were a flexible troupe of modern singers. Morricone specifically exploited the solo [[soprano]] of the group, [[Edda Dell'Orso]], at the height of her powers \"an extraordinary voice at my disposal\".\n\nThe composer subsequently scored Leone's other two ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (or ''[[Man with No Name|Man With No Name Trilogy]]'') spaghetti westerns: ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965) and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966). All three films starred the American actor [[Clint Eastwood]] as ''The Man With No Name'' and depicted Leone's own intense vision of the mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.\n\nDespite the small film budgets, the ''Dollars Trilogy'' was a box-office success. The available budget for ''The Good, the Bad and The Ugly'' was about {{USD}}1.2&nbsp;million, but it became the most successful film of the ''Dollars Trilogy'', grossing {{USD}}25.1&nbsp;million in the United States and over 2,3&nbsp;billion [[Italian lira|lire]] (1,2&nbsp;million EUR) in Italy alone. Morricone's score became a major success and sold over three million copies worldwide, earning him over 200 million dollars. On 14 August 1968 the original score was certified by the [[RIAA]] with a golden record for the sale of 500,000 copies in the United States only.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database RIAA, Gold and Platinum \u2013 The Good, the Bad & the Ugly], Retrieved 24 January 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331234333/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |date=31 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe main theme of ''For a Few Dollars More'' (\"[[For a Few Dollars More#Music|Per Qualche Dollaro in Pi\u00f9]]\") was covered by [[Hugo Montenegro]] (\"For a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Hugo Montenegro And His Orchestra \u2013 Music From 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'For A Few Dollars More' & 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'|url = http://www.discogs.com/Hugo-Montenegro-And-His-Orchestra-Music-From-A-Fistful-Of-Dollars-For-A-Few-Dollars-More-The-GoodBad/master/107581|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]] (\"Theme From a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Babe Ruth \u2013 Wells Fargo / Theme From \"For A Few Dollars More\"|url = http://www.discogs.com/Babe-Ruth-Wells-Fargo-Theme-From-For-A-Few-Dollars-More/release/3355344|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> [[The Golden Palominos|Golden Palominos]] (\"For A Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Golden Palominos, The \u2013 Omaha|url = http://www.discogs.com/Golden-Palominos-Omaha/release/835660|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> [[Material (band)|Material]] (\"For a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Material \u2013 For A Few Dollars More|url = http://www.discogs.com/Material-For-A-Few-Dollars-More/master/9753|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> and Matti Heinivaho (\"Arosusi\").<ref>{{cite web|title = Matti Heinivaho \u2013 Arosusi / Tarzan|url = http://www.discogs.com/Matti-Heinivaho-Arosusi-Tarzan/release/2442322|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> More recently, a [[Techno-Industrial]] cover was done by [[Sebastian Komor#as Komor Kommando|Komor Kommando]] (\"Hasta Luego\").

Before his death in 1989, Leone was part-way through planning a film on the [[Siege of Leningrad]], set during World War II. By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire {{USD}}100&nbsp;million in financing from independent backers for the war epic. He had convinced Morricone to compose the film score. The project was canceled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film. In early 2003, Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore announced he would direct a film called ''Leningrad''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tandemnews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=3204 | title=Tornatore wants Kidman for Leningrad Oscar-winning Italian director to make World War II movie about Nazi attack of Russia | accessdate=10 January 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015636/http://tandemnews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=3204 | archivedate=11 March 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The film has yet to go into production and Morricone has been cagey thus far as to details on account of Tornatore's superstitious nature.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/ennio-morricone-discusses-85th-anniversary-before-moscow-concert/489297.html |title=Aliide Naylor, Ennio Morricone Discusses 85th Anniversary Before Moscow Concert |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> {{as of|2018}}, no further details about this film have been released.\n\n==== Association with Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima ====\n\nTwo years after the start of his collaboration with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, [[Sergio Corbucci]]. The composer wrote music for Corbucci's ''[[Navajo Joe]]'' (1966), ''[[The Hellbenders]]'' (1967), ''[[The Mercenary (film)|The Mercenary/The Professional Gun]]'' (1968), ''[[The Great Silence]]'' (1968), ''[[Compa\u00f1eros]]'' (1970), ''[[Sonny and Jed]]'' (1972) and ''[[What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution?]]'' (1972).\n\nIn addition, Morricone composed music for the western films by [[Sergio Sollima]], ''The Big Gundown'' (with [[Lee Van Cleef]], 1966), ''[[Face to Face (1967 film)|Face to Face]]'' (1967) and ''[[Run, Man, Run]]'' (1968), as well as the 1970 crime thriller ''[[Citt\u00e0 violenta|Violent City]]'' (with [[Charles Bronson]]) and the [[Poliziotteschi|poliziottesco]] film ''[[Revolver (1973 film)|Revolver]]'' (1973).\n\n==== Other westerns ====\nOther relevant scores for less popular Spaghetti Westerns include ''[[Duello nel Texas]]'' (1963), ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le pistole non-discutono|it}}'' (1964), ''[[A Pistol for Ringo]]'' (1965), ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' (1965), ''[[Seven Guns for the MacGregors]]'' (1966), ''[[The Hills Run Red (1966 film)|The Hills Run Red]]'' (1966), [[Giulio Petroni]]'s ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'' (1967) and ''[[Tepepa]]'' (1968), ''[[A Bullet for the General]]'' (1967), ''[[Guns for San Sebastian]]'' (with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], 1968), ''[[A Sky Full of Stars for a Roof]]'' (1968), ''[[The Five Man Army]]'' (1969), [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), ''[[Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?]]'' (1972) and ''[[Buddy Goes West]]'' (1981).\n\n====Dramas and political movies====\nWith Leone's films, Ennio Morricone's name had been put firmly on the map. Most of Morricone's film scores of the 1960s were composed outside the Spaghetti Western genre, while still using Alessandroni's team. Their music included the themes for ''Il Malamondo'' (1964), ''Slalom'' (1965) and ''Listen, Let's Make Love'' (1967). In 1968, Morricone reduced his work outside the movie business and wrote scores for 20 films in the same year. The scores included psychedelic accompaniment for [[Mario Bava]]'s superhero romp ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'' (1968).\n\n[[File:Ennio Morricone Cannes 2007.jpg|Morricone in 2007|thumb|150px]]\nHis talent and creativity were such that many other directors were soon keen to collaborate with him, and in the next few years Morricone scored a lot of films by politically committed directors: collaborating with [[Marco Bellocchio]] (''[[Fists in the Pocket]]'', 1965), [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] (''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' (1966) and ''[[Burn! (1969 film)|Queimada!]]'' (1969) with [[Marlon Brando]]), [[Roberto Faenza]] (H2S, 1968), Giuliano Montaldo (''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'', 1971), [[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]] (''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore (film)|'Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'', 1971), Mauro Bolognini (''[[Drama of the Rich]]'', 1974), [[Umberto Lenzi]] (''[[Almost Human (1974 film)|Almost Human]]'', 1974), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', 1975), Bernardo Bertolucci (''[[1900 (film)|Novecento]]'', 1976) and [[Tinto Brass]] (''[[The Key (1983 film)|The Key]]'', 1983).\n\nIn 1970, Morricone wrote the score for ''Violent City''. That same year, he received his first [[Nastro d'Argento]] for the music in ''[[Metti, una sera a cena]]'' ([[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]], 1969) and his second only a year later for ''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'' (Giuliano Montaldo, 1971), in which he had made a memorable collaboration with the legendary American folk singer and activist [[Joan Baez]]. His soundtrack for ''Sacco e Vanzetti'' contains another well-known composition by Morricone, the folk song \"[[Here's to You (song)|Here's to You]]\", sung by [[Joan Baez]]. For the writing of the lyrics, Baez was inspired by a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti: ''\"Father, yes, I am a prisoner / Fear not to relay my crime\"''. The song became a hit in several countries, selling over 790,000 copies in France only.<ref>[http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=150 Les Meilleures Ventes Tout Temps de 45 T. singles, Here's to You sales in France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202155511/http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=150 |date=2 December 2008 }}, Infodisc, Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> The song was later included in movies such as ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''<ref>[http://musicbrainz.org/release/29d93150-709d-4aaa-8b16-0b3b0913885d The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Soundtrack Tracklist].

The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=days%20of%20heaven%20terrence%20malick%20ennio%20morricone ''Ennio Morricone's The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: A Film Score Guide''], Charles Leinberger, Scarecrow Press, 1 September 2004</ref>\n\nOne of Morricone's first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' by [[John Huston]]. According to Sergio Miceli's book ''Morricone, la musica, il cinema'', Morricone wrote about 15 or 16&nbsp;minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by [[Franco Ferrara]]. At first Morricone's teacher [[Goffredo Petrassi]] had been engaged to write the score for the great big budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. [[RCA Records]] then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film's producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have the exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone's work was rejected because he did not get the ok by RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for ''The Bible: In the Beginning'' in such films as ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' (1965) by [[Duccio Tessari]] and Alberto Negrin's ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987).\n\nMorricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that the composer has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.<ref>[http://thequietus.com/articles/04050-ennio-morricone-interview-a-fistful-of-dollars-for-a-few-dollars-more-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-the-thing Ennio Morricone Interviewed: John Doran, \"Compared To Bach, I'm Practically Unemployed\"], Quietus interview, 8 April 2010.</ref>\n\n====1970\u20131985: from ''Two Mules'' to ''Red Sonja''====\n\nIn 1970, Morricone composed the music for [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', an American-Mexican western film starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] and Clint Eastwood.

Katzin]], and the following year he scored the [[George Kennedy]] revenge thriller ''[[The \"Human\" Factor (1975 film)|The \"Human\" Factor]]'', which was the final film of director [[Edward Dmytryk]]. Two years later he composed the score for the sequel to [[William Friedkin]]'s 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[John Boorman]]: ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''. The horror film was a major disappointment at the box office. The film grossed {{USD}}30,749,142 in the United States,<ref name=\"mojo_2\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=exorcist2.htm |title=Box Office Information for ''Exorcist II: The Heretic'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> turning a profit but still disappointing in comparison to the original film's gross. The same year he scored the [[Dino De Laurentiis]] produced adventure film ''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'', starring [[Richard Harris]], which was also only a minor hit but later developed a cult following.\n\nIn 1978, the composer worked with [[Terrence Malick]] for ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', starring [[Richard Gere]]. During the lengthy editing process of the romantic drama, which won an [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] with an additional three nominations for the score, Terrence Malick and Billy Weber made use of a temporary score dominated by Morricone's music for the Bernardo Bertolucci film ''Novecento''. Malick also chose the ethereal Aquarium music from [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (\"[[The Carnival of the Animals]]\") to frame the film. When Malick decided he wanted Morricone to score his movie, the director sent a version of it to Italy with the Novecento temp track in place. Morricone agreed to the assignment and Malick flew to Italy because the composer did not fly, so would not travel to the United States.

In 2002, the [[director's cut]] 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as ''Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'').\n\nAfter the success of ''Cinema Paradiso'', the composer wrote the music for all subsequent films by Tornatore: the drama film ''[[Everybody's Fine (1990 film)|Everybody's Fine]]'' (Stanno Tutti Bene, 1990), ''[[A Pure Formality]]'' (1994) starring [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] and Roman Polanski, ''[[The Star Maker (1995 film)|The Star Maker]]'' (1995), ''[[The Legend of 1900]]'' (1998) starring [[Tim Roth]], the 2000 romantic drama ''[[Mal\u00e8na (soundtrack)|Mal\u00e8na]]'' (which featured [[Monica Bellucci]]) and the psychological thriller mystery film ''[[La sconosciuta]]'' (2006).\n\nMore recently, Morricone composed the scores for ''[[Baar\u00eca (film)|Baar\u00eca]]'' (2009), ''[[The Best Offer]]'' (2013) starring [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Jim Sturgess]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] and the romantic drama ''[[The Correspondence]]'' (2015) starring [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]].\n\nThe composer won several music awards for his scores to Tornatore's movies. So, Morricone received a fifth Academy Award nomination and a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for ''Mal\u00e8na''. For ''Legend of 1900'', he won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n=== Television series and recent works ===\nMorricone has worked for television, from a single title piece to variety shows and documentaries to TV series, including ''[[Moses the Lawgiver]]'' (1974), ''[[The Life and Times of David Lloyd George]]'' (1981), ''[[Marco Polo (miniseries)|Marco Polo]]'' (1982) (which won two Primetime Emmys), ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987), ''[[The Endless Game]]'' (1989), ''[[The Betrothed (miniseries)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' and ''[[Nostromo]]'' (1996).\n\nHe wrote the score for [[the Mafia]] television series ''[[La piovra]]'' seasons 2 to 10 from 1985 to 2001, including the themes \"Droga e sangue\" (\"Drugs and Blood\"), \"La Morale\", and \"L'Immorale\". Morricone worked as the conductor of seasons 3 to 5 of the series. He also worked as the music supervisor for the television project ''La bibbia'' (\"The Bible\").\n\nIn the late 1990s, he collaborated with his son Andrea on the ''Ultimo'' crime dramas, resulting in ''Ultimo'' (1998), ''Ultimo 2 \u2013 La sfida'' (1999), ''Ultimo 3 \u2013 L'infiltrato'' (2004) and ''Ultimo 4 \u2013 L'occhio del falco'' (2013).\n\nIn the 2000s, Morricone continued to compose music for successful television series such as ''[[Il Cuore nel Pozzo]]'' (2005), ''[[Karol: A Man Who Became Pope]]'' (2005), ''La provinciale'' (2006), ''[[Giovanni Falcone]]'' (2007), ''Pane e libert\u00e0'' (2009) and ''Come Un Delfino 1\u20132'' (2011\u20132013).\n\nWith an estimated 13 million viewers, ''[[Karol: A Man Who Became Pope]]'' became an incredible success. Morricone wrote additional music for the sequel, ''[[Karol: The Pope, The Man]]'' (2006), which portrayed Karol's life as Pope from his [[papal inauguration]] to his death. Both scores were originally released respectively in 2005 and 2006. One year later, a double disc album with both scores is released.\n\nIn 2003, Morricone scored another epic, for Japanese television, called ''Musashi'' and was the [[Taiga drama]] about [[Miyamoto Musashi]], Japan's legendary [[warrior]]. A part of his \"applied music\" is now applied to Italian television films.\n\nMorricone provided the string arrangements on Morrissey's \"Dear God Please Help Me\" from the album ''[[Ringleader of the Tormentors]]'' in 2006.<ref>Goddard, S.

He occasionally adopted Anglicized pseudonyms, such as '''Dan Savio''' and '''Leo Nichols'''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elcorreo.com/butaca/cine/morricone-cuelga-batuta-20190108124758-ntrc.html |title=Morricone cuelga la batuta |first=Oskar |last=Belategui |date=8 January 2019 |access-date=13 June 2019 |newspaper=[[El Correo]] |language=es |publisher=[[Vocento]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Morricone was the conductor (and uncredited co-composer) for [[Mario Nascimbene]]'s score to ''Morte Di Un Amico'' (Death of a Friend), an Italian drama directed by [[Franco Rossi (director)|Franco Rossi]]. In the same year, he composed music for the theatre show ''Il Lieto Fine'' by [[Luciano Salce]].\n\nThe 1960s began on a positive note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's ''[[The Fascist|Il Federale (The Fascist)]]''. In an interview with American composer [[Fred Karlin]], Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, ''My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors''.<ref name=\"Biography of Ennio Morricone\">{{cite web|url=http://ennio-morricone.com/#/biography.html|title= Biography of Ennio Morricone|publisher=ennio-morricone.com |date= |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Il Federale'' marked the beginning of a long-run collaboration with Luciano Salce. In 1962 Morricone composed the jazz-influenced score for Salce's comedy ''[[Crazy Desire|La voglia matta (Crazy Desire)]]''.

A few of these compositions have been made available on CD, such as \"Ut\", his trumpet concerto dedicated to the soloist [[Mauro Maur]], one of his favorite musicians; some have yet to be premiered.\n\n===The Group and New Consonance===\n\nFrom 1964 up to their eventual disbandment in 1980, he was part of ''[[Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza]]'' (G.I.N.C.), a group of composers who performed and recorded [[avant-garde]] free improvisations. The Rome-based avant-garde ensemble was dedicated to the development of [[improvisation]] and new music methods. The ensemble functioned as a laboratory of sorts, working with anti-musical systems and sound techniques in an attempt to redefine the new music ensemble and explore \"New Consonance.\"<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gruppo-di-improvvisazione-nuova-consonanza-mn0001409455 Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza], biography, Allmusic, Sylvie Harrison.

Perhaps the most famous of these is their album entitled ''The Feed-back'', which combines [[free jazz]] and avant-garde classical music with [[funk]]; the album is frequently sampled by [[hip hop]] DJs and is considered to be one of the most collectable records in existence, often fetching over $1,000 at auction.<ref>Alvin Lucia, liner notes, ''Niente''.

The ensemble's groundbreaking work informed their work in composition. The ensemble also performed in varying capacities with Morricone, contributing to some of his '60s and '70s Italian soundtracks, including ''[[A Quiet Place in the Country]]'' (1969) and ''[[Cold Eyes of Fear]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz2dxDNaEDgC&pg=PA267#v=onepage&q=Gruppo%20di%20Improvvisazione%20Morricone |title=''Film And Television Scores, 1950\u20131979: A Critical Survey by Genre'', Kristopher Spencer, McFarland, September 9, 2008 |publisher=Books.google.be |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Film music genres===\n\n==== Comedy ====\n\nHis earliest scores were Italian light comedy and costume pictures, where Morricone learned to write simple, memorable themes. During the sixties and seventies he composed the scores for comedies such as ''[[Eighteen in the Sun|Diciottenni al sole]]'' (1962), ''[[Il Successo]]'' (1963), [[Lina Wertm\u00fcller]]'s ''[[I basilischi]]'' (1963),<ref name=\"Biography of Ennio Morricone\"/> ''[[Slalom (film)|Slalom]]'' (1965), ''[[Menage all'italiana]]'' (1965), ''[[How I Learned to Love Women]]'' (1966), ''[[Her Harem|L'harem]]'' (1967), ''[[A Fine Pair]]'' (1968), ''[[Alibi (1969 film)|L'Alibi]]'' (1969), ''[[This Kind of Love (film)|Questa specie d'amore]]'' (1972), ''[[Winged Devils|Forza \"G\"]]'' (1972) and ''[[Fiorina la vacca]]'' (1972).\n\nHis best-known scores for comedies includes ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1978) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles II]]'' (1980), both directed by [[\u00c9douard Molinaro]], ''[[Il ladrone]]'' (1980), [[Georges Lautner]]'s ''[[La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding]]'' (1985), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]'s ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'' (1990) and Warren Beatty's ''Bulworth'' (1998). Morricone has never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy ''Tutte le Donne della mia Vita'' by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series ''Il Papa Buono''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Nick Vivarelli International Correspondent @NickVivarelli |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/morricone-i-can-do-anything-1117959621/ |title=Morricone: 'I can do anything' |magazine=Variety.com |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Westerns ====\nThough his first films were undistinguished, Morricone's arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone had already composed some music for less-known western movies such as ''[[Duello nel Texas]]'' (aka ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger [[Peter Tevis]], who is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's songs such as \"A Gringo Like Me\" (from ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') and \"Lonesome Billy\" (from ''Bullets Don't Argue'').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Tjh55dlDUC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=morricone%20first%20western%20films Christopher Frayling, ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone''], I. B. Tauris, 2 April 2006.</ref>\n\n===== Association with Sergio Leone =====\n\nThe turning point in Morricone's career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, [[Andrea Morricone]], who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's [[Spaghetti Western|different version]] of the [[Western (genre)|Western]], ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964).\n\n'''The ''Dollars'' trilogy'''\n{{main|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (soundtrack)}}\n\nBecause budget strictures limited Morricone's access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, [[jew's harp]], trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards \u00e0 la [[John Ford]]. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action\u2014cluing in the audience to the [[silence|taciturn]] man's ironic stance. Though sonically bizarre for a movie score, Morricone's music was [[wikt:viscerally|viscerally]] true to Leone's vision.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Ennio_Morricone-The_Good,_The_Bad_And_The_Ugly.ogg\n|title=The Good, The Bad and The Ugly main theme\n|description=From [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] film score\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nAs memorable as Leone's [[close-up]]s, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone's work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Morricone was initially billed on the film as Dan Savio. ''A Fistful of Dollars'' came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularizing the so-called [[Spaghetti Western]] genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone decided to adopt American-sounding names, so they called themselves respectively Bob Robertson and Dan Savio. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point.<ref name=\"Hughes7\">Hughes, p. 7.</ref> The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed {{USD|4.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} for the year.<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> It eventually grossed $14.5&nbsp;million in its American release,<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> against its budget of {{USD}}200\u2013250,000.<ref name=\"Hughes4\">Hughes, p. 4.</ref><ref name=\"Munn48\">Munn, p. 48.</ref>\n\nWith the score of ''A Fistful of Dollars'', Morricone began his 20-year collaboration with his childhood friend [[Alessandro Alessandroni]] and his Cantori Moderni.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Ennio-Morricone-Bianco-Rosso-E-Morricone-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtracks-From-Un-Sacco-Bello-Bia/release/3609543 Ennio Morricone Bianco, Rosso E Morricone \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtracks From \"Un Sacco Bello\" & \"Bianco, Rosso E Verdone\"], retrieved 28 January 2013</ref> Alessandroni provided the whistling and the twanging guitar on the film scores, while his Cantori Moderni were a flexible troupe of modern singers. Morricone specifically exploited the solo [[soprano]] of the group, [[Edda Dell'Orso]], at the height of her powers \"an extraordinary voice at my disposal\".\n\nThe composer subsequently scored Leone's other two ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (or ''[[Man with No Name|Man With No Name Trilogy]]'') spaghetti westerns: ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965) and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966). All three films starred the American actor [[Clint Eastwood]] as ''The Man With No Name'' and depicted Leone's own intense vision of the mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.\n\nDespite the small film budgets, the ''Dollars Trilogy'' was a box-office success. The available budget for ''The Good, the Bad and The Ugly'' was about {{USD}}1.2&nbsp;million, but it became the most successful film of the ''Dollars Trilogy'', grossing {{USD}}25.1&nbsp;million in the United States and over 2,3&nbsp;billion [[Italian lira|lire]] (1,2&nbsp;million EUR) in Italy alone. Morricone's score became a major success and sold over three million copies worldwide, earning him over 200 million dollars. On 14 August 1968 the original score was certified by the [[RIAA]] with a golden record for the sale of 500,000 copies in the United States only.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database RIAA, Gold and Platinum \u2013 The Good, the Bad & the Ugly], Retrieved 24 January 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331234333/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |date=31 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe main theme of ''For a Few Dollars More'' (\"[[For a Few Dollars More#Music|Per Qualche Dollaro in Pi\u00f9]]\") was covered by [[Hugo Montenegro]] (\"For a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Hugo Montenegro And His Orchestra \u2013 Music From 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'For A Few Dollars More' & 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'|url = http://www.discogs.com/Hugo-Montenegro-And-His-Orchestra-Music-From-A-Fistful-Of-Dollars-For-A-Few-Dollars-More-The-GoodBad/master/107581|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]] (\"Theme From a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Babe Ruth \u2013 Wells Fargo / Theme From \"For A Few Dollars More\"|url = http://www.discogs.com/Babe-Ruth-Wells-Fargo-Theme-From-For-A-Few-Dollars-More/release/3355344|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> [[The Golden Palominos|Golden Palominos]] (\"For A Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Golden Palominos, The \u2013 Omaha|url = http://www.discogs.com/Golden-Palominos-Omaha/release/835660|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> [[Material (band)|Material]] (\"For a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Material \u2013 For A Few Dollars More|url = http://www.discogs.com/Material-For-A-Few-Dollars-More/master/9753|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> and Matti Heinivaho (\"Arosusi\").<ref>{{cite web|title = Matti Heinivaho \u2013 Arosusi / Tarzan|url = http://www.discogs.com/Matti-Heinivaho-Arosusi-Tarzan/release/2442322|website = Discogs|accessdate = 1 June 2015}}</ref> More recently, a [[Techno-Industrial]] cover was done by [[Sebastian Komor#as Komor Kommando|Komor Kommando]] (\"Hasta Luego\").

In early 2003, Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore announced he would direct a film called ''Leningrad''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tandemnews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=3204 | title=Tornatore wants Kidman for Leningrad Oscar-winning Italian director to make World War II movie about Nazi attack of Russia | accessdate=10 January 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015636/http://tandemnews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=3204 | archivedate=11 March 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The film has yet to go into production and Morricone has been cagey thus far as to details on account of Tornatore's superstitious nature.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/ennio-morricone-discusses-85th-anniversary-before-moscow-concert/489297.html |title=Aliide Naylor, Ennio Morricone Discusses 85th Anniversary Before Moscow Concert |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> {{as of|2018}}, no further details about this film have been released.\n\n==== Association with Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima ====\n\nTwo years after the start of his collaboration with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, [[Sergio Corbucci]]. The composer wrote music for Corbucci's ''[[Navajo Joe]]'' (1966), ''[[The Hellbenders]]'' (1967), ''[[The Mercenary (film)|The Mercenary/The Professional Gun]]'' (1968), ''[[The Great Silence]]'' (1968), ''[[Compa\u00f1eros]]'' (1970), ''[[Sonny and Jed]]'' (1972) and ''[[What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution?]]'' (1972).\n\nIn addition, Morricone composed music for the western films by [[Sergio Sollima]], ''The Big Gundown'' (with [[Lee Van Cleef]], 1966), ''[[Face to Face (1967 film)|Face to Face]]'' (1967) and ''[[Run, Man, Run]]'' (1968), as well as the 1970 crime thriller ''[[Citt\u00e0 violenta|Violent City]]'' (with [[Charles Bronson]]) and the [[Poliziotteschi|poliziottesco]] film ''[[Revolver (1973 film)|Revolver]]'' (1973).\n\n==== Other westerns ====\nOther relevant scores for less popular Spaghetti Westerns include ''[[Duello nel Texas]]'' (1963), ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le pistole non-discutono|it}}'' (1964), ''[[A Pistol for Ringo]]'' (1965), ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' (1965), ''[[Seven Guns for the MacGregors]]'' (1966), ''[[The Hills Run Red (1966 film)|The Hills Run Red]]'' (1966), [[Giulio Petroni]]'s ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'' (1967) and ''[[Tepepa]]'' (1968), ''[[A Bullet for the General]]'' (1967), ''[[Guns for San Sebastian]]'' (with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], 1968), ''[[A Sky Full of Stars for a Roof]]'' (1968), ''[[The Five Man Army]]'' (1969), [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), ''[[Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?]]'' (1972) and ''[[Buddy Goes West]]'' (1981).\n\n====Dramas and political movies====\nWith Leone's films, Ennio Morricone's name had been put firmly on the map. Most of Morricone's film scores of the 1960s were composed outside the Spaghetti Western genre, while still using Alessandroni's team. Their music included the themes for ''Il Malamondo'' (1964), ''Slalom'' (1965) and ''Listen, Let's Make Love'' (1967). In 1968, Morricone reduced his work outside the movie business and wrote scores for 20 films in the same year. The scores included psychedelic accompaniment for [[Mario Bava]]'s superhero romp ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'' (1968).\n\n[[File:Ennio Morricone Cannes 2007.jpg|Morricone in 2007|thumb|150px]]\nHis talent and creativity were such that many other directors were soon keen to collaborate with him, and in the next few years Morricone scored a lot of films by politically committed directors: collaborating with [[Marco Bellocchio]] (''[[Fists in the Pocket]]'', 1965), [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] (''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' (1966) and ''[[Burn! (1969 film)|Queimada!]]'' (1969) with [[Marlon Brando]]), [[Roberto Faenza]] (H2S, 1968), Giuliano Montaldo (''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'', 1971), [[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]] (''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore (film)|'Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'', 1971), Mauro Bolognini (''[[Drama of the Rich]]'', 1974), [[Umberto Lenzi]] (''[[Almost Human (1974 film)|Almost Human]]'', 1974), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', 1975), Bernardo Bertolucci (''[[1900 (film)|Novecento]]'', 1976) and [[Tinto Brass]] (''[[The Key (1983 film)|The Key]]'', 1983).\n\nIn 1970, Morricone wrote the score for ''Violent City''. That same year, he received his first [[Nastro d'Argento]] for the music in ''[[Metti, una sera a cena]]'' ([[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]], 1969) and his second only a year later for ''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'' (Giuliano Montaldo, 1971), in which he had made a memorable collaboration with the legendary American folk singer and activist [[Joan Baez]]. His soundtrack for ''Sacco e Vanzetti'' contains another well-known composition by Morricone, the folk song \"[[Here's to You (song)|Here's to You]]\", sung by [[Joan Baez]]. For the writing of the lyrics, Baez was inspired by a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti: ''\"Father, yes, I am a prisoner / Fear not to relay my crime\"''. The song became a hit in several countries, selling over 790,000 copies in France only.<ref>[http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=150 Les Meilleures Ventes Tout Temps de 45 T. singles, Here's to You sales in France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202155511/http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=150 |date=2 December 2008 }}, Infodisc, Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> The song was later included in movies such as ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''<ref>[http://musicbrainz.org/release/29d93150-709d-4aaa-8b16-0b3b0913885d The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Soundtrack Tracklist].

Morricone wrote more than 15 film scores for Bolognini, including ''[[Le streghe]]'' (1966), ''[[L'assoluto naturale]]'' (1969), ''[[Un bellissimo novembre]]'' (1969), ''[[Metello]]'' (1970), ''[[Chronicle of a Homicide]]'' (1972), ''[[Libera, My Love]]'' (1973), ''[[Per le antiche scale]]'' (1975), ''[[The Lady of the Camellias (1981 film)|La Dame aux camelias]]'' (1980), ''[[Mosca addio]]'' (1987), ''[[Gli indifferenti]]'' (1988) and ''[[Husband and Lovers]]'' (1992).\n\n==== Horror and giallo ====\nEnnio Morricone's eclecticism and knack for creating highly poignant, melodic and emotional music found great scope also in horror movies, such as the baroque thrillers of [[Dario Argento]], from ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]'' (1969), ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'' (1970) and ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1971) to ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1998). His other horror scores include ''[[Nightmare Castle]]'' (1965), ''[[A Quiet Place in the Country]]'' (1968), ''[[The Antichrist (film)|The Antichrist]]'' (1974), ''[[Autopsy (1975 film)|Autopsy]]'' (1975) and ''[[Last Stop on the Night Train|Night Train Murders]]'' (1975).\n\nIn addition, Morricone's music has also been featured in many popular and cult Italian [[giallo]] films, such as ''[[Senza sapere niente di lei]]'' (1969), ''[[Le foto proibite di una signora per bene|Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion]]'' (1970), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[Cold Eyes of Fear]]'' (1971), ''[[The Fifth Cord]]'' (1971), ''[[Short Night of Glass Dolls]]'' (1971), ''[[My Dear Killer]]'' (1972), ''[[What Have You Done to Solange?]]'' (1972), ''[[Black Belly of the Tarantula]]'' (1972), ''[[Who Saw Her Die?]]'' (1972) and ''[[Spasmo]]'' (1974).\n\nIn 1977 Morricone scored [[Alberto De Martino]]'s apocalyptic horror film ''[[Holocaust 2000]]'', starring [[Kirk Douglas]]. In 1982 he composed the score for [[John Carpenter]]'s science fiction horror movie ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''.<ref name=AFI>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=67235 From AFI (The American Film Institute)], accessed September 2011.</ref> Morricone's main theme for the film was reflected in [[Marco Beltrami]]'s film's score of [[The Thing (2011 film)|prequel of the 1982 film]], which was released in 2011.\n\n===Hollywood career===\nThe ''Dollars Trilogy'' was not released in the United States until 1967 when [[United Artists]], who had already enjoyed success distributing the British-produced [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] films in the United States, decided to release Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=days%20of%20heaven%20terrence%20malick%20ennio%20morricone ''Ennio Morricone's The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: A Film Score Guide''], Charles Leinberger, Scarecrow Press, 1 September 2004</ref>\n\nOne of Morricone's first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' by [[John Huston]]. According to Sergio Miceli's book ''Morricone, la musica, il cinema'', Morricone wrote about 15 or 16&nbsp;minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by [[Franco Ferrara]]. At first Morricone's teacher [[Goffredo Petrassi]] had been engaged to write the score for the great big budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. [[RCA Records]] then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film's producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have the exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone's work was rejected because he did not get the ok by RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for ''The Bible: In the Beginning'' in such films as ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' (1965) by [[Duccio Tessari]] and Alberto Negrin's ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987).\n\nMorricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that the composer has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.<ref>[http://thequietus.com/articles/04050-ennio-morricone-interview-a-fistful-of-dollars-for-a-few-dollars-more-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-the-thing Ennio Morricone Interviewed: John Doran, \"Compared To Bach, I'm Practically Unemployed\"], Quietus interview, 8 April 2010.</ref>\n\n====1970\u20131985: from ''Two Mules'' to ''Red Sonja''====\n\nIn 1970, Morricone composed the music for [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', an American-Mexican western film starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] and Clint Eastwood. The same year the composer also delivered the title theme ''The Men from Shiloh'' for the American Western television series [[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]<ref name=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xna6GjwSJ0\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xna6GjwSJ0|title=The Virginian \u2013 Season 9 Opening Credits|work= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> and the score for [[Phil Karlson]]'s war film ''[[Hornets' Nest]]'', starring [[Rock Hudson]], and scored ''[[Bluebeard (1972 film)|Bluebeard]]'', starring [[Richard Burton]], two years later.\n\nIn 1974 Morricone wrote music for some unknown episodes of the science-fiction television series ''[[Space: 1999]]'',{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} directed by [[Lee H. Katzin]], and the following year he scored the [[George Kennedy]] revenge thriller ''[[The \"Human\" Factor (1975 film)|The \"Human\" Factor]]'', which was the final film of director [[Edward Dmytryk]]. Two years later he composed the score for the sequel to [[William Friedkin]]'s 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[John Boorman]]: ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''. The horror film was a major disappointment at the box office. The film grossed {{USD}}30,749,142 in the United States,<ref name=\"mojo_2\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=exorcist2.htm |title=Box Office Information for ''Exorcist II: The Heretic'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> turning a profit but still disappointing in comparison to the original film's gross. The same year he scored the [[Dino De Laurentiis]] produced adventure film ''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'', starring [[Richard Harris]], which was also only a minor hit but later developed a cult following.\n\nIn 1978, the composer worked with [[Terrence Malick]] for ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', starring [[Richard Gere]]. During the lengthy editing process of the romantic drama, which won an [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] with an additional three nominations for the score, Terrence Malick and Billy Weber made use of a temporary score dominated by Morricone's music for the Bernardo Bertolucci film ''Novecento''. Malick also chose the ethereal Aquarium music from [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (\"[[The Carnival of the Animals]]\") to frame the film. When Malick decided he wanted Morricone to score his movie, the director sent a version of it to Italy with the Novecento temp track in place. Morricone agreed to the assignment and Malick flew to Italy because the composer did not fly, so would not travel to the United States. Malick took the movie over to Morricone in Italy and Morricone was writing for ''Days of Heaven'' the whole time. Afterwards they scored the music in Italy. In ''Days of Heaven'', Morricone's elegiac music coexists with pre-existing selections.\n\nDespite the fact that Morricone had produced some of the most popular and widely imitated film music ever written throughout the 1960s and '70s, ''Days of Heaven'' earned him his first [[Academy Awards|Oscar nomination]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], with his score up against [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'', [[Dave Grusin]]'s ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (the eventual winner) and [[John Williams]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' at the [[51st Academy Awards|Oscar ceremonies]] in 1979.<ref name=\"Oscars1979\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1979 |title=The 51st Academy Awards (1979) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=6 October 2011 |work=oscars.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114130539/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/51st-winners.html |archivedate=14 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Morricone provided the music for the thriller ''[[Bloodline (1979 film)|Bloodline]]'', directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], best known for directing the [[James Bond]] films ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).

Morricone's win marked his first competitive Oscar, and at the age of 87 he became the oldest person at the time to win a competitive Oscar.\n\n===Composer for Giuseppe Tornatore===\n\nIn 1988 Morricone started an ongoing and very successful collaboration with Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore. His first score for Tornatore was for the drama film ''Cinema Paradiso''.

Morricone received a [[BAFTA]] award with his son [[Andrea Morricone|Andrea]], and a [[David di Donatello]] for his score. In 2002, the [[director's cut]] 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as ''Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'').\n\nAfter the success of ''Cinema Paradiso'', the composer wrote the music for all subsequent films by Tornatore: the drama film ''[[Everybody's Fine (1990 film)|Everybody's Fine]]'' (Stanno Tutti Bene, 1990), ''[[A Pure Formality]]'' (1994) starring [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] and Roman Polanski, ''[[The Star Maker (1995 film)|The Star Maker]]'' (1995), ''[[The Legend of 1900]]'' (1998) starring [[Tim Roth]], the 2000 romantic drama ''[[Mal\u00e8na (soundtrack)|Mal\u00e8na]]'' (which featured [[Monica Bellucci]]) and the psychological thriller mystery film ''[[La sconosciuta]]'' (2006).\n\nMore recently, Morricone composed the scores for ''[[Baar\u00eca (film)|Baar\u00eca]]'' (2009), ''[[The Best Offer]]'' (2013) starring [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Jim Sturgess]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] and the romantic drama ''[[The Correspondence]]'' (2015) starring [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]].\n\nThe composer won several music awards for his scores to Tornatore's movies. So, Morricone received a fifth Academy Award nomination and a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for ''Mal\u00e8na''. For ''Legend of 1900'', he won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n=== Television series and recent works ===\nMorricone has worked for television, from a single title piece to variety shows and documentaries to TV series, including ''[[Moses the Lawgiver]]'' (1974), ''[[The Life and Times of David Lloyd George]]'' (1981), ''[[Marco Polo (miniseries)|Marco Polo]]'' (1982) (which won two Primetime Emmys), ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987), ''[[The Endless Game]]'' (1989), ''[[The Betrothed (miniseries)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' and ''[[Nostromo]]'' (1996).\n\nHe wrote the score for [[the Mafia]] television series ''[[La piovra]]'' seasons 2 to 10 from 1985 to 2001, including the themes \"Droga e sangue\" (\"Drugs and Blood\"), \"La Morale\", and \"L'Immorale\". Morricone worked as the conductor of seasons 3 to 5 of the series. He also worked as the music supervisor for the television project ''La bibbia'' (\"The Bible\").\n\nIn the late 1990s, he collaborated with his son Andrea on the ''Ultimo'' crime dramas, resulting in ''Ultimo'' (1998), ''Ultimo 2 \u2013 La sfida'' (1999), ''Ultimo 3 \u2013 L'infiltrato'' (2004) and ''Ultimo 4 \u2013 L'occhio del falco'' (2013).\n\nIn the 2000s, Morricone continued to compose music for successful television series such as ''[[Il Cuore nel Pozzo]]'' (2005), ''[[Karol: A Man Who Became Pope]]'' (2005), ''La provinciale'' (2006), ''[[Giovanni Falcone]]'' (2007), ''Pane e libert\u00e0'' (2009) and ''Come Un Delfino 1\u20132'' (2011\u20132013).\n\nWith an estimated 13 million viewers, ''[[Karol: A Man Who Became Pope]]'' became an incredible success. Morricone wrote additional music for the sequel, ''[[Karol: The Pope, The Man]]'' (2006), which portrayed Karol's life as Pope from his [[papal inauguration]] to his death. Both scores were originally released respectively in 2005 and 2006. One year later, a double disc album with both scores is released.\n\nIn 2003, Morricone scored another epic, for Japanese television, called ''Musashi'' and was the [[Taiga drama]] about [[Miyamoto Musashi]], Japan's legendary [[warrior]]. A part of his \"applied music\" is now applied to Italian television films.\n\nMorricone provided the string arrangements on Morrissey's \"Dear God Please Help Me\" from the album ''[[Ringleader of the Tormentors]]'' in 2006.<ref>Goddard, S.

In order to support himself, he moved to RCA in the early sixties and entered the front ranks of the Italian recording industry.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Leinberger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1#v=snippet&q=performing|title=Ennio Morricone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: A Film Score Guide, p.2|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year= 2004 |accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> Since 1964, Morricone was also a founding member of the Rome-based avant-garde ensemble [[Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza]]. During the existence of the group (until 1978), Morricone performed several times with the group as trumpet player.\n\nTo ready his music for live performance, he joined smaller pieces of music together into longer [[Suite (music)|suites]]. Rather than single pieces, which would require the audience to applaud every few minutes, Morricone thought the best idea was to create a series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of [[symphony]] in various [[Movement (music)|movements]] \u2013 alternating successful pieces with personal favorites.

The music was written by Aron Strobel and Stefan Zauner with lyrics by Timothy Touchton and Curtis Briggs, and the song was arranged by Andrew Powell, Armand Volker and Stefan Zauner. It was recorded in [[Abbey Road Studios]] and mastered by Tonstudio Rico Sonderegger, with Volker as the producer. The performance by M\u00fcnchener Freiheit with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] included featuring of additional vocals by the Jackson Singers. \n\nThe song was originally recorded in [[German language|German]] as \"So lang' man Tr\u00e4ume noch leben kann\", and appeared on the album ''[[Fantasie (M\u00fcnchener Freiheit album)|Fantasie]]''. It was translated into English and recorded again to be released on CBS. \n\nAn instrumental version under the original German-language title \"So lang' man Tr\u00e4ume noch leben kann\" appeared in 1987 on ''Schenk Mir Eine Nacht - Ihre Sch\u00f6nsten Lovesongs''.\n\nThe song's chorus bears a striking resemblance to \"All Through the Night\", a 1984 hit by [[Cyndi Lauper]].\n\n==Charts==\nIt remains the band's only international hit, peaking at #14 in the UK Charts.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 214| title-link= British Hit Singles & Albums\n}}</ref> Because it is the only charting hit of the band in the UK, it is generally considered as a [[one-hit wonder]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1988-89)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|20|song=Keeping the Dream Alive|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart|UK]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/25210/freiheit/ |title=Official Charts Company |website=Officialcharts.com |date=1988-12-10 |accessdate=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|-\n|}\n\n==Tracklist==\n===German===\n*Side A: So lang\u2019 man Tr\u00e4ume noch leben kann\" (Long Version) (6:58)\n*Side B:<br>\n**\"So lang\u2019 man Tr\u00e4ume noch leben kann\" (Instrumental Version) (4:14)\n**\"So lang\u2019 man Tr\u00e4ume noch leben kann\" (Single Version) (4:14)\n\n===English===\n'''Single'''\n*Side A: \"Keeping the Dream Alive\" (Single Version) (4:09)\n*Side B: \"The Land of Fantasy\" (4:51)\n\n'''Maxi single'''\n#\"Keeping the Dream Alive\" (Single Version) (4:09)\n#\"Keeping the Dream Alive\" (Extended Version) (6:31)\n#\"The Land of Fantasy\" (4:51)\n\n==Popularity==\nDue to its December release and rich orchestral sound, \"Keeping the Dream Alive\" still receives a lot of airplay at Christmas time in the United Kingdom, and can be found on many Christmas compilation albums.

The single has received additional exposure in the United States thanks to the singing talent contest ''[[American Idol]]'' on the Fox television network.

His fourth term was marked by allegations of widespread corruption which were popularized by [[muckraking]] [[journalist]] [[Lincoln Steffens]] in a 1903 article in McClure's Magazine titled ''The Shame of Minneapolis.'' Ames was found guilty of corruption, but after a successful appeal and multiple [[mistrials]] the charges were dropped.\n\n==Early life and military service==\nAmes was born in [[Garden Prairie, Illinois]] on January 18, 1842 to Dr. [[Alfred Elisha Ames]] and Martha A. Ames. In 1852, Ames' family relocated to near [[Fort Snelling]] in the [[Minnesota Territory]]. At this point the area was still largely undeveloped (they were only the seventh homestead claim made in Minneapolis).<ref name=zink>{{cite book|last1=Zink|first1=Harold|title=City Bosses in the United States|date=1930|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina}}</ref>{{rp|334}} Ames attended local [[public school (government funded)|public school]]s which were partially run by the federal government. While attending high school in 1857, Ames became employed as a \"[[printer's devil]]\" and a [[newspaper carrier]] for the ''Northwestern Democrat'' (one of the first newspapers in Minneapolis). After graduating from high school in 1858, Ames pursued a career in medicine. Though he received much of his experience and training by observing and working with his father, he attended some classes at [[Rush Medical College]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] on February 5, 1862.<ref name=shutter>{{cite book|last1=Shutter|first1=Marion Daniel|title=Progressive Men of Minnesota|date=1897|publisher=The Minneapolis Journal|location=Minneapolis|pages=64\u201365|url=https://archive.org/stream/progressivemenof00shut#page/64/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating with his M.D., Ames returned to Minneapolis intending to start his career as a doctor. After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] and tensions with the [[Dakota people]] began to flare up, he enlisted in the [[9th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] as a [[private (rank)|private]]. He was later transferred to the [[7th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] as an assistant surgeon. He served with the 7th Minnesota for three years in both the [[Dakota War of 1862]] and in several battles in the western theater of the Civil War. He was promoted to the rank of surgeon major before mustering out of service in August 1865.<ref name=shutter/>\n\n==Medical career==\nFollowing the war, Ames briefly returned to Minnesota to work in the medical field with his father. His popularity among Civil War veterans was such that he was elected to serve in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] in 1866 on a \"soldiers' ticket.\" In 1868, he decided to move west to [[California]]. Once there he joined the newspaper business, becoming managing editor of the ''Alta California''. Ames remained in California until 1874 when he was summoned home due to his father's death.<ref name=shutter/><ref name=mnleglib>{{cite web|title=Ames, Albert Alonzo \u2013 Legislator Record|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail?ID=10892|website=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library}}</ref>\n\nAmes took over his father's medical practice in Minneapolis and developed a reputation as a kind and sympathetic figure. He was well known for treating the poor at no charge and for answering calls at any time of the day. He also served as a firefighter.<ref name=zink/>{{rp|336\u2013337}}\n\nIn 1880, when a tornado devastated both [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]] and [[Sauk Rapids]], \"Doc Ames\" arrived at the scene in order to treat the injured. This brought him to nationwide attention.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Political rise==\nAmes became active in the city's [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] party. He served on the Minneapolis City Council in 1875\u20131876 and was named the city's health officer in 1878. He was elected the city's mayor three times in 1876, 1882 and 1886.

During this era Minnesota was heavily dominated by the Republican party and thus Ames faced difficult odds for most state offices.<ref name=\"mnleglib\"/> In 1877 he ran unsuccessfully as lieutenant governor. In 1886, he ran for governor but narrowly lost to [[Andrew Ryan McGill]]. The narrow margin of victory sparked controversy over who was the actual winner, and the election was contested until Ames decided the effort was not worth the time.<ref name=nytimesobit>{{cite news|title=Dr. Albert A.

He initially promoted the idea at the state's Democratic convention in 1886. Despite losing the election, the Republican administration accepted his suggestions and authorized the construction of the [[Minnesota Veterans Home]]. Ames later served there as a surgeon.<ref name=\"shutter\"/>\n\nAfter being defeated in an election for park board in 1888 and losing an independent campaign for mayor in 1898, Ames devised a new strategy. In the 1900 primary election for mayor, he exploited a newly adopted rule which changed the city's primary elections to an [[Primary election#Types|open primary]] (allowing voters to vote for candidates in either party). He campaigned for votes as a Republican (knowing the competition was limited) and narrowly won the nomination. He went on to win the general election in 1900. Between his underhanded election strategy and accusations of corruption in his prior administrations, Ames was described as \"damned politically, socially and professionally\" when he entered office in 1901.<ref name=\"zink\"/>{{rp|343\u2013344}}\n\n==\"The Shame of Minneapolis\"==\nAfter entering office, Ames consolidated his power over the city's police department (the one area of city government which the mayor had full control over). He fired nearly half of the city's officers and replaced them with political allies and henchmen. He installed his brother [[Frederick W. Ames]], \"a weak, vacillating individual,\" as the city's police chief. Norman W. King, a gambler and underworld figure, became the city's chief of detectives.

The money collected was turned over to Ames and divided between him and his associates. Minneapolis was promoted as an \"open city\" to criminals across the country and criminals were released from the city's [[County jail|jail]]. Illegal businesses such as [[opium]] joints, [[gambling]] parlors, and houses of [[prostitution]] blossomed, many in the Gateway district.

Ames was drinking heavily and the various police and politicians under him began to fight among themselves, withholding money from Ames or developing their own extortion schemes without his approval.

Clarke]] began an investigation into the Minneapolis city government and its officials. Clarke was a respected and successful citizen who singlehandedly took on the case, dismissing the county's prosecutor when he was unwilling to attack Ames. Clarke paid private detectives, both locally known men and others from out of town, to investigate. After obtaining enough evidence to indict two of Ames' henchmen, they were convinced to [[turn state's evidence]] and provide information on others in the organization. By June 1902, indictments has been made against Fred Ames, Gardner and others. Before he too was convicted, Ames fled the city after announcing he has been hired to run a hotel in [[West Baden, Indiana]]. He attempted to stay in power from Indiana, but finally announced his resignation as mayor effective September 6, 1902.<ref name=zink/>{{rp|346\u2013347}}\n\nAs his former allies were tried and indicted, Ames remained on the run.

His fourth term was marked by allegations of widespread corruption which were popularized by [[muckraking]] [[journalist]] [[Lincoln Steffens]] in a 1903 article in McClure's Magazine titled ''The Shame of Minneapolis.'' Ames was found guilty of corruption, but after a successful appeal and multiple [[mistrials]] the charges were dropped.\n\n==Early life and military service==\nAmes was born in [[Garden Prairie, Illinois]] on January 18, 1842 to Dr. [[Alfred Elisha Ames]] and Martha A. Ames. In 1852, Ames' family relocated to near [[Fort Snelling]] in the [[Minnesota Territory]]. At this point the area was still largely undeveloped (they were only the seventh homestead claim made in Minneapolis).<ref name=zink>{{cite book|last1=Zink|first1=Harold|title=City Bosses in the United States|date=1930|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina}}</ref>{{rp|334}} Ames attended local [[public school (government funded)|public school]]s which were partially run by the federal government. While attending high school in 1857, Ames became employed as a \"[[printer's devil]]\" and a [[newspaper carrier]] for the ''Northwestern Democrat'' (one of the first newspapers in Minneapolis). After graduating from high school in 1858, Ames pursued a career in medicine. Though he received much of his experience and training by observing and working with his father, he attended some classes at [[Rush Medical College]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] on February 5, 1862.<ref name=shutter>{{cite book|last1=Shutter|first1=Marion Daniel|title=Progressive Men of Minnesota|date=1897|publisher=The Minneapolis Journal|location=Minneapolis|pages=64\u201365|url=https://archive.org/stream/progressivemenof00shut#page/64/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating with his M.D., Ames returned to Minneapolis intending to start his career as a doctor. After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] and tensions with the [[Dakota people]] began to flare up, he enlisted in the [[9th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] as a [[private (rank)|private]]. He was later transferred to the [[7th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] as an assistant surgeon. He served with the 7th Minnesota for three years in both the [[Dakota War of 1862]] and in several battles in the western theater of the Civil War. He was promoted to the rank of surgeon major before mustering out of service in August 1865.<ref name=shutter/>\n\n==Medical career==\nFollowing the war, Ames briefly returned to Minnesota to work in the medical field with his father. His popularity among Civil War veterans was such that he was elected to serve in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] in 1866 on a \"soldiers' ticket.\" In 1868, he decided to move west to [[California]]. Once there he joined the newspaper business, becoming managing editor of the ''Alta California''. Ames remained in California until 1874 when he was summoned home due to his father's death.<ref name=shutter/><ref name=mnleglib>{{cite web|title=Ames, Albert Alonzo \u2013 Legislator Record|url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/legdb/fulldetail?ID=10892|website=Minnesota Legislative Reference Library}}</ref>\n\nAmes took over his father's medical practice in Minneapolis and developed a reputation as a kind and sympathetic figure. He was well known for treating the poor at no charge and for answering calls at any time of the day. He also served as a firefighter.<ref name=zink/>{{rp|336\u2013337}}\n\nIn 1880, when a tornado devastated both [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]] and [[Sauk Rapids]], \"Doc Ames\" arrived at the scene in order to treat the injured. This brought him to nationwide attention.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Political rise==\nAmes became active in the city's [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] party. He served on the Minneapolis City Council in 1875\u20131876 and was named the city's health officer in 1878. He was elected the city's mayor three times in 1876, 1882 and 1886. His first term was described as \"an indifferent success\"<ref name=zink/>{{rp|338}} but his second and third terms generated accusations of corruption.<ref name=zink/>{{rp|337\u2013339}}<ref name=\"shutter\"/><ref name=mnelectiontrends>{{cite web|title=Career of Albert Alonzo Ames|url=http://electiontrendsproject.org/search/search.php?candidate=10&lookup=ames|website=Minnesota Election Trends Project}}</ref>\n\nAmes was not as successful with his attempts at higher office. During this era Minnesota was heavily dominated by the Republican party and thus Ames faced difficult odds for most state offices.<ref name=\"mnleglib\"/> In 1877 he ran unsuccessfully as lieutenant governor. In 1886, he ran for governor but narrowly lost to [[Andrew Ryan McGill]]. The narrow margin of victory sparked controversy over who was the actual winner, and the election was contested until Ames decided the effort was not worth the time.<ref name=nytimesobit>{{cite news|title=Dr. Albert A.

He initially promoted the idea at the state's Democratic convention in 1886. Despite losing the election, the Republican administration accepted his suggestions and authorized the construction of the [[Minnesota Veterans Home]]. Ames later served there as a surgeon.<ref name=\"shutter\"/>\n\nAfter being defeated in an election for park board in 1888 and losing an independent campaign for mayor in 1898, Ames devised a new strategy. In the 1900 primary election for mayor, he exploited a newly adopted rule which changed the city's primary elections to an [[Primary election#Types|open primary]] (allowing voters to vote for candidates in either party). He campaigned for votes as a Republican (knowing the competition was limited) and narrowly won the nomination. He went on to win the general election in 1900. Between his underhanded election strategy and accusations of corruption in his prior administrations, Ames was described as \"damned politically, socially and professionally\" when he entered office in 1901.<ref name=\"zink\"/>{{rp|343\u2013344}}\n\n==\"The Shame of Minneapolis\"==\nAfter entering office, Ames consolidated his power over the city's police department (the one area of city government which the mayor had full control over). He fired nearly half of the city's officers and replaced them with political allies and henchmen. He installed his brother [[Frederick W. Ames]], \"a weak, vacillating individual,\" as the city's police chief. Norman W. King, a gambler and underworld figure, became the city's chief of detectives. Medical student and confidant [[Irwin A. Gardner]] was put in charge of the city's [[Vice#Vice squad|vice squad]].<ref name=\"zink\"/>{{rp|344\u2013345}}<ref name=steffens>{{cite journal|last=Steffens |first=Lincoln |title=The Shame of Minneapolis |date=January 1903 |magazine=McClure's Magazine |publisher=Minnesota Legal History Project |url=http://www.minnesotalegalhistoryproject.org/assets/Steffens-%20Shame%20of%20Mpls.pdf |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213072254/http://www.minnesotalegalhistoryproject.org/assets/Steffens-%20Shame%20of%20Mpls.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nAmes and the Minneapolis police began operating as an [[organized crime]] syndicate, extorting [[protection money]] and \"fines\" from illegal businesses of various kinds. The money collected was turned over to Ames and divided between him and his associates. Minneapolis was promoted as an \"open city\" to criminals across the country and criminals were released from the city's [[County jail|jail]]. Illegal businesses such as [[opium]] joints, [[gambling]] parlors, and houses of [[prostitution]] blossomed, many in the Gateway district.
