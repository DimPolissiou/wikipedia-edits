At her father's death in 1492 Honor was his only daughter by his first wife (the heiress Alicia Mules/Moels<ref name=\"Vivian, p.405\"/>) who was still unmarried, and in his will Sir Thomas Grenville requested: \"I will that my sonne Roger shall mary my doughter Onor and to give her in marriage CCC markes in money to be levied of my lands and goods\". His son Roger duly followed his father's instructions, and on 15 December 1515 he signed a deed of [[marriage settlement]] with his fellow North-Devonian, Sir John Basset of Umberleigh, for the marriage of his sister Honor,<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p.308</ref> then aged about 20 or 22.<ref name=B1305 /> Basset was a widower aged 53, and still lacking a son and heir.

She moved permanently to Calais with her second husband in 1533 when he was appointed [[Lord deputy of Calais]]. They lived together at the Staple Inn in Calais until 1540, during which time she succeeded in forwarding the careers of her children, much assisted by her husband's agent in England [[John Husee]].\n\nHer husband was arrested in 1540 whilst on recall to England, for alleged involvement in a plot to betray Calais, Henry VIII's cherished personal possession, to the French, and was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. Although no evidence was ultimately found to implicate him and in 1542 he was due for release and pardon, he died in the Tower \"at the sudden rapture\",<ref>Granville, Roger, History of the Granville Family, Exeter, 1895, p.66</ref> having heard the good news but before regaining his freedom. During this time Honor had been under [[house arrest]] in Calais with her daughters Mary and Philippa.<ref name=B6149>Byrne, vol.6, p.149</ref> The contemporary chronicler [[Elis Gruffydd]] described the event of 20 May 1540 thus:<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.139, quoting Mostyn MS 158, Elis Gruffydd's Chronicle translated from Welsh by Prys Morgan, folio 552</ref>\n<blockquote>That afternoon in the twilight Lord Sussex and the Council went to the Staple Inn where Lady Lisle kept house. She, after the Council had conversed a little with her, was put in prison in a room of the palace and the girls were taken from her and put in prison in various places throughout the town.</blockquote>\nLady Lisle was then taken on 1 June 1540 to the house of Francis Hall a Spear of Calais, where she remained under house arrest for two years.<ref name=B6139>Byrne, vol.6, p.139</ref> The Lisle household was broken up on 2 June<ref name=B6149 /> and the [[Treasurer of Calais]] took possession of all the treasure and clothes of Lord and Lady Lisle in the King's name. It was at this time and place that the surviving [[Lisle Letters|Lisle Papers]] (see below) were seized by the state. The contents of the Staple Inn were minutely catalogued on their removal, with headings for gilt plate, plate parcel gilt, white plate, gold, jewels, and with goods (i.e. furnishings) listed for every room in the house.<ref>Byrne, vol.6, Appendix E, \"Inventory of Lisle's Household Goods\", pp.189\u2013210</ref>\n\nRumours circulated that Honor herself was the real traitor who brought about her husband's downfall. It was said in the highly insular and Protestant fortress of Calais that she was planning to marry one of her daughters to a Catholic Frenchman, \"a [[Picardy|Picard]] squire\",<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.138\u20139</ref> thus to an enemy of King Henry VIII, who at that time was convinced that the French were planning an assault on Calais.<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.53</ref> It was due to one of the Lisle's servants having travelled, secretly and without official permission, from Calais to Rome, to see the Pope supposedly in order to betray Calais to the French, that Lord Lisle was suspected of involvement in treason.

At her father's death in 1492 Honor was his only daughter by his first wife (the heiress Alicia Mules/Moels<ref name=\"Vivian, p.405\"/>) who was still unmarried, and in his will Sir Thomas Grenville requested: \"I will that my sonne Roger shall mary my doughter Onor and to give her in marriage CCC markes in money to be levied of my lands and goods\". His son Roger duly followed his father's instructions, and on 15 December 1515 he signed a deed of [[marriage settlement]] with his fellow North-Devonian, Sir John Basset of Umberleigh, for the marriage of his sister Honor,<ref>Byrne, vol.1, p.308</ref> then aged about 20 or 22.<ref name=B1305 /> Basset was a widower aged 53, and still lacking a son and heir. By John Basset she had children as follows,  depicted as a row of small kneeling figures below her [[monumental brass]] in Atherington Church, Devon:\n**[[John Basset (1518\u20131541)|John Basset]] (1518\u20131541), eldest son and heir.\n**George Basset, born between 1522\u201325;\n**[[James Basset (c. 1526 \u2013 1558)|James Basset]], born between 1526\u201327.\n**Philippa Basset, born 1516;\n**[[Katherine Basset]], born 1517;\n**[[Anne Bassett]], born 1521, reputedly a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of King Henry VIII.<ref>''The Mistresses of Henry VIII'' by Kelly Hart, p.121\u2013124</ref>\n**Mary Basset, born between 1522\u201325;\n*Secondly (as his second wife) she married [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]] (died 1542), later [[Lord deputy of Calais]], an illegitimate son of King [[Edward IV]] and thus a half-brother of Queen [[Elizabeth of York]] and uncle of King Henry VIII.\n\n==In Calais==\nHonor was one of the ladies who attended [[Anne Boleyn]] when she travelled to [[Calais]] with Henry VIII in 1532. She moved permanently to Calais with her second husband in 1533 when he was appointed [[Lord deputy of Calais]]. They lived together at the Staple Inn in Calais until 1540, during which time she succeeded in forwarding the careers of her children, much assisted by her husband's agent in England [[John Husee]].\n\nHer husband was arrested in 1540 whilst on recall to England, for alleged involvement in a plot to betray Calais, Henry VIII's cherished personal possession, to the French, and was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. Although no evidence was ultimately found to implicate him and in 1542 he was due for release and pardon, he died in the Tower \"at the sudden rapture\",<ref>Granville, Roger, History of the Granville Family, Exeter, 1895, p.66</ref> having heard the good news but before regaining his freedom. During this time Honor had been under [[house arrest]] in Calais with her daughters Mary and Philippa.<ref name=B6149>Byrne, vol.6, p.149</ref> The contemporary chronicler [[Elis Gruffydd]] described the event of 20 May 1540 thus:<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.139, quoting Mostyn MS 158, Elis Gruffydd's Chronicle translated from Welsh by Prys Morgan, folio 552</ref>\n<blockquote>That afternoon in the twilight Lord Sussex and the Council went to the Staple Inn where Lady Lisle kept house. She, after the Council had conversed a little with her, was put in prison in a room of the palace and the girls were taken from her and put in prison in various places throughout the town.</blockquote>\nLady Lisle was then taken on 1 June 1540 to the house of Francis Hall a Spear of Calais, where she remained under house arrest for two years.<ref name=B6139>Byrne, vol.6, p.139</ref> The Lisle household was broken up on 2 June<ref name=B6149 /> and the [[Treasurer of Calais]] took possession of all the treasure and clothes of Lord and Lady Lisle in the King's name. It was at this time and place that the surviving [[Lisle Letters|Lisle Papers]] (see below) were seized by the state. The contents of the Staple Inn were minutely catalogued on their removal, with headings for gilt plate, plate parcel gilt, white plate, gold, jewels, and with goods (i.e. furnishings) listed for every room in the house.<ref>Byrne, vol.6, Appendix E, \"Inventory of Lisle's Household Goods\", pp.189\u2013210</ref>\n\nRumours circulated that Honor herself was the real traitor who brought about her husband's downfall. It was said in the highly insular and Protestant fortress of Calais that she was planning to marry one of her daughters to a catholic Frenchman, \"a [[Picardy|Picard]] squire\",<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.138\u20139</ref> thus to an enemy of King Henry VIII, who at that time was convinced that the French were planning an assault on Calais.<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.53</ref> It was due to one of the Lisle's servants having travelled, secretly and without official permission, from Calais to Rome, to see the Pope supposedly in order to betray Calais to the French, that Lord Lisle was suspected of involvement in treason. This servant was a mischievous domestic chaplain named Gregory Botolf,<ref>Byrne, vol.6, Part 2, The Botolf Conspiracy, pp.53\u2013121</ref> like Honor of popish sympathy,<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.54</ref> nicknamed \"Sir Gregory Sweet-Lips\", who was said by evil rumour to be Honor's lover.<ref name=B6139 /> Honor's daughter Mary Basset was in fact in receipt of love-letters from a young French aristocrat, [[House of Montmorency|Gabriel de Montmorency]], Seigneur de [[Bours, Pas-de-Calais|Bours]], who had proposed marriage to her,<ref>Byrne, vol.6, pp.140\u20131</ref> and these she disposed of in the cess-pit.<ref name=B6139 /> When they were found by Lord Sussex they added further to evidence of suspicious activity.\n\nHer husband's arrest was a great shock to her, and [[John Foxe]], the Protestant [[martyrologist]], stated in his ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' that immediately on hearing the news she \"fell distraught of mind and so continued many years after\".<ref>Byrne, vol.6, p.153</ref> Foxe had a dislike for Honor, whom he suspected as being a determined catholic.

In [[Federalist No. 46]], Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, \"a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia.\" He argued that state militias \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\" He contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he described as \"afraid to trust the people with arms,\" and assured that \"the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\".<ref name=\"emerson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/emerson.html|title=United States of America v.

Several amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified.

The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments.

Ultimately, the Catholic [[James II of England|James&nbsp;II]] was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and his successors, the Protestants [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&nbsp;II]], accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after King Charles II and James&nbsp;II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government,<ref>Bogus, Carl T. \"The Hidden History of the Second Amendment.\" https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/davlr31&id=319&men_tab=srchresults.</ref> and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.<ref group=lower-alpha>From the [[English Civil War]] until the [[Glorious Revolution]] militias occasionally disarmed Catholics, and the King, without Parliament's consent, likewise occasionally disarmed Protestants. Malcolm, \"The Role of the Militia,\" pp.&nbsp;139\u201351.</ref> The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James&nbsp;II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms''.</ref> In ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.<ref>\"They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ...

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u201306. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689). This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment. See E. Dumbauld, ''The Bill of Rights and What It Means Today'' 51 (1957); W.

The following year, at [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|a meeting]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], 12 delegates from five states ([[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[Virginia]]) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model.

Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This [[Massachusetts Compromise|compromise]] persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.<ref>Foner and Garraty, p.&nbsp;914. \"The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.\"</ref> The Constitution was declared ratified on June&nbsp;21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

These concerns were addressed by modifying the final clause, and on August 24, the House sent the following version to the Senate:\n\n{{quote |A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.}}\n\nThe next day, August 25, the Senate received the amendment from the House and entered it into the Senate Journal.

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent.

The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model.\n\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include ''United States v. Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The \"militia\" comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens' militia would be preserved. pp.&nbsp;22\u201328.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(c) The Court's interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. pp.&nbsp;28\u201330.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(d) The Second Amendment's drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. pp.&nbsp;30\u201332.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court's conclusion. pp.&nbsp;32\u201347.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(f) None of the Court's precedents forecloses the Court's interpretation. Neither ''United States v. Cruikshank'', 92 U.S. 542, nor ''Presser v. Illinois'', 116 U.S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. ''United States v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. pp.&nbsp;47\u201354.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another.\n\n<blockquote>Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. ... Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\"<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]] has been a vocal critic of ''Heller''. Speaking in an interview on public radio station [[WNYC]], she called the Second Amendment \"outdated,\" saying:\n\n{{quote |When we no longer need people to keep muskets in their home, then the Second Amendment has no function ... If the Court had properly interpreted the Second Amendment, the Court would have said that amendment was very important when the nation was new; it gave a qualified right to keep and bear arms, but it was for one purpose only \u2013 and that was the purpose of having militiamen who were able to fight to preserve the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says |title=Justice Ginsburg Part II: Gender, the Second Amendment, Immigration & More |publisher=wnyc.org |accessdate=June 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418062107/http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says/ |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n===''McDonald v.

Thus all rights enumerated in a Constitution are thus auxiliary in the eyes of Sir William Blackstone because all rights are only as good as the extent they are exercised in fact.\n\nWhile both [[James Monroe]] and [[John Adams]] supported the Constitution being ratified, its most influential framer was [[James Madison]]. In [[Federalist No. 46]], Madison wrote how a federal army could be kept in check by state militias, \"a standing army ... would be opposed [by] a militia.\" He argued that state militias \"would be able to repel the danger\" of a federal army, \"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\" He contrasted the federal government of the United States to the European kingdoms, which he described as \"afraid to trust the people with arms,\" and assured that \"the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\".<ref name=\"emerson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/emerson.html|title=United States of America v.

Several amendments were proposed, but were not adopted at the time the Constitution was ratified. For example, the Pennsylvania convention debated fifteen amendments, one of which concerned the right of the people to be armed, another with the militia. The Massachusetts convention also ratified the Constitution with an attached list of proposed amendments. In the end, the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|ratification convention]] was so evenly divided between those for and against the Constitution that the [[Federalist Party|federalists]] agreed to the Bill of Rights to assure ratification. <!-- Removed Quote of a rejected resolution of the Massachusetts Convention falsely attributed to Samuel Adams.\nSource: https://archive.org/details/debatesandproce00peirgoog\n''Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Held in the year 1788 And which finally ratified the Constitution of the United States.''

Ultimately, the Catholic [[James II of England|James&nbsp;II]] was overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and his successors, the Protestants [[William III of England|William&nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&nbsp;II]], accepted the conditions that were codified in the Bill. One of the issues the Bill resolved was the authority of the King to disarm his subjects, after King Charles II and James&nbsp;II had disarmed many Protestants that were \"suspected or knowne\" of disliking the government,<ref>Bogus, Carl T. \"The Hidden History of the Second Amendment.\" https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/davlr31&id=319&men_tab=srchresults.</ref> and had argued with Parliament over his desire to maintain a standing (or permanent) army.<ref group=lower-alpha>From the [[English Civil War]] until the [[Glorious Revolution]] militias occasionally disarmed Catholics, and the King, without Parliament's consent, likewise occasionally disarmed Protestants. Malcolm, \"The Role of the Militia,\" pp.&nbsp;139\u201351.</ref> The bill states that it is acting to restore \"ancient rights\" trampled upon by James&nbsp;II, though some have argued that the English Bill of Rights created a new right to have arms, which developed out of a duty to have arms.<ref>Joyce Lee Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms''.</ref> In ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008), the Supreme Court did not accept this view, remarking that the English right at the time of the passing of the English Bill of Rights was \"clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia\" and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.<ref>\"They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ... (Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed: ... This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment&nbsp;...&nbsp;. It was clearly an individual right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia.

In its full context it is clear that the bill was asserting the right of Protestant citizens not to be disarmed by the King without the consent of Parliament and was merely restoring rights to Protestants that the previous King briefly and unlawfully had removed. In its full context it reads:\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the late King James the Second by the Assistance of diverse evill Councellors Judges and Ministers imployed by him did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant Religion and the Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome ''(list of grievances including)'' ... by causing severall good Subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law, ''(Recital regarding the change of monarch)'' ... thereupon the said Lords Spirituall and Temporall and Commons pursuant to their respective Letters and Elections being now assembled in a full and free Representative of this Nation takeing into their most serious Consideration the best meanes for attaining the Ends aforesaid Doe in the first place (as their Auncestors in like Case have usually done) for the Vindicating and Asserting their ancient Rights and Liberties, Declare ''(list of rights including)'' ... That the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law.<ref name=\"c21WillMarSess2\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe historical link between the English Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment, which both codify an existing right and do not create a new one, has been acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right. The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\" As we (the United States Supreme Court) said in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', {{ussc |92 |542 |pin= 553 |1876}}, \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed&nbsp;...\". Between the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles&nbsp;II and James&nbsp;II succeeded in using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents. See J.&nbsp;Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'' 31\u201353 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, ''The Declaration of Rights'', 1689, p.&nbsp;76 (1981). Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic James&nbsp;II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies. See Malcolm 103\u201306. These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms. They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the ''Declaration of Right'' (which was codified as the ''English Bill of Rights''), that Protestants would never be disarmed: \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" 1 W. & M., c. 2, \u00a77, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689). This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment. See E. Dumbauld, ''The Bill of Rights and What It Means Today'' 51 (1957); W.

Mark Thompson wrote that, apart from determining the succession, the English Bill of Rights did \"little more than set forth certain points of existing laws and simply secured to Englishmen the rights of which they were already posessed {{sic}}.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Constitutional History of England |last=Thompson |first=Mark |year=1938}} qtd. in Maer and Gay, p. 4.</ref> Before and after the English Bill of Rights, the government could always disarm any individual or class of individuals it considered dangerous to the peace of the realm.<ref name=\"isbn0-674-89307-7\">Malcolm, ''To Keep and Bear Arms'', p.&nbsp;51.</ref> In 1765, [[William Blackstone]] wrote the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' describing the right to have arms in England during the 18th century as a subordinate auxiliary right of the subject that was \"also declared\" in the English Bill of Rights.<ref name=\"Bodenahamer\">Ely and Bodenhamer, pp.&nbsp;89\u201391.</ref><ref name=\"HeymanChigagoKent\">Heyman, pp. 253\u201359. \"Finally, we should note that (contrary to Kates's assertion), Blackstone nowhere suggests that the right to arms derives from \"the common law.\" Instead, this is a right that is secured by \"the constitution,\" and in particular by the Bill of Rights.\"</ref>\n\n{{quote |The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law.

Some in the United States have preferred the \"rights\" argument arguing that the English Bill of Rights had granted a right. The need to have arms for self-defence was not really in question.

The following year, at [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|a meeting]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], 12 delegates from five states ([[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[Virginia]]) met and drew up a list of problems with the current government model. At its conclusion, the delegates scheduled a follow-up meeting in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania for May 1787 to present solutions to these problems, such as the absence of:<ref>Vile, p.&nbsp;19.</ref><ref name=\"Schmidt39\">Schmidt et al., p.&nbsp;39.</ref>\n* interstate arbitration processes to handle quarrels between states;\n* sufficiently trained and armed intrastate security forces to suppress insurrection;\n* a national militia to repel foreign invaders.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the solution to all three of these problems required shifting control of the states' militias to the federal Congress and giving that congress the power to raise a standing army.<ref name=\"isbn0-300-09562-7\">Williams, pp.&nbsp;41\u201344.</ref> [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article 1, Section 8]] of the Constitution codified these changes by allowing the Congress to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States by doing the following:<ref>{{cite web |last=Story |first=Joseph |title=Commentaries on the Constitution |at=2:\u00a7\u00a7 904\u201325, 927\u201330, 946\u201352, 954\u201370, 972\u201376, 988 |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |work=The Founders Constitution |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309235955/http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_1s28.html |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n* provide and maintain a navy;\n* make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;\n* provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n* provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n\nSome representatives mistrusted proposals to enlarge federal powers, because they were concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power.

Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This [[Massachusetts Compromise|compromise]] persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification.<ref>Foner and Garraty, p.&nbsp;914. \"The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.\"</ref> The Constitution was declared ratified on June&nbsp;21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it.

This created a fear that the federal government, by neglecting the upkeep of the militia, could have overwhelming military force at its disposal through its power to maintain a standing army and navy, leading to a confrontation with the states, encroaching on the states' reserved powers and even engaging in a military takeover. [[Articles of Confederation#Article summaries|Article VI of the Articles of Confederation]] states:\n\n<blockquote>No vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united States in congress assembled, for the defense of such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgement of the united States, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |title=Articles of Confederation |publisher=Usconstitution.net |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826032645/http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17/rbpe178/17802600/rbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+17802600))&linkText=0 |title=US Library of Congress, repro of original text |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319133805/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&fileName=rbpe17%2Frbpe178%2F17802600%2Frbpe17802600.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Frbpebib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28rbpe+17802600%29%29&linkText=0 |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 16]] of the U.S. Constitution states:\n\n<blockquote>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |title=US Constitution |publisher=US Constitution |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022842/http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Government tyranny===\nA foundation of American political thought during the Revolutionary period was concerned about political corruption and governmental tyranny. Even the federalists, fending off their opponents who accused them of creating an oppressive regime, were careful to acknowledge the risks of tyranny. Against that backdrop, the framers saw the personal right to bear arms as a potential check against tyranny. [[Theodore Sedgwick]] of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is \"a chimerical idea to suppose that a country like this could ever be enslaved ... Is it possible ... that an army could be raised for the purpose of enslaving themselves or their brethren? Or, if raised whether they could subdue a nation of freemen, who know how to prize liberty and who have arms in their hands?\"<ref>{{cite book |volume=2 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=97 |edition=2d |year=1863}}</ref> [[Noah Webster]] similarly argued:\n\n<blockquote>Before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe.

They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.\" Because all were members of the militia, all enjoyed the right to individually bear arms to serve therein.<ref name=\"emerson\"/><ref>{{cite book |volume=3 |author=Elliot, Jonathan |title=The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution |at=425 |edition=3d |year=1937}}</ref>\n\nWriting after the ratification of the Constitution, but before the election of the first Congress, [[James Monroe]] included \"the right to keep and bear arms\" in a list of basic \"human rights\", which he proposed to be added to the Constitution.<ref>{{cite book |series=James Monroe Papers |publisher=New York Public Library |title=Miscellaneous Papers of James Monroe |author-link=James Monroe |author=Monroe, James }}</ref>\n\n[[Patrick Henry]] argued in the Virginia ratification convention on June 5, 1788, for the dual rights to arms and resistance to oppression:\n\n<blockquote>Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.

These concerns were addressed by modifying the final clause, and on August 24, the House sent the following version to the Senate:\n\n{{quote |A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.}}\n\nThe next day, August 25, the Senate received the amendment from the House and entered it into the Senate Journal.

Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game.

Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government\" and \"whoever examines the forest, and game laws in the British code, will readily perceive that the right of keeping arms is effectually taken away from the people of England.\" Blackstone himself also commented on English game laws, Vol. II, p.&nbsp;412, \"that the prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to government by disarming the bulk of the people, is a reason oftener meant than avowed by the makers of the forest and game laws.\"<ref name=\"tucker\"/> Blackstone discussed the right of [[self-defense]] in a separate section of his treatise on the common law of crimes.

The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose. But this enables the government to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.<ref name=\"Cooley1880\">{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Thomas McIntyre |title=The General Principles of Constitutional Law in the United States of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU4oAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |year=1880 |publisher=F.B.

Thus, the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" again, in the most analogous linguistic context \u2013 that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against.\" Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom.

The \"collective rights\" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model.\n\nThe Supreme Court's primary Second Amendment cases include ''United States v. Miller'', (1939); ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008); and ''McDonald v. Chicago'' (2010).\n\n''Heller'' and ''McDonald'' supported the individual rights model, under which the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms much as the First Amendment protects the right to free speech. Under this model, the militia is composed of members who supply their own arms and ammunition. This is generally recognized as the method by which militias have historically been armed, as the Supreme Court in ''Miller'' said:<blockquote>The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/174/case.html |title=''United States v.

If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the [[The Hatter|mad hatter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=''District of Columbia v.

The \"militia\" comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens' militia would be preserved. pp.&nbsp;22\u201328.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(c) The Court's interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. pp.&nbsp;28\u201330.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(d) The Second Amendment's drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. pp.&nbsp;30\u201332.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court's conclusion. pp.&nbsp;32\u201347.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n::(f) None of the Court's precedents forecloses the Court's interpretation. Neither ''United States v. Cruikshank'', 92 U.S. 542, nor ''Presser v. Illinois'', 116 U.S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. ''United States v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. pp.&nbsp;47\u201354.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. ''Miller''{{'}}s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. pp.&nbsp;54\u201356.<ref name=\"RecorderOfDecisionsHellerSummary\"/><ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n:3. The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. pp.&nbsp;56\u201364.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court also defined the term arms used in the Second Amendment. \u201cArms\u201d covered by the Second Amendment were defined in ''[[District of Columbia v.

The majority opinion, authored by Justice Scalia, gives explanation of the majority legal reasoning behind this decision.<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/> The majority opinion made clear that the recent ruling did not foreclose the Court's prior interpretations given in ''United States v. Cruikshank'', ''Presser v. Illinois'', and ''United States v. Miller'' though these earlier rulings did not limit the right to keep and bear arms solely to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia (i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes).<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/>\n\n''Heller'' pertained to three District of Columbia ordinances involving restrictions on firearms amounting to a total ban. These three ordinances were a ban on handgun registration, a requirement that all firearms in a home be either disassembled or have a trigger lock, and licensing requirement that prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, such as from one room to another.\n\n<blockquote>Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition \u2013 in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute \u2013 would fail constitutional muster. ... Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the District's licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumed that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and did not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\"<ref name=\"CornellHellerSummary\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]] has been a vocal critic of ''Heller''. Speaking in an interview on public radio station [[WNYC]], she called the Second Amendment \"outdated,\" saying:\n\n{{quote |When we no longer need people to keep muskets in their home, then the Second Amendment has no function ... If the Court had properly interpreted the Second Amendment, the Court would have said that amendment was very important when the nation was new; it gave a qualified right to keep and bear arms, but it was for one purpose only \u2013 and that was the purpose of having militiamen who were able to fight to preserve the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says |title=Justice Ginsburg Part II: Gender, the Second Amendment, Immigration & More |publisher=wnyc.org |accessdate=June 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418062107/http://www.wnyc.org/story/second-amendment-outdated-justice-ginsburg-says/ |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n===''McDonald v.

As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers. Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed, and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories.\nIn 1875 by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands.

In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule.

The \u00c5land movement (\u00c5landsr\u00f6relsen) wanted \u00c5land to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and \u00c5land belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When [[Independence of Finland|Finland became independent]] (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the [[League of Nations]] referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didn't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|website = MacGregor is History |title = Disputes in the League of Nations in the 1920's|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616144657/http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|archive-date = 16 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]]\n| '''{{flag|Two Sicilies}}'''<br />{{flagicon|Malta|1814}} [[Malta Colony|Malta]]<br />{{flag|France}}<br />{{flag|Spain|1785}}\n| 1831\n| 1831\n|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831.

As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers.

During 1749\u201364, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred \"grants\", offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont. In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule. In 1777, the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York, Britain, and New Hampshire, calling it the State of Vermont. Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country, considered by New York to be a district in rebellion.

The \u00c5land movement (\u00c5landsr\u00f6relsen) wanted \u00c5land to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and \u00c5land belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When [[Independence of Finland|Finland became independent]] (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the [[League of Nations]] referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didn't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|website = MacGregor is History |title = Disputes in the League of Nations in the 1920's|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616144657/http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|archive-date = 16 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]]\n| '''{{flag|Two Sicilies}}'''<br />{{flagicon|Malta|1814}} [[Malta Colony|Malta]]<br />{{flag|France}}<br />{{flag|Spain|1785}}\n| 1831\n| 1831\n|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831.

Mello is introduced alongside [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] as a potential substitute for [[L (Death Note)|L]]. Both Mello and Near were raised at Wammy's House, an orphanage established by [[List of Death Note characters#Watari|Watari]], L's assistant. However, Mello refuses to work with Near to capture a murderer dubbed \"[[Light Yagami|Kira]]\". Over the course of ''Death Note'', he joins the mafia, obtains a [[Death Note#The notebooks|Death Note]], causes the death of some people, and dies before he can expose Kira's identity. Mello has also appeared in other media from the series, including [[video games]], and [[light novels]].\n\nThe character of Mello was created, along with Near, to break the endless cycle of confrontations between the detective L and Light Yagami, the man behind the persona Kira. Both Mello and Near were designed after L and were initially envisioned as twins and sons of L. Ultimately, this idea was dropped, with their designs switched compared to the original concept. He is voiced by [[Nozomu Sasaki]] and portrayed by [[Mio Y\u016bki]]. Merchandise has been created for the character, including plush dolls and action figures. Mello has received mixed commentary from manga and anime publications.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In ''Death Note''===\nMello, whose real name is Mihael Keehl, grew up in Wammy's House, an orphanage for [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]] children, and is one of two potential successors to L\u2014the best detective in the world. When L dies, it is proposed to him to work with [[Near (Death Note)|Near]], the other potential successor, to find L's murderer, a criminal dubbed \"[[Light Yagami|Kira]]\". Mello rejects the proposal, citing their bad relationship and different personalities. Then, he leaves the orphanage and joins the [[Mafia]].<ref name=c61/> Aware of a Death Note\u2014a book that allows anyone to murder individuals just by knowing their faces and names\u2014in Japanese police's possession, Mello abducts its director; Kira, however, kills the director.<ref name=c60/> Afterwards, Mello proceeds to kidnap [[Sayu Yagami]], the daughter of the police's vice-director, [[Soichiro Yagami]];<ref name=c61/> Mello succeeds in obtaining the Death Note this time.<ref name=c64/>\n\nLight Yagami, the true identity of Kira, discovers the location of Mello's hideout.<ref name=c68/> An indirect result of this is that Mello meets the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Sidoh]], the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him\u2014in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate\u2014that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent.<ref name=c69/> However, Light launches a [[SWAT]] team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.<ref name=c74/>\n\nMello invades [[List of Death Note characters#SPK (Special Provision for Kira)|SPK]]\u2014an organization that aims to catch Kira\u2014to retrieve a photograph of himself from Near. Before he leaves SPK, Mello tells Near about Sidoh and the fake rules,<ref name=c77/> which sharpens Near's suspicions on Light.<ref name=c78/> Mello then enlists the help of his friend [[List of Death Note characters#Matt|Matt]] to spy on [[Misa Amane]], suspecting she is helping Kira.<ref name=c83/> After learning that Light is Kira and Near is going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello and Matt kidnap [[Kiyomi Takada]], Kira's spokesperson. Matt pretends to attack Takada, and Mello offers to take her to safety. Takada agrees but then realizes his identity.<ref name=c98/> Mello forces her to strip naked to get rid of any tracking devices. However, Takada uses a hidden piece of Death Note paper to kill Mello, as Light had told her his name and what to do in such a situation.<ref name=c99/> Mello's actions ultimately lead to Light's downfall; [[Teru Mikami]] uses the hidden real Death Note to try to kill Takada, which leads to Near learning that the notebook Mikami had been using prior is fake and swapping the real Death Note with his own fake for the final confrontation with Kira.<ref name=c104/>\n\n=== In the live-action drama ===\nIn [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|the live-action television drama]], Mello is portrayed by [[Mio Y\u016bki]]. A major change is made to this character; Mello is the other half of Near. He lives inside of Near's body. A puppet of Mello is seen in Near's hand. After knowing that L is killed, Mello possesses Near and teams up with Himura. Mello takes Himura's help to kidnap [[Sayu Yagami]] in order to obtain the Death Note. Light Yagami makes Himura blow up Mello's hideout with the help of Death Note. Mello survives the bombing and, over the phone, vows to expose Light as Kira. Light plans another ambush with the task force and Japanese police in order to defeat Mello. Later, Light meets with Misa and Mikami and orders them to kill the task force and Mello respectively. During the ambush, Light confronts Mello in a warehouse, who reverts to his Near personality. Near reveals that he pretended to be taken over by Mello as part of a plan to expose Mikami as the current Kira.\n\n===In other media===\nAside from the initial manga, Mello appears in other media based on ''Death Note''. He serves as the narrator of [[Nisio Isin]]'s [[light novel]] ''[[Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases]]''.<ref name=bb/> He is featured in two video games; in ''Death Note: L o Tsugu Mono'',<ref name=game1/> he can serve as Kira or Kira's accomplice,<ref name=game2/> and in the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]''-based [[fighting game]] ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', he is a support character.<ref name=jus/> Mello also appears in the animated special ''Death Note: Relight 2: L's Successors'', which retells the second half of the anime. In it, his story is almost the same, the only exception is that Mello's involvement with the mafia is removed.<ref name=relight/>\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Tsugumi Ohba]], ''Death Note''{{'}}s writer, introduced [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] and Mello together because he felt L individually could not defeat Kira and that introducing only one new character would produce a \"repeat\" of the struggle between Light and L. Ohba asked [[Takeshi Obata]], artist of the series, to make both characters look \"a little 'L-ish.'\" Ohba \"wavered\" in their ages and considered making the characters the sons of L.<ref name=HowtoThink64/> As Ohba wanted to \"include a little L\" in Near and Mello, Obata tried to keep \"the weirdness and the panda eyes\". Since L is an important character, Obata felt that he had made Near and Mello look too much like L. When he first heard about Near and Mello, Obata assumed that they would join as a team and work together, so he envisioned the two as twins, describing the creation of the character designs as \"a major struggle\". At first, he tried to depict Mello as having \"more energy than Near\".<ref name=drawingdesign134/> However, the designs for the characters became switched at a later phase; the final Mello had Near's design and vice versa. When Obata created the designs, his editor wrote the wrong names to accompany them; when Obata received approval for the designs, it was too late to point out that the labels were incorrect. Initially, for him, Mello was \"more calm and feminine\", but later he felt that \"it's better\" that the switch occurred.<ref name=drawingdesign135/>\n\nOhba did not initially develop Mello and Near's personalities as he wanted to \"reveal\" them through their actions.<ref name=HowtoThink64/> He added the chocolate trait because he believed that chocolate \"represented all sweets\" and that the trait would fit with the story arc in the United States.<ref name=HowtoThink66/> Obata designed Mello's clothing based on clothes he enjoys drawing, which includes \"shiny\" leather.<ref name=drawingdesign134/> At first, Mello's hair was cut straight across; Obata preferred Mello's hair becoming messy, which occurred later in the story. Obata became grateful when Ohba added the scar since he felt that he could draw Mello \"looking cooler\".<ref name=drawingdesign134/> Ohba added Mello's scar to the thumbnails as the trait would give him \"more depth\";<ref name=HowtoThink69/> he further added Mello looks \"more intense\" and \"more human\" with the scar.<ref name=HTR179/> After drawing Mello's updated appearance with the scar, Obata \"finally [felt that he could draw Mello] really well\". Obata said that the fact that Ohba and Obata did not regularly meet in person was for the best because if Obata had told Ohba about his satisfaction with Mello's new appearance, Ohba might not have killed Mello.<ref name=HTR179/> However, Obata felt sad when Mello died in the story shortly afterward.<ref name=drawingdesign134/>\n\nOhba considered having Mello be the character who ultimately defeats Light. According to Ohba, after the disappearance of Sidoh, the writer \"struggled\" with Mello's role. Ohba's idea of Mello ultimately defeating Light and Near, being \"the best\", was strong in his mind, but once Mello had \"learned too much about the Death Note\", he had to kill him to \"sustain the intensity of the story\". As a result, Ohba did not give Mello a \"large role\" at the conclusion of ''Death Note'' and instead had Mello negatively affect Light \"indirectly\". Ohba gave Mello a \"very plain\" death, depicted in only one panel; he felt that if Mello had perished \"dramatically\" it would reveal the truth behind his death.<ref name=HowtoThink68/>\n\n==Reception==\nMerchandise based on his character has been released, including action figures and plush dolls.<ref name=merc1/><ref name=merc2/><ref name=merc3/> Moreover, several publications for manga and anime have commented on Mello's character. Referring to Mello and Near's introduction, Julie Rosato of Mania.com said the \"focus on both makes for a clash of attitudes and rough transitions\".<ref name=rosato/> However, as they were introduced in the anime, [[IGN]]'s Tom S. Pepirium criticized how it is not explained \"what Mello is doing and how it differs from Near's story\".<ref name=pepirium/> Writing for Active Anime, Holly Ellingwood stated they \"truly represent \u2013 Light's newest and greatest enemies\",<ref name=aa/> while Briana Lawrence from [[Anime News Network]] said both could be \"much better characters\" if they were treated as individuals instead of \"different halves of L\".<ref name=lawrence>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12 |title=Death Note GN 12 |date=August 5, 2007 |author=Lawrence, Briana |work=Anime News Network |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QpQyOi5j?url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12 |archivedate=July  5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Erin Finnegan from Pop Culture Shock praised ''[[Death Note: The Last Name]]'' for the absence of Mello and Near.<ref name=finnegan/>\n\nAnime News Network's Casey Brienza stressed Mello's presence as a narrator in the light novel \"makes things a bit too breathless in places and a bit too self-conscious in others\".<ref name=bb/> A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised how the introduction of Mello, \"a man of action\", \"spiced things up a bit\" as he brought \"actually\" action to the series.<ref name=sparrow1/><ref name=sparrow2/><ref name=sparrow3/> Manga News said Mello is \"an interesting character\" as he is \"unpredictable\" and also praised the action scenes he brings.<ref name=mn9/><ref name=mn12/> As such, they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is \"one of the few to bring some new blood to the series\".<ref name=mn11/> After Mello's death, Pepirium wrote \"Mello deserved more.\"<ref name=pepirium2/> On the other hand, Mello is \"an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability\", according to Chris Beveridge of Mania.com.<ref name=beveridge/> ''AnimeLand'' and Manga News presented opposite opinions if whether or not Mello is charismatic character, with the former declaring he does not replace L as he lacks charisma.<ref name=aland/><ref name=mn10/>\n\n==See

Mello is introduced alongside [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] as a potential substitute for [[L (Death Note)|L]]. Both Mello and Near were raised at Wammy's House, an orphanage established by [[List of Death Note characters#Watari|Watari]], L's assistant. However, Mello refuses to work with Near to capture a murderer dubbed \"[[Light Yagami|Kira]]\". Over the course of ''Death Note'', he joins the mafia, obtains a [[Death Note#The notebooks|Death Note]], causes the death of some people, and dies before he can expose Kira's identity. Mello has also appeared in other media from the series, including [[video games]], and [[light novels]].\n\nThe character of Mello was created, along with Near, to break the endless cycle of confrontations between the detective L and Light Yagami, the man behind the persona Kira. Both Mello and Near were designed after L and were initially envisioned as twins and sons of L. Ultimately, this idea was dropped, with their designs switched compared to the original concept. He is voiced in the Japanese [[anime]] series by [[Nozomu Sasaki]] and in the English adaptation by [[David Hurwitz (actor)|David Hurwitz]]. Merchandise has been created for the character, including plush dolls and action figures. Mello has received mixed commentary from manga and anime publications.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In ''Death Note''===\nMello, whose real name is Mihael Keehl, grew up in Wammy's House, an orphanage for [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]] children, and is one of two potential successors to L\u2014the best detective in the world. When L dies, it is proposed to him to work with [[Near (Death Note)|Near]], the other potential successor, to find L's murderer, a criminal dubbed \"[[Light Yagami|Kira]]\". Mello rejects the proposal, citing their bad relationship and different personalities. Then, he leaves the orphanage and joins the [[Mafia]].<ref name=c61/> Aware of a Death Note\u2014a book that allows anyone to murder individuals just by knowing their faces and names\u2014in Japanese police's possession, Mello abducts its director; Kira, however, kills the director.<ref name=c60/> Afterwards, Mello proceeds to kidnap [[Sayu Yagami]], the daughter of the police's vice-director, [[Soichiro Yagami]];<ref name=c61/> Mello succeeds in obtaining the Death Note this time.<ref name=c64/>\n\nLight Yagami, the true identity of Kira, discovers the location of Mello's hideout.<ref name=c68/> An indirect result of this is that Mello meets the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Sidoh]], the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him\u2014in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate\u2014that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent.<ref name=c69/> However, Light launches a [[SWAT]] team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.<ref name=c74/>\n\nMello invades [[List of Death Note characters#SPK (Special Provision for Kira)|SPK]]\u2014an organization that aims to catch Kira\u2014to retrieve a photograph of himself from Near. Before he leaves SPK, Mello tells Near about Sidoh and the fake rules,<ref name=c77/> which sharpens Near's suspicions on Light.<ref name=c78/> Mello then enlists the help of his friend [[List of Death Note characters#Matt|Matt]] to spy on [[Misa Amane]], suspecting she is helping Kira.<ref name=c83/> After learning that Light is Kira and Near is going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello and Matt kidnap [[Kiyomi Takada]], Kira's spokesperson. Matt pretends to attack Takada, and Mello offers to take her to safety. Takada agrees but then realizes his identity.<ref name=c98/> Mello forces her to strip naked to get rid of any tracking devices. However, Takada uses a hidden piece of Death Note paper to kill Mello, as Light had told her his name and what to do in such a situation.<ref name=c99/> Mello's actions ultimately lead to Light's downfall; [[Teru Mikami]] uses the hidden real Death Note to try to kill Takada, which leads to Near learning that the notebook Mikami had been using prior is fake and swapping the real Death Note with his own fake for the final confrontation with Kira.<ref name=c104/>\n\n=== In the live-action drama ===\nIn [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|the live-action television drama]], Mello is portrayed by [[Mio Y\u016bki]]. A major change is made to this character; Mello is the other half of Near. He lives inside of Near's body. A puppet of Mello is seen in Near's hand. After knowing that L is killed, Mello possesses Near and teams up with Himura. Mello takes Himura's help to kidnap [[Sayu Yagami]] in order to obtain the Death Note. Light Yagami makes Himura blow up Mello's hideout with the help of Death Note. Mello survives the bombing and, over the phone, vows to expose Light as Kira. Light plans another ambush with the task force and Japanese police in order to defeat Mello. Later, Light meets with Misa and Mikami and orders them to kill the task force and Mello respectively. During the ambush, Light confronts Mello in a warehouse, who reverts to his Near personality. Near reveals that he pretended to be taken over by Mello as part of a plan to expose Mikami as the current Kira.\n\n===In other media===\nAside from the initial manga, Mello appears in other media based on ''Death Note''. He serves as the narrator of [[Nisio Isin]]'s [[light novel]] ''[[Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases]]''.<ref name=bb/> He is featured in two video games; in ''Death Note: L o Tsugu Mono'',<ref name=game1/> he can serve as Kira or Kira's accomplice,<ref name=game2/> and in the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]''-based [[fighting game]] ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', he is a support character.<ref name=jus/> Mello also appears in the animated special ''Death Note: Relight 2: L's Successors'', which retells the second half of the anime. In it, his story is almost the same, the only exception is that Mello's involvement with the mafia is removed.<ref name=relight/>\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Tsugumi Ohba]], ''Death Note''{{'}}s writer, introduced [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] and Mello together because he felt L individually could not defeat Kira and that introducing only one new character would produce a \"repeat\" of the struggle between Light and L. Ohba asked [[Takeshi Obata]], artist of the series, to make both characters look \"a little 'L-ish.'\" Ohba \"wavered\" in their ages and considered making the characters the sons of L.<ref name=HowtoThink64/> As Ohba wanted to \"include a little L\" in Near and Mello, Obata tried to keep \"the weirdness and the panda eyes\". Since L is an important character, Obata felt that he had made Near and Mello look too much like L. When he first heard about Near and Mello, Obata assumed that they would join as a team and work together, so he envisioned the two as twins, describing the creation of the character designs as \"a major struggle\". At first, he tried to depict Mello as having \"more energy than Near\".<ref name=drawingdesign134/> However, the designs for the characters became switched at a later phase; the final Mello had Near's design and vice versa. When Obata created the designs, his editor wrote the wrong names to accompany them; when Obata received approval for the designs, it was too late to point out that the labels were incorrect. Initially, for him, Mello was \"more calm and feminine\", but later he felt that \"it's better\" that the switch occurred.<ref name=drawingdesign135/>\n\nOhba did not initially develop Mello and Near's personalities as he wanted to \"reveal\" them through their actions.<ref name=HowtoThink64/> He added the chocolate trait because he believed that chocolate \"represented all sweets\" and that the trait would fit with the story arc in the United States.<ref name=HowtoThink66/> Obata designed Mello's clothing based on clothes he enjoys drawing, which includes \"shiny\" leather.<ref name=drawingdesign134/> At first, Mello's hair was cut straight across; Obata preferred Mello's hair becoming messy, which occurred later in the story. Obata became grateful when Ohba added the scar since he felt that he could draw Mello \"looking cooler\".<ref name=drawingdesign134/> Ohba added Mello's scar to the thumbnails as the trait would give him \"more depth\";<ref name=HowtoThink69/> he further added Mello looks \"more intense\" and \"more human\" with the scar.<ref name=HTR179/> After drawing Mello's updated appearance with the scar, Obata \"finally [felt that he could draw Mello] really well\". Obata said that the fact that Ohba and Obata did not regularly meet in person was for the best because if Obata had told Ohba about his satisfaction with Mello's new appearance, Ohba might not have killed Mello.<ref name=HTR179/> However, Obata felt sad when Mello died in the story shortly afterward.<ref name=drawingdesign134/>\n\nOhba considered having Mello be the character who ultimately defeats Light. According to Ohba, after the disappearance of Sidoh, the writer \"struggled\" with Mello's role. Ohba's idea of Mello ultimately defeating Light and Near, being \"the best\", was strong in his mind, but once Mello had \"learned too much about the Death Note\", he had to kill him to \"sustain the intensity of the story\". As a result, Ohba did not give Mello a \"large role\" at the conclusion of ''Death Note'' and instead had Mello negatively affect Light \"indirectly\". Ohba gave Mello a \"very plain\" death, depicted in only one panel; he felt that if Mello had perished \"dramatically\" it would reveal the truth behind his death.<ref name=HowtoThink68/>\n\n==Reception==\nMerchandise based on his character has been released, including action figures and plush dolls.<ref name=merc1/><ref name=merc2/><ref name=merc3/> Moreover, several publications for manga and anime have commented on Mello's character. Referring to Mello and Near's introduction, Julie Rosato of Mania.com said the \"focus on both makes for a clash of attitudes and rough transitions\".<ref name=rosato/> However, as they were introduced in the anime, [[IGN]]'s Tom S. Pepirium criticized how it is not explained \"what Mello is doing and how it differs from Near's story\".<ref name=pepirium/> Writing for Active Anime, Holly Ellingwood stated they \"truly represent \u2013 Light's newest and greatest enemies\",<ref name=aa/> while Briana Lawrence from [[Anime News Network]] said both could be \"much better characters\" if they were treated as individuals instead of \"different halves of L\".<ref name=lawrence>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12 |title=Death Note GN 12 |date=August 5, 2007 |author=Lawrence, Briana |work=Anime News Network |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QpQyOi5j?url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12 |archivedate=July  5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Erin Finnegan from Pop Culture Shock praised ''[[Death Note: The Last Name]]'' for the absence of Mello and Near.<ref name=finnegan/>\n\nAnime News Network's Casey Brienza stressed Mello's presence as a narrator in the light novel \"makes things a bit too breathless in places and a bit too self-conscious in others\".<ref name=bb/> A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised how the introduction of Mello, \"a man of action\", \"spiced things up a bit\" as he brought \"actually\" action to the series.<ref name=sparrow1/><ref name=sparrow2/><ref name=sparrow3/> Manga News said Mello is \"an interesting character\" as he is \"unpredictable\" and also praised the action scenes he brings.<ref name=mn9/><ref name=mn12/> As such, they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is \"one of the few to bring some new blood to the series\".<ref name=mn11/> After Mello's death, Pepirium wrote \"Mello deserved more.\"<ref name=pepirium2/> On the other hand, Mello is \"an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability\", according to Chris Beveridge of Mania.com.<ref name=beveridge/> ''AnimeLand'' and Manga News presented opposite opinions if whether or not Mello is charismatic character, with the former declaring he does not replace L as he lacks charisma.<ref name=aland/><ref name=mn10/>\n\n==See

A famous [[model (person)|model]], Misa seeks out Kira ([[Light Yagami]]) as she supports his cause to [[utopia|\"cleanse the world of evil\"]]. Using her own Death Note, a notebook that allows its owner to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face that she received from the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]], Misa does everything she can to aid Light. This includes shortening her own lifespan by half, twice, in order to receive the eyes of a Shinigami, giving her the ability to learn a person's name just by looking at their face. Although Misa fills the traditional role of the [[love interest]], her relationship with Light is [[Unrequited love|one-sided]] as he uses her simply for his own gains.\n\nIn the [[anime]] adaptation, Misa is voiced by [[Aya Hirano]]. In the live action adaptations, she is portrayed by [[Erika Toda]] in the films, by Fuuka Yuzuki in the musical, and by [[Hinako Sano]] in the television drama.\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Tsugumi Ohba]], the writer of ''Death Note'', decided to create Misa to be the second Kira before serialization began. He felt that having the story solely consist of males would be \"boring\" and wanted \"a cute female\". Ohba, intending to introduce her with the Shinigami Eyes, described Misa as having to be \"spontaneous and not too bright\" and that he determined her personality from the start. Since Light Yagami would never want to trade for the Shinigami Eyes, Ohba needed another character to make the eye trade and so decided to use Misa.<ref name=\"EnglishHTR62\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 62.</ref> Ohba said that the conception of the name Misa \"was kind of random but I think it was from ''\"kuromisa\"'' ([[Black Mass]]). It must have been based on something\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR60\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 60.</ref>\n\nOhba ultimately decided to introduce Misa after the death of [[Naomi Misora]]. He and [[Takeshi Obata]], the artist of ''Death Note'', wanted to use the [[gothic lolita]] design to convey the \"gothic imagery of the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] and that world\".<ref name=\"Misa design\">\"Takeshi Obata Production Note: Characters\". ''Death Note: How to Read 13''. [[VIZ Media]]. 128.</ref> Ohba said that they're \"into that fashion\" and that having Misa first appear in unusual clothing would be \"more interesting\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR62\"/> Obata, imagining a mix of an \"energetic Japanese artist\" and a \"foreign [[rock and roll]] singer\", felt \"set\" with Misa's design after drawing her for the first time. Obata said that he felt \"apprehension\" regarding the length of Misa's hair; personally he wanted her [[Bangs (hair)|bangs]] to be \"straight across\" but believed that creating Misa completely within the bounds of gothic lolita style would be \"too much\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR62\"/><ref name=\"Misa design\"/> Therefore, Obata designed her so she looked \"a little more natural\" and to appear \"cute\" to people who \"weren't into the Gothic Lolita style\".<ref name=\"Misa design\"/> Obata revealed that his editor warned him that the scene with Misa in restraints in chapter 33 was on \"morally thin ground for a children's magazine\", so they placed the title logo over the middle of it. This was a surprise to the artist, as he said he \"held back\" when drawing it.<ref name=\"warning\">''Death Note 13: How to Read'' [[VIZ Media]]. 117</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] and [[Mello (Death Note)|Mello]] story arc began and Misa became a top [[Japanese idol|idol]], Obata decided to drop the gothic lolita style and make her look like \"a popular actress\". Obata said that he remembered \"having a lot of fun\" while looking through gothic lolita magazines and drawing Misa.<ref name=\"Misa design\"/> In response to a question inquiring which characters the creators faced the most difficulty in creating, Obata selected Misa. The artist said that he had difficulty comprehending the concept of \"doing anything for the person you love\" and that he felt like the character controlled him when he drew her. ''Death Note 13: How to Read'' also states that Misa \"required a lot of artistic variation\" because of her \"many expressions\" that ranged \"from goofy to serious\".<ref name=\"HTR191\">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 191.</ref>\n\nWhen designing color images, Obata assigned colors to characters to \"get the atmosphere right\". He assigned [[pink]] and [[black]] to Misa.<ref name=\"warning\"/> In the manga, Misa wears jewelry with a [[crucifix]] theme; in the anime adaptation, she wears [[fleur de lis]] jewelry, although the cross is retained on the collector's figure included with Volume 5 of the DVD series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In ''Death Note''===\n[[Image:Misa Amane DNTV.jpg|left|thumb|Misa as she appears in the ''Death Note'' anime]]\n\nBorn in [[Kyoto]] on December 25, 1984,<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 31, Page 121</ref> Misa Amane is a famous [[model (person)|model]] known as \"Misa Misa\" from the [[Kansai region]] who possesses a Death Note given to her by the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]].<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 29, Page 90</ref> Prior to her introduction in the series, Misa was attacked by an obsessed stalker. Unknown to her, a Shinigami named [[Gelus (Death Note)|Gelus]] had fallen in love with her, and in order to save her life, Gelus wrote her stalker's name into his notebook, killing him. Consequently, Gelus himself died, since Shinigami exist only to take human life, not extend it. Rem, who witnessed the whole event, then took Gelus' Death Note which had been left behind and gave it to Misa.<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 27</ref>\n\nMisa moves to [[Tokyo]] in order to meet Kira, a vigilante who uses his own Death Note to serially murder criminals in order to rid the world of evil, as she agrees with his goal.<ref>Volume 3, Chapter 25, Page 192</ref> A year prior to her introduction, Misa's parents were murdered in front of her eyes by a burglar. She was unable to forgive the killer and even desired to kill him herself, but following multiple delays in his trial, she began to worry of the possibility he would get off. However, he was killed by Kira leading to her worshiping him.<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 29, Page 93</ref> Using her Death Note, the media and her Shinigami Eyes \u2013 in exchange for half her remaining lifetime she received the ability to see a person's name and remaining lifespan just by looking at their face \u2013 she is able to identify [[Light Yagami]] as Kira and earns herself the moniker \"Fake Kira\" or \"Second Kira\" by the task force trying to stop him.\n\nHaving fallen in love with him, Misa vows to do whatever Light says in exchange for him becoming her boyfriend. Light agrees in order to use her Shinigami Eyes and even though he tells her upfront their relationship will only be an act, she believes she can ultimately win his love.<ref>Volume 4, Chapters 29 and 30</ref> According to Ohba, Light sees Misa as a \"bad person\" who killed innocent people, so he acts emotionally cold towards her and manipulates her.<ref name=\"HTR65\">\"How to Think\". ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 65.</ref> Light and Misa both act together as Kira for over five years, until Light decides that it is too dangerous for Misa to be Kira with members of the task force suspecting him and tells her to give up the notebook. During the series, Misa performs two eye trades, cutting her lifespan in half twice: the first, with Rem; the second, with [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]].\n\nMisa loses her memories related to using the Death Note, by relinquishing ownership of it, at Light's orders and retains her love for him. The rest of her fate is not shown in the manga at all; she was last seen staying at the Teito Hotel. Ohba stated that this was simply because he did not have a situation to fit her in.<ref name=\"EnglishHTRTwoHundred\">\"The 13 Truths About Chapter 108.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 200.</ref> The author speculated that after someone \"like [[List of Death Note characters#Touta Matsuda|Matsuda]] probably let it slip\" that Light died, Misa fell into despair and \"committed suicide... something like that\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTRTwoHundred\"/> Her death date is given as slightly over a year after Light's.<ref name=\"MisaHTRProfile16\">''Death Note: How to Read 13''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 16.</ref>\n\nIn the anime's finale, Misa appears standing outside the safety rail on the edge of a skyscraper and looking into the sunset. The official anime guidebook lists her date of death as unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note A Animation Official Analysis Guide|year=2007|publisher=Shueisha|isbn=9784088741970|page=9}}</ref>\n\n===In film===\n[[Image:Dn Misa film.jpg|thumb|[[Erika Toda]] as Misa in the [[Death Note (2006 film)|''Death Note'' film series]]]]\nMisa is portrayed in the films by [[Erika Toda]].<ref name=\"films\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-08/2016-death-note-film-brings-back-erika-toda-as-misa/.99555|title=2016 Death Note Film Brings Back Erika Toda as Misa|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2016-03-08|accessdate=2016-04-06}}</ref> In the film continuity, Misa has a brother, who is murdered along with her parents.  Misa's personality is altered slightly from the manga. In addition, her appearance is slightly modified: while Misa has blonde hair in the manga and anime, she has brown hair in the films. She is first seen filming a [[dorama]] called \"Misa-Misa's Happy Sweets\", where she states that she is baking treats to make her enemies fat. After filming of that section ends, she expresses support for Kira to a journalist. Her supervisor asks that the statement be cut due to controversies. Misa's attacker, Ryotaro Sakajo, the [[assistant director]] for \"Happy Sweets\", dies from a heart attack when Gelus writes his name inside of his Death Note. Gelus' Death Note then falls in front of Misa, who immediately picks it up. After reading the notebook, she finds Rem.\n\nIn the second film, [[List of Death Note characters#Kanzo Mogi|Mogi]] replaces Ukita as Misa's victim during the Sakura TV incident. Additionally, Misa first learns of Light's identity as Kira when Soichiro rescues Sayu who was at the TV station attending a fair. Misa is present at the final confrontation between Light and the police force, though she is handcuffed and restrained by another officer. When Light dies after Ryuk writes his name down in the Death Note, Misa breaks down emotionally. Her memory of the Death Note is erased, but she retains her obsession with Light, wishing him a happy birthday through a mini-[[shrine]] dedicated to him. Erika Toda said that, prior to filming, she felt \"a lot of pressure\" due to the character's popularity with audiences. She said the pressure vanished when filming began.

A famous [[model (person)|model]], Misa seeks out Kira ([[Light Yagami]]) as she supports his cause to [[utopia|\"cleanse the world of evil\"]]. Using her own Death Note, a notebook that allows its owner to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face that she received from the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]], Misa does everything she can to aid Light. This includes shortening her own lifespan by half, twice, in order to receive the eyes of a Shinigami, giving her the ability to learn a person's name just by looking at their face. Although Misa fills the traditional role of the [[love interest]], her relationship with Light is [[Unrequited love|one-sided]] as he uses her simply for his own gains.\n\nIn the [[anime]] adaptation, Misa is voiced by [[Aya Hirano]] in Japanese and by [[Shannon Chan-Kent]] in the English version. In the live-action adaptations, she is portrayed by [[Erika Toda]] in the films, by Fuuka Yuzuki in the musical, and by [[Hinako Sano]] in the television drama.\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Tsugumi Ohba]], the writer of ''Death Note'', decided to create Misa to be the second Kira before serialization began. He felt that having the story solely consist of males would be \"boring\" and wanted \"a cute female\". Ohba, intending to introduce her with the Shinigami Eyes, described Misa as having to be \"spontaneous and not too bright\" and that he determined her personality from the start. Since Light Yagami would never want to trade for the Shinigami Eyes, Ohba needed another character to make the eye trade and so decided to use Misa.<ref name=\"EnglishHTR62\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 62.</ref> Ohba said that the conception of the name Misa \"was kind of random but I think it was from ''\"kuromisa\"'' ([[Black Mass]]). It must have been based on something\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR60\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 60.</ref>\n\nOhba ultimately decided to introduce Misa after the death of [[Naomi Misora]]. He and [[Takeshi Obata]], the artist of ''Death Note'', wanted to use the [[gothic lolita]] design to convey the \"gothic imagery of the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] and that world\".<ref name=\"Misa design\">\"Takeshi Obata Production Note: Characters\". ''Death Note: How to Read 13''. [[VIZ Media]]. 128.</ref> Ohba said that they're \"into that fashion\" and that having Misa first appear in unusual clothing would be \"more interesting\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR62\"/> Obata, imagining a mix of an \"energetic Japanese artist\" and a \"foreign [[rock and roll]] singer\", felt \"set\" with Misa's design after drawing her for the first time. Obata said that he felt \"apprehension\" regarding the length of Misa's hair; personally he wanted her [[Bangs (hair)|bangs]] to be \"straight across\" but believed that creating Misa completely within the bounds of gothic lolita style would be \"too much\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR62\"/><ref name=\"Misa design\"/> Therefore, Obata designed her so she looked \"a little more natural\" and to appear \"cute\" to people who \"weren't into the Gothic Lolita style\".<ref name=\"Misa design\"/> Obata revealed that his editor warned him that the scene with Misa in restraints in chapter 33 was on \"morally thin ground for a children's magazine\", so they placed the title logo over the middle of it. This was a surprise to the artist, as he said he \"held back\" when drawing it.<ref name=\"warning\">''Death Note 13: How to Read'' [[VIZ Media]]. 117</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] and [[Mello (Death Note)|Mello]] story arc began and Misa became a top [[Japanese idol|idol]], Obata decided to drop the gothic lolita style and make her look like \"a popular actress\". Obata said that he remembered \"having a lot of fun\" while looking through gothic lolita magazines and drawing Misa.<ref name=\"Misa design\"/> In response to a question inquiring which characters the creators faced the most difficulty in creating, Obata selected Misa. The artist said that he had difficulty comprehending the concept of \"doing anything for the person you love\" and that he felt like the character controlled him when he drew her. ''Death Note 13: How to Read'' also states that Misa \"required a lot of artistic variation\" because of her \"many expressions\" that ranged \"from goofy to serious\".<ref name=\"HTR191\">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 191.</ref>\n\nWhen designing color images, Obata assigned colors to characters to \"get the atmosphere right\". He assigned [[pink]] and [[black]] to Misa.<ref name=\"warning\"/> In the manga, Misa wears jewelry with a [[crucifix]] theme; in the anime adaptation, she wears [[fleur de lis]] jewelry, although the cross is retained on the collector's figure included with Volume 5 of the DVD series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In ''Death Note''===\n[[Image:Misa Amane DNTV.jpg|left|thumb|Misa as she appears in the ''Death Note'' anime]]\n\nBorn in [[Kyoto]] on December 25, 1984,<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 31, Page 121</ref> Misa Amane is a famous [[model (person)|model]] known as \"Misa Misa\" from the [[Kansai region]] who possesses a Death Note given to her by the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]].<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 29, Page 90</ref> Prior to her introduction in the series, Misa was attacked by an obsessed stalker. Unknown to her, a Shinigami named [[Gelus (Death Note)|Gelus]] had fallen in love with her, and in order to save her life, Gelus wrote her stalker's name into his notebook, killing him. Consequently, Gelus himself died, since Shinigami exist only to take human life, not extend it. Rem, who witnessed the whole event, then took Gelus' Death Note which had been left behind and gave it to Misa.<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 27</ref>\n\nMisa moves to [[Tokyo]] in order to meet Kira, a vigilante who uses his own Death Note to serially murder criminals in order to rid the world of evil, as she agrees with his goal.<ref>Volume 3, Chapter 25, Page 192</ref> A year prior to her introduction, Misa's parents were murdered in front of her eyes by a burglar. She was unable to forgive the killer and even desired to kill him herself, but following multiple delays in his trial, she began to worry of the possibility he would get off. However, he was killed by Kira leading to her worshiping him.<ref>Volume 4, Chapter 29, Page 93</ref> Using her Death Note, the media and her Shinigami Eyes \u2013 in exchange for half her remaining lifetime she received the ability to see a person's name and remaining lifespan just by looking at their face \u2013 she is able to identify [[Light Yagami]] as Kira and earns herself the moniker \"Fake Kira\" or \"Second Kira\" by the task force trying to stop him.\n\nHaving fallen in love with him, Misa vows to do whatever Light says in exchange for him becoming her boyfriend. Light agrees in order to use her Shinigami Eyes and even though he tells her upfront their relationship will only be an act, she believes she can ultimately win his love.<ref>Volume 4, Chapters 29 and 30</ref> According to Ohba, Light sees Misa as a \"bad person\" who killed innocent people, so he acts emotionally cold towards her and manipulates her.<ref name=\"HTR65\">\"How to Think\".

During the series, Misa performs two eye trades, cutting her lifespan in half twice: the first, with Rem; the second, with [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]].\n\nMisa loses her memories related to using the Death Note, by relinquishing ownership of it, at Light's orders and retains her love for him. The rest of her fate is not shown in the manga at all; she was last seen staying at the Teito Hotel. Ohba stated that this was simply because he did not have a situation to fit her in.<ref name=\"EnglishHTRTwoHundred\">\"The 13 Truths About Chapter 108.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''.

Misa's personality is altered slightly from the manga. In addition, her appearance is slightly modified: while Misa has blonde hair in the manga and anime, she has brown hair in the films. She is first seen filming a [[dorama]] called \"Misa-Misa's Happy Sweets\", where she states that she is baking treats to make her enemies fat. After filming of that section ends, she expresses support for Kira to a journalist. Her supervisor asks that the statement be cut due to controversies. Misa's attacker, Ryotaro Sakajo, the [[assistant director]] for \"Happy Sweets\", dies from a heart attack when Gelus writes his name inside of his Death Note. Gelus' Death Note then falls in front of Misa, who immediately picks it up. After reading the notebook, she finds Rem.\n\nIn the second film, [[List of Death Note characters#Kanzo Mogi|Mogi]] replaces Ukita as Misa's victim during the Sakura TV incident. Additionally, Misa first learns of Light's identity as Kira when Soichiro rescues Sayu who was at the TV station attending a fair. Misa is present at the final confrontation between Light and the police force, though she is handcuffed and restrained by another officer. When Light dies after Ryuk writes his name down in the Death Note, Misa breaks down emotionally. Her memory of the Death Note is erased, but she retains her obsession with Light, wishing him a happy birthday through a mini-[[shrine]] dedicated to him. Erika Toda said that, prior to filming, she felt \"a lot of pressure\" due to the character's popularity with audiences. She said the pressure vanished when filming began. In an article in ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', a [[Malaysia]]n newspaper, writer Kitty Sensei theorized that Toda did not have \"the time to think much about how fans would react\", citing film shoots that Kitty Sensei described as \"physically and mentally exhausting\" such as the [[straitjacket]] scene.

He is portrayed as a brilliant but bored [[genius]] who finds the Death Note, an otherworldly [[supernatural]] notebook that allows the user to kill anyone by knowing their name and face, after it is dropped by the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]]. Frustrated by the status quo of a world he deems to be rotten, Light is eventually driven to use the Death Note to kill those whom he deems morally unworthy of life by masterminding a worldwide massacre as the vigilante {{nihongo|'''Kira'''|\u30ad\u30e9}}. Over the course of his efforts to become the god of a [[utopia]] free of crime, Light is hunted down by a special task-force, headed by an enigmatic consulting detective known as [[L (Death Note)|L]].\n\nIn the [[anime]] adaptation, he is voiced by [[Mamoru Miyano]]. In the live action film series, he is portrayed by [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]]; in the musical he is portrayed by both [[Kenji Urai]] and Hayato Kakizawa; in the TV drama, he is portrayed by [[Masataka Kubota]]; his counterparts in the American film are portrayed by [[Nat Wolff]] and [[Margaret Qualley]].\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Tsugumi Ohba]], the story writer of ''Death Note'', said that his editor suggested the [[family name]] \"Yagami\" for Light. Ohba said that he did not feel \"too concerned\" about the meaning of the name (the [[Kanji]] for \"Yagami\" are \"night\" and \"god\"); he said that after he created the final scene in the manga he \"liked\" that the final scene created \"deeper significance\" in the name, of Kira worshippers worshipping him at night under the light of the moon \u2013 his given name Light is written with the character for \"moon\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR61\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 61.</ref>\n\n[[Takeshi Obata]], the artist of ''Death Note'', said that he had \"no trouble\" designing Light as the character description presented to him, \"A brilliant honors student who's a little out there,\" was \"clear and detailed\". As the weekly serialization continued, Obata simplified the design by subconsciously removing \"unnecessary\" lines and felt that he became \"better\" at drawing Light. When Chapter 35 appeared and the editor informed Obata that Light loses his memories, Obata had to draw Light in a similar manner as he appeared in Chapter 1; Obata said \"It was like I had to forget everything I had learned.\" Obata said that he used \"a lot of effort\" to design Light's wardrobe. According to Obata, he encountered difficulty imagining the clothing of \"a brilliant person,\" so he looked through fashion magazines. Obata envisioned Light as a \"smart and formal guy\" who wears formal shirts. Most of Light's clothing in ''Death Note'' is \"fitted\" and Obata avoided [[jeans]].<ref name=\"Light drawing design\">\"Takeshi Obata Production Note: Characters.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''.

Kaneko changed the story involving Light gaining his first notebook as he felt that the audience \"would have a hard time sympathizing\" with Light if the scene remained the same as it was in the manga. Kaneko added that as he portrayed Light as \"being enthralled\" as he \"becomes more cruel\" to make the audience members feel that they could \"do the terrible things he does\" even if the members do not sympathize with Light.<ref name=\"SJinterview6\">''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]''.

Fujiwara explained that he wanted Light to cry in a particular scene even though Kaneko told Fujiwara \"Light doesn\u2019t cry\" since Fujiwara believed that the scene would feel \"more honest\"; Kaneko used the take.<ref name=\"Thestars\">\"[http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/29/movies/15836983&sec=movies The stars].\" ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''.

His ethics are [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], justifying the most extreme acts in service of his cause. He is also driven by a need for victory, which motivates most of his cruelest acts. Combined with the power of the Death Note, his [[hubris]] and genius-level intellect convince him that only he can save the world. \n\nEventually a small task force of Japanese police officers, including Light's father, under the direction of the eccentric genius detective [[L (Death Note)|L]] begin to close in on Light. Although he suspects Light is Kira, L allows him to collaborate with the police on the case. This begins a game of [[cat and mouse]] between the two, with Light trying to learn L's real name so he can kill him, and L trying to get Light to expose himself so that he can arrest him. Because the actions of [[Misa Amane]], a fervent Kira supporter and fellow Death Note owner, nearly implicates Light, he becomes compelled to temporarily relinquish ownership of his notebook and subsequently loses his memories of using the Death Note. It is during this time that Light reverts to his original persona: a caring, level-headed and empathetic individual unwilling to manipulate others or commit or justify acts of crime, such as murder. After Light regains ownership of his notebook and his memories, he manipulates Misa's Shinigami [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]] into killing L. Light then assumes the \"L\" persona and continues his charade of searching for Kira with the task force while carrying out the killings himself with help from Misa.\n\nOver four years later, Light is able to garner most of the world's support, reaching the point where his followers have begun to worship Kira as a literal deity. However, it is around this time that two of  L's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, [[Mello (Death Note)|Mello]] and [[Near (Death Note)|Near]], begin their investigation against Kira. Near heads the [[SPK (Special Provision for Kira)]], an American investigation team composed of [[CIA]] and [[FBI]] agents, while Mello works with the [[Mafia]]. Although Mello dies working separately from Near, his actions lead [[Teru Mikami]], a man selected by Light to kill criminals using another Death Note, to make a mistake that results in Light's capture by Near, the SPK and Japanese police. Seeing that Light has finally lost, he is killed when Ryuk writes his name in his own Death Note, just as the Shinigami had warned when they first met.<ref name=\"Volume 12: Finis\">{{cite book | last = Ohba | first = Tsugumi | title = Death Note, Volume 12 | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Viz Media]] | isbn = 978-1-4215-1327-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/deathnotevol12fi0012bats }}</ref>\n\n===In film===\n====Japanese film series====\n[[Image:TatsuyaFujiwaraasLightYagami.png|thumb|[[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] as Light in the [[Death Note (2006 film)|''Death Note'' film series]].]]\nIn the Japanese film series, Light Yagami is portrayed by [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]], known for his role as [[Shuya Nanahara]] in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]''. In the films, he is portrayed as a distinguished, popular and intellectually gifted college student, who has a disregard and frustration of the incapability of the law enforcement system to quell the rampant increase in criminal activities around the world, which drives his motives to use the Death Note, to change the world into a utopian society without crime, under the alias of a god-like vigilante known as \"Kira\", much like his manga counterpart. However, some slight changes and modifications were made to the character. At the film's beginning, Light is a first-year law student at a university, instead of still being in high school as in the beginning of the manga and anime. Light's motives also slightly differ; in this version, he uses the Death Note mainly out of his frustration from the perceived failures of the [[Law of Japan|Japanese justice system]]. Light, prior to his discovery of the Death Note, [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]]s into the national police database and finds that the government is unable to prosecute many criminals, either due to lack of evidence or technical loop-holes, among other reasons. Also, Light discovers the Death Note in an alley during a rainy night after encountering an acquitted felon named Takuo Shibuimaru in a night-club. Another difference is that Light meets Ryuk right after killing Shibuimaru with the Death Note. At the end of the first movie, Light reluctantly kills his girlfriend, Shiori Akino, and frames her death as a murder and reason to foster hatred for \"Kira\", in order to join the Kira investigation team as a result of their sympathy.\n\nLight relinquishes ownership of the Death Note to [[Kiyomi Takada]]. After Takada is caught, Light kills her to recover the Death Note, but it is taken by the investigation team. L states that he will test the 13-Day Rule, a fake Death Note rule designed to prove Light and Misa's innocence. Rem, knowing that L's actions will reveal Misa's identity as the second Kira, writes both L and his handler: Watari's names in the Death Note. Light then proceeds to write his father's name in the book, manipulating his father to return the confiscated Death Note. Light confronts his father, but Soichiro does not die. The investigation team members, including L, reveal themselves. Having already written his own name in the Death Note, thus negating Rem's actions, L tells Light that he had just written in a fake note. Light tries to write on a hidden piece of Death Note, but is shot by Matsuda, an investigation team member. Light tells Ryuk to write the team's names, promising to show him many interesting things, and begins to laugh. He stops, however, when Ryuk shows him that he had written just one name: Light's. Light tries to stop Ryuk, but merely passes right through him. As Light begins to succumb to the effects of the Death Note, Ryuk takes this opportunity to reveal to him that humans that have used the Death Note are barred from entering either [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]], instead spending eternity in [[nothing]]ness. Light dies in his father's arms, begging him to believe that he acted as Kira to put the justice, which Soichiro had taught him since his childhood, into practice.\n\nSeveral years after Light's death, however, it is revealed in the sequel film ''[[Death Note: Light Up the New World]]'' that Light has secretly raised a son, Hikari Yagami (\u591c\u795e\u5149 ''Yagami Hikari''), to inherit a Death Note and carry on Kira's legacy. As Hikari becomes of age, the boy is killed by Teru Mikami, his appointed guardian, over control of the notebook. Mikami is then killed by police officer Tsukuru Mishima who decides to use the notebook to continue Light's work in ridding the world of crime. During the course of the film, Mishima is eventually caught by police and he willingly turns himself in and the notebook to the authorities, seemingly thus ending Kira's legacy. A [[mid-credits scene]] reveals a video recorded by Light addressing the film's events to have occurred just as he has expected them to, teasing his potential resurrection.\n\n====American film====\n{{originalresearch|section|date=October 2019}}\n[[Nat Wolff]] portrays the character's counterpart, \"Light Turner\": a Seattle high school student, in [[Death Note (2017 film)|the American film adaptation]], as an intelligent yet quiet and socially introverted teenager, who stumbles across the mystical Death Note and eventually decides to use the notebook's god-like abilities to commit a worldwide massacre, in order to change the world into a utopian society without crime, under the alias of a literal human deity: \"Kira\", while being hunted down by an elite task-force of law enforcement officials within Seattle City, led by an enigmatic international detective known as L and his own father, veteran Seattle police detective: James Turner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/nat-wolff-adam-wingard-death-note-1201605146/|title='Paper Towns'' Nat Wolff to Star in Adam Wingard's 'Death Note'|publisher=Variety|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=September 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Warners' Live-Action Death Note Film Casts Nat Wolff |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-29/warners-live-action-death-note-film-casts-nat-wolff/.93552 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2015-09-29 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref> [[Margaret Qualley]] portrays Mia Sutton (based on the sociopathic qualities of Light Yagami<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-netflixs-death-note-is-really-an-origin-story-and-w-1798435941|title=Why Netflix's Death Note Is Really an Origin Story and Where a Sequel Could Go|last=Trendacosta|first=Katharine|work=io9|date=August 28, 2017|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref>), Light's girlfriend who assists him in his activities as \"Kira\". In this adaptation, Light has vast character differences from his manga counterpart, lacks much of the sociopathic, malicious and ruthless qualities of the original character, is more naive, sympathetic and idealistic, does not have a sister and has lost his mother in a hit and run incident, which partially serves as his inspiration to operate as Kira. He has a close yet somewhat strained relationship with his father and while considered academically gifted by peers and authorities, is not a popular student and is considered as a social outsider and lacks friends. Unlike his manga counterpart, he is also far less charismatic and confident, but more morally driven and demonstrates a reluctance to murder innocents and law enforcement individuals attempting to capture him, while eventually demonstrating a more darker, morally ambiguous, cunning and meticulous personality, towards the film's ending. Furthermore, instead of obtaining the notebook by chance, Ryuk deliberately hands Light the Death Note, in order to entertain himself and to see how an indifferent high schooler would utilize the Death Note's god-like abilities.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter being enticed to kill a bully by Ryuk, Light murders the criminal who killed his mother. Along with Mia Sutton, his classmate and love interest, Light begins a crusade similar to his manga counterpart to rid the world of crime. However the pair eventually come to a disagreement on how they should deal with law enforcement targeting them, including L and Light's father James. After Mia kills Watari, L's handler, she schemes to steal the notebook from Light, but Light outmaneuvers her and kills her and concocts an elaborate plan through the Death Note, by manipulating a number of criminals to continue his activities as \"Kira\" through the notebook, before all of them commit suicide and induces himself into a medical coma for around a month, which seemingly proves Light's innocence to the authorities. At the end of the film, James presents Light with evidence that he killed his mother's murderer and Light confesses to being Kira and reveals how he cleared himself of suspicion. Meanwhile, L, disgraced by his superiors due to failing to implicate Light and seeking to avenge Watari, considers killing Light with a hidden piece of the notebook he finds in Mia's room. The film ends, as Ryuk laughs to a bed-ridden Light and comments that \"humans are so interesting\".\n\n===In other media===\nIn the [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|2015 drama]], [[Masataka Kubota]] plays the role of Light Yagami.<ref>{{cite web |title=Masataka Kubota, Kento Yamazaki Star in Live-Action Death Note TV Series |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-21/masataka-kubota-kento-yamazaki-star-in-live-action-death-note-tv-series/.88403 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2015-05-21 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref> Similar to the Netflix adaptation, Light is portrayed as less charismatic, insecure and is initially hesitant to kill law enforcement. His relationship with his father Soichiro is also strained due to the death of his mother prior to the start of the series. However, in the later half of the series he grows to demonstrate the same level of ruthlessness, intellect and hubris as his manga counterpart.\n\nLike the Netflix adaption, Light does not obtain the notebook by chance and it is given to him by Ryuk in response to a confrontation with a bully. After again using the notebook to save his father from being held hostage, Light proceeds to use the notebook to kill criminals as Kira. In response to the killings, the detective L leads a police task force alongside Light's father Soichiro to capture Kira. Toward the end of the series, L and Soichiro see through Light's deception and each attempt to convince him to turn himself in. When Light refuses to relent, he is baited into confessing after L and Soichiro both sacrifice their lives. The information obtained from their deaths is relayed to the police task force, who ambush Light in a warehouse in a [[sting operation]] lead by L's successor Near. In a desperate attempt to help him evade capture, Light's accomplice Teru Mikami sets fire to the warehouse but Light is instead trapped by the fire and burns to death.\n\nIn [[Death Note: The Musical|the musical adaptation]], Light is portrayed by [[Kenji Urai]] and Hayato in the Japanese productions and [[Hong Kwang-ho]] and [[Han Ji-sang]] in the Korean productions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kenji Urai, Hayato Kakizawa Star in Death Note Musical |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-07-29/kenji-urai-hayato-kakizawa-star-in-death-note-musical/.77092 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2014-07-29 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\nLight also appears alongside Ryuk as a non-playable story character for the crossover video game ''[[Jump Force]]'', with [[Mamoru Miyano]] reprising his role as Light. He allies himself with the game's heroes until he acquires an ''Umbra Cube'', a tool utilized by the game's antagonists, in order to replace the power of the Death Note that he lost before the game's events.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jump Force Game |url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/jump-force-ps4/ |publisher=[[PlayStation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Analysis===\nOhba described Light as a victim of the Death Note, with Light's life being \"ruined\" once he obtained it. According to Ohba, Light was \"a young man who could understand the pain of others\" when he first encountered the Death Note. Ohba said that if Ryuk never developed an interest in the human world, Light would have become \"one of the greatest police leaders in the world\" who, with L, worked against criminals.<ref>''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 114.</ref> He added that he believed that debating whether Light's actions were good or evil is not \"very important\". Ohba said that he personally sees Light as a \"diabolical\" character.<ref name=\"HowtoThink69\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 69.</ref> Obata said that Light was his second favorite human character and that he was not sure whether that was because he \"liked\" Light or because he drew \"such a diabolical character\" in a magazine for children.<ref name=\"HTR190\">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. 190.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohba, Light sees [[Misa Amane]], whom he uses as an accomplice, as a \"bad person\" who killed people, so he acts emotionally cold towards her and manipulates her, although he pretends to love her, and even says he will marry her. He is only stopped from killing her by the shinigami [[Shinigami (Death Note)#Rem|Rem]], who threatens to kill him if she dies early or if he tries to kill her, despite her knowledge that doing so will cause her own death.<ref name=\"HTR65\"/>\n\nAlthough Light originally had good intentions, he was \"very conceited\", with a \"warped ... desire to be godlike\", bearing love for his family, and intending to transform the world into \"a better place\".<ref name=\"HTR65\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 65.</ref> Ohba also states that Light, \"uncompromising\" when achieving his ideals, \"sullied\" himself by using the Death Note and that his actions \"may have been the result of the purity within him\" prior to obtaining the Death Note.<ref name=\"LightHTRProfile9\">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 9.</ref>\n\nThis purity is demonstrated in Light's personality shift after he temporarily relinquishes the Death Note to ward off suspicion. Losing his memories as Kira along with ownership of the notebook, Light demonstrates compassion, a reluctance to manipulate others and an intense unwillingness to kill. Once his memories return, however, he reverts to his ruthless Kira persona and remains that way until his death. Nevertheless, Ohba states that Light never lost his love for his family since he viewed them as righteous people.<ref name=\"Tsugumi Ohba 2007 Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/viewtopic.php?t=21396363|work=Translated Interview from The Star featured in Gaia Online|title=Tsugumi Ohba Interview|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDouglas Wolk of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' describes Light as \"coldly manipulative\", \"egomaniacal\", and \"an unrepentant [[serial killer]], a butcher on an enormous scale\" who is not \"a [[Freddy Krueger]], a monster who represents pure evil, or a [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[demon]]ic symbol of his age\".

He is portrayed as a brilliant but bored [[genius]] who finds the Death Note, an otherworldly [[supernatural]] notebook that allows the user to kill anyone by knowing their name and face, after it is dropped by the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]]. Frustrated by the status quo of a world he deems to be rotten, Light is eventually driven to use the Death Note to kill those whom he deems morally unworthy of life by masterminding a worldwide massacre as the vigilante {{nihongo|'''Kira'''|\u30ad\u30e9}}. Over the course of his efforts to become the god of a [[utopia]] free of crime, Light is hunted down by a special task-force, headed by an enigmatic consulting detective known as [[L (Death Note)|L]].\n\nIn the [[anime]] adaptation, he is voiced by [[Mamoru Miyano]] in Japanese and by [[Brad Swaile]] in the English version. In the live-action film series, he is portrayed by [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] with Swaile reprising his role as his English dub voice; he is portrayed by both [[Kenji Urai]] and Hayato Kakizawa in the musical; in the TV drama, he is portrayed by [[Masataka Kubota]]; his counterparts in the American film are portrayed by [[Nat Wolff]] and [[Margaret Qualley]].\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[Tsugumi Ohba]], the story writer of ''Death Note'', said that his editor suggested the [[family name]] \"Yagami\" for Light. Ohba said that he did not feel \"too concerned\" about the meaning of the name (the [[Kanji]] for \"Yagami\" are \"night\" and \"god\"); he said that after he created the final scene in the manga he \"liked\" that the final scene created \"deeper significance\" in the name, of Kira worshippers worshipping him at night under the light of the moon \u2013 his given name Light is written with the character for \"moon\".<ref name=\"EnglishHTR61\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''.

As the weekly serialization continued, Obata simplified the design by subconsciously removing \"unnecessary\" lines and felt that he became \"better\" at drawing Light. When Chapter 35 appeared and the editor informed Obata that Light loses his memories, Obata had to draw Light in a similar manner as he appeared in Chapter 1; Obata said \"It was like I had to forget everything I had learned.\" Obata said that he used \"a lot of effort\" to design Light's wardrobe. According to Obata, he encountered difficulty imagining the clothing of \"a brilliant person,\" so he looked through fashion magazines. Obata envisioned Light as a \"smart and formal guy\" who wears formal shirts. Most of Light's clothing in ''Death Note'' is \"fitted\" and Obata avoided [[jeans]].<ref name=\"Light drawing design\">\"Takeshi Obata Production Note: Characters.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''.

His ethics are [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], justifying the most extreme acts in service of his cause. He is also driven by a need for victory, which motivates most of his cruelest acts. Combined with the power of the Death Note, his [[hubris]] and genius-level intellect convince him that only he can save the world. \n\nEventually a small task force of Japanese police officers, including Light's father, under the direction of the eccentric genius detective [[L (Death Note)|L]] begin to close in on Light. Although he suspects Light is Kira, L allows him to collaborate with the police on the case. This begins a game of [[cat and mouse]] between the two, with Light trying to learn L's real name so he can kill him, and L trying to get Light to expose himself so that he can arrest him. Because the actions of [[Misa Amane]], a fervent Kira supporter and fellow Death Note owner, nearly implicates Light, he becomes compelled to temporarily relinquish ownership of his notebook and subsequently loses his memories of using the Death Note. It is during this time that Light reverts to his original persona: a caring, level-headed and empathetic individual unwilling to manipulate others or commit or justify acts of crime, such as murder. After Light regains ownership of his notebook and his memories, he manipulates Misa's Shinigami [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]] into killing L. Light then assumes the \"L\" persona and continues his charade of searching for Kira with the task force while carrying out the killings himself with help from Misa.\n\nOver four years later, Light is able to garner most of the world's support, reaching the point where his followers have begun to worship Kira as a literal deity. However, it is around this time that two of  L's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, [[Mello (Death Note)|Mello]] and [[Near (Death Note)|Near]], begin their investigation against Kira. Near heads the [[SPK (Special Provision for Kira)]], an American investigation team composed of [[CIA]] and [[FBI]] agents, while Mello works with the [[Mafia]]. Although Mello dies working separately from Near, his actions lead [[Teru Mikami]], a man selected by Light to kill criminals using another Death Note, to make a mistake that results in Light's capture by Near, the SPK and Japanese police. Seeing that Light has finally lost, he is killed when Ryuk writes his name in his own Death Note, just as the Shinigami had warned when they first met.<ref name=\"Volume 12: Finis\">{{cite book | last = Ohba | first = Tsugumi | title = Death Note, Volume 12 | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Viz Media]] | isbn = 978-1-4215-1327-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/deathnotevol12fi0012bats }}</ref>\n\n===In film===\n====Japanese film series====\n[[Image:TatsuyaFujiwaraasLightYagami.png|thumb|[[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] as Light in the [[Death Note (2006 film)|''Death Note'' film series]].]]\nIn the Japanese film series, Light Yagami is portrayed by [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]], known for his role as [[Shuya Nanahara]] in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]''. In the films, he is portrayed as a distinguished, popular and intellectually gifted college student, who has a disregard and frustration of the incapability of the law enforcement system to quell the rampant increase in criminal activities around the world, which drives his motives to use the Death Note, to change the world into a utopian society without crime, under the alias of a god-like vigilante known as \"Kira\", much like his manga counterpart. However, some slight changes and modifications were made to the character. At the film's beginning, Light is a first-year law student at a university, instead of still being in high school as in the beginning of the manga and anime. Light's motives also slightly differ; in this version, he uses the Death Note mainly out of his frustration from the perceived failures of the [[Law of Japan|Japanese justice system]]. Light, prior to his discovery of the Death Note, [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]]s into the national police database and finds that the government is unable to prosecute many criminals, either due to lack of evidence or technical loop-holes, among other reasons. Also, Light discovers the Death Note in an alley during a rainy night after encountering an acquitted felon named Takuo Shibuimaru in a night-club. Another difference is that Light meets Ryuk right after killing Shibuimaru with the Death Note. At the end of the first movie, Light reluctantly kills his girlfriend, Shiori Akino, and frames her death as a murder and reason to foster hatred for \"Kira\", in order to join the Kira investigation team as a result of their sympathy.\n\nLight relinquishes ownership of the Death Note to [[Kiyomi Takada]]. After Takada is caught, Light kills her to recover the Death Note, but it is taken by the investigation team. L states that he will test the 13-Day Rule, a fake Death Note rule designed to prove Light and Misa's innocence. Rem, knowing that L's actions will reveal Misa's identity as the second Kira, writes both L and his handler: Watari's names in the Death Note. Light then proceeds to write his father's name in the book, manipulating his father to return the confiscated Death Note. Light confronts his father, but Soichiro does not die. The investigation team members, including L, reveal themselves. Having already written his own name in the Death Note, thus negating Rem's actions, L tells Light that he had just written in a fake note. Light tries to write on a hidden piece of Death Note, but is shot by Matsuda, an investigation team member. Light tells Ryuk to write the team's names, promising to show him many interesting things, and begins to laugh. He stops, however, when Ryuk shows him that he had written just one name: Light's. Light tries to stop Ryuk, but merely passes right through him. As Light begins to succumb to the effects of the Death Note, Ryuk takes this opportunity to reveal to him that humans that have used the Death Note are barred from entering either [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]], instead spending eternity in [[nothing]]ness. Light dies in his father's arms, begging him to believe that he acted as Kira to put the justice, which Soichiro had taught him since his childhood, into practice.\n\nSeveral years after Light's death, however, it is revealed in the sequel film ''[[Death Note: Light Up the New World]]'' that Light has secretly raised a son, Hikari Yagami (\u591c\u795e\u5149 ''Yagami Hikari''), to inherit a Death Note and carry on Kira's legacy. As Hikari becomes of age, the boy is killed by Teru Mikami, his appointed guardian, over control of the notebook. Mikami is then killed by police officer Tsukuru Mishima who decides to use the notebook to continue Light's work in ridding the world of crime. During the course of the film, Mishima is eventually caught by police and he willingly turns himself in and the notebook to the authorities, seemingly thus ending Kira's legacy. A [[mid-credits scene]] reveals a video recorded by Light addressing the film's events to have occurred just as he has expected them to, teasing his potential resurrection.\n\n====American film====\n{{originalresearch|section|date=October 2019}}\n[[Nat Wolff]] portrays the character's counterpart, \"Light Turner\": a Seattle high school student, in [[Death Note (2017 film)|the American film adaptation]], as an intelligent yet quiet and socially introverted teenager, who stumbles across the mystical Death Note and eventually decides to use the notebook's god-like abilities to commit a worldwide massacre, in order to change the world into a utopian society without crime, under the alias of a literal human deity: \"Kira\", while being hunted down by an elite task-force of law enforcement officials within Seattle City, led by an enigmatic international detective known as L and his own father, veteran Seattle police detective: James Turner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/nat-wolff-adam-wingard-death-note-1201605146/|title='Paper Towns'' Nat Wolff to Star in Adam Wingard's 'Death Note'|publisher=Variety|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=September 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Warners' Live-Action Death Note Film Casts Nat Wolff |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-29/warners-live-action-death-note-film-casts-nat-wolff/.93552 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2015-09-29 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref> [[Margaret Qualley]] portrays Mia Sutton (based on the sociopathic qualities of Light Yagami<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-netflixs-death-note-is-really-an-origin-story-and-w-1798435941|title=Why Netflix's Death Note Is Really an Origin Story and Where a Sequel Could Go|last=Trendacosta|first=Katharine|work=io9|date=August 28, 2017|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref>), Light's girlfriend who assists him in his activities as \"Kira\". In this adaptation, Light has vast character differences from his manga counterpart, lacks much of the sociopathic, malicious and ruthless qualities of the original character, is more naive, sympathetic and idealistic, does not have a sister and has lost his mother in a hit and run incident, which partially serves as his inspiration to operate as Kira. He has a close yet somewhat strained relationship with his father and while considered academically gifted by peers and authorities, is not a popular student and is considered as a social outsider and lacks friends. Unlike his manga counterpart, he is also far less charismatic and confident, but more morally driven and demonstrates a reluctance to murder innocents and law enforcement individuals attempting to capture him, while eventually demonstrating a more darker, morally ambiguous, cunning and meticulous personality, towards the film's ending. Furthermore, instead of obtaining the notebook by chance, Ryuk deliberately hands Light the Death Note, in order to entertain himself and to see how an indifferent high schooler would utilize the Death Note's god-like abilities.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter being enticed to kill a bully by Ryuk, Light murders the criminal who killed his mother. Along with Mia Sutton, his classmate and love interest, Light begins a crusade similar to his manga counterpart to rid the world of crime. However the pair eventually come to a disagreement on how they should deal with law enforcement targeting them, including L and Light's father James. After Mia kills Watari, L's handler, she schemes to steal the notebook from Light, but Light outmaneuvers her and kills her and concocts an elaborate plan through the Death Note, by manipulating a number of criminals to continue his activities as \"Kira\" through the notebook, before all of them commit suicide and induces himself into a medical coma for around a month, which seemingly proves Light's innocence to the authorities. At the end of the film, James presents Light with evidence that he killed his mother's murderer and Light confesses to being Kira and reveals how he cleared himself of suspicion. Meanwhile, L, disgraced by his superiors due to failing to implicate Light and seeking to avenge Watari, considers killing Light with a hidden piece of the notebook he finds in Mia's room.

However, in the later half of the series he grows to demonstrate the same level of ruthlessness, intellect and hubris as his manga counterpart.\n\nLike the Netflix adaption, Light does not obtain the notebook by chance and it is given to him by Ryuk in response to a confrontation with a bully. After again using the notebook to save his father from being held hostage, Light proceeds to use the notebook to kill criminals as Kira. In response to the killings, the detective L leads a police task force alongside Light's father Soichiro to capture Kira. Toward the end of the series, L and Soichiro see through Light's deception and each attempt to convince him to turn himself in. When Light refuses to relent, he is baited into confessing after L and Soichiro both sacrifice their lives. The information obtained from their deaths is relayed to the police task force, who ambush Light in a warehouse in a [[sting operation]] lead by L's successor Near. In a desperate attempt to help him evade capture, Light's accomplice Teru Mikami sets fire to the warehouse but Light is instead trapped by the fire and burns to death.\n\nIn [[Death Note: The Musical|the musical adaptation]], Light is portrayed by [[Kenji Urai]] and Hayato in the Japanese productions and [[Hong Kwang-ho]] and [[Han Ji-sang]] in the Korean productions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kenji Urai, Hayato Kakizawa Star in Death Note Musical |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-07-29/kenji-urai-hayato-kakizawa-star-in-death-note-musical/.77092 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2014-07-29 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\nLight also appears alongside Ryuk as a non-playable story character for the crossover video game ''[[Jump Force]]'', with [[Mamoru Miyano]] reprising his role as Light. He allies himself with the game's heroes until he acquires an ''Umbra Cube'', a tool utilized by the game's antagonists, in order to replace the power of the Death Note that he lost before the game's events.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jump Force Game |url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/jump-force-ps4/ |publisher=[[PlayStation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Analysis===\nOhba described Light as a victim of the Death Note, with Light's life being \"ruined\" once he obtained it. According to Ohba, Light was \"a young man who could understand the pain of others\" when he first encountered the Death Note. Ohba said that if Ryuk never developed an interest in the human world, Light would have become \"one of the greatest police leaders in the world\" who, with L, worked against criminals.<ref>''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 114.</ref> He added that he believed that debating whether Light's actions were good or evil is not \"very important\". Ohba said that he personally sees Light as a \"diabolical\" character.<ref name=\"HowtoThink69\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 69.</ref> Obata said that Light was his second favorite human character and that he was not sure whether that was because he \"liked\" Light or because he drew \"such a diabolical character\" in a magazine for children.<ref name=\"HTR190\">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. 190.</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohba, Light sees [[Misa Amane]], whom he uses as an accomplice, as a \"bad person\" who killed people, so he acts emotionally cold towards her and manipulates her, although he pretends to love her, and even says he will marry her. He is only stopped from killing her by the shinigami [[Shinigami (Death Note)#Rem|Rem]], who threatens to kill him if she dies early or if he tries to kill her, despite her knowledge that doing so will cause her own death.<ref name=\"HTR65\"/>\n\nAlthough Light originally had good intentions, he was \"very conceited\", with a \"warped ... desire to be godlike\", bearing love for his family, and intending to transform the world into \"a better place\".<ref name=\"HTR65\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 65.</ref> Ohba also states that Light, \"uncompromising\" when achieving his ideals, \"sullied\" himself by using the Death Note and that his actions \"may have been the result of the purity within him\" prior to obtaining the Death Note.<ref name=\"LightHTRProfile9\">''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 9.</ref>\n\nThis purity is demonstrated in Light's personality shift after he temporarily relinquishes the Death Note to ward off suspicion. Losing his memories as Kira along with ownership of the notebook, Light demonstrates compassion, a reluctance to manipulate others and an intense unwillingness to kill. Once his memories return, however, he reverts to his ruthless Kira persona and remains that way until his death. Nevertheless, Ohba states that Light never lost his love for his family since he viewed them as righteous people.<ref name=\"Tsugumi Ohba 2007 Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/viewtopic.php?t=21396363|work=Translated Interview from The Star featured in Gaia Online|title=Tsugumi Ohba Interview|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDouglas Wolk of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' describes Light as \"coldly manipulative\", \"egomaniacal\", and \"an unrepentant [[serial killer]], a butcher on an enormous scale\" who is not \"a [[Freddy Krueger]], a monster who represents pure evil, or a [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[demon]]ic symbol of his age\".
