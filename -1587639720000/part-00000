According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]\nBy the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Acadians that returned from exile discovered several thousand immigrants, mostly from New England, on their former lands.

New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]].

Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.

It cost less than $35,000, largely due to a volunteer cast and the free loan of the most sophisticated video equipment available at the time. The cast included [[Dan Aykroyd]] in character as [[Beldar Conehead]], professional wrestling [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] \"Captain\" [[Lou Albano]] in the role of Lauper's father while her real mother, Catrine, played herself. Lauper would later appear in [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] storylines opposite Albano and guest-star in an episode of ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'', in which Albano portrayed [[Mario]] (Albano also played himself in the episode). This collaboration was the catalyst for the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling\" connection that would last the next two years. Lauper's attorney, Elliot Hoffman, appeared as her uptight dancing partner. Also in the cast were Lauper's manager, David Wolf, her brother, Butch Lauper, fellow musician [[Steve Forbert]], and a bevy of secretaries borrowed from Portrait/CBS, Lauper's record label. A clip of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' is featured as Lauper watches it on television.\n\n[[Lorne Michaels]] (Broadway Video, SNL), another of Hoffman's clients, agreed to give Lauper free run of his brand new million-dollar digital editing equipment, with which she and her producer created several first-time-ever computer-generated images of Lauper dancing with her buttoned-up lawyer, leading the entire cast in a snake-dance through New York streets and ending up in Lauper's bedroom in her home. The bedroom scene is an homage to the famous stateroom scene in the Marx Brothers' film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]''.\n\n\"The year 1983 makes a watershed in the history of female-address video.

the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] since \"[[My First Night Without You]]\" in 1989.\n\nThis song is a new [[reggae]]-tinged arrangement of Lauper's own \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" standard, with a musical tip of the hat to [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]]'s \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\". The arrangement evolved as she experimented with the song's style over the course of the 1993\u20131994 Hat Full of Stars Tour. The song was a big comeback hit for Lauper, landing in the top 10 and top 40 in several countries. It was also a big dance hit in the United States. It peaked at No. 4 in the UK and New Zealand, its highest position.\n\n=== Track listing ===\n'''European CD Single / UK Cassette Single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/845568</ref><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/219413</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hat Full of Stars\" - 4:27\n\n'''CD single (US/UK) / European CD Maxi-Single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/9882864</ref><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/204507</ref><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/752508</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) (Edit) - 4:09\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n# \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" (Original Version) - 3:54\n\n'''Japanese CD single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/2391364</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) (Edit) - 4:09\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n\n'''Australian CD single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/6360023</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Dancehall Main featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:50\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Harder Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:49\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Lounge Mix featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 6:12\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) (Edit) - 4:09\n\n'''European 12\"'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/404455</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Dancehall Main featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:50\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Harder Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:49\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Lounge Mix featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 6:12\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Lounge Dub featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 6:00\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) - 6:00\n\n=== Charts ===\n'''Weekly charts'''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1994\u201395)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref name=ryan>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988\u20132010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.

Lauper\u2019s version gained recognition as a feminist anthem and was promoted by a Grammy-winning [[music video]]. It has been [[cover version|covered]], either as a studio recording or in a live performance, by over 30 other artists.\n\nThe single was Lauper's breakthrough hit, reaching number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and becoming a worldwide hit throughout late 1983 and early 1984. It remains one of Lauper's signature songs and was a widely popular song during the era of its release, [[1980s in music|the 1980s]].

Hazard's version was written from a male point of view. Lauper's version appeared on her 1983 debut solo record, ''[[She's So Unusual]]''. The track is a synthesizer-backed anthem, from a feminist point of view, conveying the point that all women really want is to have the same experiences that men can.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/30/cyndi-lauper-on-capitol-hill-and-the-secret-feminist-history-of-girls-just-wanna-have-fun/|title=Cyndi Lauper and the secret feminist history of \u2018Girls Just Want to Have Fun\u2019|last=Moyer|first=Justin Wm|date=2015-04-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-14|last2=Kaplan|first2=Sarah|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Gillian G.

It cost less than $35,000, largely due to a volunteer cast and the free loan of the most sophisticated video equipment available at the time. The cast included [[Dan Aykroyd]] in character as [[Beldar Conehead]], professional wrestling [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] \"Captain\" [[Lou Albano]] in the role of Lauper's father while her real mother, Catrine, played herself. Lauper would later appear in [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] storylines opposite Albano and guest-star in an episode of ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'', in which Albano portrayed [[Mario]] (Albano also played himself in the episode). This collaboration was the catalyst for the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling\" connection that would last the next two years. Lauper's attorney, Elliot Hoffman, appeared as her uptight dancing partner. Also in the cast were Lauper's manager, David Wolf, her brother, Butch Lauper, fellow musician [[Steve Forbert]], and a bevy of secretaries borrowed from Portrait/CBS, Lauper's record label. A clip of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' is featured as Lauper watches it on television.\n\n[[Lorne Michaels]] (Broadway Video, SNL), another of Hoffman's clients, agreed to give Lauper free run of his brand new million-dollar digital editing equipment, with which she and her producer created several first-time-ever computer-generated images of Lauper dancing with her buttoned-up lawyer, leading the entire cast in a snake-dance through New York streets and ending up in Lauper's bedroom in her home. The bedroom scene is an homage to the famous stateroom scene in the Marx Brothers' film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]''.\n\n\"The year 1983 makes a watershed in the history of female-address video. It is the year that certain issues and representations began to gain saliency and the textual strategies of female address began to coalesce.\" In the video, Lauper wanted to show in a more fun and light-hearted manner that girls want the same equality and recognition boys had in society.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender Politics and MTV: Voicing the Difference|last = Lewis|first = Lisa A.|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 1990|isbn = |location = |pages = 117}}</ref>\n\nBefore the song starts, the beginning of her version of \"[[He's So Unusual]]\" plays.\n\nThe music video was directed by [[Edd Griles]]. The producer was Ken Walz while the cinematographer was Francis Kenny. The treatment for the video was co-written by Griles, Walz, and Cyndi Lauper. The video was shot in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in summer 1983 and premiered on television in December 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=16167|title=mvdbase.com \u2013 Cyndi Lauper - \"Girls just want to have fun\"|work=mvdbase.com}}</ref>\nThe choreography was by a New York dance and music troupe called XXY featuring Mary Ellen Strom, Cyndi Lee and Pierce Turner.\n\n== Critical reception ==\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#bcbcbc;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#bcbcbc;\"|By\n! style=\"background:#bcbcbc;\"|List\n! style=\"background:#bcbcbc;\"|Work\n! style=\"background:#bcbcbc;\"|Ranked\n|-\n|1985\n|''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|''[[Pazz & Jop]]'' critics' poll of 1984\n|rowspan=5|\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Pazz & Jop critics' poll of 1984|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres84.php|newspaper=The Village Voice|accessdate=May 12, 2015|year=1985}}</ref>\n|10\n|-\n|1993\n|''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|The 100 Top Music Videos<ref name=\"rockonthenet.com\" />\n|22\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1999\n|MTV\n|100 Greatest Videos Ever Made<ref>{{cite web|title=VH1: '100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll'|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1999/vh1women.htm|work=VH1|publisher=Rock On The Net|accessdate=17 June 2012|year=1999}}</ref>\n|58\n|-\n|2001\n|rowspan=2|[[VH1]]\n|100 Greatest Videos<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n|45\n|-\n|rowspan=1|2006\n|rowspan=1|100 Greatest Songs of the 80's<ref>{{cite web|title=VH1: '100 Greatest Songs of the 80's'|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2006/vh180s.htm|work=VH1|publisher=Rock On The Net.|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref>\n|23\n|}\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|1983\n|rowspan=\"9\"|\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\"\n|American Video Awards for Best Female Performance\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|1984]]\n|[[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Concept Video]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[MTV Video Music Award \u2013 Viewer's Choice]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Overall Performance]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Grammy Awards of 1985|1985]] || [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] || {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] || {{nom}}\n{{end}}\n\n== Chart performance ==\nThe song was released in late 1983 but much of its success on the charts came during the first half of 1984.

The arrangement evolved as she experimented with the song's style over the course of the 1993\u20131994 Hat Full of Stars Tour. The song was a big comeback hit for Lauper, landing in the top 10 and top 40 in several countries. It was also a big dance hit in the United States. It peaked at No. 4 in the UK and New Zealand, its highest position.\n\n=== Track listing ===\n'''European CD Single / UK Cassette Single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/845568</ref><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/219413</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hat Full of Stars\" - 4:27\n\n'''CD single (US/UK) / European CD Maxi-Single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/9882864</ref><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/204507</ref><ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/752508</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) (Edit) - 4:09\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n# \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" (Original Version) - 3:54\n\n'''Japanese CD single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/2391364</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) (Edit) - 4:09\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n\n'''Australian CD single'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/6360023</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Single Edit) - 3:39\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Dancehall Main featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:50\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Harder Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:49\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Lounge Mix featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 6:12\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) (Edit) - 4:09\n\n'''European 12\"'''<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Cyndi-Lauper-Hey-Now-Girls-Just-Want-To-Have-Fun/release/404455</ref>\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Pop Goes the Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:04\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Dancehall Main featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:50\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Remix Harder Dancehall featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 5:49\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Sly & Robbie's Home Grown Version featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 4:16\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Lounge Mix featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 6:12\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Vasquez Lounge Dub featuring [[Snow (musician)|Snow]]) - 6:00\n# \"Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)\" (Mickey Bennett's Carnival Version featuring [[Patra (singer)|Patra]]) - 6:00\n\n=== Charts ===\n'''Weekly charts'''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1994\u201395)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref name=ryan>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988\u20132010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.

A [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] of 20 [[Carthage (state)|Carthaginian]] ships commanded by [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]] surprised 17 [[Roman Republic|Roman]] ships under the senior [[Roman consul|consul]] for the year [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]] in [[Lipara]] harbour. The inexperienced Romans made a poor showing, with all 17 of their ships captured, along with their commander.\n\nThe Romans had recently built a fleet in order to contest the Carthaginians' maritime control of the western Mediterranean and Scipio had impetuously ventured to [[Aeolian Islands|the Liparas]] with the advance squadron. This was the first encounter between the Roman and Carthaginian fleets during the war. Scipio was ransomed after the battle and known thereafter as ''Asina'' (Latin for \"female donkey\"). The Romans went on to win the following two, larger, naval encounters and establish a rough sea-going parity.\n\n==Primary sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}} 118&nbsp;BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167&nbsp;BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is best known for his work [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146&nbsp;BC, or about a century after the battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] have been recovered from the site of the [[Battle of the Aegates]], the final battle of the war, fought nineteen years later.

The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 260&nbsp;BC the war had lasted four years, and the Romans had pushed forward into Sicily, with a number of successes, including the [[battle of Agrigentum|capture of Agrigentum]], an important Carthaginian base. However, the Carthaginian navy repeatedly raided the Romans' rear areas and even the coast of Italy. Their control of the sea also made it impossible for the Romans to successfully [[blockade]] those Carthaginian cities which were on the coast. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}}\n\n===Ships===\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a trireme|{{center|Depiction of the position of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek [[trireme]]}}]]\n\nDuring this war the standard warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100&nbsp;[[long tons]] (110&nbsp;[[short tons]]; 100&nbsp;tonnes). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested they could maintain 7&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8&nbsp;mph; 13&nbsp;km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5&nbsp;knots (10&nbsp;mph; 16&nbsp;km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Vessels were built as [[cataphract]], or \"protected\", ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}}\n\nIn 260&nbsp;BC the Romans set out to construct a [[Roman navy|fleet]] and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which made them slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], so ubiquitous that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300, of which 280 were oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would normally also carry a complement of 40 marines,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} and if battle was thought to be imminent, this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n[[File:Greek Galleys.jpg|thumb|Recreation of a fleet of triremes]]\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, as well as execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a [[Naval ram|ram]], a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]] and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the [[Hellenistic-era warships|larger and heavier vessels]] adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram's effect even in the case of a successful attack.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}{{sfn|Wallinga|1956|pp=77\u201390}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead their military forces. The [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]], the year's [[consul|senior consul]], was given command of the fleet. He put to sea with the first 17 ships produced. As the first ever Roman warships they spent some time training in home waters before sailing to [[Messana]]. There they prepared for the main fleet's arrival and supported the logistics of the Roman army at the sea crossing to Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=183\u20134}}\n\n==Battle==\nWhile Scipio was at the [[Strait of Messina]] he received information that the garrison of [[Lipara]] was willing to defect to the Roman side. Lipara was the main port of the Lipari Islands and was a constant threat to Roman communications across the Strait. Though his crews were still inexperienced and the newly designed and built ships were still undergoing their sea trials, the consul could not resist the temptation of conquering an important city without a fight and sailed to Lipara. It has been suggested by some ancient sources that the offer to surrender Lipara was a ruse inspired by Carthage to encourage the Romans to commit their ships where they could be ambushed, but the sources do not give much detail and are usually pro-Roman.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}}\n\nThe Romans entered the harbour at Lipara. The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by [[Hannibal Gisco]], the general who had commanded the garrison at Agrigentum, and was based at Panormus (modern-day [[Palermo]]) some {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Lipari. When he heard of the Romans' advance to Lipara he despatched 20 ships under [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]], a Carthaginian aristocrat, to the town. The Carthaginians arrived at night and trapped the Romans in the harbour. Bo\u00f6des led his ships in an attack on the Romans inside the harbour the next morning. Scipio's men offered little resistance. The inexperienced crews were no match for the well-drilled Carthaginians and were rapidly outfought. Some Romans panicked and fled inland and the consul himself was taken prisoner, along with many of the other Roman senior officers. Some later accounts have Scipio treacherously captured while [[parley]]ing, but this is probably a Roman fabrication. All of the Roman ships were captured, most with little damage.{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=184\u20135}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u20136}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}} The battle was little more than a skirmish, and is mostly notable as the first naval encounter of the Punic Wars and the first time Roman warships had engaged in battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nScipio was later released, probably ransomed. His easy defeat earned him the pejorative ''[[Roman naming convention|cognomen]]'' Asina, which means ''donkey'' in Latin. This cognomen was all the more insulting because \"asina\" was the feminine form of the word donkey, as opposed to the masculine form \"asinus\". In spite of this Scipio's career prospered and he was consul for a second time in 254 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=181}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}}\n\nShortly after the Lipara victory, Hannibal Gisco was scouting with 50 Carthaginian ships when he encountered the full Roman fleet. He escaped, but lost most of his ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=67}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}} It was after this skirmish that the Romans installed the {{lang|la|[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]}} on their ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=68}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=182}} The {{lang|la|corvus}} was a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck. This allowed [[Roman legion|Roman legionaries]] acting as marines to [[Naval boarding|board enemy ships]] and capture them, rather than employing the previously [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|traditional tactic]] of [[ramming]].{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}} Scipio's fellow consul, [[Gaius Duilius]], placed the Roman army units under subordinates and took command of the fleet.

A [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] of 20 [[Carthage (state)|Carthaginian]] ships commanded by [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]] surprised 17 [[Roman Republic|Roman]] ships under the senior [[Roman consul|consul]] for the year [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]] in [[Lipara]] harbour. The inexperienced Romans made a poor showing, with all 17 of their ships captured, along with their commander.\n\nThe Romans had recently built a fleet in order to contest the Carthaginians' maritime control of the western Mediterranean and Scipio had impetuously ventured to [[Aeolian Islands|the Liparas]] with the advance squadron. This was the first encounter between the Roman and Carthaginian fleets during the war. Scipio was ransomed after the battle and known thereafter as ''Asina'' (Latin for \"female donkey\"). The Romans went on to win the following two, larger, naval encounters and establish a rough sea-going parity.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}} 118&nbsp;BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167&nbsp;BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is best known for his work [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146&nbsp;BC, or about a century after the battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] have been recovered from the site of the [[Battle of the Aegates]], the final battle of the war, fought nineteen years later.

The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 260&nbsp;BC the war had lasted four years, and the Romans had pushed forward into Sicily, with a number of successes, including the [[battle of Agrigentum|capture of Agrigentum]], an important Carthaginian base. However, the Carthaginian navy repeatedly raided the Romans' rear areas and even the coast of Italy. Their control of the sea also made it impossible for the Romans to successfully [[blockade]] those Carthaginian cities which were on the coast. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}}\n\n===Ships===\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a trireme|{{center|Depiction of the position of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek [[trireme]]}}]]\n\nDuring this war the standard warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100&nbsp;[[long tons]] (110&nbsp;[[short tons]]; 100&nbsp;tonnes). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested they could maintain 7&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8&nbsp;mph; 13&nbsp;km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5&nbsp;knots (10&nbsp;mph; 16&nbsp;km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Vessels were built as [[cataphract]], or \"protected\", ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}}\n\nIn 260&nbsp;BC the Romans set out to construct a [[Roman navy|fleet]] and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which made them slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], so ubiquitous that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300, of which 280 were oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would normally also carry a complement of 40 marines,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} and if battle was thought to be imminent, this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n[[File:Greek Galleys.jpg|thumb|Recreation of a fleet of triremes]]\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, as well as execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a [[Naval ram|ram]], a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]] and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the [[Hellenistic-era warships|larger and heavier vessels]] adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram's effect even in the case of a successful attack.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}{{sfn|Wallinga|1956|pp=77\u201390}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead their military forces. The [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]], the year's [[consul|senior consul]], was given command of the fleet. He put to sea with the first 17 ships produced. As the first ever Roman warships they spent some time training in home waters before sailing to [[Messana]]. There they prepared for the main fleet's arrival and supported the logistics of the Roman army at the sea crossing to Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=183\u20134}}\n\n==Battle==\nWhile Scipio was at the [[Strait of Messina]] he received information that the garrison of [[Lipara]] was willing to defect to the Roman side. Lipara was the main port of the Lipari Islands and was a constant threat to Roman communications across the Strait. Though his crews were still inexperienced and the newly designed and built ships were still undergoing their sea trials, the consul could not resist the temptation of conquering an important city without a fight and sailed to Lipara. It has been suggested by some ancient sources that the offer to surrender Lipara was a ruse inspired by Carthage to encourage the Romans to commit their ships where they could be ambushed, but the sources do not give much detail and are usually pro-Roman.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}}\n\nThe Romans entered the harbour at Lipara. The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by [[Hannibal Gisco]], the general who had commanded the garrison at Agrigentum, and was based at Panormus (modern-day [[Palermo]]) some {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Lipari. When he heard of the Romans' advance to Lipara he despatched 20 ships under [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]], a Carthaginian aristocrat, to the town. The Carthaginians arrived at night and trapped the Romans in the harbour. Bo\u00f6des led his ships in an attack on the Romans inside the harbour the next morning. Scipio's men offered little resistance. The inexperienced crews were no match for the well-drilled Carthaginians and were rapidly outfought. Some Romans panicked and fled inland and the consul himself was taken prisoner, along with many of the other Roman senior officers. Some later accounts have Scipio treacherously captured while [[parley]]ing, but this is probably a Roman fabrication. All of the Roman ships were captured, most with little damage.{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=184\u20135}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u20136}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}} The battle was little more than a skirmish, and is mostly notable as the first naval encounter of the Punic Wars and the first time Roman warships had engaged in battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nScipio was later released, probably ransomed. His easy defeat earned him the pejorative ''[[Roman naming convention|cognomen]]'' Asina, which means ''donkey'' in Latin. This cognomen was all the more insulting because \"asina\" was the feminine form of the word donkey, as opposed to the masculine form \"asinus\". In spite of this Scipio's career prospered and he was consul for a second time in 254 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=181}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}}\n\nShortly after the Lipara victory, Hannibal Gisco was scouting with 50 Carthaginian ships when he encountered the full Roman fleet. He escaped, but lost most of his ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=67}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}} It was after this skirmish that the Romans installed the {{lang|la|[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]}} on their ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=68}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=182}} The {{lang|la|corvus}} was a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck.

The roots of ''abhinaya'' appear in the ''Natyashastra'' text, which defines drama in verse 6.10 as something that aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} A performance art, asserts ''Natyashastra'', connects the artists and the audience through ''abhinaya'' (literally, \"carrying to the spectators\"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art that engages every aspect of life to glorify and give a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=160\n| image1=Hasthamudra8.JPG |width1=3072|height1=2304\n| image2=Hasthamudra18.JPG |width2=3072|height2=2304\n| image3=Hasthamudra11.JPG |width3=3072|height3=2304\n| image4=Hasthamudra7.JPG |width4=3072|height4=2304\n| image5=Hasthamudra19.JPG | width5=3072|height5=2304\n| image6=Hasthamudra17.JPG |width6=3072|height6=2304\n| footer=Example ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]'' \u2013 gestures as symbols in Bharatanatyam.\n}}\n\nThe communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/> In the Hindu texts on dance, the dancer successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\">{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref> ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/>\n\nThe gestures used in Bharatanatyam are called ''Hasta'' (or ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]''). These symbols are of three types: ''asamyuta hastas'' (single hand gestures), ''samyuta hastas'' (two hand gestures) and ''nrtta hastas'' (dance hand gestures).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p85\"/> Like words in a glossary, these gestures are presented in the ''nritta'' as a list or embellishment to a prelim performance.

The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/> In the Hindu texts on dance, the dancer successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\">{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref> ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/>\n\nThe gestures used in Bharatanatyam are called ''Hasta'' (or ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]''). These symbols are of three types: ''asamyuta hastas'' (single hand gestures), ''samyuta hastas'' (two hand gestures) and ''nrtta hastas'' (dance hand gestures).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p85\"/> Like words in a glossary, these gestures are presented in the ''nritta'' as a list or embellishment to a prelim performance.
