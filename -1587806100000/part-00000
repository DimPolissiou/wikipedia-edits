She was the first and, to date, only woman to hold the position of president in Nicaragua.\n\nBorn into a landed family in southern [[Nicaragua]], Chamorro was partially educated in the United States. After returning to her home country, she married and raised a family. Her husband, [[Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Cardenal]], was a journalist working at his family's newspaper, ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]'', which he later inherited. As a result of his anti-government stance, he was often jailed or exiled, forcing Chamorro to spend a decade following him abroad or visiting him in jail. When he was assassinated in 1978, Chamorro took over the newspaper. Pedro's murder strengthened the Nicaraguan Revolution and his image, as wielded by his widow, became a powerful symbol for the opposition forces. Initially, when the [[Sandinista]]s were victorious over [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], Chamorro fully supported them. She agreed to become part of the provisional government established under the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] ({{lang-es|Junta de Gobierno de Reconstrucci\u00f3n Nacional}}, JGRN); however, when the Junta began moving in a more radical direction and signed agreements with the [[Soviet Union]], Chamorro resigned and returned to the newspaper.\n\nUnder her direction, ''La Prensa'' continued to criticize the government and its policies despite threats and government-forced shutdowns. When [[Daniel Ortega]] announced that elections would be held in 1990, Chamorro was selected as the candidate for the opposition group known as the [[National Opposition Union]] ({{lang-es|Uni\u00f3n Nacional Opositora}}, UNO). This 14-party alliance ranged from [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[liberalism|liberals]] to [[communism|communists]] and because of idealistic differences had difficulty in devising any political platform other than a promise to end the war. Despite polls indicating a victory for the incumbent Sandinista President Ortega, Chamorro won the [[1990 Nicaraguan general election|election]] on 25 February 1990, becoming the first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female head of state]] in the [[Americas]].\n\nChamorro was sworn into office on 25 April 1990. Chamorro's leadership covered six difficult years marked by economic strife and social unrest, but she was able to compromise with rivals, maintain a constitutional regime, re-establish international banking relationships and end the hyperinflation that had plagued the country for several years.\n\nAfter leaving office on 10 January 1997, Chamorro worked on several international peace initiatives until poor health forced her to retire from public life.\n\n==Early life==\nVioleta Barrios Torres was born on 18 October 1929 in [[Rivas, Nicaragua|Rivas]], a small city near the Nicaraguan border with [[Costa Rica]], to Carlos Jos\u00e9 Barrios Sacasa and Amalia Torres Hurtado.<ref name=\"Pallais (1992)\">{{cite journal|last1=Pallais|first1=Mar\u00eda L|title=Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.

In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]''. He took over publishing and under his direction, the paper became a voice of opposition to the Somoza regime. Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for the content of the paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children. She followed him; if he was forced to leave, she left the children with family and traveled to be with him; if he was jailed, she was reunited with the children and visited him.{{Sfn|Baldwin|1996|p=100}} Chamorro's earnings from a rental property that her mother had given her gave the couple a steady income. When her husband was [[assassinated]] on 10 January 1978, she took over control of the newspaper.{{Sfn|Leiken|2003|p=74}}\n\nOver the years, Chamorro's family has been split into feuding factions based upon political association. Two of her children, Pedro and Cristiana, worked at ''La Prensa'', although Pedro left Nicaragua in 1984 to join the [[Contras]]. Her other children were active Sandinistas; Claudia was ambassador to Costa Rica and Carlos became the editor of the [[FSLN]] daily newspaper ''[[Barricada (FSLN)|Barricada]]''.  In spite of the conflicting political views of her children, Chamorro encouraged and hosted family dinners during which she insisted political affiliations were temporarily put aside in the interest of family harmony.{{Sfn|Beckman|D'Amico|1995|pp=34\u201336}}\n\n==Rise to power==\nThe assassination of Chamorro's husband sparked the [[Sandinista Revolution]].

One of the most contentious provisions, the one banning [[nepotism]] was conceded by Chamorro. Both sides claimed victory,<ref name=\"CS Monitor\" /> though the Supreme Court issue was still not resolved with the Assembly insisting their appointees were valid and the President refusing to acknowledge them.<ref name=\"New Nicaraguan Constitution\" />\n\nAs in other crises, Chamorro's ability to compromise was pivotal. The executive and legislative branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but the president had to be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government;{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=132}} and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote.{{sfn|Bothmann|2015|p=174}} Though some of the changes also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures\u2014creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=46}}\u2014failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration's ability to prosecute,{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=56}} it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek transitional justice.  [[Sof\u00eda Montenegro]], editor of the Sandinistan paper ''Barricada'' and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse if she could have, but others, like Bishop Bernardo Hombach, are confident that her faith would have required her to forgive. Prosecutions would have prolonged conflict and harsh retaliation would not have brought about the reconciliation and peace she desired.{{sfn|Bothmann|2015|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\n===Gender consequences===\nThough 15 delegates of her parliament (16%) were women, few advances in women's rights were made during Chamorro's administration.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=261}} Chamorro was not a feminist, since her beliefs prevented her from advocating many of the goals of traditional feminism. She was against abortion and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into [[prostitution]] and crime.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}} According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into \"street professions\", elevating security risks and increasing the rate of drop outs, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution.<ref name=\"prostitution, delinquency, drug use\">{{cite web|last1=Committee on the Rights of the Child|title=Country analysis: Nicaragua: Nicaragua. 10/17/1994|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/4e6a2923d2c6d19f4125615100606318?Opendocument|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=6 September 2015|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date=21 October 1994}}</ref> In addition, austerity measures that eliminated free health care made it difficult for the poor to afford care. The Sandinista Workers Central ({{lang-es|Central Sandinista De Trabajadores}}, CST) stepped in to offer health care and child care to women who could not afford the new government plan.{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=135}} She did support women's rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband's support. Her administration did not actively prepare or encourage women's participation in political life, nor did she appoint women to governmental positions.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}}\n\nThe economic policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment outside the home in Nicaragua steadily increased during the same time frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.{{sfn|Chavez Metoyer|2000|p=5}}\n\nThe 1992 Sexual Crime Code modifications resulted in winners and losers. Previously, the Penal Code had the penalty for rape specified as 8 to 12 years in prison (compared to 6 to 14 for simple homicide).<ref name=\"Morgan (1995)\">{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Martha I.|title=The Bitter and the Sweet: Feminist Efforts to Reform Nicaraguan Rape and Sodomy Laws|journal=University of Miami Inter-American Law Review|date=July 1995|volume=26|issue=3|pages=439\u2013488|url=http://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1379&context=umialr|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=University of Miami School of Law|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> However, it also defined some lesser sexual crimes in a way designed to protect the interests of fathers and husbands more than of the women themselves; for example, the penalty for \"kidnapping of a virgin [...] when her guardians were away or without violence\" depended on whether marriage was intended. Victoria Gonz\u00e1lez-Rivera writes that prior to the 1992 changes, rape had been considered a private affair and the law encouraged women to marry their rapists or accept a monetary settlement.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez-Rivera|2011|p=50}} UNO women and FSLN women in the National Assembly joined forces after Chamorro won the election and formed a Commission on Women, Youth, Children and the Family and began to discuss reform of the sexual crimes law. Convincing 18 bipartisan legislators to introduce a reform, they asked for increasing penalties for rape (to 15 to 20 years), decriminalization for abortion if the pregnancy was the result of rape and decriminalization of consensual sodomy. When the final bill passed, the approved version eliminated the exception for abortion for rape victims and not only did not decriminalize sodomy, but increased the scope of the existing law to include \"inducing, promoting or propagandizing\" homosexual conduct.<ref name=\"Morgan (1995)\"/> The new anti-sodomy law was the most repressive law of its type in Latin America,{{sfn|Borland|2006|p=128}} changing the imposed a sentence for \"anyone who induces, promotes, propagandizes, or practices sex among persons of the same sex in a scandalous manner\" to as much as three years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Joe|title=Nicaragua to decriminalise gay sex|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/11/16/nicaragua-to-decriminalise-gay-sex/|accessdate=8 April 2017|newspaper=[[PinkNews]]|date=16 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518085413/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/11/16/nicaragua-to-decriminalise-gay-sex/|archivedate=18 May 2016|location=London, England}}</ref> Chamorro rejected calls to veto the law and sent it for publication in ''La Gaceta'', a legal requirement for a statute to become law.

'''Violeta Barrios Torres'''; 18 October 1929) is a Nicaraguan politician who served as [[President of Nicaragua]] from 1990 to 1997. She was the first and, to date, only woman to hold the position of president in Nicaragua.\n\nBorn into a landed family in southern [[Nicaragua]], Chamorro was partially educated in the United States. After returning to her home country, she married and raised a family. Her husband, [[Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Cardenal]], was a journalist working at his family's newspaper, ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]'', which he later inherited. As a result of his anti-government stance, he was often jailed or exiled, forcing Chamorro to spend a decade following him abroad or visiting him in jail. When he was assassinated in 1978, Chamorro took over the newspaper. Pedro's murder strengthened the Nicaraguan Revolution and his image, as wielded by his widow, became a powerful symbol for the opposition forces. Initially, when the [[Sandinista]]s were victorious over [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], Chamorro fully supported them. She agreed to become part of the provisional government established under the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] ({{lang-es|Junta de Gobierno de Reconstrucci\u00f3n Nacional}}, JGRN); however, when the Junta began moving in a more radical direction and signed agreements with the [[Soviet Union]], Chamorro resigned and returned to the newspaper.\n\nUnder her direction, ''La Prensa'' continued to criticize the government and its policies despite threats and government-forced shutdowns. When [[Daniel Ortega]] announced that elections would be held in 1990, Chamorro was selected as the candidate for the opposition group known as the [[National Opposition Union]] ({{lang-es|Uni\u00f3n Nacional Opositora}}, UNO). This 14-party alliance ranged from [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[liberalism|liberals]] to [[communism|communists]] and because of idealistic differences had difficulty in devising any political platform other than a promise to end the war. Despite polls indicating a victory for the incumbent Sandinista President Ortega, Chamorro won the [[1990 Nicaraguan general election|election]] on 25 February 1990, becoming the first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female head of state]] in the [[Americas]].\n\nChamorro was sworn into office on 25 April 1990.

In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]''.

Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for the content of the paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children.

The executive and legislative branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but the president had to be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government;{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=132}} and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote.{{sfn|Bothmann|2015|p=174}} Though some of the changes also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures\u2014creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=46}}\u2014failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration's ability to prosecute,{{sfn|Arnson|Holiday|1991|p=56}} it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek transitional justice.  [[Sof\u00eda Montenegro]], editor of the Sandinistan paper ''Barricada'' and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse if she could have, but others, like Bishop Bernardo Hombach, are confident that her faith would have required her to forgive.

She was against abortion and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into [[prostitution]] and crime.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}} According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into \"street professions\", elevating security risks and increasing the rate of drop outs, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution.<ref name=\"prostitution, delinquency, drug use\">{{cite web|last1=Committee on the Rights of the Child|title=Country analysis: Nicaragua: Nicaragua. 10/17/1994|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/4e6a2923d2c6d19f4125615100606318?Opendocument|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=6 September 2015|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date=21 October 1994}}</ref> In addition, austerity measures that eliminated free health care made it difficult for the poor to afford care. The Sandinista Workers Central ({{lang-es|Central Sandinista De Trabajadores}}, CST) stepped in to offer health care and child care to women who could not afford the new government plan.{{sfn|Staten|2010|p=135}} She did support women's rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband's support. Her administration did not actively prepare or encourage women's participation in political life, nor did she appoint women to governmental positions.{{sfn|Skard|2014|p=264}}\n\nThe economic policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment outside the home in Nicaragua steadily increased during the same time frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.{{sfn|Chavez Metoyer|2000|p=5}}\n\nThe 1992 Sexual Crime Code modifications resulted in winners and losers.

However, [[James V of Scotland]] refused to accept that the letters were compromising, and argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King's own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Sadler compared the captured letters with Beaton's copies, and found a discrepancy.

On 22 March 1543 he rode from Edinburgh to [[Linlithgow Palace]] to see the queen for the first time. [[Mary of Guise]] showed him the queen out of her swaddling and Sadler wrote that the infant was \"as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live\". Mary reminded him that in turn [[Regent Arran]] wanted his son [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|James Hamilton]] to marry [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]].

Sadlier accompanied Hertford once more into Scotland, in the same role, in September 1545.

In this role he handled Cromwell's household business and was also involved in drafting and writing his correspondence.  By 1529, he had become one of Cromwell's most trusted friends and was appointed as an executor of his will.{{sfn|Phillips|2004}} Between 1525 and 1529, his name appeared in Cromwell's correspondence in connection with suppression of monasteries.

Sadlier failed in that respect, but the King was nonetheless impressed with his work. In 1539 he was elected [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]].\n\n=== Mr. Secretary: Henry VIII and Edward VI, 1540 to 1557 ===\nIn April 1540, Sadler was made [[Secretary of State (England)|principal secretary]] to the king, a position he held jointly with [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]].

In 1540 he tried to embarrass and undermine the authority of [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]], an ally of France, with letters captured from his messenger [[Alexander Crichton of Brunstane]] whose ship had been forced by a storm to put into England. However, [[James V of Scotland]] refused to accept that the letters were compromising, and argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King's own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Sadler compared the captured letters with Beaton's copies, and found a discrepancy. James V said he was thankful to Sadler and his uncle Henry VIII but still would not find fault in the Cardinal's actions.<ref>Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 25-28, 42-44.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Solway Moss]], Sadler was sent to Scotland again, in March 1543, to arrange a marriage between the infant [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and [[Edward VI of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. He was a successful negotiator for the [[Treaty of Greenwich]], although the marriage was not concluded. On 22 March 1543 he rode from Edinburgh to [[Linlithgow Palace]] to see the queen for the first time. [[Mary of Guise]] showed him the queen out of her swaddling and Sadler wrote that the infant was \"as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live\". Mary reminded him that in turn [[Regent Arran]] wanted his son [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|James Hamilton]] to marry [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Mary tried to work on him to intercede for [[Regent Arran]] to release Cardinal Beaton from imprisonment, alleging the Cardinal's political expertise could be employed to mutual benefit.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statepaperslette01sadluoft#page/86/mode/2up/ Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 86-8].</ref> Henry VIII wanted English servants in Mary's household, and Sadler recommended \"Lady Edongcomb\" for this role, his friend the widow of [[Peter Edgecumbe (died 1539)|Peter Edgecumbe]] of [[Cotehele]].<ref>Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 230.</ref>\n[[File:Queen's Inner Hall, Stirling Castle (5897535215).png|thumb|left|'''Ralph Sadler''' talked to [[Mary of Guise]] in her Audience Chamber at [[Stirling Castle]]]]\nOn 10 August 1543 Sadler wrote to Henry VIII describing another visit to [[Mary of Guise]] and the infant Queen, this time at [[Stirling Castle]];<blockquote>\"(Mary of Guise) is very glad that she is at Stirling, and much she praised there about the house, and told me, \"That her daughter did grow apace; and soon,\" she said, \"she would be a woman, if she took of her mother;\" who indeed, is of the largest stature of women.

Sadlier accompanied Hertford once more into Scotland, in the same role, in September 1545.  He accompanied Lord Hertford again, this time at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in the post of High Treasurer of the Army.  On 10 September 1547, in recognition of his services during the fighting, Sadler was made a [[knight banneret]],.{{sfn|Coros|1982}}  Sadlier was present when [[Stephen Gardiner]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], was arrested, and he also accompanied the force that put down [[Robert Kett]]'s [[Kett's Rebellion|Norfolk Rebellion]].\n\nWhen Henry VIII was preparing his will on Boxing Day 1546, he had already appointed Sadler onto the Council of Regency that was to rule England during Edward VI's minority and left him \u00a3200 in his will.<ref>Weir (2001), p.499</ref>\n\nIn 1550 Sadler sold his mansion at Hackney. He was one of the signatories of Edward VI's will in 1553, proving one of the radicals in a Protestant government.

{"title_page": "1923 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1923 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 15th. The First Grade competition featured 7 teams with the Fire Brigade club who featured in it in 1922 not entering a team. Fire Brigade had originally been named [[Grafton Athletic]] and had formed in 1914.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1923}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===First Grade Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8\u20137 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with \u00a3325 received in gate takings.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Final/City Defeat Athletic/Great Contest For Honours\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LX| issue=18488\n| date = 1923-08-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230827.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref> City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984\u201386 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991\u201394, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997\u201399, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013\u201315.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14\u20133 in the final.\n\n===Representative Team===\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20\u201320 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== Monteith Shield (First Grade Championship) ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8\u20137 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =

Fire Brigade had originally been named [[Grafton Athletic]] and had formed in 1914.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1923}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===First Grade Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8\u20137 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with \u00a3325 received in gate takings.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Final/City Defeat Athletic/Great Contest For Honours\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LX| issue=18488\n| date = 1923-08-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230827.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref> City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984\u201386 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991\u201394, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997\u201399, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013\u201315.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14\u20133 in the final.\n\n===Representative Team===\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20\u201320 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== Monteith Shield (First Grade Championship) ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8\u20137 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =

There were three first round matches played with [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], Athletic A, and [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] victorious. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] received a bye in the semi-finals and met Athletic in the final who they defeated 5 points to 0.\n\nThe following weekend another seven-a-side tournament was held at [[Carlaw Park]] to raise money for the Takapuna Orphanage which was destroyed by fire. Unfortunately the weather was particularly bad in the morning which had an effect on the attendance with only 1,000 spectators. The teams were supposed to composed of senior players but in reality were largely made up of junior players.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Seven-a-side Carnival Results\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Labour Day Tournament/Richmond Wins Final\n| page =5\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LX| issue=18536\n| date = 1923-10-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19231022.2.23.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|| Richmond || 2 || Athletic B || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct || Athletic A || 5 || Marist Old Boys || 3 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 20 Oct || Devonport || 10 || Ponsonby || 6 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Semi Final\n| 20 Oct || Athletic A || 6 || Devonport || 3 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Final\n| 20 Oct || Richmond || 5 || Athletic A || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | Seven-a-side Tournament Results\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 27 Oct <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Mixed Programme/Devonport Wins Seven A Side\n| page =3\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIV| issue=258\n| date = 1923-10-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19231029.2.16\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|| Devonport || 21 || Athletic || 3 || Carlaw Park||1,000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First Round\n| 27 Oct || Ponsonby || 9 || City || 0 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Semi Final\n| 27 Oct || Devonport || 14 || Marist Old Boys || 8 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Final\n| 27 Oct || Devonport || WBD || Ponsonby || LBD || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Lower Grade Clubs ===\nThere were 6 lower grades in 1923, though the sixth grade was split into A and B divisions once again, and one of the grades was a cadets grade.\n\nGrades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold:\n*'''Second Grade''': Athletic, '''City''', Devonport, Ellerslie, Epsom, Ihumatao (misspelled as Ihumata in the newpapers), Kingsland, Mangere, Marist Old Boys, Newton, Otahuhu, Ponsonby, and Richmond\n*'''Third Grade''': City, Coromandel, Devonport, Ellerslie, Ihumatao, Kingsland, Manukau, Marist, Parnell, Point Chevalier, '''Ponsonby''', Richmond, and Victoria Cruising Club.\n*'''Fourth Grade''': Athletic, City, '''Devonport''', Ellerslie, Kingsland, Mangere, Manukau, Marist, Newton, Otahuhu, Parnell\n*'''Fifth Grade''': City, Manukau, Marist, Newton, Northcote, Point Chevalier, '''Richmond''', and Takapuna\n*'''Sixth Grade A''': Athletic, City A, Devonport, Ellerslie, Manukau, Marist, Otahuhu, Parnell A, Parnell B, Ponsonby A, Richmond\n*'''Sixth Grade B''': Athletics, City, Ellerslie, Manukau Cruising Club, Marist Parnell, Ponsonby, Richmond\n*'''Cadet Competition''': 22nd Company, 26th Company, 27th Company, 29th Company, 34th Company, 36th A Company, 36th B Company, 49th Company\n\n=== Exhibition Matches ===\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] traveled to [[Taumarunui]] towards the end of the season when they had a bye in the First Grade competition and were victorious against the local side by 14 points to 5. In Round 12 Athletic played a match against representatives of the Wednesday league which was a mid week league competition in Auckland as a curtain-raiser to the [[City Rovers|City]] \u2013 [[Marist Saints|Marist]] game. Athletic won by 9 points to 5.\n\nOn the 15th of September the Athletic and Parnell 4th grade teams played a match in [[Whangarei]] which was the first time and organised game of rugby league had been played in the area.

They started the season with a match against Wellington in which they ran up a huge score, winning by 71 points to 12. Their second match was played mid week against Hamilton, before two games against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] and finishing the season with a game against an Auckland provincial team.\n\nAuckland challenged [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] for the Northern Union Cup which it had lost to the same opponents in 2022. The match was drawn and so [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] retained the cup. Auckland later played an Auckland provincial team and won comfortably in front of 7,000 spectators on [[Carlaw Park]]. A curtain-raiser was played between the Referees Association and the Junior Advisory Board, and was won by the former by 10 points to 6. In the final full league fixture of the season [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] played [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] again and were this time victorious 25 to 11.\n\n===Auckland v Wellington===\nEvery single member of the Auckland team scored points aside from [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] which was ironic given that he was one of Auckland Rugby League's most prolific point scorers.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 22 August\n| time =3:00\n| home =Auckland\n| score =71\u201312\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland V Wellington\n| page =10\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIV| issue=201\n| date = 1923-08-23\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19230823.2.139\n| accessdate = 2020-03-21}}</ref>\n| away =Wellington\n| try1 =Godick 3, [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]] 4, [[Frank Delgrosso]] 2, [[Bert Laing]] 2, V Thomas, [[Wally Somers]], W Hanlon, [[Bill Stormont]], Harry Douglas, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 =Godick 2, [[Bert Laing]] 2, [[Wilson Hall (rugby league)|Wilson Hall]], [[Clarrie Polson]] 3, [[Wally Somers]], [[Nelson Bass]]\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =Hedges, Ryan\n| con2 = Whittington\n| pen2 =Whittington, Greer\n| stadium =Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance =5000\n| referee =Ripley\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Hamilton===\nIn the match with Hamilton which, was played midweek, there were no players from the Ponsonby United and City Rovers clubs available as they were playing the Roope Rooster final on the following Saturday.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 22\u201316\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland Defeats Hamilton/22 Points to 16 in Good Game\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LX| issue=18503\n| date = 1923-09-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230913.2.11.1\n| accessdate = 2020-03-20}}</ref>\n| away = Hamilton\n| try1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2, [[Clarrie Polson]] 2, [[Nelson Bass]], Harry Douglas\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Clarrie Polson]]\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = McVeay 2, N Vernall, Paki\n| con2 = McVeay\n| pen2 = McVeay\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 2000\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n\n===South Auckland v Auckland (Northern Union Challenge Cup)===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 15 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = South Auckland (Waikato)\n| score = 20\u201320\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Cup\n| page =10\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIV| issue=222\n| date = 1923-09-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19230917.2.138\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref>\n| away = Auckland\n| try1 = Payne 2, Wilson, Stewart\n| con1 = J Dufty 2\n| pen1 = J Dufty\n| try2 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Hec Brisbane]], Stevens, Webb\n| con2 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2, [[Clarrie Polson]] 2\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Steele Park, Hamilton\n| attendance =\n| referee = T Hill\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Auckland Province===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 29 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 44\u201315\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Beats Province/In Match of Big Scoring\n| page =9\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIV| issue=234\n| date = 1923-10-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19231001.2.134\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n| away = Auckland Province\n| try1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]], [[Ivan Littlewood]], [[Maurice Wetherill]], [[Clarrie Polson]], Johnston, Stack, O\u2019Brien, [[Hec McDonald]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2, F Wilson 2, [[Clarrie Polson]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = Stewart, [[Wilson Hall (rugby league)|Wilson Hall]], McNeil\n| con2 = S Crewther\n| pen2 = J Dufty, S Crewther\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n\n===Auckland v South Auckland===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 13 October\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 35\u201311\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Close of the Season/Auckland 35; S.

It was released in the United States on 11 August 1969 ([[Epic Records]] BN 26481 (stereo)), but was not released in the United Kingdom because of a continuing contractual dispute that also prevented ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'', ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'', and ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'' from being released in the UK.\n\n==History==\nWhile the majority of the ''Barabajagal'' sessions took place in November 1968, \"Happiness Runs\" and \"Where Is She\" were recorded the previous May. All of these songs except \"Atlantis\", \"I Love My Shirt\" and \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" were shelved while ''[[Donovan's Greatest Hits]]'' was still high in the charts. \"Atlantis\" / \"I Love My Shirt\" was released as a single in November 1968 in the UK. In the US, \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" / \"Atlantis\" was released in March 1969. \"Atlantis\" ended up charting higher than its a-side. Some of the songs recorded were originally meant to be included on the unreleased ''[[Moon In Capricorn]]'' album.\n\nIn May 1969, Mickie Most produced at least one session with Donovan fronting the [[Jeff Beck Group]]. \"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" (also known as \"Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" and simply \"[[Barabajagal (single)|Barabajagal]]\") and \"Trudi\" (originally \"Bed with Me\") resulted from these sessions. There were other songs recorded by Donovan and the Jeff Beck Group, but they remained unreleased until they appeared as bonus tracks on the 2005 UK reissue of the album. [[Rod Stewart]] was in the band at this time, but he does not sing lead on any of the songs that were released. [[Tony Newman (drummer)|Tony Newman]] is featured as drummer.\n\n\"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" / \"Trudi\" was released as a single in June 1969 in the UK and in August 1969 in the United States. Following the pattern of Donovan's previous releases, his next album was named after the hit single of the time. The inclusion of \"Atlantis\" and \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" helped make ''Barabajagal'' a strong seller in the United States.\n\nThe songs on this album represent all facets of Donovan's career. Several rockers adorn the album, including the title track, \"Trudi\", \"The Love Song\" and \"Superlungs (My Supergirl)\". \"I Love My Shirt\" updates the sound of Donovan's children's music, and there are several slow songs featuring breathy vocals (\"Where Is She?\", \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\") reminiscent of the ''[[For Little Ones]]'' portion of ''A Gift from a Flower to a Garden''. It is during the ''Barabajagal'' sessions that Donovan's musical vision and work ethic began to diverge from that of producer [[Mickie Most]].

It was released in the United States on 11 August 1969 ([[Epic Records]] BN 26481 (stereo)), but was not released in the United Kingdom because of a continuing contractual dispute that also prevented ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'', ''[[Mellow Yellow (album)|Mellow Yellow]]'', and ''[[The Hurdy Gurdy Man]]'' from being released in the UK.\n\n==History==\nWhile the majority of the ''Barabajagal'' sessions took place in November 1968, \"Happiness Runs\" and \"Where Is She\" were recorded the previous May. All of these songs except \"Atlantis\", \"I Love My Shirt\" and \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" were shelved while ''[[Donovan's Greatest Hits]]'' was still high in the charts. \"Atlantis\" / \"I Love My Shirt\" was released as a single in November 1968 in the UK. In the US, \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" / \"Atlantis\" was released in March 1969. \"Atlantis\" ended up charting higher than its a-side. Some of the songs recorded were originally meant to be included on the unreleased ''[[Moon In Capricorn]]'' album.\n\nIn May 1969, Mickie Most produced at least one session with Donovan fronting the [[Jeff Beck Group]]. \"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" (also known as \"Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" and simply \"[[Barabajagal (single)|Barabajagal]]\") and \"Trudi\" (originally \"Bed with Me\") resulted from these sessions. There were other songs recorded by Donovan and the Jeff Beck Group, but they remained unreleased until they appeared as bonus tracks on the 2005 UK reissue of the album. [[Rod Stewart]] was in the band at this time, but he does not sing lead on any of the songs that were released. [[Tony Newman (drummer)|Tony Newman]] is featured as drummer.\n\n\"Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\" / \"Trudi\" was released as a single in June 1969 in the UK and in August 1969 in the United States. Following the pattern of Donovan's previous releases, his next album was named after the hit single of the time. The inclusion of \"Atlantis\" and \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\" helped make ''Barabajagal'' a strong seller in the United States.\n\nThe songs on this album represent all facets of Donovan's career. Several rockers adorn the album, including the title track, \"Trudi\", \"The Love Song\" and \"Superlungs (My Supergirl)\". \"I Love My Shirt\" updates the sound of Donovan's children's music, and there are several slow songs featuring breathy vocals (\"Where Is She?\", \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\") reminiscent of the ''[[For Little Ones]]'' portion of ''A Gift from a Flower to a Garden''. It is during the ''Barabajagal'' sessions that Donovan's musical vision and work ethic began to diverge from that of producer [[Mickie Most]]. The two eventually stopped working together, effectively ending Donovan's chart success.\n\n\"Happiness Runs\" is a round sung by Donovan, [[Graham Nash]], [[Michael McCartney]], and [[Lesley Duncan]] and was originally released without the round as \"Pebble and the Man\" on ''[[Donovan in Concert (1968 album)|Donovan in Concert]]''. \"Superlungs (My Supergirl)\" was originally recorded during the ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' sessions, but was not used for that album. That recording was released on ''Troubadour The Definitive Collection 1964\u20131976''. Donovan re-recorded the song for ''Barabajagal''.\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r6155 |first=Bruce |last=Eder |accessdate=11 May 2005 |ref=Allmusic}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev2Score = {{Rating-Christgau|C+}}<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Robert Christgau]] |first=Robert |last=Christgau |title=Donovan Consumer Guide Reviews |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Donovan |accessdate=10 February 2006 |ref=Christgau}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Reissues==\n*On 25 October 1990, Epic Records reissued ''Barabajagal'' (Epic 26481) in the US on [[compact disc|CD]].\n*On 16 May 2005, [[EMI]] reissued ''Barabajagal'' (EMI 8735692) in the UK on CD with thirteen bonus tracks.\n*On 1 October 2018, [[The state51 Conspiracy]] reissued ''Barabajagal'' (CON236LP) in the UK and Ireland on [[LP_Record|LP]].\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===Original album===\n{{Tracklist\n| headline  = Side one\n| all_writing  = Donovan Leitch\n| title1   = [[Barabajagal (single)|Barabajagal]]\n| length1   = 3:20\n| title2   = Superlungs My Supergirl\n| length2   = 2:39\n| title3   = Where Is She\n| length3   = 2:46\n| title4   = Happiness Runs\n| length4   = 3:25\n| title5   = I Love My Shirt\n| length5   = 3:19\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline  = Side two\n| title6   = The Love Song\n| length6   = 3:14\n| title7   = To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\n| length7   = 3:12\n| title8   = [[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\n| length8   = 4:58\n| title9   = Trudi\n| length9   = 2:23\n| title10   =  Pamela Jo\n| length10   = 4:24\n}}\n\n===2005 EMI version (UK) bonus tracks===\n#\"Stromberg Twins\" \u2013 4:40\n#\"Snakeskin\" \u2013 2:41\n#\"Lauretta's Cousin Laurinda\" \u2013 4:18\n#\"The Swan (Lord of the Reedy River)\" \u2013 3:08\n#\"Poor Man's Sunshine (Nativity)\" \u2013 5:19\n#\"New Year's Resolution (Donovan's Celtic Jam)\" \u2013 3:16\n#\"Runaway\" (demo) \u2013 3:03\n#\"Sweet Beverley\" (demo) \u2013 2:59\n#\"Marjorie (Margarine)\" (demo) \u2013 3:17\n#\"Little White Flower\" (demo) \u2013 2:09\n#\"Good Morning Mr. Wind\" (demo) \u2013 2:08\n#\"Palais Girl\" (demo) \u2013 2:26\n#\"Lord of the Universe\" (demo) \u2013 3:12\n\n== Personnel ==\n===London===\n* Donovan \u2013 guitar, harmonica, vocals\n* [[Jeff Beck]], [[Big Jim Sullivan]], [[Ronnie Wood]] \u2013 guitar\n* [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], [[Danny Thompson]] - bass guitar\n* [[Madeline Bell]] \u2013 backing vocals\n* [[Tony Carr (drummer)|Tony Carr]] \u2013 percussion, drums\n* [[Lesley Duncan]] - backing vocals\n* [[Aynsley Dunbar]] \u2013 drums\n* [[Alan Hawkshaw]] \u2013 piano\n* [[Nicky Hopkins]] \u2013 keyboards\n* [[Harold McNair]] \u2013 flute\n* [[Rod Stewart]] \u2013 backing vocals\n* [[Mickie Most]] \u2013 producer\n\n===Los Angeles===\nThe following musicians played on \"I Love My Shirt\", \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\", \"Atlantis\" and \"Pamela Jo\":\n\n* James Kehn \u2013 percussion, drums\n* [[Gabriel Mekler]] \u2013 keyboards\n* [[Richard Podolor|Richie Podolor]] \u2013 producer\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://donovan-unofficial.com/music/albums/barabajagal.html ''Barabajagal'' - Donovan Unofficial Site]\n<!-- This is a page that provides access to a licensed stream for the album, which is allowed under Wikipedia policies, even though it's hosted by MySpace.com -->\n* [http://www.myspace.com/donovanofficial/music/albums/barabajagal-8154652 ''Barabajagal''] ([[Adobe Flash]]) at [[Myspace]] (streamed copy where licensed)\n\n{{Donovan}}\n\n[[Category:Donovan albums]]\n[[Category:1969 albums]]\n[[Category:Epic Records albums]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Mickie Most]]\n", "name_user": "Muso805", "label": "safe", "comment": "four star rating from 10 volume 4th Edition Oxford University Press, EPM 2007", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barabajagal"}
