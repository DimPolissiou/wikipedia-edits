It is her first long non-fiction book. Much of the material consists of excerpts from Rand's novels, supplemented by a long title essay that focuses on the [[history of philosophy]].\n\n==History==\nStarting from the mid-1930s, Russian-American author Ayn Rand had worked as a writer of fiction, including plays, screenplays, and novels. Her fiction, especially her novels, contained expressions of her political and philosophical ideas, often in the form of [[monologue]]s delivered by her characters. Her most successful novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943) and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957), had attracted a group of admirers interested in Rand's ideas. She began delivering lectures at colleges, including one at [[Yale University]] in November 1960 titled \"For the New Intellectual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=318}}</ref>\n\nA revised version of the Yale speech became the title essay of ''For the New Intellectual'', which was published by [[Random House]] in 1961. It was the first of several non-fiction volumes collecting Rand's essays and speeches. It was also the last book Rand published with Random House. She left the publisher following a dispute over her next book. In 1963, a paperback edition was published by [[New American Library]].<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=320\u2013321}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=324}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe excerpts from Rand's novels are all speeches on various topics, with the clear majority of the speeches coming from her main novels ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Her novels ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' and ''[[We the Living]]'' each contribute one excerpt. The speech from ''We The Living'' is spoken by the main female character Kira Argounova, to the communist Andrei Taganov (one of the two male lead characters).\n\nThere are three speeches from ''The Fountainhead'': one by the antagonist Ellsworth Toohey, one which is actually more of a conversation between the sympathetic character Gail Wynand and the hero Howard Roark, and one which is Howard Roark's triumphant courtroom speech. The last is a statement of Rand's philosophy as it existed at the time of writing ''The Fountainhead'', and is a testimony to the human spirit expressed in individual invention and achievement.\n\nThere are six excerpts from ''Atlas Shrugged'', all speeches by various protagonists. The topics covered by the speeches are the philosophical nature of money, the psychology of sexual desire (of a man for a woman), the condemnation encountered by successful industrialists, socialized (i.e. government-regulated) medicine, the motivation of profit versus the public good (from the perspective of an industrialist), and a 60-page statement of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].\n\nThe title essay discusses the history of philosophy with particular emphasis on what Rand sees as the grievous missteps and errors committed along the way. She uses two terms to illustrate the most notorious individuals who have played a role in the history of philosophy: \"[[Attila]]\" and \"[[Witch doctor|Witch Doctor]]\". She categorizes various participants in human history, who have been a force for evil in her view, as being an \"Attila\" or \"Witch Doctor\". An \"Attila\" is someone in history who used physical (\"brute\") force to accomplish goals.

It is her first long non-fiction book. Much of the material consists of excerpts from Rand's novels, supplemented by a long title essay that focuses on the [[history of philosophy]].\n\n==History==\nStarting from the mid-1930s, Russian-American author Ayn Rand had worked as a writer of fiction, including plays, screenplays, and novels. Her fiction, especially her novels, contained expressions of her political and philosophical ideas, often in the form of [[monologue]]s delivered by her characters. Her most successful novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943) and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957), had attracted a group of admirers interested in Rand's ideas. She began delivering lectures at colleges, including one at [[Yale University]] in November 1960 titled \"For the New Intellectual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=318}}</ref>\n\nA revised version of the Yale speech became the title essay of ''For the New Intellectual'', which was published by [[Random House]] in 1961. It was the first of several non-fiction volumes collecting Rand's essays and speeches. It was also the last book Rand published with Random House. She left the publisher following a dispute over her next book. In 1963, a paperback edition was published by [[New American Library]].<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=320\u2013321}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=324}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe excerpts from Rand's novels are all speeches on various topics, with the clear majority of the speeches coming from her main novels ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Her novels ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' and ''[[We the Living]]'' each contribute one excerpt. The speech from ''We The Living'' is spoken by the main female character Kira Argounova, to the communist Andrei Taganov (one of the two male lead characters).\n\nThere are three speeches from ''The Fountainhead'': one by the antagonist Ellsworth Toohey, one which is actually more of a conversation between the sympathetic character Gail Wynand and the hero Howard Roark, and one which is Howard Roark's triumphant courtroom speech. The last is a statement of Rand's philosophy as it existed at the time of writing ''The Fountainhead'', and is a testimony to the human spirit expressed in individual invention and achievement.\n\nThere are six excerpts from ''Atlas Shrugged'', all speeches by various protagonists. The topics covered by the speeches are the philosophical nature of money, the psychology of sexual desire (of a man for a woman), the condemnation encountered by successful industrialists, socialized (i.e. government-regulated) medicine, the motivation of profit versus the public good (from the perspective of an industrialist), and a 60-page statement of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].\n\nThe title essay discusses the history of philosophy with particular emphasis on what Rand sees as the grievous missteps and errors committed along the way. She uses two terms to illustrate the most notorious individuals who have played a role in the history of philosophy: \"[[Attila]]\" and \"[[Witch Doctor]]\". She categorizes various participants in human history, who have been a force for evil in her view, as being an \"Attila\" or \"Witch Doctor\". An \"Attila\" is someone in history who used physical (\"brute\") force to accomplish goals. A \"Witch Doctor\" is someone (often a philosopher, religious person, or other type of intellectual) who has used the written or spoken word to persuade people to go against their rational minds, often to the advantage of the \"Attila\" who is currently in power.\n\nShe concludes the title essay by saying that she hopes a type of \"new intellectual\" will gain prominence. The new intellectual will promote the use of reason to persuade others, as opposed to reliance on force, or the threat of force, in order to persuade by fear.\n\n==Reception==\nThe book received a number of reviews at the time of its release, although significantly fewer than Rand's novels had received.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=119}}</ref> In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', the philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] called it a \"unique combination of tautology and extravagant absurdity.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Sidney |last=Hook |authorlink=Sidney Hook |title=Each Man for Himself |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=April 9, 1961 |page=3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/04/09/archives/each-man-for-himself-for-the-new-intellectual-the-philosophy-of-ayn.html}}</ref> In a negative review for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', [[Gore Vidal]] said Rand \"must be read to be believed\" and that \"Her 'philosophy' is nearly perfect in its immorality\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Gore |last=Vidal |authorlink=Gore Vidal |title=Rocking the Boat |url=https://archive.org/details/rockingboat00vida |url-access=registration |chapter=Two Immoralists: Orville Prescott and Ayn Rand |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1962 |oclc=291123 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rockingboat00vida/page/227 227\u2013234]}} Reprinted from ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', July 1961.</ref> In ''[[The New Republic]]'', reviewer Joel Rosenbloom described Rand's philosophy as \"pretentious nonsense\" and predicted \"little likelihood of an expanding future for Miss Rand's system or her following.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Rosenbloom |title=The Ends and Means of Ayn Rand |work=[[The New Republic]] |date=April 23, 1961 |issue=144 |pages=28\u201329 |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/75237/the-ends-and-jvleans-ayn-rand |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRand bibliographer [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] called Rand's title essay the \"major attraction for those who have already read the novels\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=79}}</ref> The historian James T.

Therefore, the area under complaint is under the authority of the Government of Guyana until something different is resolved according to the treaty. The first article of the document states that the contention of Venezuela to consider the decision of the court that defined its border with British Guyana as null and void is recognized. When the United Kingdom and Guyana (then British Guyana) signed the agreement, they recognized the claim and disagreement of Venezuela, remembering then to find a peaceful, practical, and satisfactory solution for the parties.<ref>{{cite web|title=No. 8192.

Generally a temperature rise, above usually 10 to 15&nbsp;\u00b0C above ambient, can be considered heat shock or heat stress. Heat tolerance is broadly defined as the ability of the plant tolerate heat \u2013 means that grow and produce economic yield under high temperatures.\n\n== Significance: current and future - global warming ==\n\nHeat stress is a serious threat to [[crop production]] globally (Hall, 2001, 1992).<ref>Hall, A.E., 1992. Breeding for heat tolerance. Plant Breed. Rev. 10, 129\u2013168.</ref><ref>Hall, A.E., 2001. Crop Responses to Environment. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, Florida</ref> Global warming is particularly consequence of increased level of green house gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxides. The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) has predicted a rise of 0.3&nbsp;\u00b0C per decade (Jones et al., 1999) <ref>Jones, P.D., New, M., Parker, D.E., Mortin, S., Rigor, I.G., 1999. Surface area temperature and its change over the past 150 years. Rev. Geophys. 37, 173\u2013199</ref> reaching to approximately 1 and 3&nbsp;\u00b0C above the present value by 2025 and 2100 AD, respectively.\n\n== Physiological consequence of heat stress ==\nAt very high temperatures cause severe cellular injury and [[cell death]] may occur within short time, thus leading to a catastrophic collapse of cellular organization (Schoffl et al., 1999).<ref>Schoffl, F., Prandl, R., Reindl, A., 1999. Molecular responses to heat stress. In: Shinozaki, K., Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, K. (Eds.), ''Molecular Responses to Cold, Drought, Heat and Salt Stress in Higher Plants''. R. G. Landes Co.,Austin, Texas, pp. 81\u201398</ref> However, under moderately high temperatures, the injury can only occur after longer exposure to such a temperature however the plant efficiency can be severely affected. High temperature directly affect injuries such as [[protein denaturation]] and aggregation, and increased fluidity of [[membrane lipid]]s. Other indirect or slower heat injuries involve inactivation of enzymes in [[chloroplast]] and [[mitochondria]], protein degradation, inhibition of [[protein synthesis]],  and loss of membrane integrity. Heat stress associated injuries ultimately lead to starvation, inhibition of growth, reduced ion flux, production of toxic compounds and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Immediately after exposure to high temperature stress-related proteins are expressed as stress defense strategy of the cell. \nExpression of [[heat shock proteins]] (HSPs), protein with 10 to 200&nbsp;kDa, is supposed to be involved in signal transduction during heat stress. In many species it has been demonstrated that HSPs results in improved physiological phenomena such as photosynthesis, assimilate partitioning, water and nutrient use efficiency, and membrane stability.\n\nStudies have found tremendous variation within and between species, thus this will help to breed heat tolerance for future environment.  Some of attempts to develop heat-tolerant genotypes are successful. (Ehlers and Hall, 1998;<ref>Ehlers, J.D., Hall, A.E., 1998. Heat tolerance of contrasting cowpea lines in short and long days.

Changes in photosynthetic parameters and antioxidant activities following heat-shock treatment in tomato plants. Funct. Plant Biol. 33,177\u201318</ref>)\n\n== Traits associated with heat stress tolerance ==\n\nDifferent physiological mechanisms may contribute to heat tolerance in the field\u2014for example, heat tolerant metabolism as indicated by higher\nphotosynthetic rates, stay-green, and membrane thermo-stability, or heat avoidance as indicated by canopy temperature depression. Several physiological and morphological traits have been evaluated for heat tolerance - Canopy temperature, leaf chlorophyll, stay green, leaf conductance, spike number, biomass, and flowering date.\n\n'''(a) Canopy temperature depression (CTD)'''\n\nCTD has shown clear association with yield in warm environments shows it association with heat stress tolerance. CTD shows high [[genetic correlation]] with yield and high values of proportion of direct response to selection (Reynolds et al., 1998)<ref>Reynolds, M.P., R.P. Singh, A. Ibrahim, O.A.A. Ageeb, A. Larqu\u00e9-Saavedra, and J.S. Quick.1998. Evaluating physiological traits to complement empirical selection for wheat in warm environments. Euphytica 100:84-95.,</ref> indicating that the trait is heritable and therefore amenable to early generation selection. Since an integrated CTD value can be measured almost instantaneously on scores of plants in a small breeding plot (thus reducing error normally associated with traits measured on individual plants), work has been conducted to evaluate its potential as an indirect selection criterion for genetic gains in yield. CTD is affected by many physiological factors, which makes it a powerful.\n\n'''(b) Stomatal conductance'''\n\nCanopy temperature depression is highly suitable for selecting physiologically superior lines in warm, low relative humidity environments where high evaporative demand leads to leaf cooling of up to 10&nbsp;\u00b0C below ambient temperatures. This permits differences among genotypes to be detected relatively easily using infrared thermometry. However, such differences cannot be detected in high relative humidity environments because the effect of evaporative cooling of leaves is negligible. Nonetheless, leaves maintain their stomata open to permit the uptake of CO2, and differences in the rate of CO2  fixation may lead to differences in leaf conductance that can be measured using a porometer. Porometry can be used to screen individual plants. The heritability of stomatal conductance is reasonably high, with reported values typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. Plants can be assessed for leaf conductance using a viscous flow porometer that is  available on the market (Thermoline and CSIRO, Australia). This instrument can give a relative measure of stomatal conductance in a few seconds, making it possible to identify physiologically superior genotypes from within bulks.\n\n'''(C)  Membrane thermostability '''\n\nAlthough resistance to high temperatures involves several complex tolerance and avoidance mechanisms, the membrane is thought to be a site of\nprimary physiological injury by heat, and measurement of solute leakage from tissue can be used to estimate damage to membranes. Since membrane thermostability is reasonably heritable (Fokar et al., 1998) <ref>Fokar, M., H.T. Nguyen, and A. Blum. 1998. Heat tolerance in spring wheat. I.

It included the '''Howard Street Tunnel''', the [[Mount Royal Station]] for B&O's ''[[Royal Blue Line]]'' passenger trains, and the first mainline [[Railway electrification system|railroad electrification]] in the United States. The line is currently operated by [[CSX Transportation]] as part of its [[Baltimore Terminal Subdivision]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:George Brown map.jpg|thumb|Map of the B&O-PW&B connection in south Baltimore, prior to PRR takeover]]\nThe B&O's original connection to New York in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] was through surface street transfers to the old [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] (PW&B), with passenger / freight cars (also known then as rail carriages) pulled by horses along the east/west running [[Pratt Street-Lombard Street|East Pratt Street]] route, first between the B&O's old Pratt Street Depot at Pratt and South Charles Streets, then later using the new terminal and B.& O.'s general headquarters of [[Camden Station|Camden Street Station]] (built 1857-1865)  to the PW&B's [[President Street Station]] (built 1849-1850) at President and Fleet Streets, east of the [[Inner Harbor|harbor]] past the waterfront piers from the early 1830s to early 1870s. This transfer process was also used because of ordinances passed by the [[Baltimore City Council]] in 1831 prohibiting the use of early steam locomotives within the city limits on downtown streets in the more primitive years of early American railroading.\n<ref name=Challenge>Herbert W. Harwood, Jr., ''Impossible Challenge''. Baltimore, Md.: 1979. ({{ISBN|0-934118-17-5}})</ref> In 1884, the PW&B was purchased and absorbed by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR), the growing dominant regional line in the Northeast states and a major rival of the B&O, and the PRR cut off the connection to the East Coast seaboard's main line. The B&O then proceeded to build its Philadelphia Branch (formally known as the [[Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad]]) to connect to the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]], in turn connecting with the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] for B&O's New York service across the [[Hudson River]] to [[Manhattan]]. The combination also provided a connection to the [[Staten Island Railway]], which served as the terminal switching company for the B&O's New York [[freight train|freight]] service across the [[Hudson River]] or [[Upper New York Bay]] to [[Manhattan]]. New B&O president [[Charles F. Mayer (railroad president)|Charles F. Mayer]] made the Belt Line a priority by the 1870s, and recruited young railroader [[Samuel Rea]] to work on it as Chief Engineer.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/conqueringgotham00jonn/page/39|title=Conquering Gotham : a Gilded Age epic : the construction of Penn Station and its tunnels|last=Jonnes, Jill, 1952-|date=2007|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0670031580|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conqueringgotham00jonn/page/39 39-40]|oclc=71266589}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|last=Stover, John F.|date=1995|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=1557530661|edition=1st pbk. print. 1995|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|pages=174|oclc=34099225}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Mt Royal Station Baltimore.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mount Royal Station (in 1961)]]\nConnecting the new Philadelphia Branch to the rest of the B&O system was a considerable engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the outskirts of town would have required massive [[regrading]] and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on [[carfloat]]s across the [[Patapsco River]] / [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore harbor and port]] from [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] to [[Locust Point, Baltimore|Locust Point]], but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.\n\nThe route the B&O chose started from the existing end of track at Camden Street Station, at the west end of the \"The Basin\" (modern [[Inner Harbor]]) of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River. A [[tunnel]] was constructed directly under Howard Street, heading north/south until just before it crossed the existing PRR line.\n\nAt the north portal of the tunnel, [[Mount Royal Station]] was constructed between 1891-1896. The track then curved around the northwest corner of the center city going east, passed through six other (much shorter) tunnels, continuing across the northern outskirts of downtown, curving around the Northeast corner of the old City, finally heading southeast to meet the already constructed line just north of the [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] neighborhood and connecting with the East Coast route. The cost of construction drove the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad into [[bankruptcy]] shortly after the line opened in 1895, 68 years after the line was founded in 1827 as America's first passenger / freight raiload.\n\nInitially there were plans to build three new stations in Baltimore, but concern for interference with freight haulage and expense eventually reduced this to a single station at Mount Royal Avenue< just west by the [[Jones Falls]] stream, which opened on September 1, 1896. Lower-level platforms were added later at the east end of B&O's Camden Street Station in 1897.<ref name=Challenge /><ref name=Harwood>Herbert H. Harwood, Jr., ''Royal Blue Line''.

Due to the built-up nature of the area traversed and the hilly terrain, much of its line through town was in tunnels, which posed severe ventilation problems. Large chimneys were constructed above the Pennsylvania line, in a not entirely successful attempt to disperse the fumes from the [[steam locomotive|coal-fired locomotives]]. However, by 1890 electric locomotion was beginning to appear possible, and in 1892 the B&O thus contracted with [[General Electric]] (GE) for electric locomotives, [[Power station|powerhouse]] equipment, and an electrical distribution system.<ref name=Harwood /> This equipment was delivered beginning in 1895, and the first train pulled by an [[Electric locomotive#History|electric locomotive]] operated through the Howard Street Tunnel on June 27, 1895.<ref>F.G. Bennick, \"B&O was first U.S. railroad to use electric locomotives\", ''Baltimore & Ohio Magazine'', April, 1940.</ref>\n\nThe [[Grade (slope)|grade]] on the electrified portion was downhill to Camden Station; therefore traffic heading southbound (\"westbound\", in B&O timetables), from Mount Royal Station, simply drifted through the tunnels. Since the engine was not working, the smoke produced was relatively light. Going upgrade northbound (\"eastbound\", in B&O timetables) the electric locomotives were coupled to the front of the train at Camden Station and pulled the entire train, including the steam locomotive, through the Howard Street tunnel. When northbound [[passenger train]]s stopped at Mt. Royal Station at the north end of the tunnel, the electric locomotive was uncoupled. Northbound freight trains were pulled by electric locomotives for another two miles, until reaching Huntingdon Avenue in east Baltimore. There the steam locomotive closed its cylinder cocks, took up the load, and the electric locomotive uncoupled on the fly, accelerating ahead to a pocket [[Siding (rail)|siding]] between the tracks.<ref name=Harwood />\n\nGeneral Electric installed [[rotary converter]]s in  B&O's powerhouse near Mt. Royal Station, having a combined capacity of 5,000 [[kilowatt|kW]] to convert 13,200-volt, 3 phase, 25-cycle [[alternating current|AC]] to 675 volts [[direct current|DC]]. In 1936, these rotary converters were replaced by [[Mercury arc valve|mercury arc rectifier]]s.<ref>J.H. Davis, \"B&O Substation for Main Line, through Baltimore\", ''Baltimore & Ohio Magazine'', April, 1940.</ref>\n\nInitially power was supplied through a unique system in which a pickup shoe rode in a channel above and to one side of the track. This proved vulnerable to contamination from coal smoke, and after a short time it was replaced by a conventional [[third rail]] system. When the Howard Street track was made into a [[gantlet track|gantlet]] to allow higher clearances, the pickup contacts on one side were mounted on swinging arms to accommodate the varying distance to the third rail. The electrification was finally discontinued in 1952 when [[dieselisation|dieselization]] made it unnecessary.<ref name=Harwood />\n\n==Latter day operation==\nThroughout much of its history until the end of passenger trains in 1958, the line had relatively low passenger traffic, averaging six daily New York\u2013[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] trains each way. Freight traffic was also limited by the scarcity of online industry east of Baltimore and B&O's lack of a connection across the [[Potomac River]] at Washington, D. C., to the southern railroads. The massive Pennsylvania main line carried most traffic to the northeast.\n\nBy the 1970s, however, both railroads were failing financially. The PRR had been merged into [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] in 1968, and two years later the new company declared bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book |title=American Railroads |last=Stover |first=John F. |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= |isbn=978-0-226-77658-3 |page=234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPNQXN9Onv4C&lpg=PA234&vq=bankruptcy%20penn%20central&pg=PA234#v=snippet&q=bankruptcy%20penn%20central&f=false |edition=2}}</ref> The B&O became part of the [[Chessie System]] in 1973, which in turn was merged into CSX in 1980.<ref>{{cite book |title=CSX |last=Solomon |first=Brian |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=MBI Publishing |location=St. Paul, MN |isbn=978-0-7603-1796-9 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZI4-xleAptoC&lpg=PA62&dq=CSX%20merger%201980&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q=CSX%20merger%201980&f=false |series=MBI Railroad Color History Series}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976 the PRR line became part of the newly formed [[Amtrak]] system. The line was subsequently called the [[Northeast Corridor]] (NEC), and its role as a freight line became relatively minor. The 1987 [[Chase, Maryland rail wreck|accident at Chase, Maryland]], involving a [[Conrail]] locomotive led to further reductions in freight traffic on the NEC. The Belt Line (now operated by CSX) is therefore a key link in what has now become the principal rail freight line from Baltimore to Philadelphia and beyond.  This segment of the CSX network is considered a chokepoint for freight train service from the Port of Baltimore to East Coast and Midwest markets.<ref>{{cite news |last= Halsey III |first= Ashley |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/aging-baltimore-tunnel-a-threat-to-shipping-economy-for-the-city-and-maryland/2012/03/28/gIQAjYCVhS_story.html |title= Aging Baltimore tunnel a threat to shipping economy for the city and Maryland |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= March 28, 2012 |accessdate= March 29, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330121759/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/aging-baltimore-tunnel-a-threat-to-shipping-economy-for-the-city-and-maryland/2012/03/28/gIQAjYCVhS_story.html |archive-date= March 30, 2012 |url-status= live }}</ref> ''See'' [[Baltimore Terminal Subdivision]].\n\n===Howard Street Tunnel fire===\nOn July 18, 2001, a 60-car CSXT freight derailed in the Howard Street Tunnel, sparking a fire that burned for six days and blocked traffic for much longer. The [[Howard Street Tunnel fire]] called attention to the Belt Line, both as a risk to the surrounding structures and as a link in rail traffic. CSXT has implemented various improvements to increase the integrity of the link, but is limited by the shallow depth of the bore (only {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in|disp=or|sp=us}} below the surface at the south end) and the instability of the surrounding soil.\n\n===Retaining wall collapse===\nOn April 30, 2014, a block-long portion of a retaining wall in a below-grade stretch of the Belt Line in southern [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]] collapsed after a heavy rainstorm,  sending part of East 26th Street and a number of cars onto the tracks.

East 26th Street was reopened to vehicular traffic a year later.\n\n===Howard Street Tunnel clearance improvements===\n[[File:CSX train at Mt Royal Station.jpg|thumb|left|CSX freight train emerging from the north end of the Howard St. tunnel]]\nReconstructing the Howard Street Tunnel to accommodate [[Double-stack rail transport|double-stacked intermodal containers]] had been once thought to cost $1\u20133&nbsp;billion. However, in April 2016, a $425 million plan was revealed that would create the needed {{cvt|1.5|ft}} of additional clearance in the tunnel by trimming and notching its arched ceiling, lowering its floor, and using steel crossties, which have a lower profile than wood crossties. The Maryland Department of Transportation subsequently applied for a $155 million FY2016 FASTLANE grant to help fund a project based on this lower-cost plan, but the grant was not received. In December 2016, MDOT reapplied for a FASTLANE grant of the same amount in the FY2017 round of funding. In addition to the federal funds expected from the grant, the State of Maryland would contribute $145M, and CSX $125M, towards the cost of the project. In expectation of the grant funding, CSX is investing $25M in the tunnel{{spaced ndash}}$21M to improve its water discharge system, and $4M for engineering and design of the clearance improvements. The project, which would also increase the clearance at nine bridges north of the tunnel, would last 4\u20135 years (due to having to be scheduled around active rail traffic), create about 500 construction jobs, and would result in 178,000 containers per year being moved by rail from the Port of Baltimore instead of by truck. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said that the state would explore other funding solutions if the FY2017 FASTLANE grant is not received.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CSX and Maryland officials still expect federal funding for Howard Street Tunnel |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-gbc-transportation-summit-20160928-story.html |last=Campbell |first=Colin |website=The Baltimore Sun |date=September 28, 2016 |access-date=November 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118101035/http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-gbc-transportation-summit-20160928-story.html |archive-date=November 18, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/12/16/hogan-administration-submits-fastlane-grant-application-to-double-stack-howard-street-tunnel/ |title=Hogan Administration Submits FASTLANE Grant Application to Double-Stack Howard Street Tunnel |date=December 16, 2016 |website=Office of Governor Larry Hogan |publisher=State of Maryland |access-date=December 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228034249/http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/12/16/hogan-administration-submits-fastlane-grant-application-to-double-stack-howard-street-tunnel/ |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/10/24/governor-larry-hogan-csx-ceo-michael-ward-confirm-commitment-to-howard-street-tunnel-project/ |title=Governor Larry Hogan, CSX CEO Michael Ward Confirm Commitment to Howard Street Tunnel Project |date=October 24, 2016 |website=Office of Governor Larry Hogan |publisher=State of Maryland |access-date=December 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228034325/http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/10/24/governor-larry-hogan-csx-ceo-michael-ward-confirm-commitment-to-howard-street-tunnel-project/ |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Hogan pledges to revamp 'infamous' Howard Street Tunnel |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-hogan-howard-street-tunnel-20161024-story.html |last=Cox |first=Erin |website=The Baltimore Sun |date=October 24, 2016 |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229100736/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-hogan-howard-street-tunnel-20161024-story.html |archive-date=December 29, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Maryland seeks $155 million from feds to clear freight bottleneck beneath Baltimore |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-double-stack-plan-20160414-story.html |last=Prudente |first=Tim |website=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 14, 2016 |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229101837/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-double-stack-plan-20160414-story.html |archive-date=December 29, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> On July 22, 2019, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Elaine Chao]] announced the award of $125&nbsp;million in federal infrastructure funding for the project.<ref>{{cite news|authors=Campbell, Colin and Wood, Pamela|title=Feds award long-sought grant to help expand Baltimore's Howard Street Tunnel but not as much as Maryland wanted|work=Baltimore Sun|date=July 23, 2019|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-howard-street-tunnel-20190722-blx663jme5embio65e7jshfsga-story.html|access-date=July 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727145632/https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-howard-street-tunnel-20190722-blx663jme5embio65e7jshfsga-story.html|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Railroad electrification in the United States]]\n*[[List of tunnels documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Maryland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060603010205/http://www.nrhs.com/spot/howard_street_tunnel/index.html The Howard Street Tunnel- Moving the Freight Through Baltimore]\", Smith, Jeffrey, ''The National Railway Bulletin'', Volume 66, Number 5, 2001\n* \"Baltimore's Unseen Artery: A Brief History of the Baltimore Belt Railroad and Its Howard Street Tunnel\", Lee, J.

It included the '''Howard Street Tunnel''', the [[Mount Royal Station]] for B&O's ''[[Royal Blue Line]]'' passenger trains, and the first mainline [[Railway electrification system|railroad electrification]] in the United States. The line is currently operated by [[CSX Transportation]] as part of its [[Baltimore Terminal Subdivision]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:George Brown map.jpg|thumb|Map of the B&O-PW&B connection in south Baltimore, prior to PRR takeover]]\nThe B&O's original connection to New York in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] was through surface street transfers to the old [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] (PW&B), with passenger / freight cars (also known then as rail carriages) pulled by horses along the east/west running [[Pratt Street-Lombard Street|East Pratt Street]] route, first between the B&O's old Pratt Street Depot at Pratt and South Charles Streets, then later using the new terminal and B.& O.'s general headquarters of [[Camden Station|Camden Street Station]] (built 1857-1865)  to the PW&B's [[President Street Station]] (built 1849-1850) at President and Fleet Streets, east of the [[Inner Harbor|harbor]] past the waterfront piers from the early 1830s to early 1870s. This transfer process was also used because of ordinances passed by the [[Baltimore City Council]] in 1831 prohibiting the use of early steam locomotives within the city limits on downtown streets in the more primitive years of early American railroading.\n<ref name=Challenge>Herbert W. Harwood, Jr., ''Impossible Challenge''. Baltimore, Md.: 1979. ({{ISBN|0-934118-17-5}})</ref> In 1884, the PW&B was purchased and absorbed by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR), the growing dominant regional line in the Northeast states and a major rival of the B&O, and the PRR cut off the connection to the East Coast seaboard's main line. The B&O then proceeded to build its Philadelphia Branch (formally known as the [[Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad]]) to connect to the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]], in turn connecting with the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] for B&O's New York service across the [[Hudson River]] to [[Manhattan]]. The combination also provided a connection to the [[Staten Island Railway]], which served as the terminal switching company for the B&O's New York [[freight train|freight]] service across the [[Hudson River]] or [[Upper New York Bay]] to [[Manhattan]]. New B&O president [[Charles F. Mayer (railroad president)|Charles F. Mayer]] made the Belt Line a priority by the 1870s, and recruited young railroader [[Samuel Rea]] to work on it as Chief Engineer.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/conqueringgotham00jonn/page/39|title=Conquering Gotham : a Gilded Age epic : the construction of Penn Station and its tunnels|last=Jonnes, Jill, 1952-|date=2007|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0670031580|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conqueringgotham00jonn/page/39 39-40]|oclc=71266589}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|last=Stover, John F.|date=1995|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=1557530661|edition=1st pbk. print. 1995|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|pages=174|oclc=34099225}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Mt Royal Station Baltimore.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Mount Royal Station (in 1961)]]\nConnecting the new Philadelphia Branch to the rest of the B&O system was a considerable engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the outskirts of town would have required massive [[regrading]] and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on [[carfloat]]s across the [[Patapsco River]] / [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore harbor and port]] from [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] to [[Locust Point, Baltimore|Locust Point]], but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.\n\nThe route the B&O chose started from the existing end of track at Camden Street Station, at the west end of the \"The Basin\" (modern [[Inner Harbor]]) of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River. A [[tunnel]] was constructed directly under Howard Street, heading north/south until just before it crossed the existing PRR line.\n\nAt the north portal of the tunnel, [[Mount Royal Station]] was constructed between 1891-1896. The track then curved around the northwest corner of the center city going east, passed through six other (much shorter) tunnels, continuing across the northern outskirts of downtown, curving around the Northeast corner of the old City, finally heading southeast to meet the already constructed line just north of the [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] neighborhood and connecting with the East Coast route. The cost of construction drove the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad into [[bankruptcy]] shortly after the line opened in 1895, 68 years after the line was founded in 1827 as America's first passenger / freight raiload.\n\nInitially there were plans to build three new stations in Baltimore, but concern for interference with freight haulage and expense eventually reduced this to a single station at Mount Royal Avenue< just west by the [[Jones Falls]] stream, which opened on September 1, 1896. Lower-level platforms were added later at the east end of B&O's Camden Street Station in 1897.<ref name=Challenge /><ref name=Harwood>Herbert H. Harwood, Jr., ''Royal Blue Line''.

Due to the built-up nature of the area traversed and the hilly terrain, much of its line through town was in tunnels, which posed severe ventilation problems. Large chimneys were constructed above the Pennsylvania line, in a not entirely successful attempt to disperse the fumes from the [[steam locomotive|coal-fired locomotives]]. However, by 1890 electric locomotion was beginning to appear possible, and in 1892 the B&O thus contracted with [[General Electric]] (GE) for electric locomotives, [[Power station|powerhouse]] equipment, and an electrical distribution system.<ref name=Harwood /> This equipment was delivered beginning in 1895, and the first train pulled by an [[Electric locomotive#History|electric locomotive]] operated through the Howard Street Tunnel on June 27, 1895.<ref>F.G. Bennick, \"B&O was first U.S. railroad to use electric locomotives\", ''Baltimore & Ohio Magazine'', April, 1940.</ref>\n\nThe [[Grade (slope)|grade]] on the electrified portion was downhill to Camden Station; therefore traffic heading southbound (\"westbound\", in B&O timetables), from Mount Royal Station, simply drifted through the tunnels. Since the engine was not working, the smoke produced was relatively light. Going upgrade northbound (\"eastbound\", in B&O timetables) the electric locomotives were coupled to the front of the train at Camden Station and pulled the entire train, including the steam locomotive, through the Howard Street tunnel. When northbound [[passenger train]]s stopped at Mt. Royal Station at the north end of the tunnel, the electric locomotive was uncoupled. Northbound freight trains were pulled by electric locomotives for another two miles, until reaching Huntingdon Avenue in east Baltimore. There the steam locomotive closed its cylinder cocks, took up the load, and the electric locomotive uncoupled on the fly, accelerating ahead to a pocket [[Siding (rail)|siding]] between the tracks.<ref name=Harwood />\n\nGeneral Electric installed [[rotary converter]]s in  B&O's powerhouse near Mt. Royal Station, having a combined capacity of 5,000 [[kilowatt|kW]] to convert 13,200-volt, 3 phase, 25-cycle [[alternating current|AC]] to 675 volts [[direct current|DC]]. In 1936, these rotary converters were replaced by [[Mercury arc valve|mercury arc rectifier]]s.<ref>J.H. Davis, \"B&O Substation for Main Line, through Baltimore\", ''Baltimore & Ohio Magazine'', April, 1940.</ref>\n\nInitially power was supplied through a unique system in which a pickup shoe rode in a channel above and to one side of the track. This proved vulnerable to contamination from coal smoke, and after a short time it was replaced by a conventional [[third rail]] system. When the Howard Street track was made into a [[gantlet track|gantlet]] to allow higher clearances, the pickup contacts on one side were mounted on swinging arms to accommodate the varying distance to the third rail. The electrification was finally discontinued in 1952 when [[dieselisation|dieselization]] made it unnecessary.<ref name=Harwood />\n\n==Latter day operation==\nThroughout much of its history until the end of passenger trains in 1958, the line had relatively low passenger traffic, averaging six daily New York\u2013[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] trains each way. Freight traffic was also limited by the scarcity of online industry east of Baltimore and B&O's lack of a connection across the [[Potomac River]] at Washington, D. C., to the southern railroads. The massive Pennsylvania main line carried most traffic to the northeast.\n\nBy the 1970s, however, both railroads were failing financially.

The line was subsequently called the [[Northeast Corridor]] (NEC), and its role as a freight line became relatively minor. The 1987 [[Chase, Maryland rail wreck|accident at Chase, Maryland]], involving a [[Conrail]] locomotive led to further reductions in freight traffic on the NEC. The Belt Line (now operated by CSX) is therefore a key link in what has now become the principal rail freight line from Baltimore to Philadelphia and beyond.  This segment of the CSX network is considered a chokepoint for freight train service from the Port of Baltimore to East Coast and Midwest markets.<ref>{{cite news |last= Halsey III |first= Ashley |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/aging-baltimore-tunnel-a-threat-to-shipping-economy-for-the-city-and-maryland/2012/03/28/gIQAjYCVhS_story.html |title= Aging Baltimore tunnel a threat to shipping economy for the city and Maryland |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= March 28, 2012 |accessdate= March 29, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330121759/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/aging-baltimore-tunnel-a-threat-to-shipping-economy-for-the-city-and-maryland/2012/03/28/gIQAjYCVhS_story.html |archive-date= March 30, 2012 |url-status= live }}</ref> ''See'' [[Baltimore Terminal Subdivision]].\n\n===Howard Street Tunnel fire===\nOn July 18, 2001, a 60-car CSXT freight derailed in the Howard Street Tunnel, sparking a fire that burned for six days and blocked traffic for much longer. The [[Howard Street Tunnel fire]] called attention to the Belt Line, both as a risk to the surrounding structures and as a link in rail traffic. CSXT has implemented various improvements to increase the integrity of the link, but is limited by the shallow depth of the bore (only {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in|disp=or|sp=us}} below the surface at the south end) and the instability of the surrounding soil.\n\n===Retaining wall collapse===\nOn April 30, 2014, a block-long portion of a retaining wall in a below-grade stretch of the Belt Line in southern [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]] collapsed after a heavy rainstorm,  sending part of East 26th Street and a number of cars onto the tracks.

However, in April 2016, a $425 million plan was revealed that would create the needed {{cvt|1.5|ft}} of additional clearance in the tunnel by trimming and notching its arched ceiling, lowering its floor, and using steel crossties, which have a lower profile than wood crossties. The Maryland Department of Transportation subsequently applied for a $155 million FY2016 FASTLANE grant to help fund a project based on this lower-cost plan, but the grant was not received. In December 2016, MDOT reapplied for a FASTLANE grant of the same amount in the FY2017 round of funding. In addition to the federal funds expected from the grant, the State of Maryland would contribute $145M, and CSX $125M, towards the cost of the project. In expectation of the grant funding, CSX is investing $25M in the tunnel{{spaced ndash}}$21M to improve its water discharge system, and $4M for engineering and design of the clearance improvements. The project, which would also increase the clearance at nine bridges north of the tunnel, would last 4\u20135 years (due to having to be scheduled around active rail traffic), create about 500 construction jobs, and would result in 178,000 containers per year being moved by rail from the Port of Baltimore instead of by truck. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said that the state would explore other funding solutions if the FY2017 FASTLANE grant is not received.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CSX and Maryland officials still expect federal funding for Howard Street Tunnel |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-gbc-transportation-summit-20160928-story.html |last=Campbell |first=Colin |website=The Baltimore Sun |date=September 28, 2016 |access-date=November 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118101035/http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-gbc-transportation-summit-20160928-story.html |archive-date=November 18, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/12/16/hogan-administration-submits-fastlane-grant-application-to-double-stack-howard-street-tunnel/ |title=Hogan Administration Submits FASTLANE Grant Application to Double-Stack Howard Street Tunnel |date=December 16, 2016 |website=Office of Governor Larry Hogan |publisher=State of Maryland |access-date=December 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228034249/http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/12/16/hogan-administration-submits-fastlane-grant-application-to-double-stack-howard-street-tunnel/ |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/10/24/governor-larry-hogan-csx-ceo-michael-ward-confirm-commitment-to-howard-street-tunnel-project/ |title=Governor Larry Hogan, CSX CEO Michael Ward Confirm Commitment to Howard Street Tunnel Project |date=October 24, 2016 |website=Office of Governor Larry Hogan |publisher=State of Maryland |access-date=December 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228034325/http://governor.maryland.gov/2016/10/24/governor-larry-hogan-csx-ceo-michael-ward-confirm-commitment-to-howard-street-tunnel-project/ |archive-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Hogan pledges to revamp 'infamous' Howard Street Tunnel |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-hogan-howard-street-tunnel-20161024-story.html |last=Cox |first=Erin |website=The Baltimore Sun |date=October 24, 2016 |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229100736/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-hogan-howard-street-tunnel-20161024-story.html |archive-date=December 29, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Maryland seeks $155 million from feds to clear freight bottleneck beneath Baltimore |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-double-stack-plan-20160414-story.html |last=Prudente |first=Tim |website=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 14, 2016 |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229101837/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-double-stack-plan-20160414-story.html |archive-date=December 29, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> On July 22, 2019, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Elaine Chao]] announced the award of $125&nbsp;million in federal infrastructure funding for the project.<ref>{{cite news|authors=Campbell, Colin and Wood, Pamela|title=Feds award long-sought grant to help expand Baltimore's Howard Street Tunnel but not as much as Maryland wanted|work=Baltimore Sun|date=July 23, 2019|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-howard-street-tunnel-20190722-blx663jme5embio65e7jshfsga-story.html|access-date=July 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727145632/https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-howard-street-tunnel-20190722-blx663jme5embio65e7jshfsga-story.html|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Railroad electrification in the United States]]\n*[[List of tunnels documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Maryland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060603010205/http://www.nrhs.com/spot/howard_street_tunnel/index.html The Howard Street Tunnel- Moving the Freight Through Baltimore]\", Smith, Jeffrey, ''The National Railway Bulletin'', Volume 66, Number 5, 2001\n* \"Baltimore's Unseen Artery: A Brief History of the Baltimore Belt Railroad and Its Howard Street Tunnel\", Lee, J.

During his 25 years (1947\u20131973) on the faculty at the [[New York State College of Ceramics]] at [[Alfred University]], in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]] (a division of the [[State University of New York]]), he built an international reputation as a potter, sculptor and authority on [[studio pottery]].\n\n==Background==\nBorn and raised in [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]], the son of Daniel J and Margaret Agnes (Brennan) Rhodes, he began his art career by enrolling in summer courses at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. He attended the [[University of Chicago]] for four years (1929\u20131933), earning a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in art history. He worked with [[Iowa]] painter [[Grant Wood]] for two summers (1932 and 1933) at the [[Stone City Art Colony]], and then also studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]] (1933\u201334), where his teacher was [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalist]] painter [[John Steuart Curry]].\n\nFrom 1935 to 1938, Rhodes lived in Fort Dodge, where he worked as a painter and [[mural]]ist, participated in the Fort Dodge Art Guild, and lectured at the Blanden Art Gallery (now the Blanden Memorial Art Museum. While living in Iowa, he participated actively in the state's art circles, and frequently exhibited at the [[Iowa State Fair]], where he won an unprecedented three consecutive annual sweepstakes awards for oil painting from 1938 to 1940, outdistancing a record held by Grant Wood.\n\nAfter additional study in 1940 at the [[Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center]] (where he began to work with clay), Rhodes entered the graduate program at New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, where, in 1942, he became the first person to graduate from that school's [[Master of Fine Arts]] program.\n\n==Murals==\nRhodes received several mural commissions from the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]]. The first, titled ''Storm Lake'' (1937), was created for the [[post office]] at [[Storm Lake, Iowa]]. Later, when a new post office was built, the mural was relocated to the public library.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daniel Rhodes Mural \u2013 Storm Lake IA|url=https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/daniel-rhodes-mural-storm-lake-ia/ |website=|publisher=Living New Deal|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n    \nIn the same year, Rhodes and another Iowa painter named Howard C. Johnson were commissioned to create a large mural (110 feet wide by {{convert|10|ft|m}} high), planned for installation in the Agricultural Building at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in [[Des Moines]]. Titled ''Where tillage begins, other arts follow'', the project was a commemoration of Iowa [[agriculture]]: planting, harvesting, production, and the [[meat packing industry]]. Unfortunately, it soon became the subject of a public derision. Opinionated passersby complained about factual inaccuracies in the mural, claimed that the figures of Iowans were too solemn, and objected to what they considered to be a style that was \u201ctoo modern.\u201d In 1946, Iowa State Fair Board Secretary Lloyd Cunningham ordered that the mural be taken down and that the dismantled pieces be used as scrap lumber.

It features the role of the [[railroad]] in transporting mail. The Post Office was decommissioned and sold to the city of Marion in 1968. The city used the building as the City Hall until 2005. The building sat empty for a year before being bought by a bank. In June 2008, Anton Rajer a professional fine art conservator from [[Green Bay, WI]] will begin work to move the mural to the Marion Heritage Center. The mural is estimated to weigh approximately 2,000\u20133,000 pounds, and will be removed from the building in one piece by a team of contractors.\n\nRhodes created a mural, ''Airmail'' (1941), for the U.S. Post Office in [[Piggott, Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Post Office Mural \u2013 Piggott AR|url=https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/post-office-mural-piggott-ar-2/ |website=|publisher=Living New Deal|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref> On April 10, 2019, in Piggott, the US Postal Service released a series of postage stamps featuring post office murals, including \"Airmail.\" The Postal Service planned to produce 30 million of the stamps.  \n\nHis success in completing these projects led to Rhodes being commissioned for New Deal art projects in other states, including post office murals at [[Clayton, Missouri]] (now at the Federal Building in Des Moines), and [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Post Office Mural \u2013 Glen Ellyn IL|url=https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/post-office-mural-glen-ellyn-il/ |website=|publisher=Living New Deal|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref> and a cafeteria mural in the main [[U.S. Navy]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1939-40, Rhodes taught at the Art Students\u2019 Workshop in Des Moines, and was also a guest lecturer at the [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]] Art Center and [[Iowa State University]]. In 1940, he married the former Lillyan Estelle Jacobs of Des Moines, a potter, sculptor and [[Figurative art|figurative]] painter whom he had met at Stone City. They raised two children, a daughter (Lorna) and a son ([[Aaron Rhodes|Aaron]]). Lillyan Rhodes died in 1986.\n\nAfter completing his MFA at Alfred University, the Rhodes remained in that area, where he worked as a designer for Glidden Pottery. In 1943, they moved to [[California]], where he worked in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] as a researcher in high heat ceramics for the [[Henry J. Kaiser]] Corporation. Three years later, they moved to [[Menlo Park, California]], where in 1947 they built a full-scale ceramic studio, and created thrown and cast ware for Gump's, the [[San Francisco]] [[department store]]. During the same period, Rhodes was briefly on the faculties at [[Stanford University]] (1946) and the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] (1946\u201347). In 1947, they returned to New York State, where Rhodes joined the art department faculty of his alma mater, the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, where he taught from 1947 to 1973.\n\nWhile at Alfred University, Rhodes also taught summer sessions in ceramics at the [[University of Southern California]], [[Los Angeles]] (1952\u201353); [[Black Mountain College]], [[Asheville, North Carolina]]; and the [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]], [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (1961). Rhodes later taught at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (1977\u201380).\n\nIn the last phase of his life, Rhodes married Mary Beth Coulter. At the start of a two-month tour of college campuses, he was conducting a workshop at [[Sierra Nevada College]] when he was stricken by a [[heart attack]] and died in [[Reno, Nevada]], in July 1989, aged 78.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\">{{cite news |last= |first= |date=July 28, 1989 |title=Daniel Rhodes, 78, Ceramic Sculptor, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/28/obituaries/daniel-rhodes-78-ceramic-sculptor-dies.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Awards, honors and collections==\nRhodes was the recipient of a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] and lived in [[Japan]] from 1962-63. The [[National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts]] (NCECA) awarded him a medal of citation for his contributions to teaching in 1973.

In 1940, he married the former Lillyan Estelle Jacobs of Des Moines, a potter, sculptor and [[Figurative art|figurative]] painter whom he had met at Stone City. They raised two children, a daughter (Lorna) and a son ([[Aaron Rhodes|Aaron]]). Lillyan Rhodes died in 1986.\n\nAfter completing his MFA at Alfred University, the Rhodes remained in that area, where he worked as a designer for Glidden Pottery. In 1943, they moved to [[California]], where he worked in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] as a researcher in high heat ceramics for the [[Henry J. Kaiser]] Corporation. Three years later, they moved to [[Menlo Park, California]], where in 1947 they built a full-scale ceramic studio, and created thrown and cast ware for Gump's, the [[San Francisco]] [[department store]]. During the same period, Rhodes was briefly on the faculties at [[Stanford University]] (1946) and the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] (1946\u201347). In 1947, they returned to New York State, where Rhodes joined the art department faculty of his alma mater, the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, where he taught from 1947 to 1973.\n\nWhile at Alfred University, Rhodes also taught summer sessions in ceramics at the [[University of Southern California]], [[Los Angeles]] (1952\u201353); [[Black Mountain College]], [[Asheville, North Carolina]]; and the [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]], [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (1961). Rhodes later taught at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (1977\u201380).\n\nIn the last phase of his life, Rhodes married Mary Beth Coulter. At the start of a two-month tour of college campuses, he was conducting a workshop at [[Sierra Nevada College]] when he was stricken by a [[heart attack]] and died in [[Reno, Nevada]], in July 1989, aged 78.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\">{{cite news |last= |first= |date=July 28, 1989 |title=Daniel Rhodes, 78, Ceramic Sculptor, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/28/obituaries/daniel-rhodes-78-ceramic-sculptor-dies.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Awards, honors and collections==\nRhodes was the recipient of a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] and lived in [[Japan]] from 1962-63.
