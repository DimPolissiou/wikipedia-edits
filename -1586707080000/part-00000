At its height in 1812, the French Empire had [[130 departments of the First French Empire|130 departments]], ruled over 70 million subjects, maintained an extensive military presence in [[Confederation of the Rhine|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spain]], and the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and counted Austria and Prussia as nominal allies.<ref>Martyn Lyons, ''Napoleon Bonaparte and the Legacy of the French Revolution.'' p. 232</ref> Early French victories exported many ideological features of the Revolution throughout Europe: the introduction of the [[Napoleonic Code]] throughout the continent increased legal equality, established jury systems and legalised divorce, and [[manorialism|seigneurial dues and seigneurial justice]] were abolished, as were aristocratic privileges in all places except Poland.<ref>Martyn Lyons pp. 234\u201336</ref> France's defeat in 1814 (and then again in 1815), marked the end of the Empire.\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|18 Brumaire|French Consulate}}\nIn 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte was confronted by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s]]\u2014one of five [[French Directory|Directors]] constituting the executive branch of the French government\u2014who sought his support for a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' to overthrow the [[Constitution of the Year III]]. The plot included Bonaparte's brother [[Lucien Bonaparte|Lucien]], then serving as speaker of the [[Council of Five Hundred]], [[Roger Ducos]], another Director, and [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]]. On 9 November 1799 ([[18 Brumaire]] VIII under the [[French Republican Calendar]]) and the following day, troops led by Bonaparte seized control.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} They dispersed the legislative councils, leaving a rump legislature to name Bonaparte, Siey\u00e8s and Ducos as provisional Consuls to administer the government. Although Siey\u00e8s expected to dominate the new regime, the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], he was outmaneuvered by Bonaparte, who drafted the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] and secured his own election as First Consul. He thus became the most powerful person in France, a power that was increased by the [[Constitution of the Year X]], which made him First Consul for life.\n\nThe [[Battle of Marengo]] (14 June 1800) inaugurated the political idea that was to continue its development until Napoleon's Moscow campaign. Napoleon planned only to keep the [[Duchy of Milan]] for France, setting aside Austria, and was thought{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to prepare a new campaign in the East. The [[Peace of Amiens]], which cost him control of [[Egypt]], was a temporary truce. He gradually extended his authority in Italy by annexing the [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and by acquiring [[Genoa]], [[Parma]], Tuscany and [[Naples]], and added this Italian territory to his [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Then he laid siege to the Roman state and initiated the [[Concordat of 1801]] to control the material claims of the [[pope]]. When he recognised his error of raising the authority of the pope from that of a figurehead, Napoleon produced the ''[[Organic Articles|Articles Organiques]]'' (1802) with the goal of becoming the legal protector of the papacy, like [[Charlemagne]]. To conceal his plans before their actual execution, he aroused French colonial aspirations against Britain and the memory of the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], exacerbating British envy of France, whose borders now extended to the [[Rhine]] and beyond, to [[Hanover]], Hamburg and [[Cuxhaven]].

[[William Pitt the Younger]], back in power over Britain, appealed once more for an Anglo-Austro-Russian [[coalition]] against Napoleon to stop the ideals of revolutionary France from spreading.\n\nOn 18 May 1804, Napoleon was given the title of \"[[Emperor of the French]]\" by the [[French Consulate#The new government|Senate]]; finally, on 2 December 1804, he was [[Coronation of Napoleon I|solemnly crowned]], after receiving the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] of the [[Kings of the Lombards|Lombard kings]], and was consecrated by [[Pope Pius VII]] in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].{{ref|Note 3|Note 3}}\n\nIn four campaigns, the Emperor transformed his \"[[Charlemagne|Carolingian]]\" [[feudal]] [[French First Republic|republican]] and [[Federation|federal]] empire into one modelled on the [[Roman Empire]]. The memories of imperial Rome were for a third time, after [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Charlemagne]], used to modify the historical evolution of France. Though the vague plan for an invasion of Great Britain was never executed, the [[Battle of Ulm]] and the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] overshadowed the defeat of [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and the camp at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] put at Napoleon's disposal the best military resources he had commanded, in the form of ''[[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]''.\n\n==Early victories==\nIn the [[War of the Third Coalition]], Napoleon swept away the remnants of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]] and created in [[southern Germany]] the [[vassal state]]s of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], which were reorganized into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. The [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], signed on 26 December 1805, extracted extensive territorial concessions from Austria, on top of a large financial indemnity. Napoleon's creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the occupation of [[Ancona]], and his annexation of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and its former [[Adriatic]] territories marked a new stage in the French Empire's progress.\n\n[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''The [[Battle of Austerlitz]], 2nd December 1805'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]]]]\n\nTo create [[satellite state]]s, Napoleon installed his relatives as rulers of many European states. The [[House of Bonaparte|Bonapartes]] began to marry into old European monarchies, gaining sovereignty over many nations. [[Joseph Bonaparte]] replaced the dispossessed [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] in Naples; [[Louis Bonaparte]] was installed on the throne of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], formed from the [[Batavian Republic]]; [[Joachim Murat]] became [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Grand-Duke of Berg]]; [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] was made son-in-law to the King of W\u00fcrttemberg and [[Kingdom of Westphalia|King of Westphalia]]; and Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais was appointed Viceroy of Italy while [[St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais]] married the son of the Grand Duke of Baden. In addition to the vassal titles, Napoleon's closest relatives were also granted the title of [[Nobility of the First French Empire|French Prince]] and formed the [[Imperial House of France (First French Empire)|Imperial House of France]].\n\nMet with opposition, Napoleon would not tolerate any neutral power. On 6 August 1806 the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] abdicated their title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in order to prevent Napoleon from becoming the next Emperor, ending a political power which had endured for over a thousand years. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] had been offered the territory of [[Hannover|Hanover]] to stay out of the Third Coalition. With the diplomatic situation changing, Napoleon offered Great Britain the province as part of a peace proposal. This, combined with growing tensions in Germany over French hegemony, Prussia responded by forming an alliance with Russia and sending troops into Bavaria on 1 October 1806. During the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], Napoleon destroyed the Prussian armies at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena and Auerstedt]]. Successive victories at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] against the Russians finally ruined [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]'s formerly mighty kingdom, obliging [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and Prussia to make peace with France at [[Treaties of Tilsit|Tilsit]].\n\n==Height of the Empire==\n[[File:Arc de Triomphe, Paris 5 February 2019.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'', ordered by [[Napoleon]] in honour of the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', is one of several landmarks whose construction was started in Paris during the First French Empire.]]\n\nThe Treaties of Tilsit ended the war between Russia and France and began an alliance between the two empires that held as much power as the rest of Europe. The two empires secretly agreed to aid each other in disputes. France pledged to aid Russia against the [[Ottoman Empire]], while Russia agreed to join the [[Continental System]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Napoleon also forced Alexander to enter the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u201312)|Anglo-Russian War]] and to instigate the [[Finnish War]] against Sweden in order to force Sweden to join the Continental System.\n\nMore specifically, Alexander agreed to evacuate [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], which had been occupied by Russian forces as part of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u201312)|Russo-Turkish War]]. The [[Ionian Islands]] and [[Cattaro]], which had been captured by Russian admirals [[Fyodor Ushakov|Ushakov]] and [[Dmitry Senyavin|Senyavin]], were to be handed over to the French. In recompense, Napoleon guaranteed the sovereignty of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]] and several other small states ruled by the Russian emperor's German relatives.\n\nThe treaty removed about half of Prussia's territory: [[Cottbus]] was given to Saxony, the left bank of the [[Elbe]] was awarded to the newly created Kingdom of Westphalia, [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was given to Russia, and the rest of the Polish lands in Prussian possession were set up as the Duchy of Warsaw. Prussia was ordered to reduce its army to 40,000 men and to pay an indemnity of 100,000,000 francs. Observers in Prussia viewed the treaty as unfair and as a national humiliation.\n\n[[File:Iena.jpg|thumb|left|Napoleon reviewing the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] before the [[Battle of Jena]], 1806]]\n\n[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] had advised Napoleon to pursue milder terms; the treaties marked an important stage in his estrangement from the emperor. After Tilsit, instead of trying to reconcile Europe, as Talleyrand had advised, Napoleon wanted to defeat Britain and complete his Italian dominion. To the coalition of the northern powers, he added the league of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and Mediterranean ports, and to the bombardment of [[Copenhagen]] by the [[Royal Navy]] he responded with a second decree of blockade, dated from Milan on 17 December 1807.\n\nThe application of the Concordat and the taking of Naples led to Napoleon's first struggles with the Pope, centered around [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] renewing the theocratic affirmations of [[Pope Gregory VII]]. The emperor's Roman ambition was made more visible by the occupation of the Kingdom of Naples and of the [[Marches]], and by the entry of [[Sextius Alexandre Fran\u00e7ois de Miollis|Miollis]] into Rome; while General [[Jean-Andoche Junot|Junot]] invaded Portugal, Marshal [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] [[Peninsular War|took control]] of formerly Roman Spain as Regent. Soon after, Napoleon had his brother, Joseph, crowned King of Spain and sent him there to take control.\n\nNapoleon tried to succeed in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as he had done in Italy, in the Netherlands, and in Hesse. However, the exile of the Spanish Royal Family to [[Bayonne]], together with the enthroning of Joseph Bonaparte, turned the Spanish against Napoleon. After the ''[[Dos de Mayo Uprising|Dos de Mayo]]'' riots and subsequent reprisals, the Spanish government began an effective guerrilla campaign, under the oversight of local ''Juntas''. The Iberian Peninsula became a war zone from the Pyrenees to the Straits of Gibraltar and saw the Grande Arm\u00e9e facing the remnants of the Spanish Army, as well as British and Portuguese forces. General [[Pierre Dupont de l'\u00c9tang|Dupont]] capitulated at [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n|Bail\u00e9n]] to [[Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os, 1st Duke of Bail\u00e9n|General Casta\u00f1os]], and Junot at [[Convention of Cintra|Cintra]], Portugal to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General Wellesley]].\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Battle of Eylau]], 1807]]\nSpain used up the soldiers needed for Napoleon's other fields of battle, and they had to be replaced by conscripts. Spanish resistance affected Austria, and indicated the potential of national resistance. The provocations of Talleyrand and Britain strengthened the idea that the Austrians could emulate the Spanish. On April 10, 1809, Austria invaded France's ally, Bavaria. The campaign of 1809, however, would not be nearly as long and troublesome for France as the one in Spain and Portugal. Following a short and decisive action in Bavaria, Napoleon opened up the road to the Austrian capital of [[Vienna]] for a second time. At [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern]], Napoleon suffered his first serious tactical defeat, along with the death of [[Jean Lannes]], an able Marshal and dear friend of the emperor. The victory at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], however, forced Austria to sue for peace. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], signed on 14 December 1809, resulted in the annexation of the [[Illyrian Provinces]] and recognized past French conquests.\n\nThe Pope was forcibly deported to [[Savona]], and his domains were incorporated into the French Empire. The Senate's decision on 17 February 1810 created the title \"King of Rome\", and made Rome the capital of Italy. Between 1810 and 1812 Napoleon's divorce of [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine|Jos\u00e9phine]], and his marriage with [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria]], followed by the birth of [[Napoleon II|his son]], shed light upon his future policy. He gradually withdrew power from his siblings and concentrated his affection and ambition on his son, the guarantee of the continuance of his dynasty, marking the high point of the Empire.\n\n==Intrigues and unrest==\nUndermining forces, however, had already begun to impinge on the faults inherent in Napoleon\u2019s achievements. Britain, protected by the English Channel and its navy, was [[Golden Cavalry of St George|persistently active]], and rebellion of both the governing and of the governed broke out everywhere. Napoleon, though he underrated it, soon felt his failure in coping with the Peninsular War. Men like [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl, baron von und zum Stein|Baron von Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg|August von Hardenberg]] and [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Johann von Scharnhorst]] had begun secretly preparing Prussia's retaliation.\n\n[[File:\u0422\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0438\u0442. 1807.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Napoleon demanded that [[Alexander I of Russia]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] meet him at [[Treaties of Tilsit|Tilsit]] in July 1807.]]\nThe alliance arranged at Tilsit was seriously shaken by the Austrian marriage, the threat of Polish restoration to Russia, and the Continental System. The very persons whom he had placed in power were counteracting his plans. With many of his siblings and relations performing unsuccessfully or even betraying him, Napoleon found himself obliged to revoke their power. [[Caroline Bonaparte]] conspired against her brother and against her husband Murat; the hypochondriac Louis, now Dutch in his sympathies, found the supervision of the blockade taken from him, and also the defense of the [[Scheldt]], which he had refused to ensure. [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] lost control of the blockade on the [[North Sea]] shores. The very nature of things was against the new dynasties, as it had been against the old.\n\nAfter national insurrections and family recriminations came treachery from Napoleon's ministers. Talleyrand betrayed his designs to [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]] and suffered dismissal. [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]], corresponding with Austria in 1809 and 1810, entered into an understanding with Louis and also with Britain, while [[Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne|Bourrienne]] was convicted of speculation. By consequence of the spirit of conquest Napoleon had aroused, many of his marshals and officials, having tasted victory, dreamed of sovereign power: [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]], who had helped him to the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], played Napoleon false to win the crown of Sweden. [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]], like Murat, coveted the Spanish throne after that of Portugal, thus anticipating the treason of 1812.\n\nThe country itself, though flattered by conquests, was tired of self-sacrifice. The unpopularity of [[conscription]] gradually turned many of Napoleon\u2019s subjects against him. Amidst profound silence from the press and the assemblies, a protest was raised against imperial power by the literary world, against the excommunicated sovereign by Catholicism, and against the author of the continental blockade by the discontented [[bourgeoisie]], ruined by the crisis of 1811. Even as he lost his military principles, Napoleon maintained his gift for brilliance. His [[Six Days' Campaign]], which took place at the very end of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], is often regarded as his greatest display of leadership and military prowess. But by then it was the end (or \"the finish\"), and it was during the years before when the nations of Europe conspired against France. While Napoleon and his holdings idled and worsened, the rest of Europe agreed to avenge the revolutionary events of 1792.\n\n==Fall==\n{{Main|French invasion of Russia|War of the Sixth Coalition|Hundred Days}}\n[[File:Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier-Campagne de France.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Napoleon and his staff during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], by [[Ernest Meissonier|Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]]]]\nNapoleon had hardly succeeded in putting down the revolt in Germany when the emperor of Russia himself headed a European insurrection against Napoleon. To put an end to this, to ensure his own access to the Mediterranean and exclude his chief rival, Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812. Despite his victorious advance, the [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|taking of Smolensk]], the victory on the [[Battle of Borodino|Moskva]], and the entry into Moscow, he was defeated by the country and the climate, and by Alexander's refusal to make terms. After this came the terrible retreat in the harsh Russian winter, while all of Europe was turning against him. Pushed back, as he had been in Spain, from bastion to bastion, after the action on the [[Battle of Berezina|Berezina]], Napoleon had to fall back upon the frontiers of 1809, and then\u2014having refused the peace offered to him by Austria at the Congress of Prague (4 June\u201310 August 1813), from fear of losing Italy, where each of his victories had marked a stage in the accomplishment of his dream\u2014on those of 1805, despite the victories at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]], and on those of 1802 after his disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], when Bernadotte\u2014now Crown Prince of Sweden\u2014turned upon him, [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|General Moreau]] also joined the Allies, and longstanding allied nations, such as Saxony and Bavaria, forsook him as well.\n\nFollowing his retreat from Russia, Napoleon continued to retreat, this time from Germany. After the loss of Spain, reconquered by an Allied army led by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]], the uprising in the Netherlands preliminary to the invasion and the manifesto of Frankfurt (1 December 1813)<ref>The Frankfort Declaration, 1 December 1813: http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_frankfort.html</ref> which proclaimed it, he was forced to fall back upon the frontiers of 1795; and was later driven further back upon those of 1792\u2014despite the brilliant [[Campaign in north-east France (1814)|campaign of 1814 against the invaders]]. Paris capitulated on 30 March 1814, and the [[Carthago delenda est|''Delenda Carthago'']], pronounced against Britain, was spoken of Napoleon. The Empire briefly fell with Napoleon's abdication at [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Fontainebleau]] on 11 April 1814.\n\nAfter less than a year's exile on the island of [[Principality of Elba|Elba]], Napoleon escaped to France with a thousand men and four cannons. King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] sent Marshal Ney to arrest him. Upon meeting Ney's army, Napoleon dismounted and walked into firing range, saying \"If one of you wishes to kill his emperor, here I am!\" But instead of firing, the soldiers went to join Napoleon's side shouting \"Vive l'Empereur!\" Napoleon retook the throne temporarily in 1815, reviving the Empire in what is known as the [[Hundred Days]]. However, he was defeated by the Seventh Coalition at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. He surrendered himself to the British and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], a remote island in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in 1821. After the Hundred Days, the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon monarchy was restored]], with Louis XVIII regaining the throne of France, while the rest of Napoleon's conquests were disposed of in the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\n==Nature of Napoleon Bonaparte's rule==\n[[File:Constitution an VIII et le Empire Francais.png|thumb|center|upright=2.75|Organigramme of the French Consulate and later the Empire]]\n[[File:Speyer (DerHexer) 2010-12-19 051.jpg|thumb|The [[Napoleonic Code]]]]\nNapoleon gained support by appealing to some common concerns of the French people. These included dislike of the emigrant [[nobility]] who had escaped persecution, fear by some of a restoration of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', a dislike and suspicion of foreign countries that had tried to reverse the Revolution\u2014and a wish by Jacobins to extend France's revolutionary ideals.\n\nNapoleon attracted power and imperial status and gathered support for his changes of French institutions, such as the [[Concordat of 1801]] which confirmed the Catholic Church as the majority church of France and restored some of its civil status.\nNapoleon by this time however was not a democrat, nor a republican. He was, he liked to think, an enlightened despot, the sort of man [[Voltaire]] might have found appealing. He preserved numerous social gains of the Revolution while suppressing political liberty. He admired efficiency and strength and hated feudalism, religious intolerance, and civil inequality. Enlightened despotism meant political stability. He knew Roman history well, as after 500 years of republicanism, Rome became an empire under [[Augustus]].\n\nAlthough a supporter of the [[political radicalism|radical]] [[Jacobin|Jacobins]] during the early days of the Revolution (more out of pragmatism than any real ideology), Napoleon became increasingly autocratic as his political career progressed and once in power embraced certain aspects of both liberalism and authoritarianism\u2014for example, [[state school|public education]], a generally liberal restructuring of the French [[list of national legal systems|legal system]], and the emancipation of the Jews\u2014while rejecting [[representative democracy|electoral democracy]] and [[freedom of the press]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Maps==\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\nFrance Departement 1801.svg|[[130 departments of the First French Empire|French ''d\u00e9partements'']] in 1801 during the Consulate\nFrance L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|French ''d\u00e9partements'' in 1812\nFile:Carte de l'Empire Fran\u00e7ais 1812.jpg|Map of the First French Empire in 1812, divided into [[130 departments of the First French Empire|133 ''d\u00e9partements'']], with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], and the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and [[Illyrian Provinces|Illyria and Dalmatia]]\nFile:Europe 1812 map en.png|Europe in 1812, with the French Empire at its peak before the [[French invasion of Russia|Russian Campaign]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n*[[French Revolution]]\n*[[History of France]]\n*[[List of Napoleonic battles]]\n*[[Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n*[[Paris under Napoleon]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n# {{note|Note 1}} Domestically styled as ''French Republic'' until 1808: compare the French franc minted in 1808<ref>http://www.lesfrancs.com/francais/1f1808rh.jpg</ref> and in 1809,<ref>http://www.lesfrancs.com/francais/1f1809rh.jpg</ref> as well as Article 1 of the Constitution of the Year XII,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/les-constitutions-dans-l-histoire/constitution-de-l-an-xii-empire-28-floreal-an-xii|title=Constitution de l'An XII - Empire - 28 flor\u00e9al An XII|website=Conseil constitutionnel}}</ref> which reads in English ''The Government of the' Republic is vested in an Emperor, who takes the title of Emperor of the French.''\n# {{note|Note 2}} According to his father's will only.

Although France had already established an overseas [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]] beginning in the 17th century, the French state had remained a [[Early modern France|kingdom under the Bourbons]] and a [[French First Republic|republic]] after the [[French Revolution]]. Historians refer to Napoleon's regime as the ''First Empire'' to distinguish it from the restorationist [[Second French Empire|''Second Empire'']] (1852\u20131870) ruled by his nephew [[Napoleon III]].\n\nOn 18 May 1804, Napoleon was granted the title [[Emperor of the French]] (''{{lang|fr|L'Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais}}'', {{IPA-fr|l\u0251\u0303.p\u0281\u0153\u0281 de f\u0281\u0251\u0303.s\u025b|pron}}) by the French {{lang|fr|[[S\u00e9nat conservateur|S\u00e9nat]]}} (Senate) and was crowned on 2 December 1804,<ref>{{cite web | last1=Thierry | first1=Lentz | title=The Proclamation of Empire by the {{lang|fr|S\u00e9nat Conservateur | nocat=y}} | url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/reading_room/articles/files/lentz_proclamation.asp | website=napoleon.org | publisher=Fondation Napol\u00e9on | accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> signifying the end of the [[French Consulate]] and of the [[French First Republic]]. The French Empire achieved military supremacy in mainland Europe through notable victories in the [[War of the Third Coalition]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and allied nations, notably at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805.<ref>{{cite web | title=Battle of Austerlitz | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43578/Battle-of-Austerlitz | website=Britannica.com | publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> French dominance was reaffirmed during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt]] in 1806 and the [[Battle of Friedland]] in 1807,<ref>{{cite web | last1=Hickman | first1=Kennedy | title=Napoleonic Wars: Battle of Friedland | url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/napoleonicwars/p/battle-of-friedland.htm | website=militaryhistory.about.com | publisher=about.com | accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> before Napoleon's final defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.\n\nA series of wars, known collectively as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], extended French influence to much of Western Europe and into Poland. At its height in 1812, the French Empire had [[130 departments of the First French Empire|130 departments]], ruled over 70 million subjects, maintained an extensive military presence in [[Confederation of the Rhine|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spain]], and the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and counted Austria and Prussia as nominal allies.<ref>Martyn Lyons, ''Napoleon Bonaparte and the Legacy of the French Revolution.'' p. 232</ref> Early French victories exported many ideological features of the Revolution throughout Europe: the introduction of the [[Napoleonic Code]] throughout the continent increased legal equality, established jury systems and legalised divorce, and [[manorialism|seigneurial dues and seigneurial justice]] were abolished, as were aristocratic privileges in all places except Poland.<ref>Martyn Lyons pp. 234\u201336</ref> France's defeat in 1814 (and then again in 1815), marked the end of the Empire.\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|18 Brumaire|French Consulate}}\nIn 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte was confronted by [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s]]\u2014one of five [[French Directory|Directors]] constituting the executive branch of the French government\u2014who sought his support for a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' to overthrow the [[Constitution of the Year III]]. The plot included Bonaparte's brother [[Lucien Bonaparte|Lucien]], then serving as speaker of the [[Council of Five Hundred]], [[Roger Ducos]], another Director, and [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]]. On 9 November 1799 ([[18 Brumaire]] (VIII under the [[French Republican Calendar]])) and the following day, troops led by Bonaparte seized control.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} They dispersed the legislative councils, leaving a rump legislature to name Bonaparte, Siey\u00e8s and Ducos as provisional Consuls to administer the government. Although Siey\u00e8s expected to dominate the new regime, the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], he was outmaneuvered by Bonaparte, who drafted the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] and secured his own election as First Consul. He thus became the most powerful person in France, a power that was increased by the [[Constitution of the Year X]], which made him First Consul for life.\n\nThe [[Battle of Marengo]] (14 June 1800) inaugurated the political idea that was to continue its development until Napoleon's Moscow campaign. Napoleon planned only to keep the [[Duchy of Milan]] for France, setting aside Austria, and was thought{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to prepare a new campaign in the East. The [[Peace of Amiens]], which cost him control of [[Egypt]], was a temporary truce. He gradually extended his authority in Italy by annexing the [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and by acquiring [[Genoa]], [[Parma]], Tuscany and [[Naples]], and added this Italian territory to his [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Then he laid siege to the Roman state and initiated the [[Concordat of 1801]] to control the material claims of the [[pope]]. When he recognised his error of raising the authority of the pope from that of a figurehead, Napoleon produced the ''[[Organic Articles|Articles Organiques]]'' (1802) with the goal of becoming the legal protector of the papacy, like [[Charlemagne]]. To conceal his plans before their actual execution, he aroused French colonial aspirations against Britain and the memory of the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], exacerbating British envy of France, whose borders now extended to the [[Rhine]] and beyond, to [[Hanover]], Hamburg and [[Cuxhaven]].

[[William Pitt the Younger]], back in power over Britain, appealed once more for an Anglo-Austro-Russian [[coalition]] against Napoleon to stop the ideals of revolutionary France from spreading.\n\nOn 18 May 1804, Napoleon was given the title of \"[[Emperor of the French]]\" by the [[French Consulate#The new government|Senate]]; finally, on 2 December 1804, he was [[Coronation of Napoleon I|solemnly crowned]], after receiving the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] of the [[Kings of the Lombards|Lombard kings]], and was consecrated by [[Pope Pius VII]] in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].{{ref|Note 3|Note 3}}\n\nIn four campaigns, the Emperor transformed his \"[[Charlemagne|Carolingian]]\" [[feudal]] [[French First Republic|republican]] and [[Federation|federal]] empire into one modelled on the [[Roman Empire]]. The memories of imperial Rome were for a third time, after [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Charlemagne]], used to modify the historical evolution of France. Though the vague plan for an invasion of Great Britain was never executed, the [[Battle of Ulm]] and the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] overshadowed the defeat of [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and the camp at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] put at Napoleon's disposal the best military resources he had commanded, in the form of ''[[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]''.\n\n==Early victories==\nIn the [[War of the Third Coalition]], Napoleon swept away the remnants of the old [[Holy Roman Empire]] and created in [[southern Germany]] the [[vassal state]]s of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], which were reorganized into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. The [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], signed on 26 December 1805, extracted extensive territorial concessions from Austria, on top of a large financial indemnity. Napoleon's creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the occupation of [[Ancona]], and his annexation of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and its former [[Adriatic]] territories marked a new stage in the French Empire's progress.\n\n[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''The [[Battle of Austerlitz]], 2nd December 1805'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]]]]\n\nTo create [[satellite state]]s, Napoleon installed his relatives as rulers of many European states. The [[House of Bonaparte|Bonapartes]] began to marry into old European monarchies, gaining sovereignty over many nations. [[Joseph Bonaparte]] replaced the dispossessed [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] in Naples; [[Louis Bonaparte]] was installed on the throne of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], formed from the [[Batavian Republic]]; [[Joachim Murat]] became [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Grand-Duke of Berg]]; [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] was made son-in-law to the King of W\u00fcrttemberg and [[Kingdom of Westphalia|King of Westphalia]]; and Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais was appointed Viceroy of Italy while [[St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais]] married the son of the Grand Duke of Baden. In addition to the vassal titles, Napoleon's closest relatives were also granted the title of [[Nobility of the First French Empire|French Prince]] and formed the [[Imperial House of France (First French Empire)|Imperial House of France]].\n\nMet with opposition, Napoleon would not tolerate any neutral power. On 6 August 1806 the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] abdicated their title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in order to prevent Napoleon from becoming the next Emperor, ending a political power which had endured for over a thousand years. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] had been offered the territory of [[Hannover|Hanover]] to stay out of the Third Coalition. With the diplomatic situation changing, Napoleon offered Great Britain the province as part of a peace proposal. This, combined with growing tensions in Germany over French hegemony, Prussia responded by forming an alliance with Russia and sending troops into Bavaria on 1 October 1806. During the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], Napoleon destroyed the Prussian armies at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena and Auerstedt]]. Successive victories at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] against the Russians finally ruined [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]'s formerly mighty kingdom, obliging [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and Prussia to make peace with France at [[Treaties of Tilsit|Tilsit]].\n\n==Height of the Empire==\n[[File:Arc de Triomphe, Paris 5 February 2019.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'', ordered by [[Napoleon]] in honour of the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', is one of several landmarks whose construction was started in Paris during the First French Empire.]]\n\nThe Treaties of Tilsit ended the war between Russia and France and began an alliance between the two empires that held as much power as the rest of Europe. The two empires secretly agreed to aid each other in disputes. France pledged to aid Russia against the [[Ottoman Empire]], while Russia agreed to join the [[Continental System]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Napoleon also forced Alexander to enter the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u201312)|Anglo-Russian War]] and to instigate the [[Finnish War]] against Sweden in order to force Sweden to join the Continental System.\n\nMore specifically, Alexander agreed to evacuate [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], which had been occupied by Russian forces as part of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u201312)|Russo-Turkish War]]. The [[Ionian Islands]] and [[Cattaro]], which had been captured by Russian admirals [[Fyodor Ushakov|Ushakov]] and [[Dmitry Senyavin|Senyavin]], were to be handed over to the French. In recompense, Napoleon guaranteed the sovereignty of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]] and several other small states ruled by the Russian emperor's German relatives.\n\nThe treaty removed about half of Prussia's territory: [[Cottbus]] was given to Saxony, the left bank of the [[Elbe]] was awarded to the newly created Kingdom of Westphalia, [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was given to Russia, and the rest of the Polish lands in Prussian possession were set up as the Duchy of Warsaw. Prussia was ordered to reduce its army to 40,000 men and to pay an indemnity of 100,000,000 francs. Observers in Prussia viewed the treaty as unfair and as a national humiliation.\n\n[[File:Iena.jpg|thumb|left|Napoleon reviewing the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] before the [[Battle of Jena]], 1806]]\n\n[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] had advised Napoleon to pursue milder terms; the treaties marked an important stage in his estrangement from the emperor. After Tilsit, instead of trying to reconcile Europe, as Talleyrand had advised, Napoleon wanted to defeat Britain and complete his Italian dominion. To the coalition of the northern powers, he added the league of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and Mediterranean ports, and to the bombardment of [[Copenhagen]] by the [[Royal Navy]] he responded with a second decree of blockade, dated from Milan on 17 December 1807.\n\nThe application of the Concordat and the taking of Naples led to Napoleon's first struggles with the Pope, centered around [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] renewing the theocratic affirmations of [[Pope Gregory VII]]. The emperor's Roman ambition was made more visible by the occupation of the Kingdom of Naples and of the [[Marches]], and by the entry of [[Sextius Alexandre Fran\u00e7ois de Miollis|Miollis]] into Rome; while General [[Jean-Andoche Junot|Junot]] invaded Portugal, Marshal [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] [[Peninsular War|took control]] of formerly Roman Spain as Regent. Soon after, Napoleon had his brother, Joseph, crowned King of Spain and sent him there to take control.\n\nNapoleon tried to succeed in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as he had done in Italy, in the Netherlands, and in Hesse. However, the exile of the Spanish Royal Family to [[Bayonne]], together with the enthroning of Joseph Bonaparte, turned the Spanish against Napoleon. After the ''[[Dos de Mayo Uprising|Dos de Mayo]]'' riots and subsequent reprisals, the Spanish government began an effective guerrilla campaign, under the oversight of local ''Juntas''. The Iberian Peninsula became a war zone from the Pyrenees to the Straits of Gibraltar and saw the Grande Arm\u00e9e facing the remnants of the Spanish Army, as well as British and Portuguese forces. General [[Pierre Dupont de l'\u00c9tang|Dupont]] capitulated at [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n|Bail\u00e9n]] to [[Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os, 1st Duke of Bail\u00e9n|General Casta\u00f1os]], and Junot at [[Convention of Cintra|Cintra]], Portugal to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General Wellesley]].\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Battle of Eylau]], 1807]]\nSpain used up the soldiers needed for Napoleon's other fields of battle, and they had to be replaced by conscripts. Spanish resistance affected Austria, and indicated the potential of national resistance. The provocations of Talleyrand and Britain strengthened the idea that the Austrians could emulate the Spanish. On April 10, 1809, Austria invaded France's ally, Bavaria. The campaign of 1809, however, would not be nearly as long and troublesome for France as the one in Spain and Portugal. Following a short and decisive action in Bavaria, Napoleon opened up the road to the Austrian capital of [[Vienna]] for a second time. At [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern]], Napoleon suffered his first serious tactical defeat, along with the death of [[Jean Lannes]], an able Marshal and dear friend of the emperor. The victory at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], however, forced Austria to sue for peace. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], signed on 14 December 1809, resulted in the annexation of the [[Illyrian Provinces]] and recognized past French conquests.\n\nThe Pope was forcibly deported to [[Savona]], and his domains were incorporated into the French Empire. The Senate's decision on 17 February 1810 created the title \"King of Rome\", and made Rome the capital of Italy. Between 1810 and 1812 Napoleon's divorce of [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine|Jos\u00e9phine]], and his marriage with [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria]], followed by the birth of [[Napoleon II|his son]], shed light upon his future policy. He gradually withdrew power from his siblings and concentrated his affection and ambition on his son, the guarantee of the continuance of his dynasty, marking the high point of the Empire.\n\n==Intrigues and unrest==\nUndermining forces, however, had already begun to impinge on the faults inherent in Napoleon\u2019s achievements. Britain, protected by the English Channel and its navy, was [[Golden Cavalry of St George|persistently active]], and rebellion of both the governing and of the governed broke out everywhere. Napoleon, though he underrated it, soon felt his failure in coping with the Peninsular War. Men like [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl, baron von und zum Stein|Baron von Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg|August von Hardenberg]] and [[Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst|Johann von Scharnhorst]] had begun secretly preparing Prussia's retaliation.\n\n[[File:\u0422\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0438\u0442. 1807.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Napoleon demanded that [[Alexander I of Russia]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] meet him at [[Treaties of Tilsit|Tilsit]] in July 1807.]]\nThe alliance arranged at Tilsit was seriously shaken by the Austrian marriage, the threat of Polish restoration to Russia, and the Continental System. The very persons whom he had placed in power were counteracting his plans. With many of his siblings and relations performing unsuccessfully or even betraying him, Napoleon found himself obliged to revoke their power. [[Caroline Bonaparte]] conspired against her brother and against her husband Murat; the hypochondriac Louis, now Dutch in his sympathies, found the supervision of the blockade taken from him, and also the defense of the [[Scheldt]], which he had refused to ensure. [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] lost control of the blockade on the [[North Sea]] shores. The very nature of things was against the new dynasties, as it had been against the old.\n\nAfter national insurrections and family recriminations came treachery from Napoleon's ministers. Talleyrand betrayed his designs to [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]] and suffered dismissal. [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]], corresponding with Austria in 1809 and 1810, entered into an understanding with Louis and also with Britain, while [[Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne|Bourrienne]] was convicted of speculation. By consequence of the spirit of conquest Napoleon had aroused, many of his marshals and officials, having tasted victory, dreamed of sovereign power: [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]], who had helped him to the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], played Napoleon false to win the crown of Sweden. [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]], like Murat, coveted the Spanish throne after that of Portugal, thus anticipating the treason of 1812.\n\nThe country itself, though flattered by conquests, was tired of self-sacrifice. The unpopularity of [[conscription]] gradually turned many of Napoleon\u2019s subjects against him. Amidst profound silence from the press and the assemblies, a protest was raised against imperial power by the literary world, against the excommunicated sovereign by Catholicism, and against the author of the continental blockade by the discontented [[bourgeoisie]], ruined by the crisis of 1811. Even as he lost his military principles, Napoleon maintained his gift for brilliance. His [[Six Days' Campaign]], which took place at the very end of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], is often regarded as his greatest display of leadership and military prowess. But by then it was the end (or \"the finish\"), and it was during the years before when the nations of Europe conspired against France. While Napoleon and his holdings idled and worsened, the rest of Europe agreed to avenge the revolutionary events of 1792.\n\n==Fall==\n{{Main|French invasion of Russia|War of the Sixth Coalition|Hundred Days}}\n[[File:Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier-Campagne de France.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Napoleon and his staff during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], by [[Ernest Meissonier|Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]]]]\nNapoleon had hardly succeeded in putting down the revolt in Germany when the emperor of Russia himself headed a European insurrection against Napoleon. To put an end to this, to ensure his own access to the Mediterranean and exclude his chief rival, Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812. Despite his victorious advance, the [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|taking of Smolensk]], the victory on the [[Battle of Borodino|Moskva]], and the entry into Moscow, he was defeated by the country and the climate, and by Alexander's refusal to make terms. After this came the terrible retreat in the harsh Russian winter, while all of Europe was turning against him. Pushed back, as he had been in Spain, from bastion to bastion, after the action on the [[Battle of Berezina|Berezina]], Napoleon had to fall back upon the frontiers of 1809, and then\u2014having refused the peace offered to him by Austria at the Congress of Prague (4 June\u201310 August 1813), from fear of losing Italy, where each of his victories had marked a stage in the accomplishment of his dream\u2014on those of 1805, despite the victories at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]], and on those of 1802 after his disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], when Bernadotte\u2014now Crown Prince of Sweden\u2014turned upon him, [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|General Moreau]] also joined the Allies, and longstanding allied nations, such as Saxony and Bavaria, forsook him as well.\n\nFollowing his retreat from Russia, Napoleon continued to retreat, this time from Germany. After the loss of Spain, reconquered by an Allied army led by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]], the uprising in the Netherlands preliminary to the invasion and the manifesto of Frankfurt (1 December 1813)<ref>The Frankfort Declaration, 1 December 1813: http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_frankfort.html</ref> which proclaimed it, he was forced to fall back upon the frontiers of 1795; and was later driven further back upon those of 1792\u2014despite the brilliant [[Campaign in north-east France (1814)|campaign of 1814 against the invaders]]. Paris capitulated on 30 March 1814, and the [[Carthago delenda est|''Delenda Carthago'']], pronounced against Britain, was spoken of Napoleon. The Empire briefly fell with Napoleon's abdication at [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Fontainebleau]] on 11 April 1814.\n\nAfter less than a year's exile on the island of [[Principality of Elba|Elba]], Napoleon escaped to France with a thousand men and four cannons. King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] sent Marshal Ney to arrest him. Upon meeting Ney's army, Napoleon dismounted and walked into firing range, saying \"If one of you wishes to kill his emperor, here I am!\" But instead of firing, the soldiers went to join Napoleon's side shouting \"Vive l'Empereur!\" Napoleon retook the throne temporarily in 1815, reviving the Empire in what is known as the [[Hundred Days]]. However, he was defeated by the Seventh Coalition at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. He surrendered himself to the British and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], a remote island in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in 1821. After the Hundred Days, the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon monarchy was restored]], with Louis XVIII regaining the throne of France, while the rest of Napoleon's conquests were disposed of in the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\n==Nature of Napoleon Bonaparte's rule==\n[[File:Constitution an VIII et le Empire Francais.png|thumb|center|upright=2.75|Organigramme of the French Consulate and later the Empire]]\n[[File:Speyer (DerHexer) 2010-12-19 051.jpg|thumb|The [[Napoleonic Code]]]]\nNapoleon gained support by appealing to some common concerns of the French people. These included dislike of the emigrant [[nobility]] who had escaped persecution, fear by some of a restoration of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', a dislike and suspicion of foreign countries that had tried to reverse the Revolution\u2014and a wish by Jacobins to extend France's revolutionary ideals.\n\nNapoleon attracted power and imperial status and gathered support for his changes of French institutions, such as the [[Concordat of 1801]] which confirmed the Catholic Church as the majority church of France and restored some of its civil status.\nNapoleon by this time however was not a democrat, nor a republican. He was, he liked to think, an enlightened despot, the sort of man [[Voltaire]] might have found appealing. He preserved numerous social gains of the Revolution while suppressing political liberty. He admired efficiency and strength and hated feudalism, religious intolerance, and civil inequality. Enlightened despotism meant political stability. He knew Roman history well, as after 500 years of republicanism, Rome became an empire under [[Augustus]].\n\nAlthough a supporter of the [[political radicalism|radical]] [[Jacobin|Jacobins]] during the early days of the Revolution (more out of pragmatism than any real ideology), Napoleon became increasingly autocratic as his political career progressed and once in power embraced certain aspects of both liberalism and authoritarianism\u2014for example, [[state school|public education]], a generally liberal restructuring of the French [[list of national legal systems|legal system]], and the emancipation of the Jews\u2014while rejecting [[representative democracy|electoral democracy]] and [[freedom of the press]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Maps==\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\nFrance Departement 1801.svg|[[130 departments of the First French Empire|French ''d\u00e9partements'']] in 1801 during the Consulate\nFrance L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|French ''d\u00e9partements'' in 1812\nFile:Carte de l'Empire Fran\u00e7ais 1812.jpg|Map of the First French Empire in 1812, divided into [[130 departments of the First French Empire|133 ''d\u00e9partements'']], with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], and the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and [[Illyrian Provinces|Illyria and Dalmatia]]\nFile:Europe 1812 map en.png|Europe in 1812, with the French Empire at its peak before the [[French invasion of Russia|Russian Campaign]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n*[[French Revolution]]\n*[[History of France]]\n*[[List of Napoleonic battles]]\n*[[Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n*[[Paris under Napoleon]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n# {{note|Note 1}} Domestically styled as ''French Republic'' until 1808: compare the French franc minted in 1808<ref>http://www.lesfrancs.com/francais/1f1808rh.jpg</ref> and in 1809,<ref>http://www.lesfrancs.com/francais/1f1809rh.jpg</ref> as well as Article 1 of the Constitution of the Year XII,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/les-constitutions-dans-l-histoire/constitution-de-l-an-xii-empire-28-floreal-an-xii|title=Constitution de l'An XII - Empire - 28 flor\u00e9al An XII|website=Conseil constitutionnel}}</ref> which reads in English ''The Government of the' Republic is vested in an Emperor, who takes the title of Emperor of the French.''\n# {{note|Note 2}} According to his father's will only.
