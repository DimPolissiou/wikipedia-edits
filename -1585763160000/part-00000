In the early days of Anglo-American settlement furs and hides were the major products derived from cattle. Beef was not particularly popular in the United States. However soon Texas entrepreneurs pioneered the beef industry and demand steadily increased. The cattle industry enjoyed its greatest financial success in the later 1870s and 1880s.\n\nCotton production, which had been known in Texas since Spanish times, gradually increased throughout the 19th century. By the early 20th century Texas had become the leading cotton producer in the nation. By the 1920s the cotton industry was past its peak as government regulation and foreign competition took their toll.<ref>{{cite Handbook of Texas | name=Cotton Culture | id=afc03|first1=Karen Gerhardt |last1=Britton |first2=Fred C. |last2=Elliott |first3=E.

The vast woodlands of the region, home to many varieties of wildlife when Europeans first arrived, provided major economic opportunities for early settlers. They today continue to play an important role economically and environmentally in the state.\n\nThe densest forest lands lie in the eastern part of the state. In particular the [[Big Thicket]] region, just north of [[Houston]] and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], has historically been home to the most dense woodlands. The Big Thicket was mostly uninhabited until heavy settlement from the U.S. began in the mid-19th century, and was even used as a refuge by runaway slaves and other fugitives. The [[Rio Grande]] valley in [[South Texas]] was home to a large palm tree forest when Spaniards first arrived, though today very little of it remains.\n\nThe development of railroads in the eastern part of the state during the mid-19th century led to a boom in lumber production in the 1880s. This era of financial success lasted approximately 50 years finally coming to an end as Texas' forests were decimated and the Great Depression dropped prices.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=drl02 | name=Lumber Industry}}</ref>\n\n{{Main article|Texas Oil Boom}}\nIn 1901 the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company struck oil on [[Spindletop|Spindletop Hill]] in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. Though petroleum production was not new, this strike was by far the largest the world had ever seen. The find led to widespread exploration throughout Texas and neighboring states. By 1940 Texas was firmly established as the leading oil producer in the U.S.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=doogz | name=Oil and Gas Industry}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Texas instruments gate3 dallas tx usa 2009-08-07.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of [[Texas Instruments]]]]\nTexas remained largely rural until [[World War II]] though the success of the petroleum industry rapidly expanded the economy with heavy industry of many types taking root. The second world war created tremendous demand for petroleum and a variety of products that Texas was in a unique position to provide. By the end of the war Texas was one of the leading industrial states and the population had become predominantly urban. Additionally the economy had diversified sufficiently that, though petroleum was still the largest sector by the end of the war, the business community in the state was truly diverse.\n\nThe Texas economy today relies largely on information technology, oil and natural gas, aerospace, defense, biomedical research, fuel processing, electric power, [[agriculture]], and manufacturing.\n\n{| class=\"toc\"  style=\"float:right; font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin:1em;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"tan\"|'''Fortune 500 companies<br /> based in Texas for 2011'''<br />according to revenues<br />''with State and U.S. rankings''\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"cccccc\"| '''State'''||||bgcolor=\"cccccc\"|'''Corporation'''||||bgcolor=\"cccccc\"|'''US''' \n|-\n| 1||||[[ExxonMobil]]||||2\n|-\n| 2||||[[ConocoPhillips]]||||4\n|-\n| 3||||[[AT&T]]||||12\n|-\n| 4||||[[Valero Energy Corporation|Valero Energy]]||||24\n|-\n| 5||||[[Marathon Oil]]||||29\n|-\n| 6||||[[Dell]]||||41\n|-\n| 7||||[[Sysco]]||||67\n|-\n| 8||||[[Enterprise Products]]||||80\n|-\n| 9||||[[Plains All American Pipeline]]||||99\n|-\n| 10||||[[AMR Corporation|AMR]]|||||118\n|-\n| 11||||[[Fluor Corporation|Fluor]]||||124\n|-\n| 12||||[[Tesoro]]||||128\n|-\n| 13||||[[Kimberly-Clark]]||||130\n|-\n| 14||||[[Halliburton]]||||144\n|-\n| 15||||[[USAA]]||||145\n|-\n| 16||||[[J.

In the early days of Anglo-American settlement furs and hides were the major products derived from cattle. Beef was not particularly popular in the United States.

The cattle industry enjoyed its greatest financial success in the later 1870s and 1880s.\n\nCotton production, which had been known in Texas since Spanish times, gradually increased throughout the 19th century. By the early 20th century Texas had become the leading cotton producer in the nation.

A. |last3=Miller|date=June 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{Main article|History of Texas forests}}\nThe forests of Texas have been an important resource since its earliest days and have played an important role in the state's history. The vast woodlands of the region, home to many varieties of wildlife when Europeans first arrived, provided major economic opportunities for early settlers. They today continue to play an important role economically and environmentally in the state.\n\nThe densest forest lands lie in the eastern part of the state. In particular the [[Big Thicket]] region, just north of [[Houston]] and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], has historically been home to the most dense woodlands. The Big Thicket was mostly uninhabited until heavy settlement from the U.S. began in the mid-19th century, and was even used as a refuge by runaway slaves and other fugitives. The [[Rio Grande]] valley in [[South Texas]] was home to a large palm tree forest when Spaniards first arrived, though today very little of it remains.\n\nThe development of railroads in the eastern part of the state during the mid-19th century led to a boom in lumber production in the 1880s. This era of financial success lasted approximately 50 years finally coming to an end as Texas' forests were decimated and the Great Depression dropped prices.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=drl02 | name=Lumber Industry}}</ref>\n\n{{Main article|Texas Oil Boom}}\nIn 1901 the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company struck oil on [[Spindletop|Spindletop Hill]] in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. Though petroleum production was not new, this strike was by far the largest the world had ever seen. The find led to widespread exploration throughout Texas and neighboring states. By 1940 Texas was firmly established as the leading oil producer in the U.S.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas | id=doogz | name=Oil and Gas Industry}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Texas instruments gate3 dallas tx usa 2009-08-07.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of [[Texas Instruments]]]]\nTexas remained largely rural until [[World War II]] though the success of the petroleum industry rapidly expanded the economy with heavy industry of many types taking root. The second world war created tremendous demand for petroleum and a variety of products that Texas was in a unique position to provide. By the end of the war Texas was one of the leading industrial states and the population had become predominantly urban. Additionally the economy had diversified sufficiently that, though petroleum was still the largest sector by the end of the war, the business community in the state was truly diverse.\n\nThe Texas economy today relies largely on information technology, oil and natural gas, aerospace, defense, biomedical research, fuel processing, electric power, [[agriculture]], and manufacturing.\n\n{| class=\"toc\"  style=\"float:right; font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin:1em;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" bgcolor=\"tan\"|'''Fortune 500 companies<br /> based in Texas for 2011'''<br />according to revenues<br />''with State and U.S. rankings''\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"cccccc\"| '''State'''||||bgcolor=\"cccccc\"|'''Corporation'''||||bgcolor=\"cccccc\"|'''US''' \n|-\n| 1||||[[ExxonMobil]]||||2\n|-\n| 2||||[[ConocoPhillips]]||||4\n|-\n| 3||||[[AT&T]]||||12\n|-\n| 4||||[[Valero Energy Corporation|Valero Energy]]||||24\n|-\n| 5||||[[Marathon Oil]]||||29\n|-\n| 6||||[[Dell]]||||41\n|-\n| 7||||[[Sysco]]||||67\n|-\n| 8||||[[Enterprise Products]]||||80\n|-\n| 9||||[[Plains All American Pipeline]]||||99\n|-\n| 10||||[[AMR Corporation|AMR]]|||||118\n|-\n| 11||||[[Fluor Corporation|Fluor]]||||124\n|-\n| 12||||[[Tesoro]]||||128\n|-\n| 13||||[[Kimberly-Clark]]||||130\n|-\n| 14||||[[Halliburton]]||||144\n|-\n| 15||||[[USAA]]||||145\n|-\n| 16||||[[J.

In December 1561, David repaired to [[Qazvin]] to offer his submission to Shah Tahmasp, converted to Islam and adopted the name of Daud Khan. The shah appointed him ruler in Kartli, elevated him to the rank of ''farzand'' (\"son\") at his investiture,{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=83}} and sent with a Persian army to claim the power. He may have been an unnamed Georgian prince reported by the English explorer [[Anthony Jenkinson]] as attending his audience with Shah Tahmasp on 20 November 1562, but Daud appears to have been returned to Georgia in August 1562 and the Georgian prince of Jenkinson's report could have been another Georgian renegade, [[Prince Jesse of Kakheti]] (Isa Khan).{{sfn|Karchava|2018|pp=221\u2013223}} \n\nRelying on the Persian occupation forces and a few loyal nobles, Daud was in control of the Georgian capital [[Tbilisi]] and the province of [[Lower Kartli]], while the rest of the kingdom remained faithful to Simon. The rival brothers met on the battlefield on several occasions. The hostilities took place mainly around Tbilisi, which was blockaded by Simon\u2019s forces from 1567 to 1569. Although the king won the battles at [[Battle of Digomi|Dighomi]] (1567) and Samadlo (1569), the Persians eventually prevailed and took Simon captive at the [[Battle of Partskhisi]], 1569. He was sent in chains to the fortress of [[Alamut]], and Daud Khan assumed nominal control of all of Kartli. As previously, he relied on the Persians and paid an annual tribute to the Shah. A patriotic alliance of nobles led by Prince Sachino Baratashvili continued, however, resistance to the renegade Georgian ruler. In 1578, a peace between the Safavids and the Ottomans collapsed. The Turkish army commanded by [[Lala Mustafa Pasha]] overran much of Georgia and dislodged Daud Khan, who had burnt the citadel of Tbilisi and taken shelter at Lorri. The Shah presently freed Simon to fight against the Ottomans and reinstated him as king of Kartli. In retaliation, Daud Khan handed the control over Lorri to the Turks and fled to [[Istanbul]], where he was welcomed and granted lordship over two [[sanjak]]s. His sons, Bagrat and Khosro, took shelter in Persia. During his stay in [[Turkey]], Daud Khan compiled two Ottoman-era medical treatises (''qarabadin'') and translated it into Georgian, sending a copy to his motherland.\n\n==Family==\nDavid was married to Elene ({{floruit|1569\u20131578}}), a relative of King [[Alexander II of Kakheti]].

His first tenure was marked by war against the [[Safavid Iran|Persian]] domination of Georgia. In 1569 he was captured by the Persians, and spent nine years in captivity. In 1578 he was released and reinstalled in Kartli. During this period (i.e. his second tenure), he fought as a Persian subject against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination of Georgia.{{sfn|Riota|2017|page=53}}{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|page=176}} In 1599 Simon I was captured by the Ottomans and died in captivity.{{sfn|Riota|2017|page=53}} During 1557 to 1569 he was known as '''Mahmud Khan''' ({{Lang-fa|\u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646|translit=Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n}}) and from 1578 to 1599 as '''Shahnavaz Khan''' ({{Lang-fa|\u0634\u0627\u0647\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0627\u0646|translit=Sh\u0101hnav\u0101z Kh\u0101n}})\n\n==First reign and struggle against Persia==\nThe eldest son of the heroic king [[Luarsab I of Kartli]] and [[Tamar of Imereti]], he commanded his father's army at the [[Battle of Garisi]] against the Persian invaders, 1556. He was proclaimed by his father co-ruler and heir apparent just prior to the action. Though Luarsab was mortally wounded, the battle was won by Simon, who soon ascended the throne on the death of his father. As the Kartlian capital [[Tbilisi]] remained in the Persian hands, Simon had a residence in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], whence he ruled over the territories recaptured from the occupiers. In 1559, he allied himself with another Georgian sovereign, [[Levan I of Kakheti]], and married his daughter [[Nestan-Darejan of Kakheti, Queen of Kartli|Nestan-Darejan]]. Beginning in 1560, Simon launched a series of battles to recover Tbilisi, but in April 1561 suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Tsikhedidi]], which cost life to his brother-in-law and ally, [[Prince Giorgi of Kakheti (died 1561)|Prince Giorgi of Kakheti]]. His brother, [[David XI of Kartli|David]], recently submitted to the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Shah]] [[Tahmasp I]], converted to [[Islam]], and returned with a Persian army to claim the crown. Simon blockaded Tbilisi and won the battles at [[Battle of Digomi|Dighomi]] (1567) and Samadlo (1569), but he was finally defeated and taken prisoner at [[Battle of Partskhisi|P'artskhisi]], 1569. David, now known as Daud Khan, was made by Persians a tributary king of Kartli. Simon was sent to Persia where he refused to convert to [[Islam]] and was imprisoned at the fortress of [[Alamut]] for nine years.\n\n==Second reign and struggle against the Ottomans==\n[[File:The men of Erzurum attacked by Simun.

At the same time, he induced the prince [[Manuchar II Jaqeli]] to revolt against the Ottoman rule in [[Akhaltsikhe]], and attempted to get support from [[Pope]] [[Clement VIII]], Emperor [[Rudolph II]] and [[Philip II of Spain]]. The negotiations, however, failed to yield any serious results.<ref>''Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Mediterranean World After 1492'', p. 85, edited by Alisa M.

Simon I's [[Persian language|Persian]] monolingual [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the same period reads: \"[[Allah]], who has no equal, knows that Semiyun (Simon) is a slave of the [[Shah]] from the bottom of his heart, 933 (1585)\".{{sfn|Beradze|2012|page=466}}\n\nFrom 1588 to 1590, Simon interfered on three occasions into a power struggle in the western Georgian kingdom of [[Imereti]], and though victorious over [[Levan of Imereti]] at the Battle of Gop'anto (1588), he was finally defeated at Op'shkviti and driven out with the help of the Turks. Finally, the Ottomans prevailed and their recently appointed commander, Ferhad Pasha, was able to conquer Kartli by 1588. Simon had to make peace with the [[Sublime Porte]] and agreed to pay an annual tribute. By a [[Treaty of Constantinople (1590)|peace treaty]] signed in [[Constantinople]] on March 21, 1590, the Safavids also recognised all of Georgia as an Ottoman possession. Simon, however, resumed his struggle against the occupants in 1595, and retook Gori after a long-lasting siege in 1599. The [[sultan]] [[Mehmed III]] sent a large punitive force led by Jafar Pasha, [[beylerbey]] of [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. Simon met it at the [[Battle of Nakhiduri]], but he was severely defeated and taken captive while retreating, 1599.\n\nUpon the Simon's arrest the Sultan [[Mehmed III]] made the following order:\n\n{{cquote|From [[Morocco]] to the [[Caspian Sea]], from the [[Caucasus]] to the [[Persian Gulf]], I order to exhibit the carpets in all of my realm and to celebrate for 3 days the arrest of King Simon.}}\n\nSimon was sent to Constantinople where the Georgian noblewoman [[Gulchara]] was brought to care for the aged king. He died in 1611 as a prisoner at the [[Yedikule Fortress|Fortress of the Seven Towers (Yedikule)]] without converting to [[Sunni Islam]],{{sfn|Riota|2017|page=53}} shortly before the [[Treaty of Nasuh Pasha|cessation]] of the Ottoman\u2013Safavid hostilities.

His first tenure was marked by war against the [[Safavid dynasty|Persian]] domination of Georgia. In 1569 he was captured by the Persians, and spent nine years in captivity. In 1578 he was released and reinstalled in Kartli. During this period (i.e. his second tenure), he fought as a Persian subject against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination of Georgia.{{sfn|Riota|2017|page=53}}{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|page=176}} In 1599 Simon I was captured by the Ottomans and died in captivity.{{sfn|Riota|2017|page=53}} During 1557 to 1569 he was known as '''Mahmud Khan''' ({{Lang-fa|\u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646|translit=Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n}}) and from 1578 to 1599 as '''Shahnavaz Khan''' ({{Lang-fa|\u0634\u0627\u0647\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0627\u0646|translit=Sh\u0101hnav\u0101z Kh\u0101n}})\n\n==First reign and struggle against Persia==\nThe eldest son of the heroic king [[Luarsab I of Kartli]] and [[Tamar of Imereti]], he commanded his father's army at the [[Battle of Garisi]] against the Persian invaders, 1556. He was proclaimed by his father co-ruler and heir apparent just prior to the action. Though Luarsab was mortally wounded, the battle was won by Simon, who soon ascended the throne on the death of his father. As the Kartlian capital [[Tbilisi]] remained in the Persian hands, Simon had a residence in [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], whence he ruled over the territories recaptured from the occupiers. In 1559, he allied himself with another Georgian sovereign, [[Levan I of Kakheti]], and married his daughter [[Nestan-Darejan of Kakheti, Queen of Kartli|Nestan-Darejan]]. Beginning in 1560, Simon launched a series of battles to recover Tbilisi, but in April 1561 suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Tsikhedidi]], which cost life to his brother-in-law and ally, [[Prince Giorgi of Kakheti (died 1561)|Prince Giorgi of Kakheti]]. His brother, [[David XI of Kartli|David]], recently submitted to the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Shah]] [[Tahmasp I]], converted to [[Islam]], and returned with a Persian army to claim the crown. Simon blockaded Tbilisi and won the battles at [[Battle of Digomi|Dighomi]] (1567) and Samadlo (1569), but he was finally defeated and taken prisoner at [[Battle of Partskhisi|P'artskhisi]], 1569. David, now known as Daud Khan, was made by Persians a tributary king of Kartli. Simon was sent to Persia where he refused to convert to [[Islam]] and was imprisoned at the fortress of [[Alamut]] for nine years.\n\n==Second reign and struggle against the Ottomans==\n[[File:The men of Erzurum attacked by Simun. An Ottoman illustration of the 16th century..jpg|thumb|170px|left|A battle of Simon with the [[Erzurum]] army.

At the same time, he induced the prince [[Manuchar II Jaqeli]] to revolt against the Ottoman rule in [[Akhaltsikhe]], and attempted to get support from [[Pope]] [[Clement VIII]], Emperor [[Rudolph II]] and [[Philip II of Spain]]. The negotiations, however, failed to yield any serious results.<ref>''Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Mediterranean World After 1492'', p. 85, edited by Alisa M. Ginio, first edition (1992), Routledge, hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7146-3492-1}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1580 Simon I repulsed Ottoman invasion of Kartli, and in 1582 defeated main Ottoman army on the field of Mukhrani, which had a lasting impact as Ottomans were at the height of their power and such a defeat shuttered the myth of their invincibility. Simon I's [[Persian language|Persian]] monolingual [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the same period reads: \"[[Allah]], who has no equal, knows that Semiyun (Simon) is a slave of the [[Shah]] from the bottom of his heart, 933 (1585)\".{{sfn|Beradze|2012|page=466}}\n\nFrom 1588 to 1590, Simon interfered on three occasions into a power struggle in the western Georgian kingdom of [[Imereti]], and though victorious over [[Levan of Imereti]] at the Battle of Gop'anto (1588), he was finally defeated at Op'shkviti and driven out with the help of the Turks. Finally, the Ottomans prevailed and their recently appointed commander, Ferhad Pasha, was able to conquer Kartli by 1588. Simon had to make peace with the [[Sublime Porte]] and agreed to pay an annual tribute. By a [[Treaty of Constantinople (1590)|peace treaty]] signed in [[Constantinople]] on March 21, 1590, the Safavids also recognised all of Georgia as an Ottoman possession. Simon, however, resumed his struggle against the occupants in 1595, and retook Gori after a long-lasting siege in 1599. The [[sultan]] [[Mehmed III]] sent a large punitive force led by Jafar Pasha, [[beylerbey]] of [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. Simon met it at the [[Battle of Nakhiduri]], but he was severely defeated and taken captive while retreating, 1599.\n\nUpon the Simon's arrest the Sultan [[Mehmed III]] made the following order:\n\n{{cquote|From [[Morocco]] to the [[Caspian Sea]], from the [[Caucasus]] to the [[Persian Gulf]], I order to exhibit the carpets in all of my realm and to celebrate for 3 days the arrest of King Simon.}}\n\nSimon was sent to Constantinople where the Georgian noblewoman [[Gulchara]] was brought to care for the aged king. He died in 1611 as a prisoner at the [[Yedikule Fortress|Fortress of the Seven Towers (Yedikule)]] without converting to [[Sunni Islam]],{{sfn|Riota|2017|page=53}} shortly before the [[Treaty of Nasuh Pasha|cessation]] of the Ottoman\u2013Safavid hostilities. His body was then redeemed by the Georgians and buried at the [[Svetitskhoveli]] Cathedral at [[Mtskheta]] next to his father.\n\n==Family and children==\nSimon married in 1559 Nestan-Darejan (died c. 1612), daughter of Levan I of Kakheti.

Which arguably is the best level in the game. In the level, the player controls Joseph Allen, an undercover [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who participates in a [[mass shooting]] at a [[Moscow]] airport to gain the trust of a Russian [[terrorist]] group. The leader of the terrorists, Vladimir Makarov, tells his co-conspirators, \"Remember, no Russian\", implying that speaking Russian would reveal their ethnic origins and affiliation to the Russian ultranationalists. At the end of the level, Makarov kills Allen and reveals that he intended for Russian officials to find Allen's body and believe that the attack was instigated by the United States.\n\nThe level itself is preceded by a warning that the level contains \"disturbing content which may offend some players\". It also instructs that the level is entirely optional.\n\nGame designer [[Mohammad Alavi (game developer)|Mohammad Alavi]] was heavily involved in the level's development. Alavi wanted the level to explain why Russia would invade the United States, and create an emotional connection<!--bond?--> between the player and Makarov. Much of the level's development was spent designing the massacre portion, which Alavi did not want to feel too contrived or traumatic. ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2''{{'s}} developer [[Infinity Ward]] and publisher [[Activision]] were both supportive of the level's inclusion, though several [[game testing|game testers]] expressed disapproval and one refused to play the level at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/from-all-ghillied-up-to-no-russian-the-making-of-call-of-dutys-most-famous-levels/2/|title=From All Ghillied Up to No Russian, the making of Call of Duty's most famous levels|last=Evans-Thirlwell|first=Edwin|date=2016-07-13|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future Plc]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the release of ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'', gameplay footage from \"No Russian\" was leaked on the Internet.

The leader of the terrorists, Vladimir Makarov, tells his co-conspirators, \"Remember, no Russian\", implying that speaking Russian would reveal their ethnic origins and affiliation to the Russian ultranationalists.

The Italian expedition was intended to exploit mobility and speed but was hampered by the Somali terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked until the remaining fortified hilltops were made vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and then retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was also abandoned. The Italian advance was slowed by roads being swamped by the rains and the airstrip near Berbera being found to be garrisoned, making a ''coup de main'' impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of [[''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider. The direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, to cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary. De Simone, with the central column would establish a base at Hargeisa and Adalek then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The western column (Lieutenant-General [[Sisto Bertoldi]]) was to advance towards [[Zeila]] to seal the border with French Somaliland and then move eastwards along the coast road towards Berbera.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===3\u201310 August===\n\n[[File:GeneraleGuglielmo Nasi.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|left|{{centre|General Guglielmo Nasi}}]]\nOn 3 August 1940, British air reconnaissance discovered that about 400 Italians had crossed the frontier at Biyad; early on 4 August the Italian central column was seen advancing on Hargeisa and the SCC skirmished with the Italians, slowly retiring, keeping watch and harassing the advance when possible.The Italians advanced in three widely spaced columns, Nasi communicating with de Simone by wireless and liaison aircraft, the central column heading for Tug Argan as the flanking columns attempted to deceive the defenders and exploit opportunities as they presented themselves.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=75\u201377}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} Aerial operations began on the opening day, with aircraft 15 RAF squadrons participating.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=42\u201354}}{{efn|[[No. 39 Squadron RAF|39]] ([[Bristol Blenheim]]), [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112]] ([[Gloster Gladiator]]), [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94]] (Gladiator), [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|223]] ([[Vickers Wellesley]]), [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47]] (Wellesley, [[Vickers Vildebeest|Vickers Vincent]], [[Gloster Gauntlet]]), [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|14]] (Wellesley), [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203]], [[No. 84 Squadron RAF|84]], [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45]], [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|11]] and [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|8 Squadrons]] (Blenheim).

The defenders reported the presence of Italian medium tanks and the captain of {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} donated the ship's [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss]] saluting gun, a three-man crew and thirty rounds of ammunition.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=173\u2013175}}{{efn|PO H. Jones, AB [[Hugh Sweeney]] and AB W. J. Hurren took the 3-pounder, which had been mounted on an improvised carriage, to reinforce the defenders at Tug Argan.

''Hobart'' was attacked by three Italian fighters and sent its [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] to attack an Italian headquarters at Zeila. The Walrus crew [[Strafing|strafed]] Italian vehicles and dropped two {{convert|112|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=79}}}}\n\nJust before Wavell left [[Cairo]] to visit London for talks, reports of the size of the invasion force led him to order most of a field artillery regiment and two anti-tank guns of the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] to be sent from Egypt to Somaliland by special convoy. The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan defences===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7\u20138 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery little advantage could be gained from it. The gap was too wide for the number of defenders, the hills being far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing very little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=22}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, the two 3-inch anti-aircraft guns being reserved for the defence of the port. The landing grounds had been quickly made untenable by ''Regia Aeronautica'' bombing, two [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94 Squadron]] [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters being destroyed on the ground. Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the ''Regia Aeronautica'' to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410a ''Squadriglia'', one crewman surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials and on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped. SCC members who were embarked, became an armoured car unit under the same title.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=87, 263}} There was little Italian interference with the evacuation, perhaps because on 15 August, the Duke of Aosta had ordered Nasi to allow the British to evacuate without too much fighting, in the hope of a peace agreement being mediated through the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=138}} Italian troops entered Berbera during the evening of 19 August and Mussolini annexed the colony to the AOI, as part of the [[Italian Empire]].{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Impero italiano.svg|thumb|{{centre|''Impero italiano'' (red); the maximum extent of the Italian Empire shown in pink}}]]\nThe Italians had shown the ability to co-ordinate columns separated by many miles of desert; the British forces had kept their discipline during the retreat and preserved most of their forces. British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan and [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya. News of the evacuation came as a shock to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwin-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=179}} The British had to immobilise and abandon 350 vehicles and most of their stores because of the need to ferry everything to the ships offshore.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=87}}\n\nWinston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been vigorously defended and proposed a [[court of enquiry]]. Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to the defeated generals. Adolf Hitler called the evacuation of the colony a \"hard blow\" but\n\n{{quote|...all the British had lost was the privilege of maintaining an expensive garrison in their least valuable colony.|Cowie ''War for Britain'' (1941){{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=93}}}}\n\nThe capture of the colony was the greatest success of the Italians in the East African campaign but they had not been able to exploit the opportunities that they had created and delays caused by the terrain, weather and the cancellation of a ''coup de main'' by 300 infantry on the port, enabled the British to get away despite the improvised nature of the embarkation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\nIn 1954, [[I. S. O. Playfair|Ian Playfair]], the British official historian, wrote that the British suffered 260 casualties and estimated Italian losses of 2,052 men. Seven British aircraft were shot down and ten were badly damaged in the fourteen days' fighting.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=178\u2013179}} In 1988, Alberto Rovighi, the Italian official historian, wrote that the Italians suffered 465 men killed, 1,530 wounded and 34 missing, a total of 2,029 men, of which 161 were metropolitan Italians and 1,868 were local Eritrean and Somali Ascari. The British-supporting Somalis suffered about 2,000 casualties during the invasion and occupation; about 1,000 Somalis became casualties fighting on the Italian side.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=453}}{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=188}} In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that 38 of the British casualties had been killed and 222 wounded.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}} In a 1996 publication, Christopher Shores wrote that the RAF had seven aircraft losses and ten aircraft damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} In 2007, Andrea Molinari recorded 1,995 Italian casualties and four aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Molinari|2007|p=117}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Operation Appearance}}\n\nOn 16 March 1941, the British executed Operation Appearance from [[Aden]]; the two [[Sikh]] battalions of the [[Indian Army]], that had been part of the defence force in August 1940 and a Somali commando detachment, were landed on either side of Berbera from transports escorted by HMS ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=417}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=54}} The invasion by the Sikhs was the first successful [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landing on an occupied beach of the war; few men of the Italian 70th Colonial Brigade offered resistance.

The Italian expedition was intended to exploit mobility and speed but was hampered by the Somali terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked until the remaining fortified hilltops were made vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and then retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was also abandoned. The Italian advance was slowed by roads being swamped by the rains and the airstrip near Berbera being found to be garrisoned, making a ''coup de main'' impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of [[''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider. The direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, to cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary. De Simone, with the central column would establish a base at Hargeisa and Adalek then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The western column (Lieutenant-General [[Sisto Bertoldi]]) was to advance towards [[Zeila]] to seal the border with French Somaliland and then move eastwards along the coast road towards Berbera.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===3\u201310 August===\n\n[[File:GeneraleGuglielmo Nasi.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|left|{{centre|General Guglielmo Nasi}}]]\nOn 3 August 1940, British air reconnaissance discovered that about 400 Italians had crossed the frontier at Biyad; early on 4 August the Italian central column was seen advancing on Hargeisa and the SCC skirmished with the Italians, slowly retiring, keeping watch and harassing the advance when possible.The Italians advanced in three widely spaced columns, Nasi communicating with de Simone by wireless and liaison aircraft, the central column heading for Tug Argan as the flanking columns attempted to deceive the defenders and exploit opportunities as they presented themselves.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=75\u201377}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} Aerial operations began on the opening day, with aircraft 15 RAF squadrons participating.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=42\u201354}}{{efn|[[No. 39 Squadron RAF|39]] ([[Bristol Blenheim]]), [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112]] ([[Gloster Gladiator]]), [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94]] (Gladiator), [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|223]] ([[Vickers Wellesley]]), [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47]] (Wellesley, [[Vickers Vildebeest|Vickers Vincent]], [[Gloster Gauntlet]]), [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|14]] (Wellesley), [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203]], [[No. 84 Squadron RAF|84]], [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45]], [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|11]] and [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|8 Squadrons]] (Blenheim).

''Hobart'' was attacked by three Italian fighters and sent its [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] to attack an Italian headquarters at Zeila. The Walrus crew [[Strafing|strafed]] Italian vehicles and dropped two {{convert|112|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=79}}}}\n\nJust before Wavell left [[Cairo]] to visit London for talks, reports of the size of the invasion force led him to order most of a field artillery regiment and two anti-tank guns of the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] to be sent from Egypt to Somaliland by special convoy. The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan defences===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7\u20138 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery little advantage could be gained from it. The gap was too wide for the number of defenders, the hills being far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing very little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=22}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, the two 3-inch anti-aircraft guns being reserved for the defence of the port. The landing grounds had been quickly made untenable by ''Regia Aeronautica'' bombing, two [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94 Squadron]] [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters being destroyed on the ground. Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the ''Regia Aeronautica'' to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410a ''Squadriglia'', one crewman surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials and on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped. SCC members who were embarked, became an armoured car unit under the same title.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=87, 263}} There was little Italian interference with the evacuation, perhaps because on 15 August, the Duke of Aosta had ordered Nasi to allow the British to evacuate without too much fighting, in the hope of a peace agreement being mediated through the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=138}} Italian troops entered Berbera during the evening of 19 August and Mussolini annexed the colony to the AOI, as part of the [[Italian Empire]].{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Impero italiano.svg|thumb|{{centre|''Impero italiano'' (red); the maximum extent of the Italian Empire shown in pink}}]]\nThe Italians had shown the ability to co-ordinate columns separated by many miles of desert; the British forces had kept their discipline during the retreat and preserved most of their forces. British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan and [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya. News of the evacuation came as a shock to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwin-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=179}} The British had to immobilise and abandon 350 vehicles and most of their stores because of the need to ferry everything to the ships offshore.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=87}}\n\nWinston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been vigorously defended and proposed a [[court of enquiry]]. Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to the defeated generals. Adolf Hitler called the evacuation of the colony a \"hard blow\" but\n\n{{quote|...all the British had lost was the privilege of maintaining an expensive garrison in their least valuable colony.|Cowie ''War for Britain'' (1941){{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=93}}}}\n\nThe capture of the colony was the greatest success of the Italians in the East African campaign but they had not been able to exploit the opportunities that they had created and delays caused by the terrain, weather and the cancellation of a ''coup de main'' by 300 infantry on the port, enabled the British to get away despite the improvised nature of the embarkation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\nIn 1954, [[I. S. O. Playfair|Ian Playfair]], the British official historian, wrote that the British suffered 260 casualties and estimated Italian losses of 2,052 men. Seven British aircraft were shot down and ten were badly damaged in the fourteen days' fighting.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=178\u2013179}} In 1988, Alberto Rovighi, the Italian official historian, wrote that the Italians suffered 465 men killed, 1,530 wounded and 34 missing, a total of 2,029 men, of which 161 were metropolitan Italians and 1,868 were local Eritrean and Somali Ascari. The British-supporting Somalis suffered about 2,000 casualties during the invasion and occupation; about 1,000 Somalis became casualties fighting on the Italian side.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=453}}{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=188}} In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that 38 of the British casualties had been killed and 222 wounded.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}} In a 1996 publication, Christopher Shores wrote that the RAF had seven aircraft losses and ten aircraft damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} In 2007, Andrea Molinari recorded 1,995 Italian casualties and four aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Molinari|2007|p=117}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Operation Appearance}}\n\nOn 16 March 1941, the British executed Operation Appearance from [[Aden]]; the two [[Sikh]] battalions of the [[Indian Army]], that had been part of the defence force in August 1940 and a Somali commando detachment, were landed on either side of Berbera from transports escorted by HMS ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=417}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=54}} The invasion by the Sikhs was the first successful [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landing on an occupied beach of the war; few men of the Italian 70th Colonial Brigade offered resistance.
