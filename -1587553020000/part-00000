In 1992, they dropped the \"Square\" from \"Square Roots\" because a local folk group had claim to the name.\n\nUnable to break through in their native Philadelphia, the band briefly moved to [[London]], where they would release their 1993 debut, ''[[Organix (The Roots album)|Organix]]''. The album was released and sold independently. In the span of a year, the band developed a cult following in Europe, boosted by touring. The Roots would receive offers from music labels, and the band eventually signed with DGC/Geffen.\n\n===1994\u201397: ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' and ''Illadelph Halflife''===\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, ''[[Do You Want More?!!!??!]]'', was released the following year (1995 in the United States).

The album's opening track features Black Thought introducing the band's sound as \"organic hip hop jazz,\" and indeed; the album is characterized by a combination of contemporary [[East Coast hip hop]] and [[jazz]] influences, with a heavy reliance on Storch's [[Fender Rhodes]] and the occasional saxophone of guest musician Steve Coleman. The album spawned three singles with accompanying videos: \"Proceed,\" \"Distortion to Static,\" and \"Silent Treatment.\" The album was a moderate hit among [[alternative music]] fans, boosted by the group's appearance at [[Lollapalooza]]. In 1995, the band performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. In the years since its release, ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' has come to be considered to be a classic [[jazz rap]] album.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/the-ten-best-jazz-rap-albums-to-own-on-vinyl/|title=The 10 Best Jazz Rap Albums To Own On Vinyl|work=[[Vinyl Me Please]]|date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:The roots-01.jpg|thumb|left|The Roots in 1999]]\nThe 1996 release ''[[Illadelph Halflife]]'' was the group's third album and their first to break the Top 40 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart,<ref name=\"amg\"/> spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\" (a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433815/19970107/roots.jhtml |title=Roots Take A Swing At Video Cliches |date=January 7, 1997 |website=MTV News |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}</ref> and \"Clones\", which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts.

Scott Storch left the band and was replaced by a new keyboardist, Kamal Gray. The band's sound would take a darker turn during this period, heavily influenced by [[the Wu-Tang Clan]] and the [[RZA]]'s grimy and haunting production style, replete with samples from old jazz and [[classical music|classical]] music. The album is also notable for its many guests and collaborators, including [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], and others.

The Beginners Guide to Understanding The Roots, Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 2'', feature a continuous track numbering beginning at negative 29 and counting up to zero. The implication is that this \"Beginners Guide\" would introduce new fans to the Roots and lead them to consuming the Roots' discography beginning at ''Organix''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n* \u221229 thru \u221214: ''Home Grown!

In 1992, they dropped the \"Square\" from \"Square Roots\" because a local folk group had claim to the name.\n\nUnable to break through in their native Philadelphia, the band briefly moved to [[London]], where they would release their 1993 debut, ''[[Organix (The Roots album)|Organix]]''. The album was released and sold independently. In the span of a year, the band developed a cult following in Europe, boosted by touring. The Roots would receive offers from music labels, and the band eventually signed with DGC/Geffen.\n\n===1994\u201397: ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' and ''Illadelph Halflife''===\nThe Roots' first album for DGC, ''[[Do You Want More?!!!??!]]'', was released the following year (1995 in the United States).

The album's opening track features Black Thought introducing the band's sound as \"organic hip hop jazz,\" and indeed; the album is characterized by a combination of contemporary [[East Coast hip hop]] and [[jazz]] influences, with a heavy reliance on Storch's [[Fender Rhodes]] and the occasional saxophone of guest musician Steve Coleman. The album spawned three singles with accompanying videos: \"Proceed,\" \"Distortion to Static,\" and \"Silent Treatment.\" The album was a moderate hit among [[alternative music]] fans, boosted by the group's appearance at [[Lollapalooza]]. In 1995, the band performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. In the years since its release, ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' has come to be considered to be a classic [[jazz rap]] album.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/the-ten-best-jazz-rap-albums-to-own-on-vinyl/|title=The 10 Best Jazz Rap Albums To Own On Vinyl|work=[[Vinyl Me Please]]|date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:The roots-01.jpg|thumb|left|The Roots in 1999]]\nThe 1996 release ''[[Illadelph Halflife]]'' was the group's third album and their first to break the Top 40 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart,<ref name=\"amg\"/> spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\" (a parody of rap video clich\u00e9s)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433815/19970107/roots.jhtml |title=Roots Take A Swing At Video Cliches |date=January 7, 1997 |website=MTV News |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}</ref> and \"Clones\", which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts. The band added \"What They Do\" was also the group's first single to hit the [[Top 40]] of [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's]] charts, reaching a peak of #34. Scott Storch left the band and was replaced by a new keyboardist, Kamal Gray. The band's sound would take a darker turn during this period, heavily influenced by [[the Wu-Tang Clan]] and the [[RZA]]'s grimy and haunting production style, replete with samples from old jazz and [[classical music|classical]] music. The album is also notable for its many guests and collaborators, including [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], and others. These collaborations would provide the foundation for the creation of the [[Soulquarians]] and permanently forged the Roots' association with the [[neo-soul]] subgenre.\n\n===1998\u201300: Breakthrough with ''Things Fall Apart''===\nThe group released [[Things Fall Apart (album)|''Things Fall Apart'']] in 1999 (named after ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', a novel by [[Chinua Achebe]], which in turn was named after a line from \"[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]\" by W.B.

Kenyatta \"Kid Crumbs\" Warren (MC) was in the band for Organix, the Roots' first album release. Another MC, [[Dice Raw]], joined the band in cameo appearances on later albums. The band filled Storch's position with [[Kamal Gray]] (keyboards), who continues in that capacity. Kamal Gray did not play with the Roots on ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' between April or May and early September 2012. His absence was not publicly explained, however on the September 17, 2012 (NBC's 'Late Night' 700th) episode, Gray returned to the group. \n[[Beatboxing|Beatboxer]] [[Rahzel]] was a band member from 1995 to 1999.

It was released on January 25, 2000, by [[Virgin Records]]. \n\nD'Angelo recorded the album during 1998 and 1999 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City, with an extensive line-up of musicians associated with the [[Soulquarians]] musical collective. Produced primarily by the singer, ''Voodoo'' features a loose, [[Groove (music)|groove]]-based [[funk]] sound and serves as a departure from the more conventional song structure of his debut album, ''[[Brown Sugar (D'Angelo album)|Brown Sugar]]'' (1995). Its lyrics explore themes of spirituality, love, sexuality, maturation, and fatherhood.\n\nFollowing heavy promotion and public anticipation, the album was met with commercial and critical success. It debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 320,000 copies in its first week, and spent 33 weeks on the chart. It was promoted with five singles, including the hit single \"[[Untitled (How Does It Feel)]]\", whose music video garnered D'Angelo mainstream attention and controversy. Upon its release, ''Voodoo'' received general acclaim from music critics and earned D'Angelo several accolades. It was named one of the year's best albums by numerous publications.\n\nD'Angelo promoted ''Voodoo'' with an international [[#The Voodoo Tour|supporting tour]] in late 2000. While successful early on, the tour became plagued by concert cancellations and D'Angelo's personal frustrations. ''Voodoo'' has since been regarded by music writers as a creative milestone of the [[neo soul]] genre during its apex.<ref name=\"Dombal\"/><ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Jason|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/07/17/f-maxwell-neo-soul.html|title=Soul on Fire|publisher=[[CBC News]].

It was released on January 25, 2000, by [[Virgin Records]]. \n\nD'Angelo recorded the album during 1998 and 1999 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City, with an extensive line-up of musicians associated with the [[Soulquarians]] musical collective. Produced primarily by the singer, ''Voodoo'' features a loose, [[Groove (music)|groove]]-based [[funk]] sound and serves as a departure from the more conventional song structure of his debut album, ''[[Brown Sugar (D'Angelo album)|Brown Sugar]]'' (1995). Its lyrics explore themes of spirituality, love, sexuality, maturation, and fatherhood.\n\nFollowing heavy promotion and public anticipation, the album was met with commercial and critical success. It debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 320,000 copies in its first week, and spent 33 weeks on the chart. It was promoted with five singles, including the hit single \"[[Untitled (How Does It Feel)]]\", whose music video garnered D'Angelo mainstream attention and controversy. Upon its release, ''Voodoo'' received general acclaim from music critics and earned D'Angelo several accolades. It was named one of the year's best albums by numerous publications.\n\nD'Angelo promoted ''Voodoo'' with an international [[#The Voodoo Tour|supporting tour]] in late 2000. While successful early on, the tour became plagued by concert cancellations and D'Angelo's personal frustrations. ''Voodoo'' has since been regarded by music writers as a creative milestone of the [[neo soul]] genre during its apex.<ref name=\"Dombal\"/><ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Jason|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/07/17/f-maxwell-neo-soul.html|title=Soul on Fire|publisher=[[CBC News]].

However, Brazil went on to win the 2002 World Cup with a record-breaking tally of 7 wins in 7 matches in the final competition, without facing extra time or penalty shoot-outs. The following teams also won all their final competition matches: [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1930 (4 games), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in 1938 (4 games, among which 1 game won after extra time), Brazil in 1970 (6 games) and [[France national football team|France]] in 1998 (7 games, among which one game was won in added extra time by a golden goal and one game was won on penalties). In 1970, Brazil had also won all of their 6 preliminary competition matches. Uruguay did not play any preliminary round for 1930, as there was none, and Italy did not either for 1938 as they were automatically qualified for the World Cup as title holders.\n*[[Germany national football team|Germany]] lost a World Cup qualifying match for the second time only on 1 September 2001, when they were defeated [[2001 Germany v England football match|1\u20135]] by [[England national football team|England]] in Munich. They had played 62 World Cup qualifying matches before (47 wins, 14 draws, 1 loss). Apart from Germany, no team having played more than 20 World Cup qualifying matches have lost less than 3 of them. Oddly, their first loss ever in a World Cup qualifier also took place while playing home, in Stuttgart, against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in 1985.\n*[[Australia national football team|Australia]] netted 31 goals against newcomers [[American Samoa national football team|American Samoa]], setting the record of the highest-scoring match and biggest margin of victory in an international match ever. This was only two days after Australia thrashed [[Tonga national football team|Tonga]] 22\u20130, a then international record. Also, [[Archie Thompson]]'s 13 goals in the match against American Samoa surpassed the previous record of 10.\n*[[Souleymane Mamam]] of [[Togo national football team|Togo]] became the youngest player ever to play in a World Cup qualifying match at the age of 13 years and 310 days in the match against [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]], in [[Lom\u00e9]], in May 2001. He subbed in for [[Komlan Assignon]], three minutes from full-time.\n*The fastest-ever [[hat-trick]] in an \"A\" international was set when [[Abdul Hamid Bassiouny]] of [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] needed only 177 seconds to bag his three goals in a game against [[Namibia national football team|Namibia]].\n*[[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'s [[Kubilay T\u00fcrkyilmaz]] scored a [[hat trick]] exclusively from [[penalty kick (football)|penalties]] against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. Brazil's [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] equaled this against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in his team's 3\u20131 win in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] qualifying round.\n*This was the first and, to date, only time that Germany qualified for a FIFA World Cup after playing qualifying play-offs.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/2002q.html RSSSF \u2013 2002 World Cup Qualification]\n\n{{2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers}}\n{{FIFA World Cup}}\n\n[[Category:2002 FIFA World Cup qualification| ]]\n[[Category:2002 FIFA World Cup|Qualification]]\n[[Category:FIFA World Cup qualification]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2002 football competition}}\n{{Infobox international football competition\n| tourney_name   = 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification\n| year           = \n| alt            =\n| caption        =\n| dates          = 4 March 2000 \u2013 25 November 2001\n| num_teams      = 199\n| confederations = 6\n| matches        = 777\n| goals          = 2452\n| attendance     = \n| top_scorer     = {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Archie Thompson]] <br />(16 goals)\n| prevseason     = [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification|1998]]\n| nextseason     = [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|2006]]\n}}\nThe '''2002 FIFA World Cup qualification competition''' was a series of tournaments organised by the six [[FIFA]] [[FIFA#Structure|confederations]].

The following teams also won all their final competition matches: [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1930 (4 games), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in 1938 (4 games, among which 1 game won after extra time), Brazil in 1970 (6 games) and [[France national football team|France]] in 1998 (7 games, among which one game was won in added extra time by a golden goal and one game was won on penalties). In 1970, Brazil had also won all of their 6 preliminary competition matches.

They had played 62 World Cup qualifying matches before (47 wins, 14 draws, 1 loss). Apart from Germany, no team having played more than 20 World Cup qualifying matches have lost less than 3 of them.

Also, [[Archie Thompson]]'s 13 goals in the match against American Samoa surpassed the previous record of 10.\n*[[Souleymane Mamam]] of [[Togo national football team|Togo]] became the youngest player ever to play in a World Cup qualifying match at the age of 13 years and 310 days in the match against [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]], in [[Lom\u00e9]], in May 2001.

Gunning's rich stylised form of whistle playing and tradition stems from her homeland of [[Geevagh]] in [[County Sligo|South County Sligo]]. This background and tradition aided Gunning's introduction to traditional Irish music which took place at an early age.\n\n==Musical beginnings==\nGunning was introduced to traditional Irish music as a child when her father, Tom Nangle, would teach her old tunes by [[lilting]] or whistling them to her.<ref name=\"Boston Irish Reporter\">{{cite web | author=Susan Gedtus Lindsay | title=World-Class Irish Whistler tours Boston | work=Boston Irish Reporter | url=http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=1 May 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929023421/http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | archive-date=29 September 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 she sang in her first band, ''\"Carmel and the Chrystals\"'', and played at local dances in [[Keadue]], [[Geevagh]], [[Boyle, County Roscommon|Boyle]] and surrounding areas.

J. Hernon, Mick Shannon, Joe O'Dowd and others at the famous sessions which took place at the Trades Club in [[Sligo Town]].\n\n==Musical style==\nGunning is noted for her fast-paced [[tin whistle]] style common of fiddle, flute and tin whistle of the ''\"South Sligo\"'' tradition or style. Gunning's reputation in the wider world was expanded by the release of her first solo recording, ''The Lakes of Sligo'', which features four unaccompanied songs as well as 14 tracks of virtuosic tin whistle playing.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nA reviewer of her music noted that \"no modern tin whistler can escape comparison to [[Mary Bergin]], and Carmel's playing does indeed remind some of the Dublin-born star.  If anything, however, Gunning plays reels with a more insistent headlong drive. Her ornamentation is also more diverse, featuring many tongued triplets in imitation of the bowed embellishments popular among Sligo fiddlers\".<ref>{{cite web | author=Susan Lindsay | title=World Class Irish Whistler Tours Boston | work=Boston Irish Reporter | url=http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=24 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929023421/http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | archive-date=29 September 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Teaching and instructing==\nGunning has tutored MA and BA music students at the [[University of Limerick]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Yeats Festival, Sligo |work=Yeats Society Sligo |url=http://www.yeats-sligo.com/html/sligofestival.html |accessdate=30 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210141849/http://www.yeats-sligo.com/html/sligofestival.html |archivedate=10 February 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Irish music| title=Carmel Gunning : The Sligo Maid| work=Irish abroad| url=http://www.irishabroad.com/news/irishpost/ents/irishmusic050601.asp| accessdate=30 May 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002106/http://www.irishabroad.com/news/irishpost/ents/irishmusic050601.asp| archive-date=27 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref> She recently celebrated her 45th anniversary as a music teacher in 2014 and has endeavoured to pass on the Sligo musical tradition to younger players.

Gunning is one of Ireland's most accomplished [[tin whistle]] players who is also known for her singing and [[Irish flute|flute]] playing and also plays guitar and button accordion. Gunning's rich stylised form of whistle playing and tradition stems from her homeland of [[Geevagh]] in [[County Sligo|South County Sligo]]. This background and tradition aided Gunning's introduction to traditional Irish music which took place at an early age.\n\n==Musical beginnings==\nGunning was introduced to traditional Irish music as a child when her father, Tom Nangle, would teach her old tunes by [[lilting]] or whistling them to her.<ref name=\"Boston Irish Reporter\">{{cite web | author=Susan Gedtus Lindsay | title=World-Class Irish Whistler tours Boston | work=Boston Irish Reporter | url=http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=1 May 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929023421/http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | archive-date=29 September 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 she sang in her first band, ''\"Carmel and the Chrystals\"'', and played at local dances in [[Keadue]], [[Geevagh]], [[Boyle, County Roscommon|Boyle]] and surrounding areas.

J. Hernon, Mick Shannon, Joe O'Dowd and others at the famous sessions which took place at the Trades Club in [[Sligo Town]].\n\n==Musical style==\nGunning is noted for her fast-paced [[tin whistle]] style common of fiddle, flute and tin whistle of the ''\"South Sligo\"'' tradition or style. Gunning's reputation in the wider world was expanded by the release of her first solo recording, ''The Lakes of Sligo'', which features four unaccompanied songs as well as 14 tracks of virtuosic tin whistle playing.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nA reviewer of her music noted that \"no modern tin whistler can escape comparison to [[Mary Bergin]], and Carmel's playing does indeed remind some of the Dublin-born star.  If anything, however, Gunning plays reels with a more insistent headlong drive. Her ornamentation is also more diverse, featuring many tongued triplets in imitation of the bowed embellishments popular among Sligo fiddlers\".<ref>{{cite web | author=Susan Lindsay | title=World Class Irish Whistler Tours Boston | work=Boston Irish Reporter | url=http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=24 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929023421/http://www.bostonirish.com/BIR407web.pdf | archive-date=29 September 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Teaching and instructing==\nGunning has tutored MA and BA music students at the [[University of Limerick]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Yeats Festival, Sligo |work=Yeats Society Sligo |url=http://www.yeats-sligo.com/html/sligofestival.html |accessdate=30 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210141849/http://www.yeats-sligo.com/html/sligofestival.html |archivedate=10 February 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Irish music| title=Carmel Gunning : The Sligo Maid| work=Irish abroad| url=http://www.irishabroad.com/news/irishpost/ents/irishmusic050601.asp| accessdate=30 May 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002106/http://www.irishabroad.com/news/irishpost/ents/irishmusic050601.asp| archive-date=27 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref> She recently celebrated her 45th anniversary as a music teacher in 2014 and has endeavoured to pass on the Sligo musical tradition to younger players.

[[Nigeria]] has made major improvements in [[human rights]] under this constitution though the [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|American Human Rights Report]] of 2012 notes areas where significant improvement is needed, which include:<ref>Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Human Rights Practices for 2012. 2012.</ref> abuses by [[Boko Haram]], killings by governmental forces, lack of [[social equality]], and issues with [[freedom of speech]]. The [[Human Rights Watch]]'s 2015 World Report states that intensified violence by Boko Haram, restrictions of [[LGBT|LGBTIQQ]] rights, and government corruption continue to undermine the status of human rights in Nigeria.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History since independence==\nIn the period between its independence in 1960 to 1998, Nigeria had, in terms of heads of State, two elected, one appointed, one military successor and 7 [coups d'\u00e9tat] powers. In 1979, they moved to a presidential system in order to properly instate the right of choosing who rules them with a new [https://forible.xyz constitution]. This constitution guarantees fundamental human rights that are constantly in violation.\n\nThere was a crusade for human rights in 1985 when General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] took power.<ref>McCarthy-Arnolds,Eileen. \"Africa, Human Rights, and the Global System: The Political Economy of Human Rights in a Changing World\". 30 December 1993</ref> There were changes under the Babangida administration both for the positive as well as for the negative.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has been active in signing and ratifying international human rights treaties, it has seen challenges when trying to implement these treaties domestically.  Nigeria operates under a [[Monism and dualism in international law#Dualism|dualist system]] and cannot apply international treaties unless they are ratified by the legislative houses of Nigeria.  Furthermore, the Nigerian constitution protects civil and political rights, but international treaties like the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Charter]] also expand protection to cultural, socioeconomic, and group rights.  Because the Nigerian constitution is supreme law, the [[Supreme Court of Nigeria]] often resolves conflicts in favor of the Constitution, therefore restricting the expansion of potential human rights.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Egede|first1=Edwin|title=Bringing Human Rights Home: An Examination of the Domestication of Human Rights Treaties in Nigeria|journal=Journal of African Law|date=2007|volume=51|issue=2|pages=249\u2013284|doi=10.1017/S0021855307000290|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/14418/1/Egede%202007.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Freedom of expression==\n\nThis is stupid and not true. I\u2019m gonna sue wikipedia. When General Babangida took power in 1985 and repealed Decree N0. 4 of 1984, a law that made it criminal behavior to publish any material that was considered embarrassing or against the interests of the government,<ref name=speech>MCathy-Arnolds, Penna, and Sobrepena (1994). \"Africa, Human Rights, and the Global System\".</ref> there was renewed hope for [[freedom of expression]] both by the people and the media. Within the Babangida regime, political tolerance occurred for some time. However, this brief foray into human rights broke down when the regime began jailing its critics and firing employees who did not promote their views and ideals. This regime closed down more newspapers and banned more popular organizations than any other in Nigeria's post-colonial history.<ref name=speech/>\n\nThe poparazi in Nigeria was often subject to scare tactics and intimidation. Journalists were subjected to \"chats\" with the State Security Service that involved threatening and possible imprisonment.<ref name=speech/> There were continually newspaper shutdowns. In 1990, ''The Republic'', ''Newbreed'', ''Lagos Daily News'', ''The Punch'', and various other newspapers were shut down at some point by the federal government.<ref>Africa Watch. \"Academic Freedom\".</ref>\n\nCritics maintain that though measures of freedom of the press have improved, there is still room for improvement. Nigeria was described as \"partly free\" in the Freedom of the Press 2011 report published by the [[Freedom House]] (see yearly rankings in Freedom House ratings in Nigeria section).<ref>\"2011 Human Rights Reports: Nigeria\". Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State. 24 May 2012.</ref>\n\n==Government violations==\nNigerian security forces are frequently alleged to carry out arbitrary arrests, torture<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-51419440/africa-eye-torture-rampant-among-nigeria-s-security-forces ''Africa Eye: Torture \u2018rampant\u2019 among Nigeria\u2019s security forces''], BBC news, 10 February 2020.</ref>, forced disappearances, assassinations and extrajudicial [[summary execution]]s. These abuses typically occur within the context of the Nigerian government's security operations or are directed against political and religious organizations and individuals. Several instances of mass killings of political opponents and agitators by security forces have been reported. On 12\u201314 December 2015, the Nigerian Army carried out a [[2015 Zaria massacre|massacre]] of 347 members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) in [[Zaria]], [[Kaduna State]] and buried the bodies in mass graves.\n\n===Police force===\nIn Nigeria, the [[Nigeria Police Force]] has been typically viewed as inefficient and corrupt. The Joint Task Force (JTF) has provided inadequate and violent response to the Boko Haram attacks. The JTF has been involved in killing suspects without fair trial as well as killing random members of communities suspected of supporting the Boko Haram.<ref name=\"Human Rights Watch 2012\"/> This \"heavy-handed\" approach violates human rights with its lack of access to a fair trial and use of discriminatory techniques to determine perpetrators of violence.<ref name=\"Human Rights Watch 2012\"/>\n\nWithin the regular Nigerian Police Force, there are high amounts of corruption and violations that include extortion and embezzlement. The police force takes advantage of the people by putting up roadblocks that require a fee to pass and taking money for no legal reason. Within the police force, there is no equal protection under the law.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Human Rights Watch. \"Everyone's in on the Game- Corruption and Human Rights Abuses by the Nigerian Police Force\". August 2010</ref> The wealthy are able to buy the police for security as well as expecting the police to turn a blind eye to illegal activities they participate in.\n\nOn 21 August 2020, four SARS operatives were arrested and charged with murder after being caught on film manhandling and then shooting to death two suspected phone thieves in broad daylight.<ref name=sarsmurder>https://punchng.com/breaking-police-arrest-officers-who-killed-suspected-igando-phone-thieves/</ref> The two suspected phone thieves were shot dead after they had been arrested.<ref name=sarsmurder /> On April 18, 2020, the Nigerian Police Force stated that two of its officers were arrested after being caught on film beating a woman at the [[Odo Ori Market]] in [[Iwo, Osun]].<ref>https://www.legit.ng/1322289-lockdown-police-arrest-officers-caught-beating-woman-osun-state.html</ref>\n\n===Corruption===\n{{See|Corruption in Nigeria}}\n\nNigeria has the label of having [[Corruption in Nigeria|one of the world's highest levels of corruption]]. This is especially seen within the public sector including stealing public funds and accepting bribes<ref>\"Everyone's in on the Game- Corruption and Human Rights Abuses by the Nigerian Police Force\".</ref> It is estimated that between 1999 and 2007, Nigeria has lost around $4\u20138 billion yearly due to corruption.<ref name=corrupt>Human Rights Watch. \"Criminal Politics\". October 2007</ref>\n \nPoliticians often siphon public funds to further their political careers and also pay gangs to aid them in rigging elections. The elections since the end of military rule occurring in 1999, 2003, and 2007 were bloody affairs and were openly rigged.<ref name=corrupt /> In 2007, ballot boxes were visibly stuffed by paid gangs and in some cases, electoral results were simply made up.<ref>Human Rights Watch.  \"Nigeria: Polls Marred by Violence, Fraud\". 17 April 2007.</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]] estimates that at least 300 were killed due to the 2007 elections and that is considered to be a conservative estimate as cited from a Human Rights Watch telephone interview with Derrick Marco, Nigeria country director in March 2007. These measures of violence and intimidation discouraged the general public from voting. Those who did come out were subject to attacks by gangs.<ref name=corrupt />\n\nThe current Fourth Republic of Nigeria has strengthened its laws against corruption and established the [[Independent Corrupt Practices Commission]] (ICPC) and [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) in the early 2000s.  However, due to the previous institutionalization of corruption, the battle against corruption is ongoing.  These anti-corruption institutions have been attempting to combat the issue but, as of 2010, they have not been very heavy handed in terms of punishment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Former Edo State governor Lucky Igbinedion pleaded guilty to embezzling 2.9 billion Naira (about $24.2 million). However, he had a plea bargain with the EFCC and was fined 3.5 million Naira ($29,167) and did not serve any jail time.<ref>Ahemba, Tume. \"Convicted Nigerian ex-governor to pay $25,750 fine\". Reuters. 19 December 2008.</ref>  As of January 2015, many high-level politicians remain un-investigated and only lower-level officials are arrested.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=World Report 2015: Nigeria|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/nigeria|website=Human Rights Watch|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Boko Haram==\n{{Main|Boko Haram}}\n\n[[Boko Haram]] is an Islamist terrorist group that focuses its attacks on government officials, Christians, and fellow Muslims who speak out against their actions or are thought to aid the government, known as \"traitor Muslims\". Attacks are primarily focused in northeast Nigeria.<ref name=\"Human Rights Watch 2012\">Human Rights Watch. \"Spiraling Violence: Boko Haram Attacks and Security Force Abuses in Nigeria\". 2012.\"</ref> They cite corruption committed by the national government as well as increased Western influence as the primary reason for their often violent actions. This group engaging in [[jihad]] was banded in 2000 by the spiritual leader [[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]].\n\nIn July 2009, there were five days of extreme violence from Boko Haram as well as with the  governmental response. From 26 to 31 July, the group killed 37 Christian men and burned 29 churches. After a brief hiatus in claimed incidents, the group resurfaced in the summer of 2011 with church attacks.\n\nIn October 2013, Amnesty International recommended that the Nigerian government investigate the deaths of more than 950 suspected Boko Haram members that died under military custody in the first six months of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/nigeria-deaths-hundreds-boko-haram-suspects-custody-requires-investigation-2013-10-15 |title=Nigeria: Deaths of hundreds of Boko Haram suspects in custody requires investigation |publisher = Amnesty International |date= 15 October 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Boko Haram drew international attention from its 14 April kidnapping of approximately 230 female students from a secondary school in the northern town of Chibok, Nigeria. Boko Haram leader [[Abubakar Shekau]] claims the girls have converted to Islam and has threatened to sell them as wives or slaves to Boko Haram members at a price of $12.50 each.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://therainbow.com.ng/tabloid/boko-haram-kidnapped-the-230-school-girls-as-wives-for-its-insurgents/ |title=Boko Haram kidnapped the 230 school girls as wives for its insurgents |work=The Rainbow |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140429125207/http://therainbow.com.ng/tabloid/boko-haram-kidnapped-the-230-school-girls-as-wives-for-its-insurgents/ |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Boko Haram has also attacked schools in [[Yobe State]] and forced hundreds of young men to join their forces, killing those who refused.

This bill also allows punishment for those knowingly associating with those identifying as members of the LGBT community or aiding these individuals in becoming married or pursuing that lifestyle. The punishment for abetting gay marriage is 5 years imprisonment. Furthermore, the bill criminalizes any association with gay identity and the promotion of lesbian and gay rights, such as gathering privately with gay people.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.petertatchell.net/a2/print_versions/251.htm|title = Nigeria - Vicious New Anti-Gay Law: World's Most Sweeping, Draconian Homophobic Legislation|date = 19 January 2006|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Tatchell|first = Peter}}</ref>  The Same-Sex Marriage Bill was ratified by President Goodluck Jonathan in January 2014 and has received much condemnation from the West for its restriction of the freedoms of expression and assembly for the LGBT community in Nigeria.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Peter Tatchell]] has stated that the Same-Sex Marriage Bill is \"the most comprehensively homophobic legislation ever proposed in any country in the world.\"<ref name=\":2\" />  Shawn Gaylord, Advocacy Counsel of [[Human Rights First]], has said that the Same-Sex Marriage Bill \"sets a dangerous precedence for persecution and violence against minorities\" not only in Nigeria, but throughout Africa as a whole.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/10570304/Nigeria-passes-law-banning-homosexuality.html|title = Nigeria passes law banning homosexuality|last = |first = |date = 14 January 2014|work = |access-date = 15 November 2015|via = |publisher = The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n===Women===\n{{Main|Women in Nigeria}}\n[[Women in Nigeria]] face various versions of human rights violations despite the provisions granted unto them in the 1999 Constitution.<ref>Kuteyi, O.S. \"The Rights of Nigerian Under the Laws: Real or Myth\". Gender Issues and National Development.</ref> Regardless of the opportunity provided to take up unconstitutionality to higher courts in Nigeria, women do not often utilize this option and as such, there continues to be many violations occurring.\n\nWomen who are involved in the [[informal economy]] can often enjoy some degree of autonomy, but men are often in control of land and credit, from a societal perspective. Depending on their connections with important men, educated women may enjoy a higher social status.  Education has provided many women with access to wage labor, which is usually outside of the direct control of men, but women are often still restrained by social expectations and boundaries.  Even when they have employment opportunities, tradition in Nigerian society dictates that a career be secondary to a woman's primary role in the family as a mother or housewife.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reconfiguring Tradition: Women's Rights and Social Status in Contemporary Nigeria|last = Okeke|first = Phil|date = 2000|journal = Africa Today|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nNigerian women face particular problems and injustices once they become widows. The women are subject to cultural pressures that are inconsistent with human rights. In the widowhood practice, culture demands that when a man of significance within the community dies, his widow must act in a certain way as documented by Akpo Offiong Bassey in her studies of the [[Cross River State]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ako-Nai, Ronke. \"Gender and Power Relations in Nigeria\". Lexington Books. 2012</ref> In some Nigerian tribal cultures, the woman must initially go into seclusion. They are also forced to neglect their bodies; they are not allowed to shave, shower, or change their clothing. They have to rub cow dung and palm oil on their bodies and must also sleep on the floor. Widows are also expected to wear black, the color of mourning, for two years to properly show their loss and respect for their late husband.<ref name=gender>\"Gender and Power Relations in Nigeria\"</ref> These practices widely vary in severity and methods, based on the individual cultural backdrop. However, there has been a major decline of such practices in recent years.\n\nApart from mourning, the widow has immediate concerns involving living situations and property to deal with. In most cases, the eldest son and not the widow inherits the entire property.<ref name=gender /> Women are culturally viewed as property and can be inherited like the rest of a husband's estate. Whether or not the widow can continue to reside on the property is dependent on her relationship with her eldest son or, if there are no sons, the eldest male relative of her husband. There have also been instances where the woman must return to her premarital home after refunding the bride price.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The lack of sufficient property right makes these women dependent on men while single, married, or widowed.\n\nThough the [[Nigerian Supreme Court]] has yet to formally deal with this issue, in the 2007 Nnanyelugo v. Nnanyelugo case, two brothers attempted to get the land of their deceased brother under the case that a widow has no business with the property. The ruling stated that they would no longer allow the males to take advantage of the vulnerable position of the widows and young children.<ref name=gender /> There are other cases in which courts have ruled to implement the equality guaranteed underneath the constitution.\n\nBecause of the patrilineal nature of Nigerian cultures, it is often seen as justifiable to have another wife to ensure that there will be a male heir to carry the lineage of the family.  In custody decisions, women's opinions are often ignored, and decisions are usually made in men's favor.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Child labor and child marriage===\n{{Main|Child marriage in Nigeria|Girl child labour in Nigeria}}\nAccording to the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], 31% of Nigerian children (around 14,000,000 children) aged 5 to 14 years old are working children who engage in [[forced labor]] in various sectors.<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/nigeria.htm Nigeria, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]</ref> According to the Department's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'', instances of [[child labor]] have been observed in the agricultural sector where children participate in the production of cocoa, [[Cassava production in Nigeria|cassava]], and sand, and in the mining industry where they mine, quarry, and crush gravel and granite.\n\nNigeria is characterized by many small farms that largely depend on family labor in the operations of the farm.  In Nigeria, most child labor is found in the informal agricultural sector.  Instead of attending school, more than 50% of children living in the rural areas of Nigeria spend more than 20 hours a week working, which is considered the point at which a child's education becomes significantly affected.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Child Farm Labor in Rural Households of Southwest Nigeria|last = Adeoti|first = Adetola|date = 2013|journal = Global Journal of Human Social Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Coster|first2 = A.S.|last3 = Gbolagun|first3 = A.O.}}</ref>\n\nEarly marriage is prevalent in Nigeria, especially amongst [[Muslim]]s in the north, due to the belief that early marriage prevents promiscuity. However, the major cause of  early marriage has been attributed to poverty by Tim Braimah.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Braimah|first=Tim|date=2014|title=Child marriage in Northern Nigeria: Section 61 of Part I of the 1999 Constitution and the protection of children against child marriage|url=http://www.ahrlj.up.ac.za/braimah-t-s|journal=African Human Rights Law|volume=14|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 September 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nMany girls are married off by the time they are 15, and some girls are married as early as age 9.

Among other factors to protect children from abuses and discrimination, Section 21 and 23 of the act made it illegal to marry off a child below the age of 18. If a husband consummates a marriage with a child, it is considered rape.<ref>Toyo, Nyoko. \"Revisiting Equality as a Right: The Minimum Age of Marriage Clause in the Nigerian Child Rights Act, 2003\".

Nigeria has a population roughly split in half, between Christians predominantly in the South and Muslims in the North, and with a minority population of traditional religion worshippers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ilesanmi|first1=Simeon|title=Constitutional Treatment of Religion and the Politics of Human Rights in Nigeria|journal=African Affairs|date=2001|volume=100|issue=401|pages=529\u201354|doi=10.1093/afraf/100.401.529}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>  Despite the clear provisions in the Constitution,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.yusufali.net/articles/religious_and_other_minorities_right_nigeria_as_case_study.pdf|title = Religious and Other Minorities' Rights: Nigeria as a Case Study|accessdate = 30 October 2015|last = Ali|first = Yusuf|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151121170259/http://www.yusufali.net/articles/religious_and_other_minorities_right_nigeria_as_case_study.pdf|archivedate = 21 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Nigerian public holidays honor Christian and Muslim feast days, but not holidays of any other religion. The government subsidizes only Christian and Muslim pilgrimages and allows Christian and Muslim religious education in schools.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince January 2000, several Northern states have institutionalized a version of [[Sharia in Nigeria|Sharia law]]. This enactment of Sharia law has caused controversy over its violation of fundamental rights, such as the right for minorities in those states to practice their religion, the right to life, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" />\n\nHistorically, the Nigerian Constitution has allowed Sharia courts jurisdiction over certain cases, but their jurisdiction is limited to matters of Islamic personal or family law.  Several state governments in the North have extended Sharia law to criminal offenses, thereby violating the Constitution's prohibition of an official religion. These states have relied on a constitutional provision that allows the Sharia Court to exercise other jurisdiction given to it by the state in introducing Sharia penal codes. The imposition of Sharia law in certain states in Nigeria infringes on the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims alike.  Muslims who would prefer to be judged under the Constitution are not able to do so, and non-Muslims are denied the right to practice their religions freely.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe severe penalties given to lesser offenses under Sharia penal laws have raised concern about their violation of rights that are protected by international human rights treaties.  The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), of which Nigeria is a party, allows the death penalty if it is carried out in a way that causes the least suffering and only in the cases of serious crimes that intentionally cause lethal consequences.  Under Sharia law, adultery is punished by death by stoning, which violates both conditions set forth by the ICCPR.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn southern Nigeria, especially in areas with Christian majorities, many rights are denied to Muslims as well as other religious minorities.  Some educational institutions have banned the use of the [[hijab]], which violates the right of Muslim women to practice their religion.  Some state governments in the South have also denied many requests for land grants to build mosques or Islamic schools.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThroughout Nigeria, religious minorities are systematically restricted from building places of worship and schools through the denial of land grants.  Members of minority religious groups are often attacked during riots and religious conflicts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==International perspective==\nAccording to the U.S. Department of State,\n<blockquote>The most serious human rights problems during ... [2011] were the abuses committed by the militant sect known as [[Boko Haram]], which was responsible for killings, bombings, and other attacks throughout the country, resulting in numerous deaths, injuries, and the widespread destruction of property; abuses committed by the security services with impunity, including killings, beatings, arbitrary detention, and destruction of property; and societal violence, including ethnic, regional, and religious violence. Other serious human rights problems included sporadic abridgement of citizens' right to change their government, due to some election fraud and other irregularities; politically motivated and [[extrajudicial killing]]s by security forces, including summary executions; security force torture, rape, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees, and criminal suspects; harsh and life-threatening prison and detention center conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; prolonged pretrial detention; denial of fair public trial; executive influence on the judiciary and judicial corruption; infringements on citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion, and movement; official corruption; violence and discrimination against women; child abuse; female genital mutilation ...; the killing of children suspected of witchcraft; child sexual exploitation; ethnic, regional, and religious discrimination; trafficking in persons for the purpose of prostitution and forced labor; discrimination against persons with disabilities; discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; vigilante killings; forced and bonded labor; and child labor.<ref name=\"StateDeptHumanRights\">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/186441.pdf ''2011 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Nigeria'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State]</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwelve northern states have adopted some form of [[Shari'a]] into their criminal statutes: [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]], [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Gombe State, Nigeria|Gombe]], [[Jigawa State|Jigawa]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Katsina State|Katsina]], [[Kebbi State|Kebbi]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]], [[Yobe State|Yobe]], and [[Zamfara State|Zamfara]].

[[Nigeria]] has made major improvements in [[human rights]] under this constitution though the [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|American Human Rights Report]] of 2012 notes areas where significant improvement is needed, which include:<ref>Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Human Rights Practices for 2012. 2012.</ref> abuses by [[Boko Haram]], killings by governmental forces, lack of [[social equality]], and issues with [[freedom of speech]]. The [[Human Rights Watch]]'s 2015 World Report states that intensified violence by Boko Haram, restrictions of [[LGBT|LGBTIQQ]] rights, and government corruption continue to undermine the status of human rights in Nigeria.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History since independence==\nIn the period between its independence in 1960 to 1998, Nigeria had, in terms of heads of State, two elected, one appointed, one military successor and 7 [coups d'\u00e9tat] powers. In 1979, they moved to a presidential system in order to properly instate the right of choosing who rules them with a new [https://forible.xyz constitution]. This constitution guarantees fundamental human rights that are constantly in violation.\n\nThere was a crusade for human rights in 1985 when General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] took power.<ref>McCarthy-Arnolds,Eileen. \"Africa, Human Rights, and the Global System: The Political Economy of Human Rights in a Changing World\". 30 December 1993</ref> There were changes under the Babangida administration both for the positive as well as for the negative.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has been active in signing and ratifying international human rights treaties, it has seen challenges when trying to implement these treaties domestically.  Nigeria operates under a [[Monism and dualism in international law#Dualism|dualist system]] and cannot apply international treaties unless they are ratified by the legislative houses of Nigeria.  Furthermore, the Nigerian constitution protects civil and political rights, but international treaties like the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Charter]] also expand protection to cultural, socioeconomic, and group rights.  Because the Nigerian constitution is supreme law, the [[Supreme Court of Nigeria]] often resolves conflicts in favor of the Constitution, therefore restricting the expansion of potential human rights.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Egede|first1=Edwin|title=Bringing Human Rights Home: An Examination of the Domestication of Human Rights Treaties in Nigeria|journal=Journal of African Law|date=2007|volume=51|issue=2|pages=249\u2013284|doi=10.1017/S0021855307000290|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/14418/1/Egede%202007.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Freedom of expression==\n\nWhen General Babangida took power in 1985 and repealed Decree N0. 4 of 1984, a law that made it criminal behavior to publish any material that was considered embarrassing or against the interests of the government,<ref name=speech>MCathy-Arnolds, Penna, and Sobrepena (1994). \"Africa, Human Rights, and the Global System\".</ref> there was renewed hope for [[freedom of expression]] both by the people and the media. Within the Babangida regime, political tolerance occurred for some time. However, this brief foray into human rights broke down when the regime began jailing its critics and firing employees who did not promote their views and ideals. This regime closed down more newspapers and banned more popular organizations than any other in Nigeria's post-colonial history.<ref name=speech/>\n\nThe poparazi in Nigeria was often subject to scare tactics and intimidation. Journalists were subjected to \"chats\" with the State Security Service that involved threatening and possible imprisonment.<ref name=speech/> There were continually newspaper shutdowns. In 1990, ''The Republic'', ''Newbreed'', ''Lagos Daily News'', ''The Punch'', and various other newspapers were shut down at some point by the federal government.<ref>Africa Watch. \"Academic Freedom\".</ref>\n\nCritics maintain that though measures of freedom of the press have improved, there is still room for improvement. Nigeria was described as \"partly free\" in the Freedom of the Press 2011 report published by the [[Freedom House]] (see yearly rankings in Freedom House ratings in Nigeria section).<ref>\"2011 Human Rights Reports: Nigeria\". Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State. 24 May 2012.</ref>\n\n==Government violations==\nNigerian security forces are frequently alleged to carry out arbitrary arrests, torture<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-51419440/africa-eye-torture-rampant-among-nigeria-s-security-forces ''Africa Eye: Torture \u2018rampant\u2019 among Nigeria\u2019s security forces''], BBC news, 10 February 2020.</ref>, forced disappearances, assassinations and extrajudicial [[summary execution]]s. These abuses typically occur within the context of the Nigerian government's security operations or are directed against political and religious organizations and individuals. Several instances of mass killings of political opponents and agitators by security forces have been reported. On 12\u201314 December 2015, the Nigerian Army carried out a [[2015 Zaria massacre|massacre]] of 347 members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) in [[Zaria]], [[Kaduna State]] and buried the bodies in mass graves.\n\n===Police force===\nIn Nigeria, the [[Nigeria Police Force]] has been typically viewed as inefficient and corrupt. The Joint Task Force (JTF) has provided inadequate and violent response to the Boko Haram attacks. The JTF has been involved in killing suspects without fair trial as well as killing random members of communities suspected of supporting the Boko Haram.<ref name=\"Human Rights Watch 2012\"/> This \"heavy-handed\" approach violates human rights with its lack of access to a fair trial and use of discriminatory techniques to determine perpetrators of violence.<ref name=\"Human Rights Watch 2012\"/>\n\nWithin the regular Nigerian Police Force, there are high amounts of corruption and violations that include extortion and embezzlement. The police force takes advantage of the people by putting up roadblocks that require a fee to pass and taking money for no legal reason. Within the police force, there is no equal protection under the law.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Human Rights Watch. \"Everyone's in on the Game- Corruption and Human Rights Abuses by the Nigerian Police Force\". August 2010</ref> The wealthy are able to buy the police for security as well as expecting the police to turn a blind eye to illegal activities they participate in.\n\nOn 21 August 2020, four SARS operatives were arrested and charged with murder after being caught on film manhandling and then shooting to death two suspected phone thieves in broad daylight.<ref name=sarsmurder>https://punchng.com/breaking-police-arrest-officers-who-killed-suspected-igando-phone-thieves/</ref> The two suspected phone thieves were shot dead after they had been arrested.<ref name=sarsmurder /> On April 18, 2020, the Nigerian Police Force stated that two of its officers were arrested after being caught on film beating a woman at the [[Odo Ori Market]] in [[Iwo, Osun]].<ref>https://www.legit.ng/1322289-lockdown-police-arrest-officers-caught-beating-woman-osun-state.html</ref>\n\n===Corruption===\n{{See|Corruption in Nigeria}}\n\nNigeria has the label of having [[Corruption in Nigeria|one of the world's highest levels of corruption]]. This is especially seen within the public sector including stealing public funds and accepting bribes<ref>\"Everyone's in on the Game- Corruption and Human Rights Abuses by the Nigerian Police Force\".</ref> It is estimated that between 1999 and 2007, Nigeria has lost around $4\u20138 billion yearly due to corruption.<ref name=corrupt>Human Rights Watch. \"Criminal Politics\". October 2007</ref>\n \nPoliticians often siphon public funds to further their political careers and also pay gangs to aid them in rigging elections. The elections since the end of military rule occurring in 1999, 2003, and 2007 were bloody affairs and were openly rigged.<ref name=corrupt /> In 2007, ballot boxes were visibly stuffed by paid gangs and in some cases, electoral results were simply made up.<ref>Human Rights Watch.  \"Nigeria: Polls Marred by Violence, Fraud\". 17 April 2007.</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]] estimates that at least 300 were killed due to the 2007 elections and that is considered to be a conservative estimate as cited from a Human Rights Watch telephone interview with Derrick Marco, Nigeria country director in March 2007. These measures of violence and intimidation discouraged the general public from voting. Those who did come out were subject to attacks by gangs.<ref name=corrupt />\n\nThe current Fourth Republic of Nigeria has strengthened its laws against corruption and established the [[Independent Corrupt Practices Commission]] (ICPC) and [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) in the early 2000s.  However, due to the previous institutionalization of corruption, the battle against corruption is ongoing.  These anti-corruption institutions have been attempting to combat the issue but, as of 2010, they have not been very heavy handed in terms of punishment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Former Edo State governor Lucky Igbinedion pleaded guilty to embezzling 2.9 billion Naira (about $24.2 million). However, he had a plea bargain with the EFCC and was fined 3.5 million Naira ($29,167) and did not serve any jail time.<ref>Ahemba, Tume. \"Convicted Nigerian ex-governor to pay $25,750 fine\".

This group engaging in [[jihad]] was banded in 2000 by the spiritual leader [[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]].\n\nIn July 2009, there were five days of extreme violence from Boko Haram as well as with the  governmental response. From 26 to 31 July, the group killed 37 Christian men and burned 29 churches.

Gender Issues and National Development.</ref> Regardless of the opportunity provided to take up unconstitutionality to higher courts in Nigeria, women do not often utilize this option and as such, there continues to be many violations occurring.\n\nWomen who are involved in the [[informal economy]] can often enjoy some degree of autonomy, but men are often in control of land and credit, from a societal perspective. Depending on their connections with important men, educated women may enjoy a higher social status.  Education has provided many women with access to wage labor, which is usually outside of the direct control of men, but women are often still restrained by social expectations and boundaries.  Even when they have employment opportunities, tradition in Nigerian society dictates that a career be secondary to a woman's primary role in the family as a mother or housewife.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reconfiguring Tradition: Women's Rights and Social Status in Contemporary Nigeria|last = Okeke|first = Phil|date = 2000|journal = Africa Today|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nNigerian women face particular problems and injustices once they become widows. The women are subject to cultural pressures that are inconsistent with human rights. In the widowhood practice, culture demands that when a man of significance within the community dies, his widow must act in a certain way as documented by Akpo Offiong Bassey in her studies of the [[Cross River State]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Ako-Nai, Ronke. \"Gender and Power Relations in Nigeria\". Lexington Books. 2012</ref> In some Nigerian tribal cultures, the woman must initially go into seclusion. They are also forced to neglect their bodies; they are not allowed to shave, shower, or change their clothing. They have to rub cow dung and palm oil on their bodies and must also sleep on the floor. Widows are also expected to wear black, the color of mourning, for two years to properly show their loss and respect for their late husband.<ref name=gender>\"Gender and Power Relations in Nigeria\"</ref> These practices widely vary in severity and methods, based on the individual cultural backdrop. However, there has been a major decline of such practices in recent years.\n\nApart from mourning, the widow has immediate concerns involving living situations and property to deal with. In most cases, the eldest son and not the widow inherits the entire property.<ref name=gender /> Women are culturally viewed as property and can be inherited like the rest of a husband's estate. Whether or not the widow can continue to reside on the property is dependent on her relationship with her eldest son or, if there are no sons, the eldest male relative of her husband. There have also been instances where the woman must return to her premarital home after refunding the bride price.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The lack of sufficient property right makes these women dependent on men while single, married, or widowed.\n\nThough the [[Nigerian Supreme Court]] has yet to formally deal with this issue, in the 2007 Nnanyelugo v. Nnanyelugo case, two brothers attempted to get the land of their deceased brother under the case that a widow has no business with the property. The ruling stated that they would no longer allow the males to take advantage of the vulnerable position of the widows and young children.<ref name=gender /> There are other cases in which courts have ruled to implement the equality guaranteed underneath the constitution.\n\nBecause of the patrilineal nature of Nigerian cultures, it is often seen as justifiable to have another wife to ensure that there will be a male heir to carry the lineage of the family.  In custody decisions, women's opinions are often ignored, and decisions are usually made in men's favor.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Child labor and child marriage===\n{{Main|Child marriage in Nigeria|Girl child labour in Nigeria}}\nAccording to the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], 31% of Nigerian children (around 14,000,000 children) aged 5 to 14 years old are working children who engage in [[forced labor]] in various sectors.<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/nigeria.htm Nigeria, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]</ref> According to the Department's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'', instances of [[child labor]] have been observed in the agricultural sector where children participate in the production of cocoa, [[Cassava production in Nigeria|cassava]], and sand, and in the mining industry where they mine, quarry, and crush gravel and granite.\n\nNigeria is characterized by many small farms that largely depend on family labor in the operations of the farm.  In Nigeria, most child labor is found in the informal agricultural sector.  Instead of attending school, more than 50% of children living in the rural areas of Nigeria spend more than 20 hours a week working, which is considered the point at which a child's education becomes significantly affected.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Child Farm Labor in Rural Households of Southwest Nigeria|last = Adeoti|first = Adetola|date = 2013|journal = Global Journal of Human Social Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Coster|first2 = A.S.|last3 = Gbolagun|first3 = A.O.}}</ref>\n\nEarly marriage is prevalent in Nigeria, especially amongst [[Muslim]]s in the north, due to the belief that early marriage prevents promiscuity.

Among other factors to protect children from abuses and discrimination, Section 21 and 23 of the act made it illegal to marry off a child below the age of 18. If a husband consummates a marriage with a child, it is considered rape.<ref>Toyo, Nyoko. \"Revisiting Equality as a Right: The Minimum Age of Marriage Clause in the Nigerian Child Rights Act, 2003\".

The government subsidizes only Christian and Muslim pilgrimages and allows Christian and Muslim religious education in schools.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince January 2000, several Northern states have institutionalized a version of [[Sharia in Nigeria|Sharia law]]. This enactment of Sharia law has caused controversy over its violation of fundamental rights, such as the right for minorities in those states to practice their religion, the right to life, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" />\n\nHistorically, the Nigerian Constitution has allowed Sharia courts jurisdiction over certain cases, but their jurisdiction is limited to matters of Islamic personal or family law.  Several state governments in the North have extended Sharia law to criminal offenses, thereby violating the Constitution's prohibition of an official religion. These states have relied on a constitutional provision that allows the Sharia Court to exercise other jurisdiction given to it by the state in introducing Sharia penal codes. The imposition of Sharia law in certain states in Nigeria infringes on the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims alike.  Muslims who would prefer to be judged under the Constitution are not able to do so, and non-Muslims are denied the right to practice their religions freely.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThe severe penalties given to lesser offenses under Sharia penal laws have raised concern about their violation of rights that are protected by international human rights treaties.  The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), of which Nigeria is a party, allows the death penalty if it is carried out in a way that causes the least suffering and only in the cases of serious crimes that intentionally cause lethal consequences.  Under Sharia law, adultery is punished by death by stoning, which violates both conditions set forth by the ICCPR.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn southern Nigeria, especially in areas with Christian majorities, many rights are denied to Muslims as well as other religious minorities.  Some educational institutions have banned the use of the [[hijab]], which violates the right of Muslim women to practice their religion.  Some state governments in the South have also denied many requests for land grants to build mosques or Islamic schools.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThroughout Nigeria, religious minorities are systematically restricted from building places of worship and schools through the denial of land grants.  Members of minority religious groups are often attacked during riots and religious conflicts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==International perspective==\nAccording to the U.S. Department of State,\n<blockquote>The most serious human rights problems during ...

Other serious human rights problems included sporadic abridgement of citizens' right to change their government, due to some election fraud and other irregularities; politically motivated and [[extrajudicial killing]]s by security forces, including summary executions; security force torture, rape, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees, and criminal suspects; harsh and life-threatening prison and detention center conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; prolonged pretrial detention; denial of fair public trial; executive influence on the judiciary and judicial corruption; infringements on citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion, and movement; official corruption; violence and discrimination against women; child abuse; female genital mutilation ...; the killing of children suspected of witchcraft; child sexual exploitation; ethnic, regional, and religious discrimination; trafficking in persons for the purpose of prostitution and forced labor; discrimination against persons with disabilities; discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; vigilante killings; forced and bonded labor; and child labor.<ref name=\"StateDeptHumanRights\">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/186441.pdf ''2011 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Nigeria'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State]</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwelve northern states have adopted some form of [[Shari'a]] into their criminal statutes: [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]], [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Gombe State, Nigeria|Gombe]], [[Jigawa State|Jigawa]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Katsina State|Katsina]], [[Kebbi State|Kebbi]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]], [[Yobe State|Yobe]], and [[Zamfara State|Zamfara]].
