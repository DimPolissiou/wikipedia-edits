The engagement occurred during the build-up to formal beginning of the [[First English Civil War]] on 22 August, while the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] and [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]] were recruiting men in the county. The Royalists had established their regional headquarters in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], but were threatened by superior Parliamentarian numbers in the vicinity. The Royalist commander sent out a mounted patrol consisting of 60 to 80 [[cavalry]] and [[dragoon]]s, which came across a force of between 500 and 600 Parliamentarian recruits travelling north across the [[Somerset Levels]] under the command of Sir [[John Pyne]].\n\nThe Royalists set an [[ambush]] at Marshall's Elm, where the road rose out of the Levels into the [[Polden Hills]]. After a [[parley]] between the leaders was unsuccessful, the Parliamentarians were caught in the ambush. Facing [[musket]] fire from the hidden dragoons, and being charged at by the Royalist cavalry, they were [[rout]]ed. The Royalists killed around 27, and took 60 prisoners, including two of the Parliamentarian officers. Despite their victory, the Royalists were forced to withdraw from Wells, and later from Somerset altogether, due to their inferior numbers.\n\n==Background==\nConflict between the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and its monarch on religious, fiscal and legislative matters had been ongoing since at least 1603.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|pp=344\u2013348}} The tension between Parliament and [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] escalated sharply during 1642 after the King had attempted to [[Five members|arrest five Members of Parliament]], who he accused of treason.{{sfn|Gentles|2014|p=88}} In preparation for the likelihood of conflict with Parliament, Charles appointed the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]] as commander of his forces in the [[West Country]], supported by [[Ralph Hopton, Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]], a local [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) and an experienced army officer.{{sfn|Barratt|2004|p=78}} Both sides were attempting to recruit the existing [[militia]] and new men into their armies. Parliament passed the [[Militia Ordinance]] in March 1642 without [[royal assent]], granting themselves control of the militia.<ref>The Civil War - The Breakdown of 1641\u20132.</ref> In response, Charles granted [[Commission of array|commissions of array]] to his commanders, a medieval device for [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levying]] soldiers which had not been used since 1557.{{sfn|Malcolm|1978|p=256}} One such commission was issued to Hertford, for the levying of troops in south-west England and south Wales.{{sfn|Rushworth|1721|pp=655\u2013688}}\n\nHertford chose [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] in [[Somerset]] as the Royalists' headquarters in the West Country, and they arrived in the city on 28 July. The decision was based on the fact that Wells housed the county [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]], had Royalist sympathies, and was geographically central within the area. In his 1973 book, ''Somerset in the Civil War'', the historian [[David Underdown]] criticises the decision, citing Wells' vulnerable position in the [[Mendip Hills]], and the strong Parliamentarian views held by the majority of Somerset's rural population.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=32}} Hopton had previously acted as one of the [[deputy lieutenant]]s for Somerset, making him responsible for training and leading the county's militia.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|pp=11\u201316}} Hopton's standing helped the Royalists' recruiting, but the general population of the county, many of whom were [[Calvinism|Calvinist Protestants]], or worked in industries [[Depression (economics)|depressed]] by royal policies, was more sympathetic towards Parliament than the King.{{sfn|Barratt|2004|p=78}}{{sfn|Edgar|1968|pp=30\u201333}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=11\u201323}} Broadly speaking, the Royalists were more successful in recruiting [[cavalry]] and members of the [[gentry]];{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} Hopton, [[John Digby (1618\u20131664)|John Digby]] and [[Francis Hawley, 1st Baron Hawley|Francis Hawley]] each brought a [[troop]] of horse, but attempts to raise an [[infantry]] regiment were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=32}} In contrast, the Parliamentarians signed up more men,{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} but many of these were untrained and unarmed countrymen.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=34}}\n\nOn 30 July 1642, the Parliamentarians, led by [[William Strode (of Barrington)|William Strode]], one of Parliament's deputy lieutenants in Somerset, held a meeting to collect [[Weapon|arms]] at [[Shepton Mallet]], around {{convert|4|miles|spell=in|0}} [[Points of the compass#16-wind compass rose|east-southeast]] of Wells. Hertford sent Hopton with his cavalry to Shepton on 1 August to confront the Parliamentarians, but he had orders to avoid conflict. When Hopton arrived in Shepton, Strode refused to listen to him, and the two scuffled. A crowd of over 1,000 had gathered, and Hopton withdrew and rejoined his cavalry outside the town. There, the Royalists and the countrymen sympathetic to the Parliamentarians faced off without fighting for several hours before the Royalists pulled back to Wells.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=34}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:On the Polden Way over Collard Hill - view NW (geograph 5618962).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The view from Collard Hill, towards Marshall's Elm. The [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] force approached from the left, while the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] positioned themselves on the hills.|alt=A grassy hill with trees in the background. The hill falls away steeply to the left of the image, and less so to the right.]]\nThe success of the Parliamentarians' recruiting left the Royalists in danger of being surrounded in Wells.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} Sir [[John Pyne]], an MP who had also been appointed as a deputy lieutenant of Somerset by Parliament in March,{{sfn|Underdown|2011}} and Captain John Preston recruited around 400 men from [[Taunton]] (around {{convert|24|miles|0}} south-west of Wells), while Captain Sands brought a further 200 from [[South Petherton]].{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} Pyne had orders to bring the men, described as \"a few hundred farmers\" by Underdown, to [[Street, Somerset|Street]], where they would rendezvous with Strode.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=35, 39}} Hertford was wary of his weak position,{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} and on 4 August he sent a mounted patrol out under the command of Sir [[John Stawell]], composed of three troops of cavalry and some [[dragoon]]s, numbering around 60 to 80 in all.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=35}} The patrol, which also included several of the Royalist gentry and the experienced soldier Henry Lunsford, rode south through [[Glastonbury]] into the [[Polden Hills]]. On reaching the village of Marshall's Elm, just over {{convert|1|mile|spell=in|0}} south of Street, and around {{convert|8|miles|spell=in|0}} south of Wells, the patrol spotted Pyne's force marching through cornfields about {{convert|2|miles|spell=in|0}} away.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=35}}\n\n==Battle==\nHaving approached from the north, the Royalists had the advantage of higher ground, coming down off the Poldens. Marshall's Elm is located in a depression that acted as a [[Mountain pass|pass]] between Ivy Thorn Hill and Collard Hill,{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} where the road rose out of the [[Somerset Levels]] to climb into the hills.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=61}} Stawell [[parley]]ed with the Parliamentarians, telling them that they could avoid conflict if they aborted their march, but to no effect.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} While Stawell was engaged in his discussion with the Parliamentarians, Lunsford arranged the Royalist troops; the cavalry were behind the brow of the hill, leaving just their heads and weapons visible, to disguise their numbers; fourteen dragoons dismounted and were hidden in quarry pits lower on the hill by the road.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} He ordered all the men to hold their fire until he led the attack with the dragoons.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}\n\nPyne initially continued the Parliamentarian march, but then changed his mind. His order to stop was met with complaints from his men, who said that the Royalist force \"were but a few horse and would run away\",{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} and they continued up the hill. Pyne's men halted occasionally to fire,{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} but Lunsford held the Royalists' fire until the enemy were within 120 paces, when the dragoons returned fire with their muskets and killed the leader of the Parliamentarian [[vanguard]].{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} The Parliamentarians hesitated, unsure of where the attack had come from, and Stawell led the cavalry charge down the hill.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} The Parliamentarians were routed; seven were killed at Marshall's Elm,{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=61}} and the Royalists chased some of the fleeing men for {{convert|3|miles|spell=in|0}}, as far as [[Somerton, Somerset|Somerton]]. They captured sixty prisoners, who they left in Somerton.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} Among those captured were the two officers, Preston and Sands.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} As well as the seven killed at the battle, roughly another twenty died of their wounds.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle provided both a tactical and strategic victory for the Royalists, leaving Hertford with an escape route from Wells should it be needed. Underdown credits their cavalry strength and leadership for the victory, highlighting that their leaders were \"accustomed to command and confident of their ability to defeat larger forces of poorly officered farmers\".{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} He was particularly complimentary of Lunsford, and the experience he brought. One of the region's Parliamentarian leaders, [[John Ashe (of Freshford)|John Ashe]], said that the battle \"very much daunted the honest countryman\".{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}}\n\nDespite their defeat at Marshall's Elm, the Parliamentarians continued to gather men around Wells. Groups congregated from [[Bristol]], [[Gloucester]], [[Wiltshire]] and throughout north-east Somerset; a range of cavalry, musketeers and countrymen wielding makeshift weapons such as [[pitchforks]].{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=33\u201337}} The force, which numbered around 12,000,{{efn|The Royalists suggested that there were 40,000, but in his military history of the war, Peter Gaunt dismisses this number as \"improbable\".{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=61}}}} crossed the Mendip Hills and reached a slope overlooking Wells on the evening of 5 August.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=37\u201338}} Pyne held joint command of part of the force with Strode.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} Hertford sent his cavalry to face them, and both groups agreed to a ceasefire until the next day. Overnight, the Parliamentarians' numbers were swelled by further recruits and reinforcements, and Hertford made a sham of negotiating in the morning to cover his retreat; while the Parliamentarian messengers were riding north out of Wells with his 'offer', his men fled south, covered by a cavalry [[rearguard]] led by Hopton. After spending two nights in Somerton,{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=37\u201338}} the Royalists withdrew out of Somerset altogether, garrisoning [[Sherborne Castle]] in [[Dorset]].{{sfn|Edgar|1968|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[First English Civil War]] formally began on 22 August, when Charles I raised his [[Royal standards of England|royal standard]] in Nottingham. The battle at Marshall's Elm was not the only engagement to predate the formal start of the war, but the historian Peter Gaunt suggests that it was the bloodiest,{{sfn|Gaunt|2003|p=23}} while another, Charles Carlton, said that Marshall's Elm was the \"first real confrontation\" of the war.{{sfn|Carlton|1994|p=116}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Barratt |first=John |title=Cavalier Generals: King Charles I and His Commanders in the English Civil War 1642\u201346 |location=Barnsley |publisher= Pen & Sword Military |year=2004 |isbn=1-84415-128-X}}\n::{{cite book |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/artshumanitiesth00edwa |chapter=The English Civil Wars |title=Arts and Humanities Through the Eras |volume=5: The Age of the Baroque and Enlightenment 1600\u20131800 |editor1-last=Bleiberg |editor1-first=Edward |editor2-last=Soergel |editor2-first=Philip |collaboration=true |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |year=2005 |location=[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] |isbn=978-0-787-65697-3 |ref=harv |chapter-url-access=registration}}\n::{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Brooks |first=Richard |title=Cassell's Battlefields of Britain and Ireland |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=2005 |isbn=0-304-36333-2}}\n::{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Carlton |first=Charles |title=Going to the Wars: The Experience of the British Civil Wars 1638\u20131651 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-4151-0391-6}}\n::{{cite web |title=The Civil War - The Breakdown of 1641-1642 |url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/overview/the-breakdown/ |website=www.parliament.uk |publisher=www.parliament.uk |date=2020|accessdate=15 November 2019}}\n::{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Edgar |first=F.

The engagement occurred during the build-up to formal beginning of the [[First English Civil War]] on 22 August, while the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] and [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]] were recruiting men in the county. The Royalists had established their regional headquarters in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], but were threatened by superior Parliamentarian numbers in the vicinity. The Royalist commander sent out a mounted patrol consisting of 60 to 80 [[cavalry]] and [[dragoon]]s, which came across a force of between 500 and 600 Parliamentarian recruits travelling north across the [[Somerset Levels]] under the command of Sir [[John Pyne]].\n\nThe Royalists set an [[ambush]] at Marshall's Elm, where the road rose out of the Levels into the [[Polden Hills]]. After a [[parley]] between the leaders was unsuccessful, the Parliamentarians were caught in the ambush. Facing [[musket]] fire from the hidden dragoons, and being charged at by the Royalist cavalry, they were [[rout]]ed. The Royalists killed around 27, and took 60 prisoners, including two of the Parliamentarian officers. Despite their victory, the Royalists were forced to withdraw from Wells, and later from Somerset altogether, due to their inferior numbers.\n\n==Background==\nConflict between the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and its monarch on religious, fiscal and legislative matters had been ongoing since at least 1603.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|pp=344\u2013348}} The tension between Parliament and [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] escalated sharply during 1642 after the King had attempted to [[Five members|arrest five Members of Parliament]], who he accused of treason.{{sfn|Gentles|2014|p=88}} In preparation for the likelihood of conflict with Parliament, Charles appointed the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]] as commander of his forces in the [[West Country]], supported by [[Ralph Hopton, Baron Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]], a local [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) and an experienced army officer.{{sfn|Barratt|2004|p=78}} Both sides were attempting to recruit the existing [[militia]] and new men into their armies. Parliament passed the [[Militia Ordinance]] in March 1642 without [[royal assent]], granting themselves control of the militia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/overview/the-breakdown/ |title=The Breakdown of 1641\u20132 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> In response, Charles granted [[Commission of array|commissions of array]] to his commanders, a medieval device for [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levying]] soldiers which had not been used since 1557.{{sfn|Malcolm|1978|p=256}} One such commission was issued to Hertford, for the levying of troops in south-west England and south Wales.{{sfn|Rushworth|1721|pp=655\u2013688}}\n\nHertford chose [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] in [[Somerset]] as the Royalists' headquarters in the West Country, and they arrived in the city on 28 July. The decision was based on the fact that Wells housed the county [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]], had Royalist sympathies, and was geographically central within the area. In his 1973 book, ''Somerset in the Civil War'', the historian [[David Underdown]] criticises the decision, citing Wells' vulnerable position in the [[Mendip Hills]], and the strong Parliamentarian views held by the majority of Somerset's rural population.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=32}} Hopton had previously acted as one of the [[deputy lieutenant]]s for Somerset, making him responsible for training and leading the county's militia.{{sfn|Edgar|1968|pp=11\u201316}} Hopton's standing helped the Royalists' recruiting, but the general population of the county, many of whom were [[Calvinism|Calvinist Protestants]], or worked in industries [[Depression (economics)|depressed]] by royal policies, was more sympathetic towards Parliament than the King.{{sfn|Barratt|2004|p=78}}{{sfn|Edgar|1968|pp=30\u201333}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=11\u201323}} Broadly speaking, the Royalists were more successful in recruiting [[cavalry]] and members of the [[gentry]];{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} Hopton, [[John Digby (1618\u20131664)|John Digby]] and [[Francis Hawley, 1st Baron Hawley|Francis Hawley]] each brought a [[troop]] of horse, but attempts to raise an [[infantry]] regiment were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=32}} In contrast, the Parliamentarians signed up more men,{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} but many of these were untrained and unarmed countrymen.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=34}}\n\nOn 30 July 1642, the Parliamentarians, led by [[William Strode (of Barrington)|William Strode]], one of Parliament's deputy lieutenants in Somerset, held a meeting to collect [[Weapon|arms]] at [[Shepton Mallet]], around {{convert|4|miles|spell=in|0}} [[Points of the compass#16-wind compass rose|east-southeast]] of Wells. Hertford sent Hopton with his cavalry to Shepton on 1 August to confront the Parliamentarians, but he had orders to avoid conflict. When Hopton arrived in Shepton, Strode refused to listen to him, and the two scuffled. A crowd of over 1,000 had gathered, and Hopton withdrew and rejoined his cavalry outside the town. There, the Royalists and the countrymen sympathetic to the Parliamentarians faced off without fighting for several hours before the Royalists pulled back to Wells.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=34}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:On the Polden Way over Collard Hill - view NW (geograph 5618962).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The view from Collard Hill, towards Marshall's Elm. The [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] force approached from the left, while the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] positioned themselves on the hills.|alt=A grassy hill with trees in the background. The hill falls away steeply to the left of the image, and less so to the right.]]\nThe success of the Parliamentarians' recruiting left the Royalists in danger of being surrounded in Wells.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} Sir [[John Pyne]], an MP who had also been appointed as a deputy lieutenant of Somerset by Parliament in March,{{sfn|Underdown|2011}} and Captain John Preston recruited around 400 men from [[Taunton]] (around {{convert|24|miles|0}} south-west of Wells), while Captain Sands brought a further 200 from [[South Petherton]].{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} Pyne had orders to bring the men, described as \"a few hundred farmers\" by Underdown, to [[Street, Somerset|Street]], where they would rendezvous with Strode.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=35, 39}} Hertford was wary of his weak position,{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} and on 4 August he sent a mounted patrol out under the command of Sir [[John Stawell]], composed of three troops of cavalry and some [[dragoon]]s, numbering around 60 to 80 in all.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=35}} The patrol, which also included several of the Royalist gentry and the experienced soldier Henry Lunsford, rode south through [[Glastonbury]] into the [[Polden Hills]]. On reaching the village of Marshall's Elm, just over {{convert|1|mile|spell=in|0}} south of Street, and around {{convert|8|miles|spell=in|0}} south of Wells, the patrol spotted Pyne's force marching through cornfields about {{convert|2|miles|spell=in|0}} away.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=35}}\n\n==Battle==\nHaving approached from the north, the Royalists had the advantage of higher ground, coming down off the Poldens. Marshall's Elm is located in a depression that acted as a [[Mountain pass|pass]] between Ivy Thorn Hill and Collard Hill,{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} where the road rose out of the [[Somerset Levels]] to climb into the hills.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=61}} Stawell [[parley]]ed with the Parliamentarians, telling them that they could avoid conflict if they aborted their march, but to no effect.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} While Stawell was engaged in his discussion with the Parliamentarians, Lunsford arranged the Royalist troops; the cavalry were behind the brow of the hill, leaving just their heads and weapons visible, to disguise their numbers; fourteen dragoons dismounted and were hidden in quarry pits lower on the hill by the road.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} He ordered all the men to hold their fire until he led the attack with the dragoons.{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}}\n\nPyne initially continued the Parliamentarian march, but then changed his mind. His order to stop was met with complaints from his men, who said that the Royalist force \"were but a few horse and would run away\",{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} and they continued up the hill. Pyne's men halted occasionally to fire,{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} but Lunsford held the Royalists' fire until the enemy were within 120 paces, when the dragoons returned fire with their muskets and killed the leader of the Parliamentarian [[vanguard]].{{sfn|Brooks|2005|p=381}} The Parliamentarians hesitated, unsure of where the attack had come from, and Stawell led the cavalry charge down the hill.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} The Parliamentarians were routed; seven were killed at Marshall's Elm,{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=61}} and the Royalists chased some of the fleeing men for {{convert|3|miles|spell=in|0}}, as far as [[Somerton, Somerset|Somerton]]. They captured sixty prisoners, who they left in Somerton.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} Among those captured were the two officers, Preston and Sands.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} As well as the seven killed at the battle, roughly another twenty died of their wounds.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle provided both a tactical and strategic victory for the Royalists, leaving Hertford with an escape route from Wells should it be needed. Underdown credits their cavalry strength and leadership for the victory, highlighting that their leaders were \"accustomed to command and confident of their ability to defeat larger forces of poorly officered farmers\".{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}} He was particularly complimentary of Lunsford, and the experience he brought. One of the region's Parliamentarian leaders, [[John Ashe (of Freshford)|John Ashe]], said that the battle \"very much daunted the honest countryman\".{{sfn|Underdown|1973|p=36}}\n\nDespite their defeat at Marshall's Elm, the Parliamentarians continued to gather men around Wells. Groups congregated from [[Bristol]], [[Gloucester]], [[Wiltshire]] and throughout north-east Somerset; a range of cavalry, musketeers and countrymen wielding makeshift weapons such as [[pitchforks]].{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=33\u201337}} The force, which numbered around 12,000,{{efn|The Royalists suggested that there were 40,000, but in his military history of the war, Peter Gaunt dismisses this number as \"improbable\".{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=61}}}} crossed the Mendip Hills and reached a slope overlooking Wells on the evening of 5 August.{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=37\u201338}} Pyne held joint command of part of the force with Strode.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=3}} Hertford sent his cavalry to face them, and both groups agreed to a ceasefire until the next day. Overnight, the Parliamentarians' numbers were swelled by further recruits and reinforcements, and Hertford made a sham of negotiating in the morning to cover his retreat; while the Parliamentarian messengers were riding north out of Wells with his 'offer', his men fled south, covered by a cavalry [[rearguard]] led by Hopton. After spending two nights in Somerton,{{sfn|Underdown|1973|pp=37\u201338}} the Royalists withdrew out of Somerset altogether, garrisoning [[Sherborne Castle]] in [[Dorset]].{{sfn|Edgar|1968|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[First English Civil War]] formally began on 22 August, when Charles I raised his [[Royal standards of England|royal standard]] in Nottingham. The battle at Marshall's Elm was not the only engagement to predate the formal start of the war, but the historian Peter Gaunt suggests that it was the bloodiest,{{sfn|Gaunt|2003|p=23}} while another, Charles Carlton, said that Marshall's Elm was the \"first real confrontation\" of the war.{{sfn|Carlton|1994|p=116}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Barratt |first=John |title=Cavalier Generals: King Charles I and His Commanders in the English Civil War 1642\u201346 |location=Barnsley |publisher= Pen & Sword Military |year=2004 |isbn=1-84415-128-X}}\n* {{cite book |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/artshumanitiesth00edwa |chapter=The English Civil Wars |title=Arts and Humanities Through the Eras |volume=5: The Age of the Baroque and Enlightenment 1600\u20131800 |editor1-last=Bleiberg |editor1-first=Edward |editor2-last=Soergel |editor2-first=Philip |collaboration=true |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |year=2005 |location=[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] |isbn=978-0-787-65697-3 |ref=harv |chapter-url-access=registration}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Brooks |first=Richard |title=Cassell's Battlefields of Britain and Ireland |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=2005 |isbn=0-304-36333-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Carlton |first=Charles |title=Going to the Wars: The Experience of the British Civil Wars 1638\u20131651 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-4151-0391-6}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Edgar |first=F.

They are regulated at the most basic level by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ems.gov/whatisems.html|title=EMS.gov &#124; What is EMS?|website=www.ems.gov}}</ref>, which sets the minimum standards that all states' EMS providers must meet, and regulated more strictly by individual [[U.S. state|state]] governments, which often require higher standards from the services they oversee.\n\nWide differences in [[population density]], [[topography]], and other conditions can call for different types of EMS systems; consequently, there is often significant variation between the Emergency Medical Services provided in one state and those provided in another.\n\n==Organization and funding==\n\n===Land ambulance===\n\nEMS delivery in the US can be based on various [[prototype|model]]s.  While most services are, to some degree, publicly funded, the factor which often differentiates services is the manner in which they are operated. EMS systems may be directly operated by the community, or they may fall to a third-party provider, such as a [[private company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ems.gov/whatisems.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308110607/http://www.ems.gov/whatisems.htm |archivedate=2016-03-08 }}</ref> The most common operating models in the U.S. include:\n\n====Publicly operated EMS====\n\nIn one of the more common publicly operated models, an EMS system is operated directly by the municipality it services.  The services themselves may be provided by a local government, or may be the responsibility of the regional (or state) government.  Municipality-operated services may be funded by service fees and supplemented by [[property taxes]].  In many such cases, the EMS system is considered to be too small to operate independently, and is organized as a branch of another municipal department, such as the [[Public health|Public Health]] department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtyhd.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=20&Itemid=209&lang=en|title=Monterey County EMS|accessdate=2012-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001045749/http://www.mtyhd.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=20&Itemid=209&lang=en|archive-date=2012-10-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In small communities that lack a large population or tax-base, such a service may not be able to operate unless it is staffed by community [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monroeems.org/|title=Monroe Volunteer EMS website|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>  In these cases, the volunteer squad may receive some funding from municipal taxes, but is generally heavily reliant on voluntary [[donation]]s to cover operating expenses.  This provides a significant challenge for volunteer groups, since the [[training]] standards for staff must be met, and the vehicle and equipment standards adhered to, while the group does all or most of its own [[fundraising]].  Without the presence of dedicated volunteers, however, many small communities in America might be without local EMS systems and would either have no service at all or be forced to rely on service from more distant communities.\n\nAnother operating model for publicly operated EMS is what is generally referred to in the industry as the 'third service' option.  In this option, rather than being an integral part of (or in some cases, an 'add-on' to) one of the traditional 'emergency' services (fire and police), the service is organized as a separate, free-standing, [[Local government|municipal]] department, with organization that may be similar to, but operated independently from, either the fire or police departments,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.gov/government/ems/|title=New Orleans EMS|accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref> In a variant of this model, the EMS system may be recognized as a legitimate third emergency service, but provided under a [[contractual agreement]] with another organization, such as a private company or a hospital, instead of direct operation.  This model is sometimes referred to as the 'public utility' model.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jon R. Krohmer |title=Principles Of Ems Systems |publisher=American College of Emergency Physicians |location= |year=2005 |pages=149\u2013150 |isbn=0-7637-3382-2 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  This may be a cost-saving measure, or it may be because the community feels that they lack the resident expertise to deal with medical oversight and control issues, and the legal requirements that typically surround an Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn yet another model for publicly operated EMS, the system may be integrated into the operations of another municipal emergency service, such as the local [[fire department]] or [[police department]].  This integration may be partial or complete.  In the case of partial integration, the EMS staff may share quarters, administrative services, and even command and control with the other service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fdnyems.com/|title=FDNYEMS website|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>  In the case of full integration, the EMS staff may be fully cross-trained to perform the entry-level function of the other emergency service, whether [[firefighting]] or [[policing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mspaviation.org/frames.asp |title=Maryland State Police Aviation Command website |accessdate=2008-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004094925/http://www.mspaviation.org/frames.asp |archivedate=2008-10-04 }}</ref>  Many communities perceive this as providing 'added value' to the community, since municipal workers are fulfilling more than one function, and are less likely to be idle.\n\n====Private/for profit EMS====\n\nAmbulance services operating on a private/for profit basis have a long history in the U.S. Often, particularly in smaller communities, ambulance service was seen by the community as a lower priority than police or fire services, and certainly nothing that should require public funding. Until the professionalization of emergency medical services in the early 1970s, one of the most common providers of ambulance service in the United States was a community's local funeral home.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jon R.

Funeral home ambulance operations were sometimes supplemented by 'mom and pop' operations, which were not affiliated with funeral homes but rather operated on much the same basis as a taxi service. There were no national standards for ambulance services and staff generally had little, if any, medical training or equipment, leading to a high pre-hospital mortality rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Such companies continue to operate this way in some locations, providing non-emergency transport services, fee-for-service emergency service,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardianambulance.org/ver_1.html|title=Guardian Ambulance Ltd. website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> or contracted emergency ambulance service to municipalities, as in the public utility model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencyambulance.com/main.html|title=Emergency Ambulance Service Ltd website|accessdate=2008-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027035037/http://www.emergencyambulance.com/main.html|archive-date=2008-10-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, more than 200 private ambulance companies in the U.S. were gradually merged into large regional companies, some of which continue to operate today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acadian.com/|title=Acadian Ambulance Company website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> As this trend continued, the result was a few remaining private companies, a handful of regional companies, and two very large multinational companies which currently dominate the entire industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amr.net/|title=American Medical Response website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralmetro.com/|title=Rural Metro Corporation website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> These services continue to operate in some parts of the U.S., either on a fee-for-service basis to the patient, or by means of contracts with local municipalities.

In addition, it is not uncommon for U.S. military helicopters to be pressed into service providing air ambulance support.  The vast distances covered by the U.S. mean that while helicopters may be the preferred form of service delivery for 'on-scene' emergencies, [[fixed wing]] aircraft, including small [[Jet aircraft|jets]], are often used for transfers from rural hospitals to [[tertiary care]] sites.  These aircraft are typically staffed by a mix of personnel including [[physicians]], [[nurses]], and [[paramedics in the United States|paramedics]], and in some cases, by all three.  Publicly operated air ambulance service is supplemented by emergency and non-emergency air transport service, which may be provided by dedicated air ambulance companies, or by aircraft [[charter]] companies as a secondary business operation. 3\n<gallery caption=\"Air Ambulance in the United States\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:MCI Drill 2008 003.jpg|Training with LifeEvac II\nFile:Tn DSC01826.JPG|STAT MedEvac\nFile:Aircare.JPG|PHI AirMedical AirCare 2\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\nGrady [[ambulance]] service in the United States began in [[Atlanta]], Georgia in 1869. Grady Memorial Hospital staff rode in horse-drawn carriages designed specifically for transporting the sick and injured.\n\nThe first volunteer rescue squads organized around 1920 in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], [[Palmyra, New Jersey]], and along the [[New Jersey]] coast. Gradually, especially during and after World War II, hospitals and physicians faded from prehospital practice, yielding in urban areas to centrally coordinated programs. These were often controlled by the municipal hospital or fire department. Sporadically, funeral home hearses, which had been the common mode of transport, were being replaced by fire department, rescue squad, and private ambulances.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, ambulance service was largely unregulated. While some areas ambulances were staffed by advanced first-aid-level responders, in other areas, it was common for the local undertaker, having the only vehicles in town in which a person could lie down, to operate both the local furniture store (where he would make coffins as a sideline) and the local ambulance service.  However, after the release of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s study, \"Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society\", (known in the EMS trade as [[the White Paper]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaston SR |title=Accidental death and disability: the neglected disease of modern society.

The system was called the Division of Emergency Medical Services (now known as the ''[http://www.miemss.org/ Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services and Systems]''). Also in 1969, Cowley obtained a [[military]] helicopter to assist in rapidly transporting patients to the Center for the Study of Trauma (now known as the [[R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center]]), a specialized hospital that he had started for the purpose of treating [[hypovolemia|shock]]. This service was not only the first statewide EMS program, but also the beginning of modern emergency medical helicopter transport in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/shocktrauma/history.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224082924/http://www.umm.edu/shocktrauma/history.html|url-status=dead|title=History<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=December 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[civilian]] hospital-based medical helicopter program in the U.S., [[Flight For Life]] Colorado, began in 1972 with a single Alouette III [[helicopter]], based at St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver, Colorado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightforlifecolorado.org/index.php?s=5|title= Flight for Life Colorado website|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref>\n\nNational EMS standards for the US are determined by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and modified by each state's Department of EMS (usually under its [[Department of Health]]), and further altered by Regional Medical Advisory Committees (usually in rural areas) or by other committees, or even individual EMS providers.  In addition, the [http://www.nremt.org/ National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians], an independent body, was created in 1970 at the recommendation of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in an effort to provide a nationally accepted certification for providers and a nationwide consensus on protocols. Currently, National Registry certification is accepted in some parts of the U.S., while other areas still maintain their own, separate protocols and training curricula.\n\nA significant event in the development of modern standards of care in the U.S. was a report published in 1966 by the National Academy of Sciences entitled \"Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society\", commonly referred to as \"the White Paper.\" In this study, it became apparent that many of the deaths occurring every day were unnecessary, and could be prevented through a combination of community education, stricter safety standards, and better pre-hospital treatments.\n\nIn particular, in the US state of [[California]], in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state ([[Medic One]]), and in [[Miami]], projects began to include [[paramedics in the United States|paramedic]]s in the EMS responses in the early 1970s.  Groups in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] and [[Portland, Oregon]] were also early pioneers in pre-hospital emergency medical training.  Despite opposition from [[firefighters]] and doctors, the program eventually gained acceptance as its effectiveness became obvious.\n\nFurthermore, such programs became widely popularized around North America in the 1970s with the [[NBC]] television series, ''[[Emergency!]]''  which, in part, followed the adventures of two [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] paramedics as they responded to various types of [[medical emergency]].  [[James O. Page]] served as the series technical adviser and went on to become integral in the development of EMS in the U.S. The popularity of this series encouraged other communities to establish their own equivalent services.\n\n==Standards==\n\n===Staffing===\n\nAmbulances in the United States must be staffed with a minimum of 2 personnel. The level of crew certification varies depending on the jurisdiction the ambulance is operating in. In most areas, the bare minimum is an EMT to provide patient care and an EMR to assist and drive the unit. This set-up would be classified as a Basic Life Support Unit (BLS) due to the fact that the highest ranking provider cannot perform Advanced Life Support (ALS) interventions. If patient condition warrants, an ALS provider may be summoned to assist and meet the ambulance en route to the hospital. Other staffing combinations include one EMT and one paramedic (the most common arrangement), or two Paramedics, which are classified in most areas as an Advanced Life Support Unit (ALS). Unlike in Europe, Emergency Physicians do not regularly practice in the field, and only crew ambulances for specialty situations, such as extreme-low-weight infant transports, ECMO or cardiac bypass transports, or unusual situations such as crush injuries necessitating field amputation, or mass casualty/disaster situations.\n\n====Funding and manpower models====\nEMS is sometimes provided by volunteers. Agencies that were once strictly volunteer have begun supplementing their ranks with compensated members in order to keep up with booming call volumes. As of 2004, the largest \"Private Enterprise\" provider of contract EMS services in North America was [[American Medical Response]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amr.net/|title=AMR website|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> based in Greenwood Village, Colorado.  The second-largest US EMS provider is [[Rural Metro|Rural/Metro Corporation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralmetro.com/|title=Rural/Metro website|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> based in Scottsdale, Arizona; Rural/Metro Corporation also provides EMS services to parts of Latin America.  Like AMR, Rural/Metro provided other transportation services, such as non-emergency transport and \"coach\", or wheelchair, transportation. On October 28, 2015, AMR announced that it had finalized the acquisition of Rural/Metro, forming the largest EMS organization in the United States and employing nearly 25,000 individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.amr.net/ruralmetro|title = AMR & Rural/Metro Integration Planning Updates|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref>\n\nMany colleges and universities now also have their own EMS agencies.  Collegiate EMS programs vary somewhat from university to university; however, most agencies are fully staffed by student volunteers. Agencies might operate what is called a Quick Response Service (which does not transport patients but acts as a first responder to scenes) providing initial patient assessment and care, or they might operate certified ambulance services staffed with EMTs or Paramedics. Some groups limit services to within their campus, while others extend services to the surrounding community. Services provided by college and university agencies may include ambulance services, mass-casualty incident response, aero-medical services, and search-and-rescue teams.<ref name=\"will\">Will H, Jones KO, [http://www.collegehealth-e.org/3/n05.htm \"An Overview of Collegiate Emergency Medical Services.\"]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''collegehealth-e'', Issue 3 (June\u2013July 2006), pp. 13-14.

Unlike fire and police protection, which are recognize as an essential services by the Federal Government, it has been left to local governments to determine if emergency medical services are necessary for their communities. This lack of federal recognition as an essential service has left emergency medical services grossly underfunded throughout the United States, leading to service closures and gaps in coverage for citizens throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/in-rural-america-there-are-few-people-left-to-drive-the-ambulances|title=In Rural America, There Are Few People Left to Drive the Ambulances|first=Nathan|last=Kohrman|date=January 15, 2019|via=www.newyorker.com}}</ref>\n\n===Training and certification===\n''For a state specific list of qualification levels, see [[Emergency medical responder levels by U.S. state]]''\n[[Image:MS1 on stretcher.jpg|thumb|Arriving at hospital]]\nThe original lines that delineated an EMT from a Paramedic and a Paramedic from a doctor are becoming increasingly blurred{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. Skills that were once reserved for [[physicians]] are now routinely performed by [[paramedics in the United States|paramedics]], and skills once reserved for paramedics, such as defibrillation, are now routinely performed by Basic [[Emergency Medical Technician]]s (EMTs){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. However, there is wide variation among states, and even among counties within states, of what type of care providers at different levels are allowed to provide. In addition to these variations, some states and counties allow for ''add-ons'', such as [[defibrillation]] or [[Intravenous therapy|IV therapy]], which enable workers at a lower level to learn and use additional skills that would not normally be within the [[scope of practice]] of their qualification level (for example, an EMT is not generally permitted to start an IV, but after successfully completing an IV add-on course, he or she would then be able to do so.) Add-on skills are generally more common in rural areas where definitive care is further away geographically and immediate interventions by EMTs are beneficial for patient care.\n\nA basic listing of qualification levels:\n*[[Emergency Medical Responder]] (EMR): EMRs, many of whom are volunteers, provide basic, immediate care including bleeding control, CPR, AED, and emergency childbirth. An EMR, with the help of an EMT, can assume care for a patient while that patient is being transported.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n*[[Emergency Medical Technician]] (EMT): EMT includes all EMR skills, advanced oxygen and ventilation skills, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and administration of certain medications.\n*[[Advanced Emergency Medical Technician]] (AEMT): AEMT includes all EMT skills, advanced airway devices, intravenous and intraosseous access, blood glucose monitoring, and administration of additional medications.\n*[[Registered Nurse]]: Some jurisdictions use specially trained nurses for pre-hospital services. These are mostly air-medical personnel or critical care transport providers with specialized training and experience in pre-hospital care. Such nurses are required by their employers to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing licensure and are often required to have three years (minimum) of full-time experience in emergency and/or intensive care. Certifications requirements vary but often include [[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS), [[basic life support]] (BLS), [[pediatric advanced life support]] (PALS), [[neonatal resuscitation program]] (NRP), [[trauma nursing core course]] (TNCC), and [[Advanced Trauma Life Support]] (ATLS), in addition to [[Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support]] (PHTLS). Standards also include being board certified in [[Emergency Nursing]] (CEN), [[Critical Care Nursing]] (CCRN), and Ground Transport (CTRN) or [[Flight Nursing]] (CFRN) respectively. These nurses are trained up to and able to operate at the level of a paramedic and in some regions are authorized to operate base station phones for medical command. Some states allow them to operate entirely under standing orders while on a ground ambulance or air medical unit (i.e. offline medical control). Training also includes specific education relevant to the state and its protocols, and often require the nurse to train with paramedics for a period of time as well as taking an additional exam administered by their medical director before being allowed to operate on a ground ambulance or air medical unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astna.org/documents/Continuing_Education_Rev2012_AB.pdf|title=Qualifications, Orientation, Competencies, and Continuing Education for Transport Nurses|accessdate=2014-08-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122153732/http://www.astna.org/documents/Continuing_Education_Rev2012_AB.pdf|archivedate=2015-01-22}} Air & Transport Nurse Association, 2012.</ref> Many of these nurses hold certifications as Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics, and in some states are required to, but it is not the standard of practice.<ref name=\"NJAC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newjersey.gov/health/ems/documents/njac841r.pdf |title=Advanced Life Support Services; Mobile Intensive Care Programs, Specialty Care Transport Services and Air Medical Services |accessdate=2010-01-04 |at=NJAC 8:41 |publisher=State of New Jersey |work=[[New Jersey Administrative Code]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064244/http://www.newjersey.gov/health/ems/documents/njac841r.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astna.org/documents/RoleoftheRNintheOut-of-HospitalEnvironment.pdf|title=ROLE OF THE REGISTERED NURSE IN THE OUT-OF-HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT|accessdate=2014-08-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226022006/http://www.astna.org/documents/RoleoftheRNintheOut-of-HospitalEnvironment.pdf|archivedate=2011-12-26}} Air & Transport Nurse Association, 2010.</ref>\n* [[Paramedic]] (''see [[Paramedics in the United States]]''): Paramedic is specialist health care provider, autonomous practitioner , providing advanced assessment and management skills, various invasive skills, and extensive pharmacology interventions, Paramedic is the highest level in EMS and its extension to the emergency physician .<ref>Coughlin, C., Ph.D. (2014).

This protocol helps ensure a consistent approach to the most common types of emergencies the EMS professional may encounter.  Medical Control may take place [[on-line]], with the EMS personnel having to contact the physician for direction [[delegation]] <!--would \"approval\" work better here?--> for all Advanced Life Support ([[ALS]]) procedures, or [[off-line]], with EMS personnel performing some or all of their ALS procedures on the basis of [[Medical guideline|protocols]] or 'standing orders'.\nThe NHTSA curriculum remains the Standard of Care for EMS organizations in the US.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n====Ambulances====\n<!--Images-->\n\nAmbulances in the United States are defined by federal KKK-1822 Standards requirements,<ref name=\"upton.ma.us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upton.ma.us/media/EMS/ambulanc_1_R2FI5H_0Z5RDZ-i34K-pR.pdf|title=U.S. General Services Administration website|accessdate=2008-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217022814/http://www.upton.ma.us/media/EMS/ambulanc_1_R2FI5H_0Z5RDZ-i34K-pR.pdf|archive-date=2012-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> which define several categories of ambulances. In addition, most states have additional requirements according to their individual needs. \n* Type I Ambulances are based on the chassis-cabs of light duty pickup-trucks,\n* Type II Ambulances are based on modern passenger/cargo vans, referred to in the industry as ''Vanbulances''.\n* Type III Ambulances are based on chassis-cabs of light duty vans,\n''AD'' (Additional Duty) versions of both Type I and Type III designs are also defined.  They include increased [[GVWR]], storage and payload capacity.\n\nLarge American cities like New York and Los Angeles tend to have many distinct ambulance services, each with its own paint scheme and using all of the ambulance types mentioned above. Pedestrians and drivers in such cities must be alert for ambulances of many shapes, sizes, and colors. Most ambulances certified for emergency response in the U.S. are marked with the [[Star of Life]] for ready identification by the public.\n<gallery caption=\"EMS in the United States\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:CARS 1.jpg|A typical '''Type I ambulance'''\nImage:Amrambulance.jpg|A typical '''Type II ambulance'''\nImage:SCFR Berea M12.JPG|A typical '''Type III ambulance'''\nImage:Nd-552.jpg|A typical '''Medium-Duty ambulance with commercial truck chassis'''\nImage:USMCAmbulance.jpg|A typical '''Military Ambulance (US) based on HMMWV chassis'''\nImage:St. Croix EMS Rescue Ambulance 5185.jpg|'''Medium-Duty combination Rescue/Ambulance'''\n\n</gallery>\n\nAmbulances may be supplemented or supported by vehicles that lack the capacity to transport a patient.<ref name=\"upton.ma.us\"/>  The most common of these vehicles is known by several names, including 'Response Car'. Response cars are often equipped with much of the same equipment carried by an ambulance, but, since they are [[SUV]]s or large cars, they are often faster and nimbler. Response cars are staffed by one or more medical providers, and are used variously as a source of additional (or more skilled) manpower, as a supervisor's vehicle, or as a first response vehicle, enabling medical treatment to begin before the arrival of the ambulance.\n<gallery caption=\"Support Vehicles in the United States\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:135trktrl01.jpg|Typical '''Heavy Rescue Unit'''\nImage:139new.jpg|A typical '''SUV-based Paramedic, known as a First Responder Unit, Chase car or [[Ambulance emergency response vehicle|Fly-car]]'''\n</gallery>\n\n===Dispatch===\nIn the United States, there are as many methods of dispatching EMS resources as there are approaches to providing EMS service.  In some larger communities, EMS may be self-dispatching.  Where EMS is operated as a division of the Police or Fire Departments, it will generally be dispatched by those organizations.  Dispatching may occur through state-licensed EMS dispatch centers, which are operated by one service but provide dispatch to several counties.  In large centers, such as New York City, the statutory EMS provider (in the case of NYC, the [[FDNY]]) will dispatch not only their own vehicles, but also EMS resources belonging to hospitals, private companies, and even volunteers, within their own community.  The [[emergency telephone number|national emergency number]] in the United States is [[9-1-1]].  The number works for all three emergency services.  In most cases, a 9-1-1 call will be answered at a central facility, usually referred to as a Public Safety Answering Point, and operated, in most cases, by the police.  The needs of the caller are identified, and the call is routed to the dispatcher for the emergency service(s) required.\n\nWhile some small communities continue to use 'low-tech' approaches to dispatch, in many places in the U.S. the technology is quite advanced.  Advanced technologies in use may include electronic mapping, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) or its first cousin [[Automatic vehicle location]] (AVL).  The use of decision support software<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mresnet.com/mresscreenshots.asp|title=MRES website|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> such as [[AMPDS]] is also common, as are [[surveillance]] 'add-ons'.  As a result, many dispatchers are trained to a high level in their own right, triaging incoming calls by severity, and providing advice or medical guidance by telephone prior to the arrival of the ambulance or rescue squad on the scene.

Individuals who live in rural areas far from emergency services also may expect a longer wait due to the distance involved.  This issue is further complicated by differing performance measurement methodologies. Some services count response time beginning at the moment that the telephone call is answered and running until an ambulance or response resource arrives at the scene, while others measure only the time from the notification of EMS personnel of the call, which is considerably shorter.  Another issue which arises in urban areas is that the response time 'clock' almost universally stops when the unit arrives in front of the address; in large office or apartment buildings, actually accessing the patient may take several minutes longer, but this is not considered in response time calculation or reporting.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Silverman RA, Galea S, Blaney S, Freese J, Prezant DJ, Park R, Pahk R, Caron D, Yoon S, Epstein J, Richmond NJ |title=The \"Vertical Response Time\": Barriers to Ambulance Response in an Urban Area|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|volume=14|pages=772\u2013778|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119819559/abstract|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110813181426/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119819559/abstract|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-08-13|pmid=17601996|year=2007|issue=9|doi=10.1197/j.aem.2007.04.016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|United_States}}\n*[[9-1-1]]\n*[[Ambulance]]\n*[[Certified first responder]]\n*[[List of EMS provider credentials]]\n*[[Emergency Medical Services]]\n*[[Emergency Medical Dispatcher]]\n*[[Emergency medical technician]]\n*[[Emergency medical responder levels by state]]\n*[[Emergency medicine]]\n*[[Paramedics in the United States]]\n*[[Paramedic]]\n*''[[The White Paper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.emsedsem.org/ctemsi/HISTORY%20OF%20EMERGENCY%20MEDICAL%20SERVICES.pdf History of Emergency Medical Services]\n*[http://www.roselandfirstaidsquad.org/HistoryofEMS.html HISTORY OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS)]\n* [http://www.nremt.org National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians]\n* [http://www.naemt.org National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians]\n* [http://www.nvfc.org/ems National Volunteer Fire Council - EMS/Rescue Section]\n* [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/menuitem.2a0771e91315babbbf30811060008a0c/ National Highway Traffic Safety Agency, Office of Emergency Medical Services]\n* [http://firstaid.about.com/od/emergencymedicalservices/qt/06_EMTBvsP.htm The Difference Between an EMT and a Paramedic]\n* [https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/03/01/389798498/how-pittsburghs-freedom-house-pioneered-paramedic-treatment How Pittsburgh's Freedom House Pioneered Paramedic Treatment]\n{{EMSworld}}\n\n[[Category:Emergency medical services in the United States| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Emergency medical services in the United States}}\n\n[[File:Darien_EMS-Post_53.JPG|thumb|right|325px|This medical services headquarters in [[Darien, Connecticut]] has an emergency vehicle outside ready to respond immediately in case of need.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], '''[[emergency medical services]]''' (EMS) provide out-of-hospital acute medical care and/or transport to definitive care for those in need. They are regulated at the most basic level by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ems.gov/whatisems.html|title=EMS.gov &#124; What is EMS?|website=www.ems.gov}}</ref>, which sets the minimum standards that all states' EMS providers must meet, and regulated more strictly by individual [[U.S. state|state]] governments, which often require higher standards from the services they oversee.\n\nWide differences in [[population density]], [[topography]], and other conditions can call for different types of EMS systems; consequently, there is often significant variation between the Emergency Medical Services provided in one state and those provided in another.\n\n==Organization and funding==\n\n===Land ambulance===\n\nEMS delivery in the US can be based on various [[prototype|model]]s.  While most services are, to some degree, publicly funded, the factor which often differentiates services is the manner in which they are operated. EMS systems may be directly operated by the community, or they may fall to a third-party provider, such as a [[private company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ems.gov/whatisems.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308110607/http://www.ems.gov/whatisems.htm |archivedate=2016-03-08 }}</ref> The most common operating models in the U.S. include:\n\n====Publicly operated EMS====\n\nIn one of the more common publicly operated models, an EMS system is operated directly by the municipality it services.  The services themselves may be provided by a local government, or may be the responsibility of the regional (or state) government.  Municipality-operated services may be funded by service fees and supplemented by [[property taxes]].  In many such cases, the EMS system is considered to be too small to operate independently, and is organized as a branch of another municipal department, such as the [[Public health|Public Health]] department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtyhd.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=20&Itemid=209&lang=en|title=Monterey County EMS|accessdate=2012-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001045749/http://www.mtyhd.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=20&Itemid=209&lang=en|archive-date=2012-10-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In small communities that lack a large population or tax-base, such a service may not be able to operate unless it is staffed by community [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monroeems.org/|title=Monroe Volunteer EMS website|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>  In these cases, the volunteer squad may receive some funding from municipal taxes, but is generally heavily reliant on voluntary [[donation]]s to cover operating expenses.  This provides a significant challenge for volunteer groups, since the [[training]] standards for staff must be met, and the vehicle and equipment standards adhered to, while the group does all or most of its own [[fundraising]].  Without the presence of dedicated volunteers, however, many small communities in America might be without local EMS systems and would either have no service at all or be forced to rely on service from more distant communities.\n\nAnother operating model for publicly operated EMS is what is generally referred to in the industry as the 'third service' option.  In this option, rather than being an integral part of (or in some cases, an 'add-on' to) one of the traditional 'emergency' services (fire and police), the service is organized as a separate, free-standing, [[Local government|municipal]] department, with organization that may be similar to, but operated independently from, either the fire or police departments,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.gov/government/ems/|title=New Orleans EMS|accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref> In a variant of this model, the EMS system may be recognized as a legitimate third emergency service, but provided under a [[contractual agreement]] with another organization, such as a private company or a hospital, instead of direct operation.  This model is sometimes referred to as the 'public utility' model.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jon R.

This integration may be partial or complete.  In the case of partial integration, the EMS staff may share quarters, administrative services, and even command and control with the other service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fdnyems.com/|title=FDNYEMS website|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>  In the case of full integration, the EMS staff may be fully cross-trained to perform the entry-level function of the other emergency service, whether [[firefighting]] or [[policing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mspaviation.org/frames.asp |title=Maryland State Police Aviation Command website |accessdate=2008-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004094925/http://www.mspaviation.org/frames.asp |archivedate=2008-10-04 }}</ref>  Many communities perceive this as providing 'added value' to the community, since municipal workers are fulfilling more than one function, and are less likely to be idle.\n\n====Private/for profit EMS====\n\nAmbulance services operating on a private/for profit basis have a long history in the U.S. Often, particularly in smaller communities, ambulance service was seen by the community as a lower priority than police or fire services, and certainly nothing that should require public funding. Until the professionalization of emergency medical services in the early 1970s, one of the most common providers of ambulance service in the United States was a community's local funeral home.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jon R. Krohmer |title=Principles Of Ems Systems |publisher=American College of Emergency Physicians |location= |year=2005 |pages=146|isbn=0-7637-3382-2 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> This occurred essentially by default, as hearses were the only vehicles at the time capable of transporting a person lying down. Funeral home ambulance operations were sometimes supplemented by 'mom and pop' operations, which were not affiliated with funeral homes but rather operated on much the same basis as a taxi service. There were no national standards for ambulance services and staff generally had little, if any, medical training or equipment, leading to a high pre-hospital mortality rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Such companies continue to operate this way in some locations, providing non-emergency transport services, fee-for-service emergency service,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardianambulance.org/ver_1.html|title=Guardian Ambulance Ltd. website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> or contracted emergency ambulance service to municipalities, as in the public utility model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencyambulance.com/main.html|title=Emergency Ambulance Service Ltd website|accessdate=2008-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027035037/http://www.emergencyambulance.com/main.html|archive-date=2008-10-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, more than 200 private ambulance companies in the U.S. were gradually merged into large regional companies, some of which continue to operate today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acadian.com/|title=Acadian Ambulance Company website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> As this trend continued, the result was a few remaining private companies, a handful of regional companies, and two very large multinational companies which currently dominate the entire industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amr.net/|title=American Medical Response website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralmetro.com/|title=Rural Metro Corporation website|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> These services continue to operate in some parts of the U.S., either on a fee-for-service basis to the patient, or by means of contracts with local municipalities.

In addition, it is not uncommon for U.S. military helicopters to be pressed into service providing air ambulance support.  The vast distances covered by the U.S. mean that while helicopters may be the preferred form of service delivery for 'on-scene' emergencies, [[fixed wing]] aircraft, including small [[Jet aircraft|jets]], are often used for transfers from rural hospitals to [[tertiary care]] sites.  These aircraft are typically staffed by a mix of personnel including [[physicians]], [[nurses]], and [[paramedics in the United States|paramedics]], and in some cases, by all three.  Publicly operated air ambulance service is supplemented by emergency and non-emergency air transport service, which may be provided by dedicated air ambulance companies, or by aircraft [[charter]] companies as a secondary business operation. 3\n<gallery caption=\"Air Ambulance in the United States\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:MCI Drill 2008 003.jpg|Training with LifeEvac II\nFile:Tn DSC01826.JPG|STAT MedEvac\nFile:Aircare.JPG|PHI AirMedical AirCare 2\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\nGrady [[ambulance]] service in the United States began in [[Atlanta]], Georgia in 1869. Grady Memorial Hospital staff rode in horse-drawn carriages designed specifically for transporting the sick and injured.\n\nThe first volunteer rescue squads organized around 1920 in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], [[Palmyra, New Jersey]], and along the [[New Jersey]] coast. Gradually, especially during and after World War II, hospitals and physicians faded from prehospital practice, yielding in urban areas to centrally coordinated programs. These were often controlled by the municipal hospital or fire department. Sporadically, funeral home hearses, which had been the common mode of transport, were being replaced by fire department, rescue squad, and private ambulances.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, ambulance service was largely unregulated. While some areas ambulances were staffed by advanced first-aid-level responders, in other areas, it was common for the local undertaker, having the only vehicles in town in which a person could lie down, to operate both the local furniture store (where he would make coffins as a sideline) and the local ambulance service.  However, after the release of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s study, \"Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society\", (known in the EMS trade as [[the White Paper]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaston SR |title=Accidental death and disability: the neglected disease of modern society.

The system was called the Division of Emergency Medical Services (now known as the ''[http://www.miemss.org/ Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services and Systems]''). Also in 1969, Cowley obtained a [[military]] helicopter to assist in rapidly transporting patients to the Center for the Study of Trauma (now known as the [[R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center]]), a specialized hospital that he had started for the purpose of treating [[hypovolemia|shock]]. This service was not only the first statewide EMS program, but also the beginning of modern emergency medical helicopter transport in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/shocktrauma/history.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224082924/http://www.umm.edu/shocktrauma/history.html|url-status=dead|title=History<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=December 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[civilian]] hospital-based medical helicopter program in the U.S., [[Flight For Life]] Colorado, began in 1972 with a single Alouette III [[helicopter]], based at St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver, Colorado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightforlifecolorado.org/index.php?s=5|title= Flight for Life Colorado website|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref>\n\nNational EMS standards for the US are determined by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and modified by each state's Department of EMS (usually under its [[Department of Health]]), and further altered by Regional Medical Advisory Committees (usually in rural areas) or by other committees, or even individual EMS providers.  In addition, the [http://www.nremt.org/ National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians], an independent body, was created in 1970 at the recommendation of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in an effort to provide a nationally accepted certification for providers and a nationwide consensus on protocols. Currently, National Registry certification is accepted in some parts of the U.S., while other areas still maintain their own, separate protocols and training curricula.\n\nA significant event in the development of modern standards of care in the U.S. was a report published in 1966 by the National Academy of Sciences entitled \"Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society\", commonly referred to as \"the White Paper.\" In this study, it became apparent that many of the deaths occurring every day were unnecessary, and could be prevented through a combination of community education, stricter safety standards, and better pre-hospital treatments.\n\nIn particular, in the US state of [[California]], in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state ([[Medic One]]), and in [[Miami]], projects began to include [[paramedics in the United States|paramedic]]s in the EMS responses in the early 1970s.  Groups in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] and [[Portland, Oregon]] were also early pioneers in pre-hospital emergency medical training.  Despite opposition from [[firefighters]] and doctors, the program eventually gained acceptance as its effectiveness became obvious.\n\nFurthermore, such programs became widely popularized around North America in the 1970s with the [[NBC]] television series, ''[[Emergency!]]''  which, in part, followed the adventures of two [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] paramedics as they responded to various types of [[medical emergency]].  [[James O. Page]] served as the series technical adviser and went on to become integral in the development of EMS in the U.S. The popularity of this series encouraged other communities to establish their own equivalent services.\n\n==Standards==\n\n===Staffing===\n\nAmbulances in the United States must be staffed with a minimum of 2 personnel. The level of crew certification varies depending on the jurisdiction the ambulance is operating in. In most areas, the bare minimum is an EMT to provide patient care and an EMR to assist and drive the unit. This set-up would be classified as a Basic Life Support Unit (BLS) due to the fact that the highest ranking provider cannot perform Advanced Life Support (ALS) interventions. If patient condition warrants, an ALS provider may be summoned to assist and meet the ambulance en route to the hospital. Other staffing combinations include one EMT and one paramedic (the most common arrangement), or two Paramedics, which are classified in most areas as an Advanced Life Support Unit (ALS). Unlike in Europe, Emergency Physicians do not regularly practice in the field, and only crew ambulances for specialty situations, such as extreme-low-weight infant transports, ECMO or cardiac bypass transports, or unusual situations such as crush injuries necessitating field amputation, or mass casualty/disaster situations.\n\n\n====Funding and manpower models====\nEMS is sometimes provided by volunteers. Agencies that were once strictly volunteer have begun supplementing their ranks with compensated members in order to keep up with booming call volumes. As of 2004, the largest \"Private Enterprise\" provider of contract EMS services in North America was [[American Medical Response]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amr.net/|title=AMR website|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> based in Greenwood Village, Colorado.  The second-largest US EMS provider is [[Rural Metro|Rural/Metro Corporation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralmetro.com/|title=Rural/Metro website|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> based in Scottsdale, Arizona; Rural/Metro Corporation also provides EMS services to parts of Latin America.  Like AMR, Rural/Metro provided other transportation services, such as non-emergency transport and \"coach\", or wheelchair, transportation. On October 28, 2015, AMR announced that it had finalized the acquisition of Rural/Metro, forming the largest EMS organization in the United States and employing nearly 25,000 individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.amr.net/ruralmetro|title = AMR & Rural/Metro Integration Planning Updates|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref>\n\nMany colleges and universities now also have their own EMS agencies.  Collegiate EMS programs vary somewhat from university to university; however, most agencies are fully staffed by student volunteers. Agencies might operate what is called a Quick Response Service (which does not transport patients but acts as a first responder to scenes) providing initial patient assessment and care, or they might operate certified ambulance services staffed with EMTs or Paramedics. Some groups limit services to within their campus, while others extend services to the surrounding community. Services provided by college and university agencies may include ambulance services, mass-casualty incident response, aero-medical services, and search-and-rescue teams.<ref name=\"will\">Will H, Jones KO, [http://www.collegehealth-e.org/3/n05.htm \"An Overview of Collegiate Emergency Medical Services.\"]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''collegehealth-e'', Issue 3 (June\u2013July 2006), pp. 13-14.

Unlike fire and police protection, which are recognize as an essential services by the Federal Government, it has been left to local governments to determine if emergency medical services are necessary for their communities. This lack of federal recognition as an essential service has left emergency medical services grossly underfunded throughout the United States, leading to service closures and gaps in coverage for citizens throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/in-rural-america-there-are-few-people-left-to-drive-the-ambulances|title=In Rural America, There Are Few People Left to Drive the Ambulances|first=Nathan|last=Kohrman|date=January 15, 2019|via=www.newyorker.com}}</ref>\n\n===Training and certification===\n''For a state specific list of qualification levels, see [[Emergency medical responder levels by U.S. state]]''\n[[Image:MS1 on stretcher.jpg|thumb|Arriving at hospital]]\nThe original lines that delineated an EMT from a Paramedic and a Paramedic from a doctor are becoming increasingly blurred{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

In addition to these variations, some states and counties allow for ''add-ons'', such as [[defibrillation]] or [[Intravenous therapy|IV therapy]], which enable workers at a lower level to learn and use additional skills that would not normally be within the [[scope of practice]] of their qualification level (for example, an EMT is not generally permitted to start an IV, but after successfully completing an IV add-on course, he or she would then be able to do so.) Add-on skills are generally more common in rural areas where definitive care is further away geographically and immediate interventions by EMTs are beneficial for patient care.\n\nA basic listing of qualification levels:\n*[[Emergency Medical Responder]] (EMR): EMRs, many of whom are volunteers, provide basic, immediate care including bleeding control, CPR, AED, and emergency childbirth. An EMR, with the help of an EMT, can assume care for a patient while that patient is being transported.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n*[[Emergency Medical Technician]] (EMT): EMT includes all EMR skills, advanced oxygen and ventilation skills, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and administration of certain medications.\n*[[Advanced Emergency Medical Technician]] (AEMT): AEMT includes all EMT skills, advanced airway devices, intravenous and intraosseous access, blood glucose monitoring, and administration of additional medications.\n*[[Registered Nurse]]: Some jurisdictions use specially trained nurses for pre-hospital services. These are mostly air-medical personnel or critical care transport providers with specialized training and experience in pre-hospital care. Such nurses are required by their employers to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing licensure and are often required to have three years (minimum) of full-time experience in emergency and/or intensive care. Certifications requirements vary but often include [[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS), [[basic life support]] (BLS), [[pediatric advanced life support]] (PALS), [[neonatal resuscitation program]] (NRP), [[trauma nursing core course]] (TNCC), and [[Advanced Trauma Life Support]] (ATLS), in addition to [[Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support]] (PHTLS). Standards also include being board certified in [[Emergency Nursing]] (CEN), [[Critical Care Nursing]] (CCRN), and Ground Transport (CTRN) or [[Flight Nursing]] (CFRN) respectively. These nurses are trained up to and able to operate at the level of a paramedic and in some regions are authorized to operate base station phones for medical command. Some states allow them to operate entirely under standing orders while on a ground ambulance or air medical unit (i.e. offline medical control). Training also includes specific education relevant to the state and its protocols, and often require the nurse to train with paramedics for a period of time as well as taking an additional exam administered by their medical director before being allowed to operate on a ground ambulance or air medical unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astna.org/documents/Continuing_Education_Rev2012_AB.pdf|title=Qualifications, Orientation, Competencies, and Continuing Education for Transport Nurses|accessdate=2014-08-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122153732/http://www.astna.org/documents/Continuing_Education_Rev2012_AB.pdf|archivedate=2015-01-22}} Air & Transport Nurse Association, 2012.</ref> Many of these nurses hold certifications as Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics, and in some states are required to, but it is not the standard of practice.<ref name=\"NJAC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newjersey.gov/health/ems/documents/njac841r.pdf |title=Advanced Life Support Services; Mobile Intensive Care Programs, Specialty Care Transport Services and Air Medical Services |accessdate=2010-01-04 |at=NJAC 8:41 |publisher=State of New Jersey |work=[[New Jersey Administrative Code]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064244/http://www.newjersey.gov/health/ems/documents/njac841r.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astna.org/documents/RoleoftheRNintheOut-of-HospitalEnvironment.pdf|title=ROLE OF THE REGISTERED NURSE IN THE OUT-OF-HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT|accessdate=2014-08-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226022006/http://www.astna.org/documents/RoleoftheRNintheOut-of-HospitalEnvironment.pdf|archivedate=2011-12-26}} Air & Transport Nurse Association, 2010.</ref>\n* [[Paramedic]] (''see [[Paramedics in the United States]]''): Paramedic is specialist health care provider, autonomous practitioner , providing advanced assessment and management skills, various invasive skills, and extensive pharmacology interventions, Paramedic is the highest level in EMS and its extension to the emergency physician .<ref>Coughlin, C., Ph.D. (2014).

This protocol helps ensure a consistent approach to the most common types of emergencies the EMS professional may encounter.  Medical Control may take place [[on-line]], with the EMS personnel having to contact the physician for direction [[delegation]] <!--would \"approval\" work better here?--> for all Advanced Life Support ([[ALS]]) procedures, or [[off-line]], with EMS personnel performing some or all of their ALS procedures on the basis of [[Medical guideline|protocols]] or 'standing orders'.\nThe NHTSA curriculum remains the Standard of Care for EMS organizations in the US.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n====Ambulances====\n<!--Images-->\n\nAmbulances in the United States are defined by federal KKK-1822 Standards requirements,<ref name=\"upton.ma.us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.upton.ma.us/media/EMS/ambulanc_1_R2FI5H_0Z5RDZ-i34K-pR.pdf|title=U.S. General Services Administration website|accessdate=2008-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217022814/http://www.upton.ma.us/media/EMS/ambulanc_1_R2FI5H_0Z5RDZ-i34K-pR.pdf|archive-date=2012-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> which define several categories of ambulances. In addition, most states have additional requirements according to their individual needs. \n* Type I Ambulances are based on the chassis-cabs of light duty pickup-trucks,\n* Type II Ambulances are based on modern passenger/cargo vans, referred to in the industry as ''Vanbulances''.\n* Type III Ambulances are based on chassis-cabs of light duty vans,\n''AD'' (Additional Duty) versions of both Type I and Type III designs are also defined.  They include increased [[GVWR]], storage and payload capacity.\n\nLarge American cities like New York and Los Angeles tend to have many distinct ambulance services, each with its own paint scheme and using all of the ambulance types mentioned above. Pedestrians and drivers in such cities must be alert for ambulances of many shapes, sizes, and colors. Most ambulances certified for emergency response in the U.S. are marked with the [[Star of Life]] for ready identification by the public.\n<gallery caption=\"EMS in the United States\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:CARS 1.jpg|A typical '''Type I ambulance'''\nImage:Amrambulance.jpg|A typical '''Type II ambulance'''\nImage:SCFR Berea M12.JPG|A typical '''Type III ambulance'''\nImage:Nd-552.jpg|A typical '''Medium-Duty ambulance with commercial truck chassis'''\nImage:USMCAmbulance.jpg|A typical '''Military Ambulance (US) based on HMMWV chassis'''\nImage:St. Croix EMS Rescue Ambulance 5185.jpg|'''Medium-Duty combination Rescue/Ambulance'''\n\n</gallery>\n\nAmbulances may be supplemented or supported by vehicles that lack the capacity to transport a patient.<ref name=\"upton.ma.us\"/>  The most common of these vehicles is known by several names, including 'Response Car'. Response cars are often equipped with much of the same equipment carried by an ambulance, but, since they are [[SUV]]s or large cars, they are often faster and nimbler. Response cars are staffed by one or more medical providers, and are used variously as a source of additional (or more skilled) manpower, as a supervisor's vehicle, or as a first response vehicle, enabling medical treatment to begin before the arrival of the ambulance.\n<gallery caption=\"Support Vehicles in the United States\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:135trktrl01.jpg|Typical '''Heavy Rescue Unit'''\nImage:139new.jpg|A typical '''SUV-based Paramedic, known as a First Responder Unit, Chase car or [[Ambulance emergency response vehicle|Fly-car]]'''\n</gallery>\n\n===Dispatch===\nIn the United States, there are as many methods of dispatching EMS resources as there are approaches to providing EMS service.  In some larger communities, EMS may be self-dispatching.  Where EMS is operated as a division of the Police or Fire Departments, it will generally be dispatched by those organizations.  Dispatching may occur through state-licensed EMS dispatch centers, which are operated by one service but provide dispatch to several counties.  In large centers, such as New York City, the statutory EMS provider (in the case of NYC, the [[FDNY]]) will dispatch not only their own vehicles, but also EMS resources belonging to hospitals, private companies, and even volunteers, within their own community.  The [[emergency telephone number|national emergency number]] in the United States is [[9-1-1]].  The number works for all three emergency services.  In most cases, a 9-1-1 call will be answered at a central facility, usually referred to as a Public Safety Answering Point, and operated, in most cases, by the police.  The needs of the caller are identified, and the call is routed to the dispatcher for the emergency service(s) required.\n\nWhile some small communities continue to use 'low-tech' approaches to dispatch, in many places in the U.S. the technology is quite advanced.  Advanced technologies in use may include electronic mapping, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) or its first cousin [[Automatic vehicle location]] (AVL).  The use of decision support software<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mresnet.com/mresscreenshots.asp|title=MRES website|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> such as [[AMPDS]] is also common, as are [[surveillance]] 'add-ons'.  As a result, many dispatchers are trained to a high level in their own right, triaging incoming calls by severity, and providing advice or medical guidance by telephone prior to the arrival of the ambulance or rescue squad on the scene.  Some are certified as EMTs or paramedics in their own states, and increasingly, are becoming certified as [[Emergency Medical Dispatchers]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kuehl, Alexander |title=Prehospital systems and medical oversight |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub |location=Dubugue, Iowa |year=2002 |pages=192 |isbn=0-7872-7071-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Response times===\nThere is no official Federal or State standard for response times in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicsafety.com/article/article.jsp?id=2255&siteSection=5|title=EMS Response Time Standards (article) 1|accessdate=2008-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328230914/http://publicsafety.com/article/article.jsp?id=2255&siteSection=5|archive-date=2009-03-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> Response time standards frequently do exist in the form of contractual obligations between communities and EMS provider organizations, however.

Individuals who live in rural areas far from emergency services also may expect a longer wait due to the distance involved.  This issue is further complicated by differing performance measurement methodologies. Some services count response time beginning at the moment that the telephone call is answered and running until an ambulance or response resource arrives at the scene, while others measure only the time from the notification of EMS personnel of the call, which is considerably shorter.  Another issue which arises in urban areas is that the response time 'clock' almost universally stops when the unit arrives in front of the address; in large office or apartment buildings, actually accessing the patient may take several minutes longer, but this is not considered in response time calculation or reporting.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Silverman RA, Galea S, Blaney S, Freese J, Prezant DJ, Park R, Pahk R, Caron D, Yoon S, Epstein J, Richmond NJ |title=The \"Vertical Response Time\": Barriers to Ambulance Response in an Urban Area|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|volume=14|pages=772\u2013778|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119819559/abstract|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110813181426/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119819559/abstract|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-08-13|pmid=17601996|year=2007|issue=9|doi=10.1197/j.aem.2007.04.016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|United_States}}\n*[[9-1-1]]\n*[[Ambulance]]\n*[[Certified first responder]]\n*[[List of EMS provider credentials]]\n*[[Emergency Medical Services]]\n*[[Emergency Medical Dispatcher]]\n*[[Emergency medical technician]]\n*[[Emergency medical responder levels by state]]\n*[[Emergency medicine]]\n*[[Paramedics in the United States]]\n*[[Paramedic]]\n*''[[The White Paper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.emsedsem.org/ctemsi/HISTORY%20OF%20EMERGENCY%20MEDICAL%20SERVICES.pdf History of Emergency Medical Services]\n*[http://www.roselandfirstaidsquad.org/HistoryofEMS.html HISTORY OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS)]\n* [http://www.nremt.org National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians]\n* [http://www.naemt.org National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians]\n* [http://www.nvfc.org/ems National Volunteer Fire Council - EMS/Rescue Section]\n* [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/menuitem.2a0771e91315babbbf30811060008a0c/ National Highway Traffic Safety Agency, Office of Emergency Medical Services]\n* [http://firstaid.about.com/od/emergencymedicalservices/qt/06_EMTBvsP.htm The Difference Between an EMT and a Paramedic]\n* [https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/03/01/389798498/how-pittsburghs-freedom-house-pioneered-paramedic-treatment How Pittsburgh's Freedom House Pioneered Paramedic Treatment]\n{{EMSworld}}\n\n[[Category:Emergency medical services in the United States| ]]\n", "name_user": "\u041a\u0438\u0430\u043d", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStandards", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services_in_the_United_States"}
