The [[Ay kingdom]] in the deep south and the [[Ezhimala kingdom]] in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the [[Common Era]] (CE or AD). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000&nbsp;BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of [[Pliny the elder|Pliny]] as well as the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus]] around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the [[spice trade]] attracted [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders to Kerala, and paved the way for [[Colonial India|European colonisation]] of India. At the time of [[Indian independence movement]] in the early 20th century, there were two major [[princely states]] in Kerala-[[Travancore State]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin]]. They united to form the state of [[Thiru-Kochi]] in 1949. The [[Malabar region]], in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the [[Madras province]] of [[British India]], which later became a part of the [[Madras State]] post-independence. After the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]], the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the [[Malabar district]] of [[Madras State]] (excluding [[Gudalur taluk]] of [[The Nilgiris District|Nilgiris district]], [[Topslip]],  the [[Attappadi]] Forest east of Anakatti), the state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of [[Kanyakumari district]], Shenkottai and Tenkasi taluks), and the taluk of [[Kasaragod]] (now [[Kasaragod District]]) in [[South Canara]] ([[Tulunad]]) which was a part of Madras State.\n\nThe [[economy of Kerala]] is the [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP|11th-largest state economy]] in India with {{INRConvert|8.76|t}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GDP of {{INRConvert|199|k}}.<ref name=\"KER\"/><ref name=\"Kerala_ESOPB\">{{cite web |title=State Wise Data |url=http://www.esopb.gov.in/Static/PDF/GSDP/Statewise-Data/StateWiseData.pdf |website=esopb.gov.in |publisher=Economic and Statistical Organization, Government of Punjab |accessdate=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630122203/http://esopb.gov.in/Static/PDF/GSDP/Statewise-Data/statewisedata.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in [[India]], 3.44%; the highest [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest [[literacy]] rate, 93.91% in the 2011 census; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men.

This claim and M\u0101dhava's achievements were ignored by Western historians, presumably at first because they could not admit that an Indian discovered the calculus, but later because no one read any more the ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society'', in which Whish's article was published. The matter resurfaced in the 1950s, and now we have the Sanskrit texts properly edited, and we understand the clever way that M\u0101dhava derived the series ''without'' the calculus; but many historians still find it impossible to conceive of the problem and its solution in terms of anything other than the calculus and proclaim that the calculus is what M\u0101dhava found. In this case the elegance and brilliance of M\u0101dhava's mathematics are being distorted as they are buried under the current mathematical solution to a problem to which he discovered an alternate and powerful solution. |bibcode=1992Isis...83..554P}}</ref> In the early decades of the 19th century, the modern educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the [[Church Mission Society]] missionaries to promote mass education.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Missionaries led State to renaissance: Pinarayi |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Missionaries-led-State-to-renaissance-Pinarayi/article16444369.ece |quote=Inaugurating on Saturday the valedictory of the bicentenary celebration of the arrival of Church Mission Society (CMS) missionaries to the shores of Kerala, Mr. Vijayan said it was their pioneering work in the fields of education, literature, printing, publishing, women\u2019s education, education of the differently abled and, in general, a new social approach through the inclusion of marginalised sections into the mainstream which brought the idea of \u2018equality\u2019 into the realm of public consciousness.

The [[Ay kingdom]] in the deep south and the [[Ezhimala kingdom]] in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the [[Common Era]] (CE or AD). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000&nbsp;BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of [[Pliny the elder|Pliny]] as well as the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus]] around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the [[spice trade]] attracted [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders to Kerala, and paved the way for [[Colonial India|European colonisation]] of India. At the time of [[Indian independence movement]] in the early 20th century, there were two major [[princely states]] in Kerala-[[Travancore State]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin]]. They united to form the state of [[Thiru-Kochi]] in 1949. The [[Malabar region]], in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the [[Madras province]] of [[British India]], which later became a part of the [[Madras State]] post-independence. After the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]], the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the [[Malabar district]] of [[Madras State]] (excluding [[Gudalur taluk]] of [[The Nilgiris District|Nilgiris district]], [[Topslip]],  the [[Attappadi]] Forest east of Anakatti), the state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of [[Kanyakumari district]], Shenkottai and Tenkasi taluks), and the taluk of [[Kasaragod]] (now [[Kasaragod District]]) in [[South Canara]] ([[Tulunad]]) which was a part of Madras State.\n\nThe [[economy of Kerala]] is the [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP|11th-largest state economy]] in India with {{INRConvert|8.76|t}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GDP of {{INRConvert|199|k}}.<ref name=\"KER\"/><ref name=\"Kerala_ESOPB\">{{cite web |title=State Wise Data |url=http://www.esopb.gov.in/Static/PDF/GSDP/Statewise-Data/StateWiseData.pdf |website=esopb.gov.in |publisher=Economic and Statistical Organization, Government of Punjab |accessdate=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630122203/http://esopb.gov.in/Static/PDF/GSDP/Statewise-Data/statewisedata.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in [[India]], 3.44%; the highest [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest [[literacy]] rate, 93.91% in the 2011 census; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men.

This claim and M\u0101dhava's achievements were ignored by Western historians, presumably at first because they could not admit that an Indian discovered the calculus, but later because no one read any more the ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society'', in which Whish's article was published. The matter resurfaced in the 1950s, and now we have the Sanskrit texts properly edited, and we understand the clever way that M\u0101dhava derived the series ''without'' the calculus; but many historians still find it impossible to conceive of the problem and its solution in terms of anything other than the calculus and proclaim that the calculus is what M\u0101dhava found. In this case the elegance and brilliance of M\u0101dhava's mathematics are being distorted as they are buried under the current mathematical solution to a problem to which he discovered an alternate and powerful solution. |bibcode=1992Isis...83..554P}}</ref> In the early decades of the 19th century, the modern educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the [[Church Mission Society]] missionaries to promote mass education.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Missionaries led State to renaissance: Pinarayi |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/Missionaries-led-State-to-renaissance-Pinarayi/article16444369.ece |quote=Inaugurating on Saturday the valedictory of the bicentenary celebration of the arrival of Church Mission Society (CMS) missionaries to the shores of Kerala, Mr. Vijayan said it was their pioneering work in the fields of education, literature, printing, publishing, women\u2019s education, education of the differently abled and, in general, a new social approach through the inclusion of marginalised sections into the mainstream which brought the idea of \u2018equality\u2019 into the realm of public consciousness.
