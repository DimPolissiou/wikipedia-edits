He is best known for producing and directing drama films about [[social problem film|social problems]], such as ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'', ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', and ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''. His first attempt at directing a comedy film paid off immensely as ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' became a critical and commercial success in 1963 and was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and two [[Golden Globe Awards]].\n\nDespite this, the film suffered severe cuts by its distributor [[United Artists]] in order to give the film a shorter running time for its general release. The footage was excised against Kramer's wishes. On October 15, 2013, however, it was announced that [[the Criterion Collection]] had collaborated with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], United Artists, and film restoration expert [[Robert A. Harris]] to reconstruct and restore ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' to be as close as possible to the original 197-minute version envisioned by Kramer.

Five motorists stop to help him:  Melville Crump, a dentist; Lennie Pike, a furniture mover; Ding Bell and Benjy Benjamin, two friends on their way to Las Vegas; and J. Russell Finch, a business owner.  Just before he dies, Grogan tells them about $350,000 buried in Santa Rosita State Park under \"a big W.\"\n\nThe motorists initially decide to share the money, but it soon becomes a race to get to the money first.  Unbeknownst to them, Captain Culpeper, Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department, has been working on the Smiler Grogan case for years, hoping to solve it and retire.  \nWhen Culpeper learns of the crash, he suspects that Grogan tipped off the passersby, so he has them tracked.\n\nEveryone experiences setbacks on the way to the money.  Crump and his wife Monica charter a biplane to take them to Santa Rosita but are \ninadvertently locked in a hardware store's basement and eventually free themselves with dynamite.\n\nBell and Benjamin charter a modern plane, but when their alcoholic pilot knocks himself out, they have to land the plane themselves.\n\nFinch, his wife Emmeline, and his loud and obnoxious mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus, are involved in a car accident with Pike's furniture van.  The three persuade British Army Lieutenant Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne to drive them to Santa Rosita.  After many arguments, Mrs. Marcus and Emmeline refuse to go any farther, and Finch and Hawthorne leave them behind.\n\nPike tries to get motorist Otto Meyer to take him to Santa Rosita, but instead Meyer leaves Pike stranded with only a little girl's bike from his furniture van.  Pike catches up with Meyer at a gas station, where the station's owners try to stop Pike from assaulting Meyer.  Meyer escapes in his car, while Pike destroys the gas station, steals the station's tow truck, and in it pursues Meyer.  Failing to catch Meyer, Pike meets up with Mrs. Marcus and Emmeline and picks them up.  Mrs. Marcus calls her dim-witted son Sylvester, who lives near Santa Rosita, to get the money, but, believing his mother is in trouble, Sylvester instead races in his car to her.\n\nMeyer experiences his own setbacks, including sinking his car in the Kern River and nearly drowning.  Meyer then steals a car.  All the while, Culpeper watches from afar.  Two taxi drivers join the chase.\n\nEveryone reaches Santa Rosita State Park at about the same time and searches for the big W.  Culpeper orders all police to leave the area and goes in solo.  Emmeline, who wants no part of the money, spots the big W first:  four palm trees in the shape of the letter.  Pike finds it next and informs everyone else.  After the money is dug up, Culpeper identifies himself and talks the group into turning itself in, promising a jury will be more lenient if it does.\n\nCulpeper takes the money and heads for Mexico.  The group realizes what is happening and gives chase in the two cabs.  When the chase becomes a foot pursuit, Chief Aloysius, who had blackmailed the mayor into tripling Culpeper's small pension, tears up the pension papers and orders Culpeper's arrest.\n\nAfter a long chase, all eleven men end up stranded on the fire escape of a condemned office building.  The suitcase containing the money opens, and the money falls onto the streets below, where passersby collect it.  The men try to climb down a fire truck's ladder, but their combined weight causes the ladder to swing around wildly and fling them off, causing many injuries.\n\nThe hospitalized group, in various stages of traction, criticizes Culpeper for taking the money.  Culpeper muses that it will be a long time before he can laugh at anything again.  Mrs. Marcus, flanked by Emmeline and Monica, enters, berates everyone, then slips on a banana peel.  All the men, including Culpeper, laugh hysterically.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Principal cast===\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Captain T.G. Culpeper\n* [[Edie Adams]] as Monica Crump\n* [[Milton Berle]] as J.

Skelton was unable to take much time off from [[The Red Skelton Show|his television series]], and thus agreed to only make a cameo appearance in the film. However, his demands for a high salary led to [[Stanley Kramer]]'s turning him down. [[Lucille Ball]], [[Martha Raye]], [[Joan Davis]], and [[Imogene Coca]] were suggested as the men's female companions. [[Sophie Tucker]] and [[Mae West]] were both suggested for the role of [[Milton Berle]]'s mother-in-law, which went to Merman. Rose wanted [[Jack Benny]] to play the role of the detective monitoring the group throughout the film. The role of Smiler Grogan originally was intended for [[Buster Keaton]].\n\nAccording to Paul Scrabo, [[Paul Picerni]] originally was cast as the second detective at Smiler Grogan's crash site. Picerni was unable to appear in the film, but he recommended fellow ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|Untouchables]]'' character [[Nicholas Georgiade]] for the role. According to Georgiade, he was to have another scene in which his character had a police radio conversation with [[Spencer Tracy]]'s Culpeper character. The scene ultimately was not filmed. An early cast list indicated that [[Jerry Lewis]]' role originally was intended for [[Jack Paar]]. According to Michael Schlesinger, the role of Algernon Hawthorne was meant for [[Peter Sellers]], who demanded too much money and was thus replaced by [[Terry-Thomas]].\n \nAccording to Robert Davidson,<ref name=Davidson>{{cite web |url=http://threestooges.net/filmography/episode/233 |title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Cast Members |first=Robert |last=Davidson |publisher=The Three Stooges Online Filmography |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> the role of Irwin originally was offered to [[Joe Besser]], who was unable to participate when [[Sheldon Leonard]] and [[Danny Thomas]] could not give him time off from his co-starring role in ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''. According to the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', [[Jackie Mason]] then was cast in the role of Irwin, but had to bow out because of his nightclub commitments. The role ultimately went to [[Marvin Kaplan]]. According to Mark Evanier, [[Bob Hope]] was to have a cameo in the film. During the production of ''Mad World'', Hope was arguing with the studio about the future projects that he was due in his contract, and they ultimately refused to allow him to appear. Further telephone conversations in Captain Culpeper's office were scripted and filmed but ultimately removed before the film's premiere. Culpeper was to be disturbed by a \"Dr. Chadwick\" and by an \"Uncle Mike\", in addition to his wife and daughter. The roles were played by [[Elliott Reid]] and [[Morey Amsterdam]] respectively.\n\nActress Eve Bruce filmed a scene as a showgirl who asks Benjy Benjamin and Ding Bell to help her put on suntan lotion. The scene was cut, and she is uncredited. [[Cliff Norton]] is listed in the opening credits, but is nowhere to be found in the film. Norton had a role as a detective who appears at the Rancho Conejo airport. [[King Donovan]], playing an airport official, also appeared in the Rancho Conejo scenes but was cut from the film. [[Don Knotts]] originally shot a second scene in which he tries to use a telephone in a diner. Also featured in the scene was [[Barbara Pepper]].<ref name=\"Lost\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\nIn the early 1960s, screenwriter [[William Rose (screenwriter)|William Rose]], then living in the United Kingdom, conceived the idea for a film (provisionally titled ''So Many Thieves'', and later ''Something a Little Less Serious'') about a comedic chase through Scotland. He sent an outline to Kramer, who agreed to produce and direct the film. The setting was shifted to America, and the working title changed to ''Where, but in America?'' then ''One Damn Thing After Another'' and then ''It's a Mad World'', with Rose and Kramer adding additional ''Mad''s to the title as time progressed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=9069&s=Features| title=Behind the Mad-ness&nbsp;\u2014 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World| website=Urban Cinephile| date=July 1, 2004| accessdate=September 2, 2009}}</ref> Kramer considered adding a fifth \"mad\" to the title before deciding it was redundant but noted in interviews that he later regretted it.\n\nAlthough well known for serious films such as ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' and ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (both starring Tracy), Kramer set out to make the ultimate comedy film. Filmed in [[Ultra Panavision 70]] and presented in [[Cinerama]] (becoming one of the early single-camera Cinerama features produced), ''Mad World'' had an all-star cast, with dozens of major comedy stars from all eras of cinema appearing in it. The film followed a Hollywood trend in the 1960s of producing \"epic\" films as a way of wooing audiences away from television and back to movie theaters. The film's theme music was written by [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]] with lyrics by [[Mack David]]. Kramer hosted a roundtable (including extensive clips) on the film with stars Caesar, Hackett and Winters as part of a special ''The Comedians, Stanley Kramer's Reunion with the Great Comedy Artists of Our Time'' broadcast in 1974 as part of ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/stanley-kramer-collection| title=Stanley Kramer Collection| website=UCLA Film & Television Archive| accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref> The last reported showing of the film on major network television was on ABC on July 16, 1979,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19790711&id=pJUiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3qkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1557,1848829| title='Mad World' Repeats| newspaper=[[The Item|The Daily Item]]| location=Sumter, South Carolina| date=July 16, 1979| page=6B| accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> and before that, on CBS on May 16, 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66#v=onepage| title=Television| magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]| page=66| date=May 18, 1978| accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n{{Refimprove section|date= December 2015}}\n\nThe airport terminal scenes were filmed at the now-defunct Rancho Conejo Airport in Newbury Park, California, though the control tower shown was constructed only for filming. Other airplane sequences were filmed at the Sonoma County Airport north of Santa Rosa, California; at the Palm Springs International Airport; and in the skies above Thousand Oaks, California; Camarillo, California; and Orange County, California. In the Orange County scene, stuntman [[Frank Tallman]] flew a [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beech model C-18S]] through a highway billboard advertising [[Coca-Cola]]. A communications mix-up resulted in the use of linen graphic sheets on the sign rather than paper, as planned. Linen, much tougher than paper, damaged the plane on impact.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Tallman managed to fly it back to the airstrip, discovering that the leading edges of the wings had been smashed all the way back to the wing spars. Tallman considered that incident the closest he ever came to dying on film. (Both Tallman and  [[Paul Mantz]], Tallman's business partner and fellow flier on ''Mad World'', eventually died in separate air crashes over a decade apart.)<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-22/local/me-274_1_professional-pilot| title=Pilot Told of Bad Weather, FAA Says of Crash Killing 10| first1=Eric| last1=Malnic| first2=Louis| last2=Sahagun| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=February 22, 1989| accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://airportjournals.com/paul-mantz-and-the-last-flight-of-the-phoenix/| title=Paul Mantz and the Last Flight of the Phoenix| first=Henry M.| last=Holden| journal=Airport Journals| date=September 1, 2004| accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mad1.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The hangar is at the [[Charles M.

(The original Cinerama process filmed scenes with three separate cameras. The three processed reels were projected by three electronically synchronized projectors onto a huge curved screen.) It originally was planned for three-camera Cinerama, and some reports state that initial filming was done using three cameras but was abandoned. One-camera Cinerama could be Super Panavision 70 or Ultra Panavision 70, which was essentially the [[Super Panavision 70]] process with anamorphic compression at the edges of the image to give a much wider aspect ratio.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} When projected by one projector, the expanded 70mm image filled the wide Cinerama screen. [[Ultra Panavision 70]] was used to film ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''. Other films shot in Ultra Panavision 70 and released in Cinerama include ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', ''[[The Hallelujah Trail]]'', ''[[Battle of the Bulge (1965 film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'', and ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]''. Super Panavision 70 films released in Cinerama include ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Animated credit sequence===\nKramer's comedy was accentuated by many things, including the opening animated credits designed by [[Saul Bass]]. The film begins with mention of Spencer Tracy, then the \"in alphabetical order\" mention of nine of the main cast (Berle, Caesar, Hackett, Merman, Rooney, Shawn, Silvers, Terry-Thomas, Winters), followed by hands switching these nine names two to three times over. Animation continues with paper dolls and a windup toy world spinning with several men hanging on to it and finishing with a man opening a door to the globe and getting trampled by a mad crowd. One of the animators who helped with the sequence was future ''[[Peanuts]]'' animator [[Bill Melendez]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) - Roadshow Trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=27|right|Original roadshow [[teaser trailer]] for ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''.]]\n\nThe film opened at the newly built [[Cinerama Dome]] in Los Angeles on November 7, 1963.

It premiered on November 7, 1963.<ref name=\"WVrev\">{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1962/film/reviews/it-s-a-mad-mad-mad-mad-world-1200420392/| title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World| newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=November 6, 1963| page=6}}</ref> The cast features [[Edie Adams]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Buddy Hackett]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Terry-Thomas]], and [[Jonathan Winters]].\n\nThe film marked the first time Kramer directed a comedy, though he had produced the comedy ''[[So This Is New York]]'' in 1948. He is best known for producing and directing drama films about [[social problem film|social problems]], such as ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'', ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', and ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''. His first attempt at directing a comedy film paid off immensely as ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' became a critical and commercial success in 1963 and was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and two [[Golden Globe Awards]].\n\nDespite this, the film suffered severe cuts by its distributor [[United Artists]] in order to give the film a shorter running time for its general release. The footage was excised against Kramer's wishes. On October 15, 2013, however, it was announced that [[the Criterion Collection]] had collaborated with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], United Artists, and film restoration expert [[Robert A. Harris]] to reconstruct and restore ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' to be as close as possible to the original 197-minute version envisioned by Kramer. It was released in a five-disc \"Dual Format\" Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack on January 21, 2014.<ref>{{cite web| title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World as 197-Min Cut| url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/news.php?ID=6261| publisher=Movie-Censorship| date=October 25, 2013| accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name=criterion>{{cite web| url=http://www.criterion.com/films/28579-it-s-a-mad-mad-mad-mad-world| title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963)| publisher=The Criterion Collection| accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' featured at number 40 in the [[American Film Institute]]'s list [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years{{nbsp}}... 100 Laughs]].\n\n==Plot==\n\"Smiler\" Grogan, a just-released convict jailed for robbery 15 years earlier and fleeing police surveillance, crashes off [[California State Route 74]].  Five motorists stop to help him:  Melville Crump, a dentist; Lennie Pike, a furniture mover; Ding Bell and Benjy Benjamin, two friends on their way to Las Vegas; and J. Russell Finch, a business owner.  Just before he dies, Grogan tells them about $350,000 buried in Santa Rosita State Park under \"a big W.\"\n\nThe motorists initially decide to share the money, but it soon becomes a race to get to the money first.  Unbeknownst to them, Captain Culpeper, Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department, has been working on the Smiler Grogan case for years, hoping to solve it and retire.  \nWhen Culpeper learns of the crash, he suspects that Grogan tipped off the passersby, so he has them tracked.\n\nEveryone experiences setbacks on the way to the money.  Crump and his wife Monica charter a biplane to take them to Santa Rosita but are \ninadvertently locked in a hardware store's basement and eventually free themselves with dynamite.\n\nBell and Benjamin charter a modern plane, but when their alcoholic pilot knocks himself out, they have to land the plane themselves.\n\nFinch, his wife Emmeline, and his loud and obnoxious mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus, are involved in a car accident with Pike's furniture van.  The three persuade British Army Lieutenant Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne to drive them to Santa Rosita.  After many arguments, Mrs. Marcus and Emmeline refuse to go any farther, and Finch and Hawthorne leave them behind.\n\nPike tries to get motorist Otto Meyer to take him to Santa Rosita, but instead Meyer leaves Pike stranded with only a little girl's bike from his furniture van.  Pike catches up with Meyer at a gas station, where the station's owners try to stop Pike from assaulting Meyer.  Meyer escapes in his car, while Pike destroys the gas station, steals the station's tow truck, and in it pursues Meyer.  Failing to catch Meyer, Pike meets up with Mrs. Marcus and Emmeline and picks them up.  Mrs. Marcus calls her dim-witted son Sylvester, who lives near Santa Rosita, to get the money, but, believing his mother is in trouble, Sylvester instead races in his car to her.\n\nMeyer experiences his own setbacks, including sinking his car in the Kern River and nearly drowning.  Meyer then steals a car.  All the while, Culpeper watches from afar.  Two taxi drivers join the chase.\n\nEveryone reaches Santa Rosita State Park at about the same time and searches for the big W.  Culpeper orders all police to leave the area and goes in solo.  Emmeline, who wants no part of the money, spots the big W first:  four palm trees in the shape of the letter.  Pike finds it next and informs everyone else.  After the money is dug up, Culpeper identifies himself and talks the group into turning itself in, promising a jury will be more lenient if it does.\n\nCulpeper takes the money and heads for Mexico.  The group realizes what is happening and gives chase in the two cabs.  When the chase becomes a foot pursuit, Chief Aloysius, who had blackmailed the mayor into tripling Culpeper's small pension, tears up the pension papers and orders Culpeper's arrest.\n\nAfter a long chase, all eleven men end up stranded on the fire escape of a condemned office building.  The suitcase containing the money opens, and the money falls onto the streets below, where passersby collect it.  The men try to climb down a fire truck's ladder, but their combined weight causes the ladder to swing around wildly and fling them off, causing many injuries.\n\nThe hospitalized group, in various stages of traction, criticizes Culpeper for taking the money.  Culpeper muses that it will be a long time before he can laugh at anything again.  Mrs. Marcus, flanked by Emmeline and Monica, enters, berates everyone, then slips on a banana peel.  All the men, including Culpeper, laugh hysterically.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Principal cast===\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Captain T.G. Culpeper\n* [[Edie Adams]] as Monica Crump\n* [[Milton Berle]] as J.

Skelton was unable to take much time off from [[The Red Skelton Show|his television series]], and thus agreed to only make a cameo appearance in the film. However, his demands for a high salary led to [[Stanley Kramer]]'s turning him down. [[Lucille Ball]], [[Martha Raye]], [[Joan Davis]], and [[Imogene Coca]] were suggested as the men's female companions. [[Sophie Tucker]] and [[Mae West]] were both suggested for the role of [[Milton Berle]]'s mother-in-law, which went to Merman. Rose wanted [[Jack Benny]] to play the role of the detective monitoring the group throughout the film. The role of Smiler Grogan originally was intended for [[Buster Keaton]].\n\nAccording to Paul Scrabo, [[Paul Picerni]] originally was cast as the second detective at Smiler Grogan's crash site. Picerni was unable to appear in the film, but he recommended fellow ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|Untouchables]]'' character [[Nicholas Georgiade]] for the role. According to Georgiade, he was to have another scene in which his character had a police radio conversation with [[Spencer Tracy]]'s Culpeper character. The scene ultimately was not filmed. An early cast list indicated that [[Jerry Lewis]]' role originally was intended for [[Jack Paar]]. According to Michael Schlesinger, the role of Algernon Hawthorne was meant for [[Peter Sellers]], who demanded too much money and was thus replaced by [[Terry-Thomas]].\n \nAccording to Robert Davidson,<ref name=Davidson>{{cite web |url=http://threestooges.net/filmography/episode/233 |title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Cast Members |first=Robert |last=Davidson |publisher=The Three Stooges Online Filmography |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> the role of Irwin originally was offered to [[Joe Besser]], who was unable to participate when [[Sheldon Leonard]] and [[Danny Thomas]] could not give him time off from his co-starring role in ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''. According to the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', [[Jackie Mason]] then was cast in the role of Irwin, but had to bow out because of his nightclub commitments. The role ultimately went to [[Marvin Kaplan]]. According to Mark Evanier, [[Bob Hope]] was to have a cameo in the film. During the production of ''Mad World'', Hope was arguing with the studio about the future projects that he was due in his contract, and they ultimately refused to allow him to appear. Further telephone conversations in Captain Culpeper's office were scripted and filmed but ultimately removed before the film's premiere. Culpeper was to be disturbed by a \"Dr. Chadwick\" and by an \"Uncle Mike\", in addition to his wife and daughter. The roles were played by [[Elliott Reid]] and [[Morey Amsterdam]] respectively.\n\nActress Eve Bruce filmed a scene as a showgirl who asks Benjy Benjamin and Ding Bell to help her put on suntan lotion. The scene was cut, and she is uncredited. [[Cliff Norton]] is listed in the opening credits, but is nowhere to be found in the film. Norton had a role as a detective who appears at the Rancho Conejo airport. [[King Donovan]], playing an airport official, also appeared in the Rancho Conejo scenes but was cut from the film. [[Don Knotts]] originally shot a second scene in which he tries to use a telephone in a diner. Also featured in the scene was [[Barbara Pepper]].<ref name=\"Lost\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\nIn the early 1960s, screenwriter [[William Rose (screenwriter)|William Rose]], then living in the United Kingdom, conceived the idea for a film (provisionally titled ''So Many Thieves'', and later ''Something a Little Less Serious'') about a comedic chase through Scotland. He sent an outline to Kramer, who agreed to produce and direct the film. The setting was shifted to America, and the working title changed to ''Where, but in America?'' then ''One Damn Thing After Another'' and then ''It's a Mad World'', with Rose and Kramer adding additional ''Mad''s to the title as time progressed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=9069&s=Features| title=Behind the Mad-ness&nbsp;\u2014 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World| website=Urban Cinephile| date=July 1, 2004| accessdate=September 2, 2009}}</ref> Kramer considered adding a fifth \"mad\" to the title before deciding it was redundant but noted in interviews that he later regretted it.\n\nAlthough well known for serious films such as ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' and ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (both starring Tracy), Kramer set out to make the ultimate comedy film. Filmed in [[Ultra Panavision 70]] and presented in [[Cinerama]] (becoming one of the early single-camera Cinerama features produced), ''Mad World'' had an all-star cast, with dozens of major comedy stars from all eras of cinema appearing in it. The film followed a Hollywood trend in the 1960s of producing \"epic\" films as a way of wooing audiences away from television and back to movie theaters. The film's theme music was written by [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]] with lyrics by [[Mack David]]. Kramer hosted a roundtable (including extensive clips) on the film with stars Caesar, Hackett and Winters as part of a special ''The Comedians, Stanley Kramer's Reunion with the Great Comedy Artists of Our Time'' broadcast in 1974 as part of ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/stanley-kramer-collection| title=Stanley Kramer Collection| website=UCLA Film & Television Archive| accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref> The last reported showing of the film on major network television was on ABC on July 16, 1979,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19790711&id=pJUiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3qkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1557,1848829| title='Mad World' Repeats| newspaper=[[The Item|The Daily Item]]| location=Sumter, South Carolina| date=July 16, 1979| page=6B| accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> and before that, on CBS on May 16, 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66#v=onepage| title=Television| magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]| page=66| date=May 18, 1978| accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n{{Refimprove section|date= December 2015}}\n\nThe airport terminal scenes were filmed at the now-defunct Rancho Conejo Airport in Newbury Park, California, though the control tower shown was constructed only for filming. Other airplane sequences were filmed at the Sonoma County Airport north of Santa Rosa, California; at the Palm Springs International Airport; and in the skies above Thousand Oaks, California; Camarillo, California; and Orange County, California. In the Orange County scene, stuntman [[Frank Tallman]] flew a [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beech model C-18S]] through a highway billboard advertising [[Coca-Cola]]. A communications mix-up resulted in the use of linen graphic sheets on the sign rather than paper, as planned. Linen, much tougher than paper, damaged the plane on impact.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Tallman managed to fly it back to the airstrip, discovering that the leading edges of the wings had been smashed all the way back to the wing spars. Tallman considered that incident the closest he ever came to dying on film. (Both Tallman and  [[Paul Mantz]], Tallman's business partner and fellow flier on ''Mad World'', eventually died in separate air crashes over a decade apart.)<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-22/local/me-274_1_professional-pilot| title=Pilot Told of Bad Weather, FAA Says of Crash Killing 10| first1=Eric| last1=Malnic| first2=Louis| last2=Sahagun| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=February 22, 1989| accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://airportjournals.com/paul-mantz-and-the-last-flight-of-the-phoenix/| title=Paul Mantz and the Last Flight of the Phoenix| first=Henry M.| last=Holden| journal=Airport Journals| date=September 1, 2004| accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mad1.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The hangar is at the [[Charles M.

(The original Cinerama process filmed scenes with three separate cameras. The three processed reels were projected by three electronically synchronized projectors onto a huge curved screen.) It originally was planned for three-camera Cinerama, and some reports state that initial filming was done using three cameras but was abandoned. One-camera Cinerama could be Super Panavision 70 or Ultra Panavision 70, which was essentially the [[Super Panavision 70]] process with anamorphic compression at the edges of the image to give a much wider aspect ratio.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} When projected by one projector, the expanded 70mm image filled the wide Cinerama screen. [[Ultra Panavision 70]] was used to film ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''. Other films shot in Ultra Panavision 70 and released in Cinerama include ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', ''[[The Hallelujah Trail]]'', ''[[Battle of the Bulge (1965 film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'', and ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]''. Super Panavision 70 films released in Cinerama include ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Animated credit sequence===\nKramer's comedy was accentuated by many things, including the opening animated credits designed by [[Saul Bass]]. The film begins with mention of Spencer Tracy, then the \"in alphabetical order\" mention of nine of the main cast (Berle, Caesar, Hackett, Merman, Rooney, Shawn, Silvers, Terry-Thomas, Winters), followed by hands switching these nine names two to three times over. Animation continues with paper dolls and a windup toy world spinning with several men hanging on to it and finishing with a man opening a door to the globe and getting trampled by a mad crowd. One of the animators who helped with the sequence was future ''[[Peanuts]]'' animator [[Bill Melendez]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) - Roadshow Trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=27|right|Original roadshow [[teaser trailer]] for ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''.]]\n\nThe film opened at the newly built [[Cinerama Dome]] in Los Angeles on November 7, 1963.

of counter-strike capability which required a long-range missile to provide robust [[second strike]] capability. India developed a larger missile, with a heavier payload and longer range in a compact configuration. Driven by the need for retaliation to defeat emerging [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) defence and countermeasures, this capability requires a compact missile which can carry ABM payloads and weapons in a configuration similar to a [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]].\n\n==Description==\nThe Agni-III was developed as the successor to the [[Agni-II]].<ref name=\"expressindia.com\"/> Designed by the [[Government of India|Indian government's]] [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]], Agni-III is a [[Multistage rocket|two-stage]] [[ballistic missile]] capable of [[nuclear weapons delivery]]. It was designed and developed by a unit of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]] formed in September 2001, with the development of large-sized rocket engines its main objective. The propulsion plant for solid-fuel engines was developed, including the infrastructure for propellant casting. The stubby, two-stage solid-fuel missile is compact enough for easy mobility and flexible deployment on a number of surface and sub-surface platforms.<ref name=hindu2636571>{{cite news|title=New kid on the nuclear block|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article2636571.ece|accessdate=4 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=18 November 2011|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nThe missile is equipped with sophisticated navigation, guidance and control systems and advanced on-board computer systems.

of counter-strike capability which required a long-range missile to provide robust [[second strike]] capability. India developed a larger missile, with a heavier payload and longer range in a compact configuration. Driven by the need for retaliation to defeat emerging [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) defence and countermeasures, this capability requires a compact missile which can carry ABM payloads and weapons in a configuration similar to a [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]].\n\n==Description==\nThe Agni-III was developed as the successor to the [[Agni-II]].<ref name=\"expressindia.com\"/> Designed by the [[Government of India|Indian government's]] [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]], Agni-III is a [[Multistage rocket|two-stage]] [[ballistic missile]] capable of [[nuclear weapons delivery]]. It was designed and developed by a unit of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]] formed in September 2001, with the development of large-sized rocket engines its main objective. The propulsion plant for solid-fuel engines was developed, including the infrastructure for propellant casting. The stubby, two-stage solid-fuel missile is compact enough for easy mobility and flexible deployment on a number of surface and sub-surface platforms.<ref name=hindu2636571>{{cite news|title=New kid on the nuclear block|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article2636571.ece|accessdate=4 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=18 November 2011|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nThe missile is equipped with sophisticated navigation, guidance and control systems and advanced on-board computer systems.

It stars [[Jared Padalecki]], [[Danielle Panabaker]], [[Aaron Yoo]], [[Amanda Righetti]], [[Travis Van Winkle]], and [[Derek Mears]] and follows Clay Miller (Padalecki) as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney (Righetti), who is captured by  [[Jason Voorhees]] (Mears) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake.\n\nThe film was originally conceived as an [[origin story]], but the project evolved into a [[Remake#Reimagine|re-imagining]] of the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for ''Part III''; though there were subtle changes.

Clay and Jenna search the old Crystal Lake campgrounds where they see Jason hauling a body into the abandoned camp house.\n\nJenna and Clay run to warn the others about Jason, who arrives and disconnects the cabin's electricity. Jason kills Chewie and Lawrence outside the cabin and sneaks inside and kills Bree. Trent, Clay, and Jenna escape the cabin, but Trent is killed when he reaches the main road. Jason chases Clay and Jenna back to the campgrounds, where Clay discovers Jason's lair and finds his sister chained to a wall. Clay frees Whitney, and all three try to escape as Jason arrives. They find an exit, but Jenna is killed before she can escape. Jason corners Clay and Whitney; Whitney confuses Jason by pretending to be Pamela, then stabs him in the chest with his own machete.

They wanted their teenage characters to \"sound normal\".

They wanted to create a quick, loose Jason. The writing team decided to create a version of Jason \"who was actually in the woods surviving off the land\", and whose killings are presented as a way of defending his territory rather than randomly murdering whoever came along.<ref name=\"writers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16407.html |author=Sheila Roberts |title=Friday the 13th Screenwriters Interview |publisher=Movies Online |accessdate=February 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213220911/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16407.html |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{{quotebox|align=right|width=30%|quote=We felt it was important to go back to the basics and put Jason back in the woods again.|source=\u2014Mark Swift on conceptualizing a new ''Friday the 13th'' film.<ref name=\"writers\"/>}}\n\nThe writers did not want to spend a lot of time covering Jason's childhood experiences, which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his tunnels. Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost  $100,000.  Because of budget constraints, certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned.<ref name=\"Shan/Swift\"/>\n\nThe writers had written a scene in which Willa Ford's character Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore.<ref name=\"writers\"/> Eventually, the girl would tire and drown. Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films, but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral.<ref name=\"Shan/Swift\"/> A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna. Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in the final version of the film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a \"cute line\" about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=10147 |title=Panabaker Describes Alternate Friday the 13th Kill|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409014120/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=10147|archive-date=April 9, 2009|url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in installments of the previous series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark ([[Tom McBride (actor)|Tom McBride]]) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of ''Friday the 13th''.<ref name=\"Shan/Swift\"/>\n\nThe writers altered Jason's character. Mears describes him as a combination of [[John Rambo]], [[Tarzan]], and the [[Abominable Snowman]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]''. To Mears, Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is supposed to be more sympathetic in this film.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> However, Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'' not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. They decided against an origin story because they did not want to focus on Jason's tormented childhood because the producers felt that would \"demystify\" the character in an unhelpful manner. Fuller said, \"We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple.\"<ref name=\"SG\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe producers used Asylum Visual Effects to create digital effects for ''Friday the 13th''. Although director Marcus Nispel is a proponent of practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members to work on the visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=1|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (1)|magazine=[[VFX World]]|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Richiesdeath.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with a video camera kneels to film as an actor pulls a machete from the head of another actor who is sitting on the ground.

Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete to show it being pulled away from Feldman's face.]]\nOne of the first scenes Asylum was given was the scene depicting the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland  was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames.<ref name=\"VFX2\">{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=2|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (2)|magazine=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> Another composite shot is used in the scene in which Chelsea is hit by a [[Powerboating|speedboat]]. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of [[Willa Ford]] reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.<ref name=\"VFX3\"/>\n\nAsylum also enhanced some of Jason's signature machete kills. In several scenes, the company used a computer-generated machete because Nispel wanted to show multiple characters' deaths in one shot instead of cutting from the acts of murder to the aftermath of their deaths. In one scene, Jason kills Richie by slamming a machete into his head. Instead of using a real machete with a fake head, Nispel had Feldman act dead as Mears pulled a handle{{mdash}}with only a portion of the blade attached{{mdash}}away from Feldman's head. Then, Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect.<ref name=\"VFX2\"/> For this scene, Asylum adjusted the actor's facial expressions to create a \"post mortem\" look. The special effects team digitally drooped half of the actor's face to appear as though the nerves had been severed by Jason's machete.<ref name=\"VFX3\">{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=3|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (3)|magazine=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAsylum digitally created weapons for various scenes. In the scene in which Nolan is killed suddenly by a shot in the head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the air{{mdash}}in one instance appearing in the same frame as the actor{{mdash}}would be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete [[3D computer graphics|3D model]] of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.<ref name=\"VFX3\"/>\n\n===Creating Jason===\n{{further|Jason Voorhees#Concept and creation}}\n[[File:Jason2009face.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A sculpture of a male torso and head is overlaid with fake skin, which has been molded to appear as lean muscle.

The skin is pale.|A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Jason as seen in the film. Effects artist Scott Stoddard combined characteristics from Jason's appearance in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and ''The Final Chapter'' when crafting his design.]]\n\nEffects artist Scott Stoddard described his look for Jason's face as a combination of Carl Fullerton's design for ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and [[Tom Savini]]'s design for ''Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter''. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/> Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back to give the impression that Jason had [[scoliosis]]. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/> He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|title=Fridaythe13thfilms.com Exclusive Interview with new Jason, Derek Mears!|author=Tony Carroll|publisher=Fridaythe13thfilms.com|date=January 31, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724030403/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor Jason's wardrobe, Mears was given a pair of combat boots and a \"high-priced t-shirt\" that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by combining a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears wanted to use the hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his \"kill movements\", so the top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed over the top of the military jacket to create what Mears called a \"giant [[Frankenstein]] jacket.\" He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, \"Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There  were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit. Break them up.\"<ref name=\"Rotten\"/>\n\n===Music===\nForm and Fuller recognized the iconic status of the music used in the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by [[Harry Manfredini]]. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used [[Steve Jablonsky]] to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film.<ref name=\"SG\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Todd Gilchrist|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/925/925754p3.html|title=Set Visit: Friday the 13th (page 3)|website=IGN|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=February 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219064850/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/925/925754p3.html|archive-date=February 19, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score ''Friday the 13th'' after having worked with him on the remake of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''.

The film was produced by [[Platinum Dunes]] and [[Crystal Lake Entertainment]] and distributed by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. It stars [[Jared Padalecki]], [[Danielle Panabaker]], [[Aaron Yoo]], [[Amanda Righetti]], [[Travis Van Winkle]], and [[Derek Mears]] and follows Clay Miller (Padalecki) as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney (Righetti), who is captured by  [[Jason Voorhees]] (Mears) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake.\n\nThe film was originally conceived as an [[origin story]], but the project evolved into a [[Remake#Reimagine|re-imagining]] of the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for ''Part III''; though there were subtle changes. ''Friday the 13th'' includes some of [[Harry Manfredini]]'s musical score from the previous ''Friday the 13th'' films because the producers recognized its iconic status.<ref name=\"SG\">{{cite web|author=Ryan Stewart |url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday+the+13th%3A+The+Producers/ |title=Friday the 13th: The Producers |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504133108/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday%2Bthe%2B13th%3A%2BThe%2BProducers/ |archivedate=May 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n''Friday the 13th'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 13, 2009, by [[New Line Cinema]] in North American territories and by [[Paramount Pictures]] internationally. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that did not add anything new to the franchise. Despite this, it had grossed over $92.7 million at the box office on a budget of $19 million, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise after [[Freddy vs. Jason]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--STOP.

Almost thirty years later, a group of friends{{mdash}}Wade ([[Jonathan Sadowski]]), Richie ([[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]]), Mike ([[Nick Mennell]]), [[List of characters in the Friday the 13th series#Whitney Miller|Whitney]] ([[Amanda Righetti]]) and Amanda ([[America Olivo]]){{mdash}}arrive at Crystal Lake on a camping trip to search for [[marijuana]] growing in the woods. That night, an adult Jason ([[Derek Mears]]) kills everyone except Whitney, whom he captures since she resembles his mother at a young age.\n\nSix weeks later, Trent ([[Travis Van Winkle]]), his girlfriend Jenna ([[Danielle Panabaker]]) and friends Chelsea ([[Willa Ford]]), Bree ([[Julianna Guill]]), Chewie ([[Aaron Yoo]]), Nolan ([[Ryan Hansen]]) and Lawrence ([[Arlen Escarpeta]]) arrive at Trent's summer cabin on the shore of Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Whitney's brother [[List of characters in the Friday the 13th series#Clay Miller|Clay Miller]] ([[Jared Padalecki]]) arrives at the lake to search for her. Clay visits Trent's cabin, and Jenna agrees to help him search for Whitney. As they search, Jason kills Chelsea and Nolan while they are [[wakeboarding]] on the lake. Clay and Jenna search the old Crystal Lake campgrounds where they see Jason hauling a body into the abandoned camp house.\n\nJenna and Clay run to warn the others about Jason, who arrives and disconnects the cabin's electricity. Jason kills Chewie and Lawrence outside the cabin and sneaks inside and kills Bree. Trent, Clay, and Jenna escape the cabin, but Trent is killed when he reaches the main road. Jason chases Clay and Jenna back to the campgrounds, where Clay discovers Jason's lair and finds his sister chained to a wall. Clay frees Whitney, and all three try to escape as Jason arrives. They find an exit, but Jenna is killed before she can escape. Jason corners Clay and Whitney; Whitney confuses Jason by pretending to be Pamela, then stabs him in the chest with his own machete. Clay and Whitney dump Jason's \"corpse\" into the lake, but before they leave, Jason bursts through the [[Dock (maritime)#American English|wooden dock]] and grabs Whitney.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jared Padalecki]] as Clay Miller\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Jenna\n* [[Amanda Righetti]] as Whitney Miller\n* [[Travis Van Winkle]] as Trent\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Chewie\n* [[Derek Mears]] as [[Jason Voorhees]]\n** Caleb Guss as Young Jason Voorhees\n* [[Jonathan Sadowski]] as Wade\n* [[Julianna Guill]] as Bree\n* [[Ben Feldman]] as Richie\n* [[Arlen Escarpeta]] as Lawrence\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as Nolan\n* [[Willa Ford]] as Chelsea\n* [[Nick Mennell]] as Mike\n* [[America Olivo]] as Amanda\n* [[Kyle Davis (actor)|Kyle Davis]] as Donnie\n* [[Richard Burgi]] as Sheriff Bracke\n* [[Nana Visitor]] as [[Pamela Voorhees]]\n** [[Kathleen Garrett]] as voice of Pamela Voorhees\t\n* Stephanie Rhodes as [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Camp Counselor]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[New Line Cinema]]'s [[Toby Emmerich]] approached [[Platinum Dunes]] producers [[Michael Bay]], Brad Fuller and [[Andrew Form]] about remaking ''Friday the 13th'' in the same way they restarted [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]].

They wanted to create a quick, loose Jason. The writing team decided to create a version of Jason \"who was actually in the woods surviving off the land\", and whose killings are presented as a way of defending his territory rather than randomly murdering whoever came along.<ref name=\"writers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16407.html |author=Sheila Roberts |title=Friday the 13th Screenwriters Interview |publisher=Movies Online |accessdate=February 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213220911/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16407.html |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{{quotebox|align=right|width=30%|quote=We felt it was important to go back to the basics and put Jason back in the woods again.|source=\u2014Mark Swift on conceptualizing a new ''Friday the 13th'' film.<ref name=\"writers\"/>}}\n\nThe writers did not want to spend a lot of time covering Jason's childhood experiences, which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his tunnels. Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost  $100,000.  Because of budget constraints, certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned.<ref name=\"Shan/Swift\"/>\n\nThe writers had written a scene in which Willa Ford's character Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore.<ref name=\"writers\"/> Eventually, the girl would tire and drown. Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films, but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral.<ref name=\"Shan/Swift\"/> A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna. Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in the final version of the film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a \"cute line\" about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=10147 |title=Panabaker Describes Alternate Friday the 13th Kill|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409014120/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=10147|archive-date=April 9, 2009|url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in installments of the previous series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark ([[Tom McBride (actor)|Tom McBride]]) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of ''Friday the 13th''.<ref name=\"Shan/Swift\"/>\n\nThe writers altered Jason's character. Mears describes him as a combination of [[John Rambo]], [[Tarzan]], and the [[Abominable Snowman]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]''. To Mears, Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is supposed to be more sympathetic in this film.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> However, Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'' not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. They decided against an origin story because they did not want to focus on Jason's tormented childhood because the producers felt that would \"demystify\" the character in an unhelpful manner. Fuller said, \"We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple.\"<ref name=\"SG\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe producers used Asylum Visual Effects to create digital effects for ''Friday the 13th''. Although director Marcus Nispel is a proponent of practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members to work on the visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=1|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (1)|magazine=[[VFX World]]|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Richiesdeath.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with a video camera kneels to film as an actor pulls a machete from the head of another actor who is sitting on the ground.

The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland  was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot.

Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of [[Willa Ford]] reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.<ref name=\"VFX3\"/>\n\nAsylum also enhanced some of Jason's signature machete kills. In several scenes, the company used a computer-generated machete because Nispel wanted to show multiple characters' deaths in one shot instead of cutting from the acts of murder to the aftermath of their deaths. In one scene, Jason kills Richie by slamming a machete into his head. Instead of using a real machete with a fake head, Nispel had Feldman act dead as Mears pulled a handle{{mdash}}with only a portion of the blade attached{{mdash}}away from Feldman's head. Then, Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect.<ref name=\"VFX2\"/> For this scene, Asylum adjusted the actor's facial expressions to create a \"post mortem\" look. The special effects team digitally drooped half of the actor's face to appear as though the nerves had been severed by Jason's machete.<ref name=\"VFX3\">{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=3|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (3)|magazine=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAsylum digitally created weapons for various scenes. In the scene in which Nolan is killed suddenly by a shot in the head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the air{{mdash}}in one instance appearing in the same frame as the actor{{mdash}}would be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete [[3D computer graphics|3D model]] of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.<ref name=\"VFX3\"/>\n\n===Creating Jason===\n{{further|Jason Voorhees#Concept and creation}}\n[[File:Jason2009face.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A sculpture of a male torso and head is overlaid with fake skin, which has been molded to appear as lean muscle. The face is disfigured, the left side of the mouth is curled upwards as though snarling, the right eye droops and is pressed into the eye socket, and the top of the head is bald with strands of hair on the back. The skin is pale.|A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Jason as seen in the film. Effects artist Scott Stoddard combined characteristics from Jason's appearance in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and ''The Final Chapter'' when crafting his design.]]\n\nEffects artist Scott Stoddard described his look for Jason's face as a combination of Carl Fullerton's design for ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and [[Tom Savini]]'s design for ''Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter''. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/> Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back to give the impression that Jason had [[scoliosis]]. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/> He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|title=Fridaythe13thfilms.com Exclusive Interview with new Jason, Derek Mears!|author=Tony Carroll|publisher=Fridaythe13thfilms.com|date=January 31, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724030403/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor Jason's wardrobe, Mears was given a pair of combat boots and a \"high-priced t-shirt\" that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by combining a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears wanted to use the hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his \"kill movements\", so the top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed over the top of the military jacket to create what Mears called a \"giant [[Frankenstein]] jacket.\" He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, \"Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There  were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit. Break them up.\"<ref name=\"Rotten\"/>\n\n===Music===\nForm and Fuller recognized the iconic status of the music used in the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by [[Harry Manfredini]]. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used [[Steve Jablonsky]] to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film.<ref name=\"SG\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Todd Gilchrist|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/925/925754p3.html|title=Set Visit: Friday the 13th (page 3)|website=IGN|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=February 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219064850/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/925/925754p3.html|archive-date=February 19, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score ''Friday the 13th'' after having worked with him on the remake of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''.

A recording conducted by the composer lasts 20 minutes and 33 seconds.\n\n==History==\n''Uirapuru'' originated as a fifteen-minute symphonic poem titled ''T\u00e9dio de alvorada'' (Boredom at Dawn), composed in Rio de Janeiro in 1916 and first performed there on a concert sponsored by the {{ILL| Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Imprensa|pt}} for the benefit of retired journalists, at the Theatro Municipal on 15 May 1918 by an orchestra made up of 85 music teachers, conducted by Soriano Robert. Villa-Lobos extensively reworked and expanded this composition into the score retitled ''Uirapuru'', beginning in 1917. However, it was not until [[Serge Lifar]] and his ensemble danced the ballets ''Jurupari'' (to the music of ''[[Ch\u00f4ros No. 10]]'') and ''Amazonas'' in 1934 that Villa-Lobos completed ''Uirapuru'' and dedicated the score to Lifar. In the end, however, Lifar was not involved in the ballet's premiere. The newly finished score was performed for the first time on Argentina's [[D\u00eda de la Revoluci\u00f3n de Mayo]], 25 May 1935, as a ballet choreographed by Ricardo Nemanoff and with stage design by {{ill|H\u00e9ctor Balsad\u00faa|es}}, at the [[Teatro Col\u00f3n]] in Buenos Aires. The occasion was a gala in honour of the Brazilian President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] during a visit to Argentina for the Fifth Pan-American Commercial Conference which started the next day. The ballet was danced on this occasion by Michel Borovsky and Dora del Grande, with the orchestra and corps de ballet of the Teatro Col\u00f3n, conducted by the composer. The first concert performance as a symphonic poem took place a few months later, on 6 November 1935 in the [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]] in Rio de Janeiro, by the Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica do Theatro Municipal conducted by the composer. ''Uirapuru'' was also included on the programme of the last concert conducted by Villa-Lobos, on 12 July 1959, at the Empire State Music Festival in New York ({{harvnb|Peppercorn|1991|loc=85}}; {{harvnb|''Villa-Lobos, sua obra''|2009|loc=38\u201339}}).\n\n[[File:Funcion de gala Teatro Colon 1935.png|thumb|left|A 1935 gala at the Teatro Col\u00f3n, possibly the one at which ''Uirapuru'' was premiered]]\nThe title page of the autograph manuscript reads \u201cUirapuru / (O passaro encantado)/ Bailado brasileiro\"// \"H.

The completion date of 1917, also given in the official catalogue of works, is improbable in view of two facts: the subsequent 1918 premiere of ''T\u00e9dio de alvorada'', and the fact that the new score was not first performed until 18 years later, in 1935. It has been suggested that the composer gave the earlier date in order not to be thought under the influence of Igor Stravinsky, whose music he came to know at first hand only during his first European visit in 1923 {{harv|Salles|2005|loc=2\u20133}}.\n\nOn the other hand, a sketch page for the earlier composition almost certainly dating from 1916 includes drafts of material only incorporated later in ''Uirapuru'', in particular the [[Octatonic scale|octatonic]] \"handsome indian theme\", which suggests that such a scale was indeed already familiar to Villa-Lobos before his earliest contact with the music of Stravinsky {{harv|Volpe|2011|loc=300\u201301}}.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n [[File:Viol\u00ed de botzina, MDMB 1120, Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona.JPG|thumb|left|Violinophone]]\n''Uirapuru'' is scored for an orchestra consisting of:\npiccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, soprano saxophone, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (tam-tam, tubular bells, [[reco-reco]], coco, floor-tom, [[tamborim]], cymbals, bass drum, xylophone, celesta, glockenspiel), 2 harps, piano, [[Stroh violin|violinophone]], and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Cyphorhinus arada 1841.jpg|thumb|The Uirapuru]]\n\"Uirapuru\" is a name, derived from the [[Tupi language]], applied to various members of the bird family [[Manakin|Pipridae]] found in Brazil. The bird whose song Villa-Lobos used as a compositional theme is ''[[Musician wren|Cyphorhinus arada]]'', the uirapuru-verdadeiro or musician wren, also known as the organ wren or quadrille wren, a bird with an astonishing variety of song patterns. Villa-Lobos likely based his uirapuru theme on a transcription made during an expedition in 1849\u201350 by the British botanist [[Richard Spruce]], and published in 1908 {{harv| Volpe|2001|loc=305\u201306}}.\n\nThe work falls into two large parts (b. 1\u2013134 and 134\u2013382), suggesting a binary form (especially with the repeat of the entire section A) but the form is created cumulatively from a succession of fifteen thematically based smaller sections (four in the first part and eleven in the second) in a non-functional harmonic context {{harv|Volpe|2001|loc=316\u201318}}.\n\n==References==\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|1935}}|reference=Anon. 1935. \"Buenos Aires Gay for Vargas's Visit\".

It has been suggested that the composer gave the earlier date in order not to be thought under the influence of Igor Stravinsky, whose music he came to know at first hand only during his first European visit in 1923 {{harv|Salles|2005|loc=2\u20133}}.\n\nOn the other hand, a sketch page for the earlier composition almost certainly dating from 1916 includes drafts of material only incorporated later in ''Uirapuru'', in particular the [[Octatonic scale|octatonic]] \"handsome indian theme\", which suggests that such a scale was indeed already familiar to Villa-Lobos before his earliest contact with the music of Stravinsky {{harv|Volpe|2011|loc=300\u201301}}.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n [[File:Viol\u00ed de botzina, MDMB 1120, Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona.JPG|thumb|left|Violinophone]]\n''Uirapuru'' is scored for an orchestra consisting of:\npiccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, soprano saxophone, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (tam-tam, tubular bells, [[reco-reco]], coco, floor-tom, [[tamborim]], cymbals, bass drum, xylophone, celesta, glockenspiel), 2 harps, piano, [[Stroh violin|violinophone]], and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Cyphorhinus arada 1841.jpg|thumb|The Uirapuru]]\n\"Uirapuru\" is a name, derived from the [[Tupi language]], applied to various members of the [[Manakin|Pipridae]] family of birds found in Brazil. The bird whose song Villa-Lobos used as a compositional theme is ''[[Musician wren|Cyphorhinus arada]]'', the uirapuru-verdadeiro or musician wren, also known as the organ wren or quadrille wren, a bird with an astonishing variety of song patterns. Villa-Lobos likely based his uirapuru theme on a transcription made during an expedition in 1849\u201350 by the British botanist [[Richard Spruce]], and published in 1908 {{harv| Volpe|2001|loc=305\u201306}}.\n\nThe work falls into two large parts (b. 1\u2013134 and 134\u2013382), suggesting a binary form (especially with the repeat of the entire section A) but the form is created cumulatively from a succession of fifteen thematically based smaller sections (four in the first part and eleven in the second) in a non-functional harmonic context {{harv|Volpe|2001|loc=316\u201318}}.\n\n==References==\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|1935}}|reference=Anon. 1935. \"Buenos Aires Gay for Vargas's Visit\".

On 5 December 1936, the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established as a constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring the 1920s, Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational and social life. Literacy was greatly improved, and a standard literary language was introduced by imposing Russian on the populace. Economic and social development also was notable. Many aspects of the Kyrgyz national culture were retained despite the suppression of nationalist activity under [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nThe early years of [[glasnost]] had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Republic's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, ''Literaturny Kirghizstan'', by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.\n\nAccording to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of [[Bishkek|Frunze]] (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (a rather unique fact, for almost any place in the Soviet Union, except the [[Jewish Autonomous Republic]]).\n\n[[File:Stamps of Kyrgyzstan, 2011-05.jpg|thumb|[[Urial]] on a Kyrgyzstan stamp]]\nIn June 1990, ethnic tensions between [[Uzbeks]] and Kyrgyz surfaced in the [[Osh Oblast]] (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population.<ref name=\"conflict\">{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=33728 |title=KYRGYZSTAN: Economic disparities driving inter-ethnic conflict |publisher=[[IRIN]] Asia |date=15 February 2006}}</ref> Attempts to appropriate Uzbek [[Collective farming|collective farms]] for housing development triggered the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh Riots]].

On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.\n\nDespite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a \"renewed federation\". Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan's independence through in August of that same year.\n\nOn 19 August 1991, when the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|State Emergency Committee]] assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President [[German Kuznetsov]] announced their resignations from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the '''Republic of Kyrgyzstan'''.\n\n===Independence===\n{{Recentism|date=September 2012}}\nIn October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent Republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with the representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community. Finally, on 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan joined with the other four Central Asian Republics to formally enter the new [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Kyrgyzstan gained full independence a few days later on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nIn 2005, a popular uprising known as the \"[[Tulip Revolution]]\", took place after the parliamentary elections in March 2005, forced President [[Askar Akayev]]'s resignation on 4 April 2005. Opposition leaders formed a coalition, and a new government was formed under President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and Prime Minister [[Feliks Kulov]]. The nation's capital was looted during the protests.\n\nPolitical stability appeared to be elusive, however, as various groups and factions allegedly linked to [[organized crime]] jockeyed for power. Three of the 75 members of Parliament elected in March 2005 were assassinated, and another member was assassinated on 10 May 2006 shortly after winning his murdered brother's seat in a by-election. All four are reputed to have been directly involved in major illegal business ventures.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}}\nOn 6 April 2010, [[2010 Kyrgyzstan revolution|civil unrest broke out]] in the town of [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]] after a demonstration against government corruption and increased living expenses.

(3968109583).jpg|thumb|On the southern shore of Issyk Kul lake, [[Issyk Kul Region]]]]\n\nKyrgyzstan is a landlocked country in [[Central Asia]], bordering [[Kazakhstan]], China, [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39\u00b0]] and [[44th parallel north|44\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[69th meridian east|69\u00b0]] and [[81st meridian east|81\u00b0 E]]. It is farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow into [[endorheic basin|closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea]]. The mountainous region of the [[Tian Shan]] covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally referred to as \"the Switzerland of Central Asia\", as a result),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/GC26Ag03.html | title = The Tulip Revolution takes root | first = Pepe | last = Escobar| date = 26 March 2005 |publisher = Asia Times Online}}</ref> with the remainder made up of valleys and basins.\n[[File:Kyrgyzstan.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A map of Kyrgyzstan]]\n\n[[Issyk-Kul Lake]], or Ysyk-K\u00f6l in [[Kyrgyz Language|Kyrgyz]], in the north-eastern Tian Shan is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after [[Titicaca]]. The highest peaks are in the Kakshaal-Too range, forming the Chinese border. Peak [[Jengish Chokusu]], at {{convert|7439|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest point and is considered by geologists to be the northernmost peak over {{convert|7000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the world. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for [[hydro-electricity]].\n\nKyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including [[gold]] and [[rare-earth metals]]. Due to the country's predominantly mountainous terrain, less than 8% of the land is cultivated, and this is concentrated in the northern lowlands and the fringes of the [[Fergana Valley]].\n\n[[Bishkek]] in the north is the capital and largest city, with 937,400 inhabitants ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}). The second city is the ancient town of [[Osh]], located in the Fergana Valley near the border with Uzbekistan. The principal river is the [[Kara Darya]], which flows west through the Fergana Valley into Uzbekistan. Across the border in Uzbekistan it meets another major Kyrgyz river, the [[Naryn River|Naryn]].\n\nThe confluence forms the [[Syr Darya]], which originally flowed into the [[Aral Sea]]. {{As of|2010}}, it no longer reaches the sea, as its water is withdrawn upstream to irrigate cotton fields in [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and southern [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chu River]] also briefly flows through Kyrgyzstan before entering Kazakhstan.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Kyrgyzstan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Kyrgyzstan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]\n{{Main|Climate of Kyrgyzstan}}\nThe climate varies regionally. The low-lying [[Fergana Valley]] in the southwest is [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] and extremely hot in [[summer]], with temperatures reaching {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} The northern [[foothill]]s are [[temperate climate|temperate]] and the [[Tian Shan]] varies from dry [[continental climate|continental]] to [[polar climate]], depending on elevation. In the coldest areas temperatures are sub-zero for around 40 days in winter, and even some [[desert]] areas experience constant snowfall in this period. In the lowlands the temperature ranges from around {{convert|-6|\u00b0C|0}} in January to {{convert|24|\u00b0C|0}} in July.\n\n===Enclaves and exclaves===\nThere is one [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]], the tiny village of [[Barak, Kyrgyzstan|Barak]]<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav060603.shtml# The exclave of Barak, Kyrgyzstan in Uzbekistan].

Chong-Kara is on the [[Sokh river]], between the Uzbek border and the Sokh enclave. Jangy-ayyl is about {{convert|60|km}} east of [[Batken]], in a northward projection of the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border near [[Khalmion]].\n\nThere are also two enclaves belonging to [[Tajikistan]]: [[Vorukh]] (exclave area between {{convert|95|-|130|km2|abbr=on}}, population estimated between 23,000 and 29,000, 95% Tajiks and 5% Kyrgyz, distributed among 17 villages), located {{convert|45|km}} south of [[Isfara]] on the right bank of the Karafshin river, and a small settlement near the Kyrgyz railway station of [[Kairagach]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Kyrgyzstan}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction=horizontal |align=right |caption_align=center |total_width=300\n| image1 = Sooronbay Jeenbekov (2018-05-14) 02.jpg\n| alt1 = Sooronbay Jeenbekov\n| caption1 = [[Sooronbay Jeenbekov]], [[President of Kyrgyzstan|President]], in office since 2017.\n| image2 = Muhammetkaliy Abdulgaziyev.jpg\n| alt2 = Muhammetkaliy Abdulgaziyev\n| caption2 = [[Mukhammedkalyi Abylgaziev]], [[Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan|Prime Minister]], in office since 2018.\n}}\n\nThe [[1993\u20132010 Constitution of Kyrgyzstan|1993 constitution]] defines the form of government as a democratic unicameral republic. The executive branch includes a president and prime minister. The parliament currently is unicameral. The judicial branch comprises a Supreme Court, local courts and a Chief Prosecutor.\n\nIn March 2002, in the southern district of [[Aksy]], five people protesting the arbitrary arrest of an opposition politician were shot dead by police, sparking nationwide protests. President [[Askar Akayev]] initiated a constitutional reform process which initially included the participation of a broad range of government, civil and social representatives in an open dialogue, leading to a February 2003 referendum marred by voting irregularities.\n\nThe amendments to the constitution approved by the referendum resulted in stronger control by the president and weakened the parliament and the Constitutional Court. Parliamentary elections for a new, 75-seat unicameral legislature were held on 27 February and 13 March 2005, but were widely viewed as corrupt. The subsequent protests led to a bloodless [[coup]] on 24 March 2005, after which Akayev fled the country with his family and was replaced by acting president [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] (see: [[Tulip Revolution]]).\n\nOn 10 July 2005, acting president Bakiyev won the [[Kyrgyz presidential election, 2005|presidential election]] in a landslide, with 88.9% of the vote, and was inaugurated on 14 August. However, initial public support for the new administration substantially declined in subsequent months as a result of its apparent inability to solve the corruption problems that had plagued the country since its independence from the Soviet Union, along with the murders of several members of parliament. Large-scale protests against president Bakiyev took place in Bishkek in April and November 2006, with opposition leaders accusing the president of failing to live up to his election promises to reform the country's constitution and transfer many of his presidential powers to parliament.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6124428.stm | title = Clashes erupt in Kyrgyz capital|accessdate = 21 November 2007 |work = BBC Online | date=7 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin and Sooronbay Jeenbekov (2018-05-14) 01.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Sooronbay Jeenbekov]] and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], 14 May 2018]]\nKyrgyzstan is also a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), a league of 56 participating states committed to peace, transparency, and the protection of human rights in Eurasia.

Initially, these were a result of the breakup of the Soviet trade bloc and resulting loss of markets, which impeded the republic's transition to a demand economy.\n\nThe government has reduced expenditures, ended most price subsidies and introduced a [[value-added tax]]. Overall, the government appears committed to the transition to a [[market economy]]. Through economic stabilization and reform, the government seeks to establish a pattern of long-term consistent growth. Reforms led to Kyrgyzstan's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 20 December 1998.\n\nThe Kyrgyz economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation's economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Tajikistan]], as factories and state farms collapsed with the disappearance of their traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. While economic performance has improved considerably in the last few years, and particularly since 1998, difficulties remain in securing adequate [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal]] revenues and providing an adequate [[social safety net]].

As the prices of imported [[agrichemicals]] and [[petroleum]] are so high, much farming is being done by hand and by horse, as it was generations ago. Agricultural processing is a key component of the industrial economy as well as one of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment.\n\nKyrgyzstan is rich in mineral resources but has negligible [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves; it imports petroleum and gas. Among its mineral reserves are substantial deposits of [[coal]], [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[antimony]], and other valuable metals. [[Metallurgy]] is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment in this field. The government has actively encouraged foreign involvement in extracting and processing gold from the [[Kumtor Gold Mine]] and other regions. The country's plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of [[hydroelectric energy]].\n\nThe principal exports are nonferrous metals and minerals, woollen goods and other agricultural products, electric energy and certain engineering goods. Imports include petroleum and natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, most machinery, wood and paper products, some foods and some construction materials. Its leading trade partners include Germany, Russia, China, [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. After Beijing launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, China has expanded its economic presence and initiated a number of sizable infrastructure projects in Kyrgyzstan.<ref>Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) \u201c[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329310641 China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia]\u201d, in Fanny M.

There are 55 higher educational institutions and universities in Kyrgyzstan, out of which 37 are state institutions.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn September 2016, the [[University of Central Asia]] was launched in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucentralasia.org |title=University of Central Asia \u2013 University of Central Asia |publisher=Ucentralasia.org |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:E8102-Bishkek-West-Bus-Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Bishkek West Bus Terminal]]\n{{Main|Transport in Kyrgyzstan}}\nTransport in Kyrgyzstan is severely constrained by the country's alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mudslides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions.\n\nAdditional problems come from the fact that many roads and railway lines built during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. [[Horse]]s are still a much-used transport option, especially in more rural areas; Kyrgyzstan's road infrastructure is not extensive, so horses are able to reach locations that motor vehicles cannot, and they do not require expensive, imported [[fuel]].\n\n===Airports===\nAt the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today. The [[Kyrgyzstan Air Company]] provides air transport to China, Russia, and other local countries.\n* [[Manas International Airport]] near [[Bishkek]] is the main international airport, with services to Moscow, [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], [[Urumqi]], [[Istanbul]], [[Baku]], and [[Dubai]].\n* [[Osh Airport]] is the main air terminal in the south of the country, with daily connections to Bishkek, and services to Moscow, Krasnoyarsk, Almaty and more international places.\n* [[Jalal-Abad Airport]] is linked to Bishkek by daily flights. The national flag carrier, Kyrgyzstan, operates flights on [[BAe-146]] aircraft. During the summer months, a weekly flight links Jalal-Abad with the Issyk-Kul Region.\n* Other facilities built during the Soviet era are either closed down, used only occasionally or restricted to military use (e.g., [[Kant Air Base]] near Bishkek, which is used by the [[Russian Air Force]]).\n\n===Banned airline status===\nKyrgyzstan appears on the European Union's [[List of air carriers banned in the European Union|list of prohibited countries for the certification of airlines]]. This means that no airline which is registered in Kyrgyzstan may operate services of any kind within the European Union, due to safety standards which fail to meet European regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:102:0003:0016:EN:PDF |title=List of banned European Union air carriers |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> No EU airline has flights to Kyrgyzstan (as of 2020). Travel between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan includes changing aircraft, most often in Moscow or Istanbul.\n\n===Railways===\nThe [[Chuy Valley]] in the north and the [[Ferghana valley]] in the south were endpoints of the [[Soviet Union]]'s rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about {{convert|370|km|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1520|mm|1|abbr=on}} broad gauge) in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centres as [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], and the cities of Russia.\n\nThere are vague plans about extending rail lines from [[Balykchy]] in the north and/or from [[Osh]] in the south into China, but the cost of construction would be enormous.\n\n====Rail links with adjacent countries====\n* [[Transport in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Bishkek]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Osh]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] \u2013 no \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|China]] \u2013 no \u2013 [[Break of gauge]] 1524&nbsp;mm/1435&nbsp;mm\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Osh 03-2016 img07 Gapar Aitiev Street.jpg|thumb|Street scene in [[Osh]].]]\nWith support from the [[Asian Development Bank]], a major road linking the north and southwest from [[Bishkek]] to [[Osh]] has recently been completed.

On 5 December 1936, the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established as a constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring the 1920s, Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational and social life. Literacy was greatly improved, and a standard literary language was introduced by imposing Russian on the populace. Economic and social development also was notable. Many aspects of the Kyrgyz national culture were retained despite the suppression of nationalist activity under [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nThe early years of [[glasnost]] had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Republic's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, ''Literaturny Kirghizstan'', by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.\n\nAccording to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of [[Bishkek|Frunze]] (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (a rather unique fact, for almost any place in the Soviet Union, except the [[Jewish Autonomous Republic]]).\n\n[[File:Stamps of Kyrgyzstan, 2011-05.jpg|thumb|[[Urial]] on a Kyrgyzstan stamp]]\nIn June 1990, ethnic tensions between [[Uzbeks]] and Kyrgyz surfaced in the [[Osh Oblast]] (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population.<ref name=\"conflict\">{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=33728 |title=KYRGYZSTAN: Economic disparities driving inter-ethnic conflict |publisher=[[IRIN]] Asia |date=15 February 2006}}</ref> Attempts to appropriate Uzbek [[Collective farming|collective farms]] for housing development triggered the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh Riots]].

On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.\n\nDespite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a \"renewed federation\". Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan's independence through in August of that same year.\n\nOn 19 August 1991, when the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|State Emergency Committee]] assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President [[German Kuznetsov]] announced their resignations from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the '''Republic of Kyrgyzstan'''.\n\n===Independence===\n{{Recentism|date=September 2012}}\nIn October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent Republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with the representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community. Finally, on 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan joined with the other four Central Asian Republics to formally enter the new [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Kyrgyzstan gained full independence a few days later on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nIn 2005, a popular uprising known as the \"[[Tulip Revolution]]\", took place after the parliamentary elections in March 2005, forced President [[Askar Akayev]]'s resignation on 4 April 2005. Opposition leaders formed a coalition, and a new government was formed under President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and Prime Minister [[Feliks Kulov]]. The nation's capital was looted during the protests.\n\nPolitical stability appeared to be elusive, however, as various groups and factions allegedly linked to [[organized crime]] jockeyed for power. Three of the 75 members of Parliament elected in March 2005 were assassinated, and another member was assassinated on 10 May 2006 shortly after winning his murdered brother's seat in a by-election. All four are reputed to have been directly involved in major illegal business ventures.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}}\nOn 6 April 2010, [[2010 Kyrgyzstan revolution|civil unrest broke out]] in the town of [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]] after a demonstration against government corruption and increased living expenses.

Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for [[hydro-electricity]].\n\nKyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including [[gold]] and [[rare-earth metals]].

The executive branch includes a president and prime minister. The parliament currently is unicameral. The judicial branch comprises a Supreme Court, local courts and a Chief Prosecutor.\n\nIn March 2002, in the southern district of [[Aksy]], five people protesting the arbitrary arrest of an opposition politician were shot dead by police, sparking nationwide protests. President [[Askar Akayev]] initiated a constitutional reform process which initially included the participation of a broad range of government, civil and social representatives in an open dialogue, leading to a February 2003 referendum marred by voting irregularities.\n\nThe amendments to the constitution approved by the referendum resulted in stronger control by the president and weakened the parliament and the Constitutional Court. Parliamentary elections for a new, 75-seat unicameral legislature were held on 27 February and 13 March 2005, but were widely viewed as corrupt. The subsequent protests led to a bloodless [[coup]] on 24 March 2005, after which Akayev fled the country with his family and was replaced by acting president [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] (see: [[Tulip Revolution]]).\n\nOn 10 July 2005, acting president Bakiyev won the [[Kyrgyz presidential election, 2005|presidential election]] in a landslide, with 88.9% of the vote, and was inaugurated on 14 August. However, initial public support for the new administration substantially declined in subsequent months as a result of its apparent inability to solve the corruption problems that had plagued the country since its independence from the Soviet Union, along with the murders of several members of parliament. Large-scale protests against president Bakiyev took place in Bishkek in April and November 2006, with opposition leaders accusing the president of failing to live up to his election promises to reform the country's constitution and transfer many of his presidential powers to parliament.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6124428.stm | title = Clashes erupt in Kyrgyz capital|accessdate = 21 November 2007 |work = BBC Online | date=7 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin and Sooronbay Jeenbekov (2018-05-14) 01.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Sooronbay Jeenbekov]] and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], 14 May 2018]]\nKyrgyzstan is also a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), a league of 56 participating states committed to peace, transparency, and the protection of human rights in Eurasia.

Initially, these were a result of the breakup of the Soviet trade bloc and resulting loss of markets, which impeded the republic's transition to a demand economy.\n\nThe government has reduced expenditures, ended most price subsidies and introduced a [[value-added tax]]. Overall, the government appears committed to the transition to a [[market economy]]. Through economic stabilization and reform, the government seeks to establish a pattern of long-term consistent growth. Reforms led to Kyrgyzstan's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 20 December 1998.\n\nThe Kyrgyz economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation's economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Tajikistan]], as factories and state farms collapsed with the disappearance of their traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. While economic performance has improved considerably in the last few years, and particularly since 1998, difficulties remain in securing adequate [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal]] revenues and providing an adequate [[social safety net]]. [[Remittance]]s of around 800,000 Kyrgyz migrants working in Russia represent 40% of Kyrgyzstan's GDP.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6373KT20100408 |title=Kyrgyz unrest plays into regional rivalry |work=Reuters |date=8 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |title=Kyrgyzstan: Returning Labor Migrants are a Cause for Concern |publisher=EurasiaNet.org |date=2 April 2009 |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104050/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] is an important sector of the economy in Kyrgyzstan (see [[agriculture in Kyrgyzstan]]). By the early 1990s, the private agricultural sector provided between one-third and one-half of some harvests. In 2002, agriculture accounted for 35.6% of GDP and about half of employment. Kyrgyzstan's terrain is mountainous, which accommodates [[livestock]] raising, the largest agricultural activity, so the resulting [[wool]], [[meat]] and [[dairy product]]s are major commodities. Main crops include [[wheat]], [[sugar beets]], [[potatoes]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[vegetables]], and [[fruit]]. As the prices of imported [[agrichemicals]] and [[petroleum]] are so high, much farming is being done by hand and by horse, as it was generations ago. Agricultural processing is a key component of the industrial economy as well as one of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment.\n\nKyrgyzstan is rich in mineral resources but has negligible [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves; it imports petroleum and gas. Among its mineral reserves are substantial deposits of [[coal]], [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[antimony]], and other valuable metals. [[Metallurgy]] is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment in this field. The government has actively encouraged foreign involvement in extracting and processing gold from the [[Kumtor Gold Mine]] and other regions. The country's plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of [[hydroelectric energy]].\n\nThe principal exports are nonferrous metals and minerals, woollen goods and other agricultural products, electric energy and certain engineering goods. Imports include petroleum and natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, most machinery, wood and paper products, some foods and some construction materials. Its leading trade partners include Germany, Russia, China, [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]].

It is required that every child finishes 9 grades of school and receives a certificate of completion. Grades 10\u201311 are optional, but it is necessary to complete them to graduate and receive a state-accredited school diploma. To graduate, a student must complete the 11-year school course and pass 4 mandatory state exams in writing, maths, history and a foreign language.\n\nThere are 77 public schools in Bishkek (capital city) and more than 200 in the rest of the country. There are 55 higher educational institutions and universities in Kyrgyzstan, out of which 37 are state institutions.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn September 2016, the [[University of Central Asia]] was launched in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucentralasia.org |title=University of Central Asia \u2013 University of Central Asia |publisher=Ucentralasia.org |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:E8102-Bishkek-West-Bus-Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Bishkek West Bus Terminal]]\n{{Main|Transport in Kyrgyzstan}}\nTransport in Kyrgyzstan is severely constrained by the country's alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mudslides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions.\n\nAdditional problems come from the fact that many roads and railway lines built during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. [[Horse]]s are still a much-used transport option, especially in more rural areas; Kyrgyzstan's road infrastructure is not extensive, so horses are able to reach locations that motor vehicles cannot, and they do not require expensive, imported [[fuel]].\n\n===Airports===\nAt the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today. The [[Kyrgyzstan Air Company]] provides air transport to China, Russia, and other local countries.\n* [[Manas International Airport]] near [[Bishkek]] is the main international airport, with services to Moscow, [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], [[Urumqi]], [[Istanbul]], [[Baku]], and [[Dubai]].\n* [[Osh Airport]] is the main air terminal in the south of the country, with daily connections to Bishkek, and services to Moscow, Krasnoyarsk, Almaty and more international places.\n* [[Jalal-Abad Airport]] is linked to Bishkek by daily flights. The national flag carrier, Kyrgyzstan, operates flights on [[BAe-146]] aircraft. During the summer months, a weekly flight links Jalal-Abad with the Issyk-Kul Region.\n* Other facilities built during the Soviet era are either closed down, used only occasionally or restricted to military use (e.g., [[Kant Air Base]] near Bishkek, which is used by the [[Russian Air Force]]).\n\n===Banned airline status===\nKyrgyzstan appears on the European Union's [[List of air carriers banned in the European Union|list of prohibited countries for the certification of airlines]]. This means that no airline which is registered in Kyrgyzstan may operate services of any kind within the European Union, due to safety standards which fail to meet European regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:102:0003:0016:EN:PDF |title=List of banned European Union air carriers |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> No EU airline has flights to Kyrgyzstan (as of 2020). Travel between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan includes changing aircraft, most often in Moscow or Istanbul.\n\n===Railways===\nThe [[Chuy Valley]] in the north and the [[Ferghana valley]] in the south were endpoints of the [[Soviet Union]]'s rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about {{convert|370|km|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1520|mm|1|abbr=on}} broad gauge) in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centres as [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], and the cities of Russia.\n\nThere are vague plans about extending rail lines from [[Balykchy]] in the north and/or from [[Osh]] in the south into China, but the cost of construction would be enormous.\n\n====Rail links with adjacent countries====\n* [[Transport in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Bishkek]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] \u2013 yes \u2013 [[Osh]] branch \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] \u2013 no \u2013 same gauge\n* [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|China]] \u2013 no \u2013 [[Break of gauge]] 1524&nbsp;mm/1435&nbsp;mm\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Osh 03-2016 img07 Gapar Aitiev Street.jpg|thumb|Street scene in [[Osh]].]]\nWith support from the [[Asian Development Bank]], a major road linking the north and southwest from [[Bishkek]] to [[Osh]] has recently been completed.
