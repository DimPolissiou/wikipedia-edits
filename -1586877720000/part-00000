One of SWIP's earliest ideas was that it would set up a philosophy journal. The thought of \"[[A Room of One's Own|a journal of our own\"]] was very powerful, according to Kathryn Morgan ([[University of Toronto|Toronto]]), speaking in 2009 on the history of ''Hypatia''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Hypatia (journal)|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypatia_(journal)&oldid=950818294|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> At the time, according to [[Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff]] ([[City University of New York|CUNY]]), president of the Hypatia Inc. board of directors since February 2018,<ref>{{Citation|title=Hypatia (journal)|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypatia_(journal)&oldid=950818294|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> philosophers who wanted to write about gender-related issues were being silenced in a discipline \"riven by unabashed bias and vested interest, inflicting its own form of unapologetic mob violence\".\n\n[[File:Azizah Y. al-Hibri, 2012.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]], 2012]]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nSWIP decided in 1977 to set up an [[editorial board]] to plan the journal; the first board was put together by [[Ann Garry]] ([[California State University, Los Angeles|Cal State LA]]) and Jacqueline Thomason ([[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]]). Women's Studies International Forum At a meeting in Denver in the spring of 1979, the board agreed that [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] ([[University of Richmond|UR]]) should be the founding editor. Al-Hibri began work on the journal in 1982, after she had completed her PhD in philosophy and just as she was starting her first year of [[law school]]. The philosophy and women's studies departments at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] offered support in the form of an office and research assistance.[[Women's Studies International Forum|''Women's Studies International Forum'']] agreed to publish the new journal as an annual \"piggy back\" issue of its own, which it did for three years, and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising it.\n\nThe group led by Al-Hibri decided that submissions would be fully reviewed and that substantive comments would be offered, Alcoff wrote, rather than the usual brief rejection, to help authors improve their work and to contribute to the field's development. Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue. It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.\n\nThe journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have \"deep roots in philosophy\". According to [[Linda L\u00f3pez McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been \"stoned to death for telling the truth\". The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.\n\nThroughout Hypatia\u2019s thirty-three-year history, the journal has been influential in legitimizing feminist philosophy within the field. It has served as one of the most pivotal sources of scholarship in feminist philosophy, both because it showcases a wide range of feminist viewpoints and because it has self-consciously addressed varied views and issues in the discipline. In a editorial statement titled \u201cThe Promise of Feminist Philosophy,\u201d the editors note that:<blockquote>Hypatia\u2019s specific history in this regard is complex. The journal\u2019s editors have often addressed questions of disciplinary pluralism, demographic exclusion and marginalization, and the journal\u2019s own role in setting the agenda for feminist agitation or compliance within the academy...The special issue structure has sometimes allowed ''Hypatia'' to create space for scholars who are subjected to the most persistent forms of marginalization in the discipline, and for intersectional feminist work, even as ''Hypatia'' as a whole has been justly criticized for the underrepresentation of such work.<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490]</ref>...More recently, the development of ''Hypatia'' clusters (a set of two or more articles on a single theme in an open issue) offers another avenue that might be employed to highlight work that is marginalized in the larger discipline.</blockquote>\n\n==Governance==\n''Hypatia'' is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia Inc.,<ref name=ProPublica/> registered in April 2008 in the State of Washington. The purpose of the non-profit is \"to foster feminist scholarship in philosophy and related fields, including through the publication of the academic journal ''Hypatia''\".{{efn|\"A non-profit corporation, Hypatia Inc.

One of SWIP's earliest ideas was that it would set up a philosophy journal. The thought of \"[[A Room of One's Own|a journal of our own\"]] was very powerful, according to Kathryn Morgan ([[University of Toronto|Toronto]]), speaking in 2009 on the history of ''Hypatia''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Hypatia (journal)|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypatia_(journal)&oldid=950818294|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> At the time, according to [[Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff]] ([[City University of New York|CUNY]]), president of the Hypatia Inc. board of directors since February 2018,<ref>{{Citation|title=Hypatia (journal)|date=2020-04-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypatia_(journal)&oldid=950818294|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> philosophers who wanted to write about gender-related issues were being silenced in a discipline \"riven by unabashed bias and vested interest, inflicting its own form of unapologetic mob violence\".\n\n[[File:Azizah Y. al-Hibri, 2012.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]], 2012]]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nSWIP decided in 1977 to set up an [[editorial board]] to plan the journal; the first board was put together by [[Ann Garry]] ([[California State University, Los Angeles|Cal State LA]]) and Jacqueline Thomason ([[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]]). Women's Studies International Forum At a meeting in Denver in the spring of 1979, the board agreed that [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] ([[University of Richmond|UR]]) should be the founding editor. Al-Hibri began work on the journal in 1982, after she had completed her PhD in philosophy and just as she was starting her first year of [[law school]]. The philosophy and women's studies departments at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] offered support in the form of an office and research assistance.[[Women's Studies International Forum|''Women's Studies International Forum'']] agreed to publish the new journal as an annual \"piggy back\" issue of its own, which it did for three years, and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising it.\n\nThe group led by Al-Hibri decided that submissions would be fully reviewed and that substantive comments would be offered, Alcoff wrote, rather than the usual brief rejection, to help authors improve their work and to contribute to the field's development. Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue. It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.\n\nThe journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have \"deep roots in philosophy\". According to [[Linda L\u00f3pez McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been \"stoned to death for telling the truth\". The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.\n\nThroughout Hypatia\u2019s thirty-three-year history, the journal has been influential in legitimizing feminist philosophy within the field. It has served as one of the most pivotal sources of scholarship in feminist philosophy, both because it showcases a wide range of feminist viewpoints and because it has self-consciously addressed varied views and issues in the discipline. In a editorial statement titled \u201cThe Promise of Feminist Philosophy,\u201d the editors note that:<blockquote>Hypatia\u2019s specific history in this regard is complex. The journal\u2019s editors have often addressed questions of disciplinary pluralism, demographic exclusion and marginalization, and the journal\u2019s own role in setting the agenda for feminist agitation or compliance within the academy...The special issue structure has sometimes allowed ''Hypatia'' to create space for scholars who are subjected to the most persistent forms of marginalization in the discipline, and for intersectional feminist work, even as ''Hypatia'' as a whole has been justly criticized for the underrepresentation of such work.<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490]</ref>...More recently, the development of ''Hypatia'' clusters (a set of two or more articles on a single theme in an open issue) offers another avenue that might be employed to highlight work that is marginalized in the larger discipline.</blockquote>\n\n==Governance==\n''Hypatia'' is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia Inc.,<ref name=ProPublica/> registered in April 2008 in the State of Washington. The purpose of the non-profit is \"to foster feminist scholarship in philosophy and related fields, including through the publication of the academic journal ''Hypatia''\".{{efn|\"A non-profit corporation, Hypatia Inc.

In their resignation statement, they wrote that the current controversy was \"grounded in long-standing differences and tensions within the field.\" They argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into \"a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people.\"<ref name=Weinberg24July2017>{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia's Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=(Another) Shake-Up at 'Hypatia'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/divisions-within-hypatias-editorial-board-lead-resignations-top-editors|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=24 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=Zamudio-Suar\u00e9z21July2017>{{cite news|last1=Zamudio-Suar\u00e9z|first1=Fernanda|title=Months After 'Transracialism' Flap, Controversy Still Rages at Feminist Philosophy Journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Months-After/240722|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe board appointed interim editors, and in November 2017 [[Sally Haslanger]], Serene Khader, and Yannik Thiem were named as the governance task-force co-chairs.<ref name=Weinberg13Nov2017>{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia Board Announces Task Force|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/11/13/hypatia-board-announces-task-force/|work=Daily Nous|date=13 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=taskforce>{{cite news|title=Hypatia Board of Directors Announces Task Force Co-Chairs|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/task-force/hypatia-board-directors-announces-task-force-co-chairs/|work=Hypatia|date=1 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724115800/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/task-force/hypatia-board-directors-announces-task-force-co-chairs/|archivedate=24 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=EditorialBoardMarch2018>{{cite web|title=Editorial board|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/about/editorialboard/|publisher=Hypatia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301224919/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/about/editorialboard/|archivedate=1 March 2018|date=1 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The five-person board of directors, including Solomon, was replaced in February 2018.<ref name=search23Feb2018/> Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff and Kim Hall, two of the associate editors who resigned in July,<ref name=Weinberg24July2017/> became president of the board of directors and chair of the search committee for the new editorial team, respectively.<ref name=search23Feb2018>{{cite web|title=Announcement from Hypatia's Board of Directors and Task Force Co-Chairs|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|publisher=Hypatia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164503/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|archivedate=1 March 2018|date=23 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=edandgovJuly2018>{{cite web |title=Editorial and governance boards |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/about/edandgovboards/ |website=Hypatia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724092156/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/about/edandgovboards/ |archivedate=24 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==2018 hoax==\n{{main|Grievance studies affair}}\n''Hypatia'' was the subject of further controversy in 2018 when it accepted a satirical hoax article for publication, one of several written as part of the \"grievance-studies affair\", organized by, among others, the philosopher [[Peter Boghossian]] to provoke discussion about scholarly standards.
