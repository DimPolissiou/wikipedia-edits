During his career he has formed lasting creative relationships with both [[Toby Radloff]] and [[P. Craig Russell]].\n\nHarold is a 1988 graduate of [[Kent State University]] with a degree in communications and film. Soon after graduating from Kent State, Harold began producing short comedic segments for MTV about [[Cleveland]]-based \"genuine nerd\" [[Toby Radloff]]. In the 1990s, under the company title '''Lurid Entertainment''', Harold co-created the cult horror comedy feature films ''[[Killer Nerd]]'' and ''[[Bride of Killer Nerd]]'', both of which starred Radloff. He continued working with Radloff in the 1999 cult film ''Townies'', and then the 2006 documentary ''Genuine Nerd''.\n\nHarold's 2009 documentary, ''Night Music: The Art of P. Craig Russell'', has had public screenings at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] <ref>{{cite news |title= 'Night Music: The Art of P.

The debut event was held at Kent State University on October 19, 2013. Guests included [[P. Craig Russell]], [[Jill Thompson]] and other artists of the graphic novel adaptation of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Graveyard Book]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title= Kent Comics Arts Fest a quiet success on Saturday: Journey Into Comics|author= |work=Cleveland.com|date= 21 October 2013|url= http://www.cleveland.com/comic-books/index.ssf/2013/10/kent_comics_arts_fest_a_quiet.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he edited, designed and published the ''P. Craig Russell Sketchbook Archives'', a hardcover coffee-table style art book featuring career-spanning sketch work by artist  [[P. Craig Russell]].<ref>{{cite news |title= It\u2019s A Last Call For P.

It was controlled by three successive generations of the same family until 1207. After that date it was given to the Hospital of St John the Evangelist and served by chaplains from that foundation.\n\nIn the early 1280s, [[Hugh de Balsham]], [[Bishop of Ely]], lodged some scholars in the Hospital but to his dismay found soon that the sick and the students could not live in harmony together. The students were moved in 1284 to the site of what is now [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]]; this was the origin of the first Cambridge college. By the 1340s the church was in such a bad state that the fellows of Peterhouse decided to rebuild it. In 1352, the new building had the dual purpose of College Chapel (to Peterhouse) and Parish Church. At this time, it was rededicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. In 1632 Peterhouse built a separate Chapel and St Mary the Less reverted to being a Parish Church.\n\n[[Richard Crashaw]], the metaphysical poet, was a priest there from 1638 to 1643, at the same time that he was a Fellow of Peterhouse. In 1643, after his departure, many of the Church's ornaments and statues were damaged or destroyed by the [[Puritan]] iconoclast [[William Dowsing]]. The damage to the [[sedilia]] and the entrance to the [[Lady chapel|Lady Chapel]] has never been repaired.\n\n{{cquote|1643.

From 1856\u20137 [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] restored the church and removed the 18th-century panelling. Further restoration work was carried out in 1876 and 1891, but by 1880 the church was much as it is now. The south, or Lady Chapel, was added in 1931 and designed by [[Thomas Lyon (architect)|T. H.

In late January 2013, Branagh signed on to direct, with Weitz hired to revise a script from [[Aline Brosh McKenna]]. In November 2012, casting began with Blanchett being the first to sign on; James was eventually cast in the titular role in April 2013. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire, England]] on September 23, 2013, and ended on December 14.\n\n''Cinderella'' had its world premiere on February 13, 2015, at the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically in the United States on March 13, 2015, and in the United Kingdom on March 27 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It grossed over $542&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming Branagh's highest-grossing film to date as a director. The film received generally  positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly James, Blanchett, and Bonham Carter), Branagh's direction, musical score, costume design, production values, and faithfulness to the original animated film. It received a nomination at the [[88th Academy Awards]], [[21st Critics' Choice Awards]] and [[69th British Academy Film Awards]], all for costume design. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nElla and her parents live a humble but happy life until her mother falls ill. Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, pushing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move to the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money and forces all their chores on Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in [[cinders]] after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her \"Cinderella\".\n\nDistraught, Ella rides off into the woods where she happens to encounter Kit, the [[crown prince]], hunting. He hides that he is a prince and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to also invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.\n\nOn the night of the ball, Ella tries to join her step-family, wearing her mother\u2019s old gown that she has refashioned, but Lady Tremaine and Drisella tear it to shreds and leave without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's stepfamily from recognizing her.\n\nAt the ball, the entire court is entranced by Ella. She dances with Kit, much to the chagrin of the Grand Duke who has already promised Kit to Princess Chelina of Zaragoza, which Lady Tremaine overhears. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella and the prince bond. Before Ella can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her slippers. Pursued by the Grand Duke and his men, Ella manages to escape home before the final stroke of midnight; the spell dissipates and everything reverts back to its true form. Ella hides the remaining slipper under her bedroom floorboards.\n\nThe King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now King, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the \u201cmystery princess\u201d and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity, only to find it with her stepmother. Having deduced that Ella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella to make her head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for her stepsisters, in exchange for giving Ella's hand in marriage to Kit. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the shattered remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, who agrees to make her a [[countess]] and secure marriages for her daughters in exchange for keeping Ella hidden.\n\nThe Grand Duke and the Captain of the guards lead the search for the mystery princess by trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. At the Tremaine estate, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, but hear Ella singing ''[[Lavender's Blue]]''. The Grand Duke urges them to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return.\n\nElla and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As shown in the credits, some names differ in dialogue. -->\n\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Lady

Pictures president of production [[Sean Bailey]], studio chairman [[Alan F. Horn]] wished to make the film the \"definitive ''Cinderella'' for generations to come,\" and told him that \"if you need to spend a little more, spend it, to make sure it's one for the time capsule.\"<ref name=\"Rainey\">{{cite news|last1=Rainey|first1=James|title=Disney's Alan Horn Uses Low-Key Approach, Keen Creative Vision to Find Hits of the Future|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/alan-horn-disney-chairman-1201749971/|accessdate=December 14, 2016|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media|date=April 11, 2016|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nThree-time Oscar-winning costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] was in charge of the costumes for the film. Powell began working on concepts for the characters' looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of \"a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella's Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|website=Vanity Fair|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nFor the Fairy Godmother, Powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. The skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which Helena said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.\nFor the stepmother and stepsisters, Powell had a very clear idea about the look; \"They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside\u2014a bit too much and overdone\u2014and ugly on the inside.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh's Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> The silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colors. Some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden's eyes.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe ball gown was inspired by the Disney animated film in its color and shape; \"The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" /> The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe wedding dress was another difficult project. \"Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train\", said Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While the crew photographed James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nFor the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. Consequently, the leather shoes James wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. Alongside the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7&nbsp;million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite

The film is based on the [[Cinderella|eponymous folk tale]] and is a [[live action]] adaptation of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 animated film of the same name]].<ref name=PressKit>{{cite web|title=Cinderella: Press Release|url=http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/Cinderella/writen-material/Cinderella54dc0b6c538d2.pdf|website=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=The Walt Disney Studios|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> It features [[Lily James]] as the [[Cinderella (Disney character)|eponymous character]], with [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Richard Madden]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Holliday Grainger]], [[Derek Jacobi]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]].\n\nDevelopment for a [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action reimagining]] of the original animated film began in May 2010, with producer [[Simon Kinberg]] attached to the project. In late January 2013, Branagh signed on to direct, with Weitz hired to revise a script from [[Aline Brosh McKenna]]. In November 2012, casting began with Blanchett being the first to sign on; James was eventually cast in the titular role in April 2013. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire, England]] on September 23, 2013, and ended on December 14.\n\n''Cinderella'' had its world premiere on February 13, 2015, at the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically in the United States on March 13, 2015, and in the United Kingdom on March 27 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It grossed over $542&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming Branagh's highest-grossing film to date as a director. The film received generally  positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly James, Blanchett, and Bonham Carter), Branagh's direction, musical score, costume design, production values, and faithfulness to the original animated film. It received a nomination at the [[88th Academy Awards]], [[21st Critics' Choice Awards]] and [[69th British Academy Film Awards]], all for costume design. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nElla and her parents live a humble but happy life until her mother falls ill. Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, pushing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move to the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money and forces all their chores on Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in [[cinders]] after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her \"Cinderella\".\n\nDistraught, Ella rides off into the woods where she happens to encounter Kit, the [[crown prince]], hunting. He hides that he is a prince and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to also invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.\n\nOn the night of the ball, Ella tries to join her step-family, wearing her mother\u2019s old gown that she has refashioned, but Lady Tremaine and Drisella tear it to shreds and leave without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's stepfamily from recognizing her.\n\nAt the ball, the entire court is entranced by Ella. She dances with Kit, much to the chagrin of the Grand Duke who has already promised Kit to Princess Chelina of Zaragoza, which Lady Tremaine overhears. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella and the prince bond. Before Ella can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her slippers. Pursued by the Grand Duke and his men, Ella manages to escape home before the final stroke of midnight; the spell dissipates and everything reverts back to its true form. Ella hides the remaining slipper under her bedroom floorboards.\n\nThe King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now King, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the \u201cmystery princess\u201d and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity, only to find it with her stepmother. Having deduced that Ella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella to make her head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for her stepsisters, in exchange for giving Ella's hand in marriage to Kit. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the shattered remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, who agrees to make her a [[countess]] and secure marriages for her daughters in exchange for keeping Ella hidden.\n\nThe Grand Duke and the Captain of the guards lead the search for the mystery princess by trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. At the Tremaine estate, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, but hear Ella singing ''[[Lavender's Blue]]''. The Grand Duke urges them to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return.\n\nElla and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As shown in the credits, some names differ in dialogue. -->\n\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Lady

Pictures president of production [[Sean Bailey]], studio chairman [[Alan F.

Powell began working on concepts for the characters' looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of \"a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella's Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|website=Vanity Fair|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nFor the Fairy Godmother, Powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. The skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which Helena said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.\nFor the stepmother and stepsisters, Powell had a very clear idea about the look; \"They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside\u2014a bit too much and overdone\u2014and ugly on the inside.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh's Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> The silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colors. Some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden's eyes.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe ball gown was inspired by the Disney animated film in its color and shape; \"The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" /> The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe wedding dress was another difficult project. \"Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train\", said Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While the crew photographed James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nFor the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. Consequently, the leather shoes James wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. Alongside the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7&nbsp;million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite

These numbers are sometimes modified for alternate versions of a release, such as the multiple releases of ''The Downward Spiral''. Promotional-only releases do not have their own numbers, although the promotional singles for \"Piggy\" and \"Hurt\" were both labeled as \"Halo Ten\", a title later officially used for ''Further Down the Spiral''. A US promo for \"Into the Void\" is mislabeled as Halo 16 because this number actually belongs to the ''Things Falling Apart'' remix album.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n;''Pretty Hate Machine'' era (1989\u20131990)\n{{Further|Halo I\u2013IV}}\n* Halo 1: \"[[Down in It]]\" (1989)\n* Halo 2: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989)\n** Halo 2R: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine#Reissue|Pretty Hate Machine: Remastered]]''  (2010)\n* Halo 3: \"[[Head Like a Hole]]\" (1990)\n* Halo 4: \"[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]\" (1990)\n\n;''Broken'' era (1992)\n* Halo 5: ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]''\n* Halo 6: ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]''\n\n;''The Downward Spiral'' era (1994\u20131997)\n* Halo 7: \"[[March of the Pigs]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 8: ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994)\n** Halo 8 DE: ''The Downward Spiral: Deluxe Edition'', reissue (2004)\n** Halo 8 DVD-A: ''The Downward Spiral: [[DualDisc]]'', reissue (2004)\n* Halo 9: \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 10: ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'' (1995)\n** Halo 10 v2: ''Further Down the Spiral'', European/Australian/Japanese release\n* Halo 11: \"[[The Perfect Drug]]\" (1997)\n* Halo 12: ''[[Closure (video)|Closure]]'' (1997)\n\n;''The Fragile'' era (1999\u20132002)\n* Halo 13: \"[[The Day the World Went Away]]\" (1999)\n* Halo 14: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]]'' (1999)\n** Halo 30: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)#The Fragile: Deviations 1|The Fragile: Deviations 1]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 15: \"[[Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)|Into the Void]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 a: \"[[We're in This Together|We're in This Together CD1]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 b: \"We're in This Together CD2\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 c: \"We're in This Together CD3\" (1999)\n* Halo 16: ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'' (2000)\n* Halo 17: ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' (2002), limited edition packaged with Halo 17b\n** Halo 17a: ''And All That Could Have Been'', live CD\n** Halo 17b: ''Still'', limited edition bonus CD\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n;''With Teeth'' era (2005\u20132007)\n* Halo 18: \"[[The Hand That Feeds]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 19: ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005)\n** Halo 19 DVD-A: ''With Teeth'', DualDisc release\n* Halo 20: \"[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 21: \"[[Every Day Is Exactly the Same]]\" (2006)\n* Halo 22: ''[[Beside You in Time]]'' (2007)\n** Halo 22 HD: ''Beside You in Time'', Live Blu-ray\n\n;''Year Zero'' era (2007)\n* Halo 23: \"[[Survivalism (song)|Survivalism]]\" \n* Halo 24: ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]''\n* Halo 25: ''[[Year Zero Remixed]]''\n\n;''Ghosts I\u2013IV'' era (2008)\n* Halo 26: ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'', digital download\n** Halo 26 CD: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 2\u00d7 CD\n** Halo 26 V: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 4\u00d7 vinyl\n** Halo 26 DE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Deluxe Edition\n** Halo 26 LE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition\n\n;''The Slip'' era (2008)\n* Halo 27: ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]''\n** Halo 27 CD-LE: ''The Slip'', Limited Edition CD with bonus DVD\n\n;''Hesitation Marks'' era (2013)\n* Halo 28: ''[[Hesitation Marks]]''\n** Halo 28dcd: ''Hesitation Marks'', Deluxe Edition\n\n;The Trilogy era (2016\u20132018)\n* Halo 29: ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 31: ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017)\n* Halo 32: ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018)\n\n;''Ghosts V\u2013VI'' era (2020)\n* Halo 33: ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' (2020)\n* Halo 34: ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]]'' (2020)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Other appearances==\n<!--This section is for ORIGINAL Nine Inch Nails material created specifically for movies or other media.

These numbers are sometimes modified for alternate versions of a release, such as the multiple releases of ''The Downward Spiral''. Promotional-only releases do not have their own numbers, although the promotional singles for \"Piggy\" and \"Hurt\" were both labeled as \"Halo Ten\", a title later officially used for ''Further Down the Spiral''. A US promo for \"Into the Void\" is mislabeled as Halo 16 because this number actually belongs to the ''Things Falling Apart'' remix album.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n;''Pretty Hate Machine'' era (1989\u20131990)\n{{Further|Halo I\u2013IV}}\n* Halo 1: \"[[Down in It]]\" (1989)\n* Halo 2: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989)\n** Halo 2R: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine#Reissue|Pretty Hate Machine: Remastered]]''  (2010)\n* Halo 3: \"[[Head Like a Hole]]\" (1990)\n* Halo 4: \"[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]\" (1990)\n\n;''Broken'' era (1992)\n* Halo 5: ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]''\n* Halo 6: ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]''\n\n;''The Downward Spiral'' era (1994\u20131997)\n* Halo 7: \"[[March of the Pigs]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 8: ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994)\n** Halo 8 DE: ''The Downward Spiral: Deluxe Edition'', reissue (2004)\n** Halo 8 DVD-A: ''The Downward Spiral: [[DualDisc]]'', reissue (2004)\n* Halo 9: \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 10: ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'' (1995)\n** Halo 10 v2: ''Further Down the Spiral'', European/Australian/Japanese release\n* Halo 11: \"[[The Perfect Drug]]\" (1997)\n* Halo 12: ''[[Closure (video)|Closure]]'' (1997)\n\n;''The Fragile'' era (1999\u20132002)\n* Halo 13: \"[[The Day the World Went Away]]\" (1999)\n* Halo 14: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]]'' (1999)\n** Halo 30: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)#The Fragile: Deviations 1|The Fragile: Deviations 1]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 15: \"[[Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)|Into the Void]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 a: \"[[We're in This Together|We're in This Together CD1]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 b: \"We're in This Together CD2\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 c: \"We're in This Together CD3\" (1999)\n* Halo 16: ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'' (2000)\n* Halo 17: ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' (2002), limited edition packaged with Halo 17b\n** Halo 17a: ''And All That Could Have Been'', live CD\n** Halo 17b: ''Still'', limited edition bonus CD\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n;''With Teeth'' era (2005\u20132007)\n* Halo 18: \"[[The Hand That Feeds]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 19: ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005)\n** Halo 19 DVD-A: ''With Teeth'', DualDisc release\n* Halo 20: \"[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 21: \"[[Every Day Is Exactly the Same]]\" (2006)\n* Halo 22: ''[[Beside You in Time]]'' (2007)\n** Halo 22 HD: ''Beside You in Time'', Live Blu-ray\n\n;''Year Zero'' era (2007)\n* Halo 23: \"[[Survivalism (song)|Survivalism]]\" \n* Halo 24: ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]''\n* Halo 25: ''[[Year Zero Remixed]]''\n\n;''Ghosts I\u2013IV'' era (2008)\n* Halo 26: ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'', digital download\n** Halo 26 CD: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 2\u00d7 CD\n** Halo 26 V: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 4\u00d7 vinyl\n** Halo 26 DE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Deluxe Edition\n** Halo 26 LE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition\n\n;''The Slip'' era (2008)\n* Halo 27: ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]''\n** Halo 27 CD-LE: ''The Slip'', Limited Edition CD with bonus DVD\n\n;''Hesitation Marks'' era (2013)\n* Halo 28: ''[[Hesitation Marks]]''\n** Halo 28dcd: ''Hesitation Marks'', Deluxe Edition\n\n;The Trilogy era (2016\u20132018)\n* Halo 29: ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 31: ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017)\n* Halo 32: ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018)\n\n;''Ghosts V\u2013VI'' era (2020)\n* Halo 33: ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' (2020)\n* Halo 34: ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]]'' (2020)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Other appearances==\n<!--This section is for ORIGINAL Nine Inch Nails material created specifically for movies or other media.
