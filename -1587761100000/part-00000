The newly developed chemical Actellic 300CS would \u201cprovide at least 8 months control of pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes.\u201d McLean said: \u201cThe more effective control of mosquitoes is vital to the fight against malaria. Current tools can be highly effective but resistance threatens the effectiveness of existing products. We need innovative solutions to sustain the ground gained over malaria in recent years and to continue the push towards eventual eradication. This project amply demonstrates that IVCC\u2019s concept of covering initial risk to stimulate innovation is working and that industry has enthusiastically bought into the product development partnership model which we have pioneered for vector control.\u201d<ref name=\"malariaworld\" />\n\nIn May 2017 McLean gave a speech in [[Madrid]] emphasizing the importance of [[cost effectiveness]] in marketing insecticides.<ref>Tom McLean: NgenIRS project: need for cost-effective data and market shaping; Fundacion Ramon Areces; [https://www.fundacionareces.tv/ciencias-de-la-vida-y-de-la-materia/new-tools-to-advance-the-global-response-to-vector-borne-dis/tom-mclean-ngenirs-project-need-for-cost-effective-data-an/]</ref>\n\nIn July 2011 it was announced that the IVCC had signed an agreement with Scynexis, Inc., a [[New Jersey]] biotech firm, under which the latter would \u201cscreen its extensive chemical library\u201d in search of chemicals \u201csuitable for development into new insecticide active ingredients.\u201d McLean said: \"We look forward to working with Scynexis and are hopeful that their expertise in insecticide discovery research will yield further candidates for development as new active ingredients.
