Represented in the [[United States]] and one of several branches across the world, they believe they follow biblical precedent for their doctrine and practices and only use examples from [[Early Christianity|the early Christian church]] as described in the [[New Testament]].\n\nMore broadly, the Restoration Movement was an evangelistic and Bible-based effort launched in various places around the world as several people sought a return to the original teachings and practices of the New Testament. Christian leaders including [[Robert Sandeman (theologian)|Robert Sandeman]], [[James O'Kelly]], [[Abner Jones]], [[Elias Smith]], Rice Haggard, [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]], [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], [[Walter Scott (clergyman)|Walter Scott]], and [[Barton W. Stone]] were trailblazers of similar movements that impacted the eventual phenomenon known as the [[American Restoration Movement]].\n\nThe Restoration ideal was also similar and somewhat connected to earlier restoration efforts in Europe (such as those of [[John Glas]], Robert Haldane, and James Haldane), as well as Puritan movements in colonial America. Though differing somewhat in details, each group consisted of like-minded Christians who, although often independent of one another, had declared independence from their various denominations and the traditional [[creed]]s, seeking a fresh start to return to the doctrines and practices of the New Testament church.

[[Autonomy|autonomous]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Local church|congregations]] associated with one another through distinct beliefs and practices based on biblical examples. Represented in the [[United States]] and one of several branches across the world, they believe they follow biblical precedent for their doctrine and practices and only use examples from [[Early Christianity|the early Christian church]] as described in the [[New Testament]].\n\nMore broadly, the Restoration Movement was an evangelistic and Bible-based effort launched in various places around the world as several people sought a return to the original teachings and practices of the New Testament. Christian leaders including [[Robert Sandeman (theologian)|Robert Sandeman]], [[James O'Kelly]], [[Abner Jones]], [[Elias Smith]], Rice Haggard, [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]], [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], [[Walter Scott (clergyman)|Walter Scott]], and [[Barton W. Stone]] were trailblazers of similar movements that impacted the eventual phenomenon known as the [[American Restoration Movement]].\n\nThe Restoration ideal was also similar and somewhat connected to earlier restoration efforts in Europe (such as those of [[John Glas]], Robert Haldane, and James Haldane), as well as Puritan movements in colonial America. Though differing somewhat in details, each group consisted of like-minded Christians who, although often independent of one another, had declared independence from their various denominations and the traditional [[creed]]s, seeking a fresh start to return to the doctrines and practices of the New Testament church. They did not see themselves as establishing a new church but rather sought \"the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the original church of the New Testament.\"<ref name=\"I Just Want to Be a Christian\">[[Rubel Shelly]], ''I Just Want to Be a Christian'', 20th Century Christian, Nashville, Tennessee 1984, {{ISBN|0-89098-021-7}}</ref>{{rp|54}} The names \"Church of Christ,\" \"Christian Church,\" and \"Disciples of Christ\" were adopted by the movement because they are biblically used, rather than denominational.\n\nPrior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations associated with the Restoration Movement had been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew between those who emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church. In contrast, the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]] may consider any practice not expressly forbidden.<ref name=\"McAlister & Tucker, 1975\" />{{rp|242\u2013247}}\n\nFor example, the Christian Church uses [[musical instrument]]s in [[Christian worship|worship]] (known as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]]), whereas the Churches of Christ believe ''[[a cappella|a&nbsp;cappella]]'' singing to be proper, although some Church of Christ congregations do use instruments. In addition, there was also disagreement over the appropriateness of organizational structures above the congregational level, such as those of missionary societies and funding orphanages.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missionary Societies Controversy\" />\n\nThough not officially recognized as distinct movements until 1906, the separation of the Churches of Christ and the Christian Churches had been taking place gradually for decades.\n\nThe Restoration Movement was not a purely [[North America]]n phenomenon, and active [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] efforts began in the 18th century.<ref>In a sense the Restoration Movement began in the [[United Kingdom]] before getting traction in America. See, ''e.g.'', [[Robert Haldane#Church and ministry|Robert Haldane's influence in Scotland]].</ref> There are now Churches of Christ in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Australia]], [[South America]], [[Central America]], and [[Churches of Christ in Europe|Europe]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{quote|Members of the church of Christ do not conceive of themselves as a new church started near the beginning of the 19th century.

As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using [[organ (music)|organ]]s or [[piano]]s, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ to separate from the groups that condoned instrumental music.<ref name=WakefieldGrove>{{cite web|first=John C. |last=Wakefield |title=Stone-Campbell tradition, the |work=The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition |publisher=Grove Music Online |date=31 Jan 2014}}</ref>\n\nScriptural backing given by members for the practice of ''a cappella'' includes:\n\n* {{bibleverse|Matt|26:30|rsv}}: \"And when they had sung a [[hymn]], they went out to the [[Mount of Olives]].\"<ref name=\"Howard 1971\"/>{{rp|236}}\n* {{bibleverse|Rom|15:9|rsv}}: \"Therefore I will praise thee among the [[Gentiles]], and sing to thy name\";<ref name=\"Howard 1971\"/>{{rp|236}}\n* {{bibleverse|Eph|5:18\u201319|rsv}}: \"...&nbsp;be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in [[psalms]] and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart,\"<ref name=\"Who Are the churches of Christ\"/><ref name=\"Howard 1971\"/>{{rp|236}}\n* {{bibleverse|1 Cor|14:15|rsv}}: \"I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.\"<ref name=\"Howard 1971\"/>{{rp|236}}\n* {{bibleverse|Col|3:16|rsv}}: \"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with [[psalms]] and [[hymns]] and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.\"<ref name=\"Howard 1971\"/>{{rp|237}}\n* {{bibleverse|Heb|2:12|rsv}}: \"I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.\"<ref name=\"Howard 1971\"/>{{rp|237}}\n* {{bibleverse|Heb|13:15|rsv}}: By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.\n\nThere are congregations that permit hand-clapping and a few that use musical instruments in worship.<ref name=\"Unauthorized Guide\"/>{{rp|240}}<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Instrumental Music\"/>{{rp|417}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianchronicle.org/article555~Nation%27s_largest_Church_of_Christ_adding_instrumental_service |title=Nation's largest Church of Christ adding instrumental service |last=Ross |first=Bobby Jr |accessdate=2008-09-19 |work=christianchronicle.org |publisher=The Christian Chronicle |date=January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516174443/http://www.christianchronicle.org/article555~Nation%27s_largest_Church_of_Christ_adding_instrumental_service |archivedate=2013-05-16 |df= }}</ref>  Some of the latter describe themselves as a \"Church of Christ (Instrumental)\".<ref name=\"Hawkins 2008\"/>{{rp|667}}\n\n===Other theological tendencies===\n[[File:Millennial views.svg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Post-tribulation Premillennialism places the millennium after the tribulation and between the second coming of Christ and the last judgment; Pre-tribulational Premillennialism places the second coming of Christ ''for the church'' before the tribulation, the second coming of Christ ''with the church'' after the tribulation, with the millennium following and the last judgment coming at the end of the millennium; Postmillennialism places the second coming of Christ and the last judgment together at the end of the millennium; Amillennialism has an extended symbolic millennium that ends with the second coming of Christ and the last judgment. |Churches of Christ are generally [[Amillennialism|''amillennial'']].]]\n{{quote|Churches of Christ avoid the term \"theology\", preferring instead the term \"doctrine\": theology is what humans say about the Bible; doctrine is simply what the Bible says.|''Encyclopedia of Religion in the South''<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Religion in the South\"/>{{rp|213}}}}  Many leaders argue that the Churches of Christ only follow the Bible and have no \"theology\".<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Theology\">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

The river forms from the confluence of two creeks a few miles west of the town. The Chunky River has little development along its shores, and is used for canoeing and kayaking. While the river is shallow, occasionally, there are sections where the paddle will not reach the bottom. One such section is known as the \"Deep Eddy\". Otherwise, the river is seldom deeper than a few feet, and where there are mild rapids, the river may only be a few inches in depth. There is a public landing east of town on the Highway 80 bridge, and another public landing {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} farther east, at another Highway 80 bridge. This section of river is known as the \"Seven Mile Bend\", although it is approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} in length. The ease of accessibility makes this area the most used section of the river.\n\n==Education==\nThe Town of Chunky is served by the [[Newton County School District]], though some of the households within the 39323 postal district are in the West Lauderdale school district, part of the [[Lauderdale County School District (Mississippi)|Lauderdale County School District]].\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Railroads===\nThe [[Kansas City Southern Railroad]] goes through Chunky.  Approximately 25 freight trains per day travel through the town.  On each side of Chunky, there are {{convert|9000|ft|m|adj=on}} sidings at Meehan Junction to the east, and Hickory to the west.  The railroad crosses the Chunky River in two places just east of town, and between these two trestles is a very popular photography spot for train buffs to take photos of the trains as they cross the river.  The railroad crosses the Chunky River west of town on a much smaller trestle, known locally as \"break down\".  It was on this site that the trestle collapsed under a troop-carrying train of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War]]; the wreck is called the [[Chunky Creek Train Wreck of 1863]].

However, among the press and fans the tour is widely known as the 'Stones Touring Party 1972', derived from the laminates handed out by the management to crew, family, friends and press, granting access to the various area's at the concert venues and hotels. 'Stones Touring Party' was then shortened to 'STP', the street name of the drug [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine]], where STP stands for \"Serenity, Tranquility and Peace\". In 2015 [[Jose Cuervo]] in association with the Rolling Stones launched a brand of tequila with a marketing campaign stating that the STP Tour was known as the 'tequila sunrise tour'. This statement does not hold any historical truth.\n\n==Coverage==\n[[File:Jagger-early Stones.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mick Jagger at [[Winterland Ballroom]], June 1972]]\n\nSeveral writers were assigned to cover the tour. [[Truman Capote]] was commissioned to write a travelogue for ''[[Rolling Stone]].'' Accompanied by prominent New York socialites [[Lee Radziwill]] and [[Peter Beard]], Capote did not mesh well with the group; he and his entourage abandoned the tour in [[New Orleans]] before resurfacing for the final shows at Madison Square Garden.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5-Nx8AUNAHIC&pg=PT353&dq=truman+capote+rolling+stones+madison+square+garden#v=onepage&q=truman%20capote%20rolling%20stones%20madison%20square%20garden&f=false | title=Old Gods Almost Dead: The 40-Year Odyssey of the Rolling Stones| isbn=9780767909563| last1=Davis| first1=Stephen| date=11 December 2001}}</ref> Having struggled with [[writer's block]] since the publication of ''[[In Cold Blood]]'' in 1966, he failed to complete his feature, tentatively titled \"It Will Soon Be Here.\" ''Rolling Stone'' ultimately recouped its stake by assigning Andy Warhol to interview Capote about the tour in 1973. In the interview, Capote alleged that tour doctor Laurence Badgley (a 1968 graduate of the [[Yale School of Medicine]] who was later retained by [[Led Zeppelin]] for their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|\n1977 North American tour]])<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-badgley-m-d</ref> had a \"super-[[Lolita]] complex\" and initiated the [[statutory rape]] of a high school student (also filmed by [[Robert Frank]]) on the band's [[business jet]] during a flight to Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=t2CaFeDa_m0C&pg=PT68&lpg=PT68&dq=%22it+developed+that+he+had+a+super-lolita+complex%22#v=onepage&q=%22it%20developed%20that%20he%20had%20a%20super-lolita%20complex%22&f=false |title = The Rolling Stone Interviews|isbn = 9780316023139|last1 = Wenner|first1 = Jann S.|date = November 2007}}</ref> \n\n[[Terry Southern]], a close friend of Keith Richards since the late 1960s, wrote about the tour for ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' in what proved to be one of his last major journalistic assignments. Southern and Beard developed a friendship on the tour and collaborated intermittently on ''The End of the Game'' (an unfilmed screenplay) for over two decades.\n\n[[Robert Greenfield]]'s ''S.T.P.: A Journey Through America With The Rolling Stones'' (derived from his tour reportage for ''Rolling Stone'') was published in 1974. Greenfield had already covered the band's [[The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971|1971 British Tour]] for ''Rolling Stone'' and was granted unlimited access to the band's affairs. Although Greenfield was initially assigned as the magazine's sole correspondent for the tour before a last-minute deal was reached with Capote, he was permitted to continue in his assignment, paralleling [[Hunter S. Thompson]] and [[Timothy Crouse]]'s two-pronged coverage of the contemporaneous [[1972 United States presidential election]] for the magazine.\n\n[[Dick Cavett]] hosted a one-hour special shot before the concluding New York engagement of performances. Capote appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and several other talk shows, talking about his experiences on the tour. New York radio host [[Alex Bennett (broadcaster)|Alex Bennett]] reported on the first Madison Square Garden show as soon as he got back from it.\n\n==Filming==\nNo live album was released from the tour at the time, although one was planned as far as having a front and back cover designed and studio touch-ups being made on several recorded tracks. Eventually, the album was shelved due to contractual disputes with [[Allen Klein]].\n\nTwo films of the tour were produced. The concert film ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones]]!'' only saw a limited theatrical release in 1974. Aside from an Australian VHS release in the early 1980s, it wasn't officially available on home video until 2010. The film's complete soundtrack was released as an album by Eagle Records/Universal in 2017.\n\nRobert Frank's ''[[Cocksucker Blues]]'' is a documentary shot in ''[[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]'' style; several cameras were available for anyone in the entourage to pick up and start shooting backstage parties, drug use,<ref name=\"CB\">{{cite web| last =  | first = |title=The Trouble With 'Cocksucker Blues'| publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |date= 3 November 1977|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-trouble-with-cocksucker-blues-19771103| accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> and roadie and groupie antics,<ref name=\"DF\">{{cite web| last = Fricke | first = David |title= The Greatest Rolling Stones Movie You've Never Seen: 'Cocksucker Blues'| publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=20 November 2012|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/the-greatest-rolling-stones-movie-youve-never-seen-cocksucker-blues-20121120 | accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> including a groupie in a hotel room injecting heroin.<ref name=\"PD\">{{cite web| last = Doyle | first = Patrick |title= Rolling Stones' Controversial Tour Documentary \"Cocksucker Blues\" Screens in New York | publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |date =26 October 2009 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-stones-controversial-tour-documentary-cocksucker-blues-screens-in-new-york-20091026| accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> The film came under a court order which forbade it from being shown other than in very restricted circumstances.

The Rolling Stones/Stevie Wonder (1972)|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> This placement, along with his hard-edged hit \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" (released in October 1972), did much to increase Wonder's visibility to rock audiences. He and his band would also sometimes join the Stones at the end of the group's performance for an encore medley of Wonder's 1966 hit \"[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\".\n\n==Tour set list==\n[[File:Mick Taylor2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Taylor playing slide guitar with the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden, 1972]]\nThe standard [[set list]] for the tour was:\n\n# \"[[Brown Sugar (song)|Brown Sugar]]\"\n# \"[[Bitch (Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\"\n# \"[[Rocks Off]]\"\n# \"[[Gimme Shelter]]\"\n# \"[[Happy (Rolling Stones)|Happy]]\"\n# \"[[Tumbling Dice]]\"\n# \"[[Love in Vain]]\"\n# \"[[Sweet Virginia]]\"\n# \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\"\n# \"[[All Down the Line]]\"\n# \"[[Midnight Rambler]]\"\n# \"[[Rockin' at the Hops|Bye Bye Johnny]]\"\n# \"[[Rip This Joint]]\"\n# \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\"\n# \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\"\n# Encore: often none, sometimes \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\", a few times \"[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]\" / \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\"\n\nAdditional songs performed:\n* \"[[Loving Cup (song)|Loving Cup]]\" (Vancouver, 3 June; both shows in Seattle, 4 June; Winterland in San Francisco, 8 June, second show)\n* \"[[Ventilator Blues]]\" (only on opening night in Vancouver, 3 June)\n* \"[[Torn and Frayed]]\" (only on opening night in Vancouver, 3 June)\n* \"[[Dead Flowers (Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]\" (only in Fort Worth, 24 June, first show)\n* \"[[Sweet Black Angel]]\" (only in Fort Worth, 24 June, first show)\n* \"[[Don't You Lie to Me]]\" ([[Tampa Red]] Cover) (only in Fort Worth, 24 June, second show)\n\nThe exact number of setlist variations are subject to ongoing research. Notably absent was anything from before 1968 in the Stones' catalog save for the occasional presence of \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". This tour also marked the banishment of their dark epic \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\", which had been wrongly associated with the [[Meredith Curly Hunter, Jr.|killing at Altamont]], from Stones' American performances for much of the 1970s.\n\nThe tour grossed a then-record of $4 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\">{{cite book|last=Wyman|first=Bill|title=Rolling With the Stones|year=2002|publisher= Dorling Kindersley|isbn=0-7513-4646-2}}p. 398.</ref>\n\n==Tour dates==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"100\"|Opening Act\n|-\n| 3 June 1972\n| [[Vancouver]]\n| Canada\n| [[Pacific Coliseum]]\n| rowspan=\"39\" |[[Stevie Wonder]]\n|-\n| 4 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Seattle]]\n| rowspan=\"28\"|United States\n| [[Seattle Center Coliseum]]\n|-\n| 6 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| rowspan=\"2\"|San Francisco\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Winterland Ballroom]]\n|-\n| 8 June 1972<br />2 shows\n|-\n| 9 June 1972\n| Los Angeles\n| [[Hollywood Palladium]]\n|-\n| 10 June 1972\n| [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]\n| [[Long Beach Arena]]\n|-\n| 11 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]\n| [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]]\n|-\n| 13 June 1972\n| [[San Diego]]\n| [[San Diego Sports Arena|International Sports Arena]]\n|-\n| 14 June 1972\n| [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]\n| [[Tucson Convention Center]]\n|-\n| 15 June 1972\n| [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]\n| [[The Pit (arena)|University Arena]]<!--\"The Pit\" didn't become the official name until 2009.-->\n|-\n| 16 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Denver]]\n| [[Denver Coliseum]]\n|-\n| 18 June 1972\n| [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]]\n| [[Metropolitan Sports Center]]\n|-\n| 19 June 1972\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Chicago]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[International Amphitheatre]]\n|-\n| 20 June 1972<br />2 shows\n|-\n| 22 June 1972\n| [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]\n| [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City, Missouri)|Municipal Auditorium]]\n|-\n| 24 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]\n| [[Tarrant County Convention Center]]\n|-\n| 25 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Houston]]\n| [[Hofheinz Pavilion]]\n|-\n| 27 June 1972\n| [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]\n| [[Mobile Civic Center]]\n|-\n| 28 June 1972\n| [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]\n| [[Coleman Coliseum|Memorial Coliseum]]\n|-\n| 29 June 1972\n| [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]\n| [[Nashville Municipal Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]]\n|-\n| 4 July 1972\n| Washington, D.C.\n| [[Robert F.

However, among the press and fans the tour is widely known as the 'Stones Touring Party 1972', derived from the laminates handed out by the management to crew, family, friends and press, granting access to the various area's at the concert venues and hotels. 'Stones Touring Party' was then shortened to 'STP', the street name of the drug 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, where STP stands for \"Serenity, Tranquility and Peace\". In 2015 [[Jose Cuervo]] in association with the Rolling Stones launched a brand of tequila with a marketing campaign stating that the STP Tour was known as the 'tequila sunrise tour'. This statement does not hold any historical truth.\n\n==Coverage==\n[[File:Jagger-early Stones.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mick Jagger at [[Winterland Ballroom]], June 1972]]\n\nSeveral writers were assigned to cover the tour. [[Truman Capote]] was commissioned to write a travelogue for ''[[Rolling Stone]].'' Accompanied by prominent New York socialites [[Lee Radziwill]] and [[Peter Beard]], Capote did not mesh well with the group; he and his entourage abandoned the tour in [[New Orleans]] before resurfacing for the final shows at Madison Square Garden.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5-Nx8AUNAHIC&pg=PT353&dq=truman+capote+rolling+stones+madison+square+garden#v=onepage&q=truman%20capote%20rolling%20stones%20madison%20square%20garden&f=false | title=Old Gods Almost Dead: The 40-Year Odyssey of the Rolling Stones| isbn=9780767909563| last1=Davis| first1=Stephen| date=11 December 2001}}</ref> Having struggled with [[writer's block]] since the publication of ''[[In Cold Blood]]'' in 1966, he failed to complete his feature, tentatively titled \"It Will Soon Be Here.\" ''Rolling Stone'' ultimately recouped its stake by assigning Andy Warhol to interview Capote about the tour in 1973. In the interview, Capote alleged that tour doctor Laurence Badgley (a 1968 graduate of the [[Yale School of Medicine]] who was later retained by [[Led Zeppelin]] for their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|\n1977 North American tour]])<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-badgley-m-d</ref> had a \"super-[[Lolita]] complex\" and initiated the [[statutory rape]] of a high school student (also filmed by [[Robert Frank]]) on the band's [[business jet]] during a flight to Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=t2CaFeDa_m0C&pg=PT68&lpg=PT68&dq=%22it+developed+that+he+had+a+super-lolita+complex%22#v=onepage&q=%22it%20developed%20that%20he%20had%20a%20super-lolita%20complex%22&f=false |title = The Rolling Stone Interviews|isbn = 9780316023139|last1 = Wenner|first1 = Jann S.|date = November 2007}}</ref> \n\n[[Terry Southern]], a close friend of Keith Richards since the late 1960s, wrote about the tour for ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' in what proved to be one of his last major journalistic assignments. Southern and Beard developed a friendship on the tour and collaborated intermittently on ''The End of the Game'' (an unfilmed screenplay) for over two decades.\n\n[[Robert Greenfield]]'s ''S.T.P.: A Journey Through America With The Rolling Stones'' (derived from his tour reportage for ''Rolling Stone'') was published in 1974. Greenfield had already covered the band's [[The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971|1971 British Tour]] for ''Rolling Stone'' and was granted unlimited access to the band's affairs. Although Greenfield was initially assigned as the magazine's sole correspondent for the tour before a last-minute deal was reached with Capote, he was permitted to continue in his assignment, paralleling [[Hunter S. Thompson]] and [[Timothy Crouse]]'s two-pronged coverage of the contemporaneous [[1972 United States presidential election]] for the magazine.\n\n[[Dick Cavett]] hosted a one-hour special shot before the concluding New York engagement of performances. Capote appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and several other talk shows, talking about his experiences on the tour. New York radio host [[Alex Bennett (broadcaster)|Alex Bennett]] reported on the first Madison Square Garden show as soon as he got back from it.\n\n==Filming==\nNo live album was released from the tour at the time, although one was planned as far as having a front and back cover designed and studio touch-ups being made on several recorded tracks. Eventually, the album was shelved due to contractual disputes with [[Allen Klein]].\n\nTwo films of the tour were produced. The concert film ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones]]!'' only saw a limited theatrical release in 1974. Aside from an Australian VHS release in the early 1980s, it wasn't officially available on home video until 2010. The film's complete soundtrack was released as an album by Eagle Records/Universal in 2017.\n\nRobert Frank's ''[[Cocksucker Blues]]'' is a documentary shot in ''[[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]'' style; several cameras were available for anyone in the entourage to pick up and start shooting backstage parties, drug use,<ref name=\"CB\">{{cite web| last =  | first = |title=The Trouble With 'Cocksucker Blues'| publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |date= 3 November 1977|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-trouble-with-cocksucker-blues-19771103| accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> and roadie and groupie antics,<ref name=\"DF\">{{cite web| last = Fricke | first = David |title= The Greatest Rolling Stones Movie You've Never Seen: 'Cocksucker Blues'| publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=20 November 2012|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/the-greatest-rolling-stones-movie-youve-never-seen-cocksucker-blues-20121120 | accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> including a groupie in a hotel room injecting heroin.<ref name=\"PD\">{{cite web| last = Doyle | first = Patrick |title= Rolling Stones' Controversial Tour Documentary \"Cocksucker Blues\" Screens in New York | publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |date =26 October 2009 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-stones-controversial-tour-documentary-cocksucker-blues-screens-in-new-york-20091026| accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> The film came under a court order which forbade it from being shown other than in very restricted circumstances.

The Rolling Stones/Stevie Wonder (1972)|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> This placement, along with his hard-edged hit \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" (released in October 1972), did much to increase Wonder's visibility to rock audiences. He and his band would also sometimes join the Stones at the end of the group's performance for an encore medley of Wonder's 1966 hit \"[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\".\n\n==Tour set list==\n[[File:Mick Taylor2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Taylor playing slide guitar with the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden, 1972]]\nThe standard [[set list]] for the tour was:\n\n# \"[[Brown Sugar (song)|Brown Sugar]]\"\n# \"[[Bitch (Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\"\n# \"[[Rocks Off]]\"\n# \"[[Gimme Shelter]]\"\n# \"[[Happy (Rolling Stones)|Happy]]\"\n# \"[[Tumbling Dice]]\"\n# \"[[Love in Vain]]\"\n# \"[[Sweet Virginia]]\"\n# \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\"\n# \"[[All Down the Line]]\"\n# \"[[Midnight Rambler]]\"\n# \"[[Rockin' at the Hops|Bye Bye Johnny]]\"\n# \"[[Rip This Joint]]\"\n# \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\"\n# \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\"\n# Encore: often none, sometimes \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\", a few times \"[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]\" / \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\"\n\nAdditional songs performed:\n* \"[[Loving Cup (song)|Loving Cup]]\" (Vancouver, 3 June; both shows in Seattle, 4 June; Winterland in San Francisco, 8 June, second show)\n* \"[[Ventilator Blues]]\" (only on opening night in Vancouver, 3 June)\n* \"[[Torn and Frayed]]\" (only on opening night in Vancouver, 3 June)\n* \"[[Dead Flowers (Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]\" (only in Fort Worth, 24 June, first show)\n* \"[[Sweet Black Angel]]\" (only in Fort Worth, 24 June, first show)\n* \"[[Don't You Lie to Me]]\" ([[Tampa Red]] Cover) (only in Fort Worth, 24 June, second show)\n\nThe exact number of setlist variations are subject to ongoing research. Notably absent was anything from before 1968 in the Stones' catalog save for the occasional presence of \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". This tour also marked the banishment of their dark epic \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\", which had been wrongly associated with the [[Meredith Curly Hunter, Jr.|killing at Altamont]], from Stones' American performances for much of the 1970s.\n\nThe tour grossed a then-record of $4 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\">{{cite book|last=Wyman|first=Bill|title=Rolling With the Stones|year=2002|publisher= Dorling Kindersley|isbn=0-7513-4646-2}}p. 398.</ref>\n\n==Tour dates==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"200\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n! width=\"100\"|Opening Act\n|-\n| 3 June 1972\n| [[Vancouver]]\n| Canada\n| [[Pacific Coliseum]]\n| rowspan=\"39\" |[[Stevie Wonder]]\n|-\n| 4 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Seattle]]\n| rowspan=\"28\"|United States\n| [[Seattle Center Coliseum]]\n|-\n| 6 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| rowspan=\"2\"|San Francisco\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Winterland Ballroom]]\n|-\n| 8 June 1972<br />2 shows\n|-\n| 9 June 1972\n| Los Angeles\n| [[Hollywood Palladium]]\n|-\n| 10 June 1972\n| [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]\n| [[Long Beach Arena]]\n|-\n| 11 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]\n| [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]]\n|-\n| 13 June 1972\n| [[San Diego]]\n| [[San Diego Sports Arena|International Sports Arena]]\n|-\n| 14 June 1972\n| [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]\n| [[Tucson Convention Center]]\n|-\n| 15 June 1972\n| [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]\n| [[The Pit (arena)|University Arena]]<!--\"The Pit\" didn't become the official name until 2009.-->\n|-\n| 16 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Denver]]\n| [[Denver Coliseum]]\n|-\n| 18 June 1972\n| [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]]\n| [[Metropolitan Sports Center]]\n|-\n| 19 June 1972\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Chicago]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[International Amphitheatre]]\n|-\n| 20 June 1972<br />2 shows\n|-\n| 22 June 1972\n| [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]\n| [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City, Missouri)|Municipal Auditorium]]\n|-\n| 24 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]\n| [[Tarrant County Convention Center]]\n|-\n| 25 June 1972<br />2 shows\n| [[Houston]]\n| [[Hofheinz Pavilion]]\n|-\n| 27 June 1972\n| [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]\n| [[Mobile Civic Center]]\n|-\n| 28 June 1972\n| [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]\n| [[Coleman Coliseum|Memorial Coliseum]]\n|-\n| 29 June 1972\n| [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]\n| [[Nashville Municipal Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]]\n|-\n| 4 July 1972\n| Washington, D.C.\n| [[Robert F.
