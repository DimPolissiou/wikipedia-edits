It portrays a fictionalized account of her historical encounter with [[English people|Englishman]] [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] settlers that arrived from the [[Virginia Company]]. The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on June 16, 1995. It is the 33rd [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and the sixth film produced and released during the period known as the [[Disney Renaissance]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Mike Gabriel]] and [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]]. The voice cast stars [[Irene Bedard]] and [[Mel Gibson]] as Pocahontas and Smith, respectively, with [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Russell Means]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Billy Connolly]] and [[Linda Hunt]] providing other voices. The score was written by [[Alan Menken]], who also wrote the film's songs along with [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]].\n\nAfter making his [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' (1990), Gabriel conceived the film during a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend. The project went into development concurrently with ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994) and attracted most of Disney's top animators. Meanwhile, Disney studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] decided the film should be a serious romantic epic in the vein of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), in hope that, like ''Beauty'', it would also be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Screenwriters [[Carl Binder]], [[Susannah Grant]], and [[Philip LaZebnik]] took creative liberties with history in an attempt to make the film palatable to audiences.\n\n''Pocahontas'' received mixed reactions from reviewers, who praised its animation, musical score, songs and female heroine but criticized its story, lack of historical accuracy, and racial overtones. Despite this, ''Pocahontas'' was a commercial success, earning $346 million at the box office and has become the most well-known adaptation of the Pocahontas story. The film received two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Musical or Comedy Score]] for Menken and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Colors of the Wind]]\". A [[Disney's Pocahontas (video game)|video game]] based on ''Pocahontas'' was released across various platforms, and the film itself was followed by a [[direct-to-video]] sequel titled ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]'' in 1998. According to critics, ''Pocahontas'' has influenced subsequent films.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1607, the ''[[Susan Constant]]'' sails from [[London]] to the [[New World]], carrying English settlers from the [[Virginia Company]]. On board are Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and the voyage's greedy leader [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]], who seeks gold as part of his plan to bring him wealth and status. Along the way, the ''Susan Constant'' is caught in a [[Nor'easter|North Atlantic storm]] and John saves young, inexperienced crewmate Thomas from drowning. As they approach the New World, the settlers, including John, talk of adventure, finding gold, fighting \"[[Indian nation|Injuns]]\" and potentially settling in the new land.\n\nIn the [[Powhatan]] tribe in [[Tsenacommacah]], North America, [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the daughter of [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]], fears being possibly wed to Kocoum, a brave warrior whom she sees as too serious for her own free-spirited personality. Powhatan gives Pocahontas her mother's necklace as a present. Pocahontas, along with her friends, the [[raccoon]] Meeko and [[hummingbird]] Flit, visit Grandmother Willow, a spiritual talking [[willow tree]] and speaks of a dream involving a spinning arrow and her confusion regarding what her path in life should be. Grandmother Willow then alerts Pocahontas to the arriving English.\n\nRatcliffe has [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] built in a wooded clearing and immediately has the crewmen dig for gold. John departs to explore the wilderness and encounters Pocahontas. They quickly bond, fascinated by each other's worlds and end up falling in love, despite Powhatan's orders to stay away from the Englishmen after Kocoum and other warriors engage them in a fight. Meanwhile, Meeko meets Percy, Ratcliffe's pet [[pug]] and becomes the bane of his existence. When John tells Pocahontas that he and his men are here to find gold, she tells him that there is no gold. Pocahontas introduces John to Grandmother Willow and avoids two other crewmen, but Pocahontas's best friend Nakoma discovers her relationship with John and warns Kocoum. Ratcliffe also learns of John's encounters with Pocahontas and angrily warns John against sparing any natives he comes across on pain of death.\n\nLater, John and Pocahontas meet with Grandmother Willow and plan to bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. John and Pocahontas share a kiss, while Kocoum and Thomas, sent by Ratcliffe to spy on John, witness from afar. Furious, Kocoum, screaming a [[battle cry]], attacks and attempts to kill John, but Thomas intervenes with his [[musket]] and kills Kocoum, who destroys Pocahontas's necklace in the process. John orders Thomas to leave just before the tribesmen arrive, capture John and retrieve Kocoum's body. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan declares war on the English, beginning with John's execution at sunrise.\n\nThomas reaches Jamestown safely at night and warns the English settlers of John's capture. Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their non-existent gold. That same night, Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle. A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow, where Meeko hands her John's compass. Pocahontas realizes John's compass was the spinning arrow from her real life encounter, which leads to her destiny. Morning comes, and Powhatan and his tribe drag John to a cliff overlooking a clearing for execution. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to the cliff to fight Powhatan's warriors. Just as Powhatan is about to execute John, Pocahontas intervenes and finally convinces him to end the fighting between the two groups and to spare John's life. Everyone accepts gratefully and John is released; when the unmoved Ratcliffe orders his men to attack, they refuse to. Enraged, Ratcliffe fires a musket at Powhatan, but John shields him and is hit instead. The settlers, livid at Ratcliffe, turn on him and arrest him for hurting their comrade.\n\nJohn is nursed back to health by the tribe, but must return to England for further treatment if he is to survive. Ratcliffe is also sent back to England to face punishment for his crimes against the settlement. John asks Pocahontas to come with him, but she chooses to stay with her tribe. Meeko and Percy, now friends, give Pocahontas her mother's necklace completely fixed. John leaves without Pocahontas but with Powhatan's blessing to return anytime he likes. The film ends with Pocahontas standing atop a cliff, watching the ship carrying John depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Irene Bedard]] as [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the daughter of Chief Powhatan.

The Powhatans promised the starving colonists would be given corn, but were ambushed. Ratcliffe was tied to a stake in front of a fire. Women removed the skin from his entire body with mussel shells and tossed the pieces into the flame as he watched. They skinned his face last and finally burned him at the stake.\n\nIn the sequel, ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]'', it depicts Pocahontas volunteering to go to England in her father's place. In reality, she was kidnapped by colonists due to conflict between the settlers and the Natives. Despite Powhatan's surrender of prisoners and weapons the Natives stole, the colonists were not satisfied and Pocahontas was taken to the town of Henricus. She converted to Christianity and took the name \"Rebecca\". She married Rolfe and they had a son together, Thomas. The ending of the sequel features them on their way back to Jamestown, but in reality, Pocahontas became seriously ill and was unable to travel.

It portrays a fictionalized account of her historical encounter with [[English people|Englishman]] [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] settlers that arrived from the [[Virginia Company]]. The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on June 16, 1995. It is the 33rd [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and the sixth film produced and released during the period known as the [[Disney Renaissance]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Mike Gabriel]] and [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]]. The voice cast stars [[Irene Bedard]] and [[Mel Gibson]] as Pocahontas and Smith, respectively, with [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Russell Means]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Billy Connolly]] and [[Linda Hunt]] providing other voices. The score was written by [[Alan Menken]], who also wrote the film's songs along with [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]].\n\nAfter making his [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' (1990), Gabriel conceived the film during a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend. The project went into development concurrently with ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994) and attracted most of Disney's top animators. Meanwhile, Disney studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] decided the film should be a serious romantic epic in the vein of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), in hope that, like ''Beauty'', it would also be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Screenwriters [[Carl Binder]], [[Susannah Grant]], and [[Philip LaZebnik]] took creative liberties with history in an attempt to make the film palatable to audiences.\n\n''Pocahontas'' received mixed reactions from reviewers, who praised its animation, musical score, songs and female heroine but criticized its story, lack of historical accuracy, and racial overtones. Despite this, ''Pocahontas'' was a commercial success, earning $346 million at the box office and has become the most well-known adaptation of the Pocahontas story. The film received two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Musical or Comedy Score]] for Menken and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Colors of the Wind]]\". A [[Disney's Pocahontas (video game)|video game]] based on ''Pocahontas'' was released across various platforms, and the film itself was followed by a [[direct-to-video]] sequel titled ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]'' in 1998. According to critics, ''Pocahontas'' has influenced subsequent films.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1607, the ''[[Susan Constant]]'' sails from [[London]] to the [[New World]], carrying English settlers from the [[Virginia Company]]. On board are Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and the voyage's greedy leader [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]], who seeks gold as part of his plan to bring him wealth and status. Along the way, the ''Susan Constant'' is caught in a [[Nor'easter|North Atlantic storm]] and John saves young, inexperienced crewmate Thomas from drowning. As they approach the New World, the settlers, including John, talk of adventure, finding gold, fighting \"[[Indian nation|Injuns]]\" and potentially settling in the new land.\n\nIn the [[Powhatan]] tribe in [[Tsenacommacah]], North America, [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the daughter of [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]], fears being possibly wed to Kocoum, a brave warrior whom she sees as too serious for her own free-spirited personality. Powhatan gives Pocahontas her mother's necklace as a present. Pocahontas, along with her friends, the [[raccoon]] Meeko and [[hummingbird]] Flit, visit Grandmother Willow, a spiritual talking [[willow tree]] and speaks of a dream involving a spinning arrow and her confusion regarding what her path in life should be. Grandmother Willow then alerts Pocahontas to the arriving English.\n\nRatcliffe has [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] built in a wooded clearing and immediately has the crewmen dig for gold. John departs to explore the wilderness and encounters Pocahontas. They quickly bond, fascinated by each other's worlds and end up falling in love, despite Powhatan's orders to stay away from the Englishmen after Kocoum and other warriors engage them in a fight. Meanwhile, Meeko meets Percy, Ratcliffe's pet [[pug]] and becomes the bane of his existence. When John tells Pocahontas that he and his men are here to find gold, she tells him that there is no gold. Pocahontas introduces John to Grandmother Willow and avoids two other crewmen, but Pocahontas's best friend Nakoma discovers her relationship with John and warns Kocoum. Ratcliffe also learns of John's encounters with Pocahontas and angrily warns John against sparing any natives he comes across on pain of death.\n\nLater, John and Pocahontas meet with Grandmother Willow and plan to bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. John and Pocahontas share a kiss, while Kocoum and Thomas, sent by Ratcliffe to spy on John, witness from afar. Furious, Kocoum, screaming a [[battle cry]], attacks and attempts to kill John, but Thomas intervenes with his [[musket]] and kills Kocoum, who destroys Pocahontas's necklace in the process. John orders Thomas to leave just before the tribesmen arrive, capture John and retrieve Kocoum's body. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan declares war on the English, beginning with John's execution at sunrise.\n\nThomas reaches Jamestown safely at night and warns the English settlers of John's capture. Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their non-existent gold. That same night, Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle. A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow, where Meeko hands her John's compass. Pocahontas realizes John's compass was the spinning arrow from her real life encounter, which leads to her destiny. Morning comes, and Powhatan and his tribe drag John to a cliff overlooking a clearing for execution. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to the cliff to fight Powhatan's warriors. Just as Powhatan is about to execute John, Pocahontas intervenes and finally convinces him to end the fighting between the two groups and to spare John's life. Everyone accepts gratefully and John is released; when the unmoved Ratcliffe orders his men to attack, they refuse to. Enraged, Ratcliffe fires a musket at Powhatan, but John shields him and is hit instead. The settlers, livid at Ratcliffe, turn on him and arrest him for hurting their comrade.\n\nJohn is nursed back to health by the tribe, but must return to England for further treatment if he is to survive. Ratcliffe is also sent back to England to face punishment for his crimes against the settlement. John asks Pocahontas to come with him, but she chooses to stay with her tribe. Meeko and Percy, now friends, give Pocahontas her mother's necklace completely fixed. John leaves without Pocahontas but with Powhatan's blessing to return anytime he likes. The film ends with Pocahontas standing atop a cliff, watching the ship carrying John depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Irene Bedard]] as [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], the daughter of Chief Powhatan.
