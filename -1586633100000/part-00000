It is determined either with a stop-watch, recording the result of the times of a number of bowls from the point of deliver to the point of coming to rest, or using a timing ramp.  The result will be a time, in seconds, usually to 2 decimal places.\n* {{Anchor|Timing ramp|timing ramp}} '''timing ramp''': a custom designed piece of equipment that calculated the ''[[#speed|speed]]'' of the ''[[#green|green]]''.  the ramp uses a ball, which is delivered down the ramp in several locations on the green, and a calculation table is then used to convert the results into a time, in seconds.

Derived from the fact that bowls were once made using a dense hardwood, ''[[#lignum vitae|lignum vitae]]''.\n* {{Anchor|Wrong bias|wrong bias}} '''wrong bias''': a bowl delivered where the biased side of the bowl has been placed opposite to the desired position for a given delivery.  If a right handed player plays a forehand delivery, but has the biased side of the bowl on the right, the bowls bias will take an arc away from the intended target, and in most cases, outside the rink boundary.  As well as becoming a dead bowl, the person delivering the bowl is sometimes subjected to gentle \"ridicule\".  Clubs may also have a \"house rule\" with a penalty for a witnessed \"wrong bias\" such as a fine into a charity jar, or buying a drink for your opponents.\n{{Glossary end}}\n{{Compact ToC|side=yes|center=yes|top=yes|symnum=yes|refs=yes|nobreak=yes|x=X}}\n==X==\n{{Glossary}}\n* {{Anchor|Xtra Heavy|xtra Heavy}} '''xtra Heavy''': describes the physical weight of the bowl compared to other bowls of the same size.

{"title_page": "Social equality", "text_new": "\n\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''Social equality''' is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific [[Society|society]] or isolated group have the same status in possibly all respects, possibly including [[civil rights]], [[freedom of speech]], [[property rights]] and equal access to certain [[social goods]] and [[social services]]. However, it may also include [[health equality]], [[economic equality]] and other social securities. Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced [[social class]] or [[caste]] boundaries and the absence of [[discrimination]] motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity.<ref name=\"Blackford\">{{cite journal|last1=Blackford|first1=Russell|date=July 20, 2006|title=Genetic enhancement and the point of social equality|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/689/%20Genetic%20enhancement%20and%20the%20point%20of%20social%20equality|journal=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> For example, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, [[caste]] or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability must absolutely not result in [[equal justice under law|unequal treatment under the law]] and should not reduce opportunities unjustifiably.\n\n''[[Equal opportunity|Equal opportunities]]'' is interpreted as being judged by ability, which is compatible with a [[free market]] economy. Relevant problems are [[horizontal inequality]] \u2212 the inequality of two persons of ''same'' origin and ability and differing opportunities given to individuals \u2212 such as in (education) or by inherited capital.\n\n==Ontological==\nThe standard of equality that states everyone is created equal at birth is called '''ontological equality'''. This type of equality can be seen in many different places like the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. This early document, which states many of the values of the [[United States of America]], has this idea of equality embedded in it. It clearly states that \"[https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/ all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights]\". The statement reflects the philosophy of [[John Locke]] and his idea that we are all equal in certain [[natural rights theory|natural rights]].  Although this standard of equality is seen in documents as important as the Declaration of Independence, it is \"one not often invoked in policy debates these days\".<ref name=YMAY>{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself|date=2013|publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]]|location=New York|edition=3rd}}</ref> However this notion of equality is often used to justify inequalities such as material inequality. Dalton Conley claims that ontological equality is used to justify material inequality by putting a spotlight on the fact, legitimated by theology, that \"the distribution of power and resources here on earth does not matter, because all of us are equally children of God and will have to face our maker upon dying\". [[Dalton Conley]], the author of ''[https://books.google.com.my/books/about/You_May_Ask_Yourself.html?id=Lv34twEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y You May Ask Yourself]'', claims that ontological equality can also be used to put forth the notion that poverty is a virtue. [[Luciano Floridi]], author of a book about [[information]], wrote about what he calls the ontological equality principle. His work on information ethics raises the importance of equality when presenting information.\n\n==Opportunity==\n{{Main article|Equality of opportunity}}\n\nAnother standard of equality is equality of opportunity, \"the idea that everyone has an equal chance to achieve wealth, social prestige, and power because the rules of the game, so to speak, are the same for everyone\".<ref name=YMAY/> This concept can be applied to society by saying that no one has a head start. This means that, for any social equality issue dealing with wealth, social prestige, power, or any of that sort, the equality of opportunity standard can defend the idea that everyone had the same start. This views society almost as a [[game]] and any of the differences in equality standards are due to luck and playing the \"game\" to one's best ability. Conley gives an example of this standard of equality by using a game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] to describe society. He claims that \"Monopoly follows the rules of equality of opportunity\" by explaining that everyone had an equal chance when starting the game and any differences were a result of the luck of the dice roll and the skill of the player to make choices to benefit their wealth. Comparing this example to society, the standard of equality of opportunity eliminates inequality because the rules of the games in society are still fair and the same for all; therefore making any existing inequalities in society fair. Lesley A. Jacobs, the author of ''[https://books.google.com.my/books/about/Pursuing_Equal_Opportunities.html?id=CtMCx0RQsrMC&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y Pursuing Equal Opportunities: The Theory and Practice of Egalitarian Justice]'', talks about equality of opportunity and its importance relating to egalitarian [[justice]]. Jacobs states that: at the core of equality of opportunity... is the concept that in competitive procedures designed for the allocation of scarce resources and the distribution of the benefits and burdens of social life, those procedures should be governed by criteria that are relevant to the particular goods at stake in the competition and not by irrelevant considerations such as race, religion, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors that may hinder some of the competitors\u2019 opportunities at success. (Jacobs, 10). \nThis concept points out factors like [[race (biology)|race]], [[gender]], [[social class|class]], etc. that should not be considered when talking about equality through this notion. Conley also mentions that this standard of equality is at the heart of a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois society]], such as a modern capitalist society, or \"a society of commerce in which the maximization of profit is the primary business incentive\".<ref name=YMAY/>  It was the equal opportunity ideology that civil rights activists adopted in the era of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s. This ideology was used by them to argue that [[Jim Crow laws]] were incompatible with the standard of equality of opportunity.\n\n\n==Condition==\n{{Main article|Leveling mechanism}}\nAnother notion of equality introduced by Conley is equality of condition. Through this framework is the idea that everyone should have an equal starting point. Conley goes back to his example of a game of Monopoly to explain this standard. If the game of four started off with two players both having an advantage of $5,000 dollars to start off with and both already owning hotels and other property while the other two players both did not own any property and both started off with a $5,000 dollar deficit, then from a perspective of the standard of equality of condition, one can argue that the rules of the game \"need to be altered in order to compensate for inequalities in the relative starting positions\".<ref name=YMAY/>  From this we form policies in order to even equality which in result bring an efficient way to create fairer [[competition]] in society. Here is where [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] comes into play where we change society in order to give an equality of [[human condition|condition]] to everyone based on race, gender, class, religion etc. when it is made justifiable that the proponents of the society makes it unfair for them.\n\nSharon E. Kahn, author of ''[https://books.google.com.my/books/about/Academic_Freedom_and_the_Inclusive_Unive.html?id=m1KdAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University]'', talks about equality of condition in their work as well and how it correlates to [[freedom]] of individuals. They claim that in order to have individual freedom there needs to be equality of condition \"which requires much more than the elimination of legal barriers: it requires the creation of a [[level playing field]] that eliminates structural barriers to opportunity\".<ref name=\"CAN: UBC Press\">{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Sharon|title=Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University|date=2000|publisher=CAN: UBC Press|location=Vancouver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSlKx1Lxlz8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=equality&f=false|isbn=9780774808088}}</ref> Her work talks about the academic structure and its problem with equalities and claims that to \"ensure equity...we need to recognize that the [[university]] structure and its organizational culture have traditionally privileged some and marginalized other; we need to go beyond theoretical concepts of equality by eliminating systemic barriers that hinder the equal participation of members of all groups; we need to create and equality of condition, not merely an equality of opportunity\".<ref name=\"CAN: UBC Press\"/> \"Notions of equity, diversity, and inclusiveness begin with a set of premises about [[individualism]], freedom and rights that take as given the existence of deeply rooted inequalities in social structure,\" therefore in order to have a culture of the inclusive university, it would have to \"be based on values of equity; that is, equality of condition\" eliminating all systemic barriers that go against equality.<ref name=\"CAN: UBC Press\"/>\n\n==Outcome==\n{{Main article|Equality of outcome}}\nA fourth standard of equality is equality of outcome, which is \"a position that argues each player must end up with the same amount regardless of the fairness\".<ref name=YMAY/>  This ideology is predominately a [[Marxist philosophy]] that is concerned with equal distribution of power and resources rather than the rules of society. In this standard of equality, the idea is that \"everyone contributes to society and to the economy according to what they do best\".<ref name=YMAY/> Under this notion of equality, Conley states that \"nobody will earn more power, prestige, and wealth by working harder\".\n\nWhen defining equality of outcome in [[education]], \"the goals should not be the liberal one of equality of access but equality of outcome for the median number of each identifiable non-educationally defined group, i.e. the average women, negro, or [[Proletariat|proletarian]] or rural dweller should have the same level of educational attainment as the average male, white, suburbanite\".<ref name=\"Palgrave Macmillan\">{{cite book|last1=Hewitt|first1=Martin|title=Welfare & Human Nature: The Human Subject in Twentieth-Century Social Politics|date=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref> The outcome and the benefits from equality from education from this notion of equality promotes that all should have the same outcomes and benefits regardless of race, gender, religion etc. The equality of outcome in Hewitt's point of view is supposed to result in \"a comparable range of achievements between a specific [[disadvantaged]] group \u2013 such as an ethnic [[minority group|minority]], women, lone parents and the disabled \u2013 and society as a whole\".<ref name=\"Palgrave Macmillan\"/>\n\nInformation ethics is impartial and universal because it brings to ultimate completion the process of enlargement of the concept of what may count as a center of a (no matter how minimal) [[morality|moral claim]], which now includes every instance of being understood informationally, no matter whether physically implemented or not. In this respect information ethics holds that every entity as an expression of being, has a dignity constituted by its mode of existence and essence (the collection of all the elementary properties that constitute it for what it is), which deserve to be respected (at least in a minimal and overridable sense), and hence place moral claims on the interacting agent and ought to contribute to the constraint and guidance of his ethical decisions and behavior.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite book|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|title=Very Short Introductions : Information: A Very Short Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Oxford}}</ref>\nFlorida goes onto claim that this \"ontological equality principle means that any form of reality (any instance of information/being), simply for the fact of being what it is, enjoys a minimal, initial, overridable, equal right to exist and develop in a way which is appropriate to its nature.\"<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\nValues in his claims correlate to those shown in the sociological textbook ''You May Ask Yourself'' by Dalton Conley. The notion of \"ontological equality\" describes equality by saying everything is equal by nature. Everyone is created equal at birth. Everything has an equal right to exist and develop by its nature.<ref name=YMAY/>\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Matthew Arnold|Arnold, Mathew]] (18759).

However, it may also include [[health equality]], [[economic equality]] and other social securities. Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced [[social class]] or [[caste]] boundaries and the absence of [[discrimination]] motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity.<ref name=\"Blackford\">{{cite journal|last1=Blackford|first1=Russell|date=July 20, 2006|title=Genetic enhancement and the point of social equality|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/689/%20Genetic%20enhancement%20and%20the%20point%20of%20social%20equality|journal=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> For example, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, [[caste]] or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability must absolutely not result in [[equal justice under law|unequal treatment under the law]] and should not reduce opportunities unjustifiably.\n\n''[[Equal opportunity|Equal opportunities]]'' is interpreted as being judged by ability, which is compatible with a [[free market]] economy. Relevant problems are [[horizontal inequality]] \u2212 the inequality of two persons of ''same'' origin and ability and differing opportunities given to individuals \u2212 such as in (education) or by inherited capital.\n\n==Ontological==\nThe standard of equality that states everyone is created equal at birth is called '''ontological equality'''. This type of equality can be seen in many different places like the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. This early document, which states many of the values of the [[United States of America]], has this idea of equality embedded in it. It clearly states that \"[https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/ all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights]\". The statement reflects the philosophy of [[John Locke]] and his idea that we are all equal in certain [[natural rights theory|natural rights]].  Although this standard of equality is seen in documents as important as the Declaration of Independence, it is \"one not often invoked in policy debates these days\".<ref name=YMAY>{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself|date=2013|publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]]|location=New York|edition=3rd}}</ref> However this notion of equality is often used to justify inequalities such as material inequality. Dalton Conley claims that ontological equality is used to justify material inequality by putting a spotlight on the fact, legitimated by theology, that \"the distribution of power and resources here on earth does not matter, because all of us are equally children of God and will have to face our maker upon dying\". [[Dalton Conley]], the author of ''[https://books.google.com.my/books/about/You_May_Ask_Yourself.html?id=Lv34twEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y You May Ask Yourself]'', claims that ontological equality can also be used to put forth the notion that poverty is virtue. [[Luciano Floridi]], author of a book about [[information]], wrote about what he calls the ontological equality principle. His work on information ethics raises the importance of equality when presenting information. Here is a short sample of his work:\n:Information ethics is impartial and universal because it brings to ultimate completion the process of enlargement of the concept of what may count as a centre of a (no matter how minimal) [[morality|moral claim]], which now includes every instance of being understood informationally, no matter whether physically implemented or not. In this respect information ethics holds that every entity as an expression of being, has a dignity constituted by its mode of existence and essence (the collection of all the elementary properties that constitute it for what it is), which deserve to be respected (at least in a minimal and overridable sense), and hence place moral claims on the interacting agent and ought to contribute to the constraint and guidance of his ethical decisions and behaviour.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite book|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|title=Very Short Introductions : Information: A Very Short Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Oxford}}</ref>\nFloridi goes onto claim that this \"ontological equality principle means that any form of reality (any instance of information/being), simply for the fact of being what it is, enjoys a minimal, initial, overridable, equal right to exist and develop in a way which is appropriate to its nature.\"<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\nValues in his claims correlate to those shown in the sociological textbook ''You May Ask Yourself'' by Dalton Conley. The notion of \"ontological equality\" describes equality by saying everything is equal by nature. Everyone is created equal at birth. Everything has equal right to exist and develop by its nature.<ref name=YMAY/>\n\n==Opportunity==\n{{Main article|Equality of opportunity}}\n\nAnother standard of equality is equality of opportunity, \"the idea that everyone has an equal chance to achieve wealth, social prestige, and power because the rules of the game, so to speak, are the same for everyone\".<ref name=YMAY/> This concept can be applied to society by saying that no one has a head start. This means that, for any social equality issue dealing with wealth, social prestige, power, or any of that sort, the equality of opportunity standard can defend the idea that everyone had the same start. This views society almost as a [[game]] and any of the differences in equality are due to luck and playing the \"game\" to one's best ability. Conley gives an example of this standard of equality by using a game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] to describe society. He claims that \"Monopoly follows the rules of equality of opportunity\" by explaining that everyone had an equal chance when starting the game and any differences were a result of the luck of the dice roll and the skill of the player to make choices to benefit their wealth. Comparing this example to society, the standard of equality of opportunity eliminates inequality because the rules of the games in society are still fair and the same for all; therefore making any existing inequalities in society fair. Lesley A. Jacobs, the author of ''[https://books.google.com.my/books/about/Pursuing_Equal_Opportunities.html?id=CtMCx0RQsrMC&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y Pursuing Equal Opportunities: The Theory and Practice of Egalitarian Justice]'', talks about equality of opportunity and its importance relating to egalitarian [[justice]]. Jacobs states that \n:at the core of equality of opportunity... is the concept that in competitive procedures designed for the allocation of scarce resources and the distribution of the benefits and burdens of social life, those procedures should be governed by criteria that are relevant to the particular goods at stake in the competition and not by irrelevant considerations such as race, religion, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors that may hinder some of the competitors\u2019 opportunities at success. (Jacobs, 10). \nThis concept points out factors like [[race (biology)|race]], [[gender]], [[social class|class]] etc. that should not be considered when talking about equality through this notion. Conley also mentions that this standard of equality is at the heart of a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois society]], such as a modern capitalist society, or \"a society of commerce in which the maximization of profit is the primary business incentive\".<ref name=YMAY/>  It was the equal opportunity ideology that civil rights activists adopted in the era of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s. This ideology was used by them to argue that [[Jim Crow laws]] were incompatible with the standard of equality of opportunity.\n\n==Condition==\n{{Main article|Leveling mechanism}}\nAnother notion of equality introduced by Conley is equality of condition. Through this framework is the idea that everyone should have an equal starting point. Conley goes back to his example of a game of Monopoly to explain this standard. If the game of four started off with two players both having an advantage of $5,000 dollars to start off with and both already owning hotels and other property while the other two players both did not own any property and both started off with a $5,000 dollar deficit, then from a perspective of the standard of equality of condition, one can argue that the rules of the game \"need to be altered in order to compensate for inequalities in the relative starting positions\".<ref name=YMAY/>  From this we form policies in order to even equality which in result bring an efficient way to create fairer [[competition]] in society. Here is where [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] comes into play where we change society in order to give an equality of [[human condition|condition]] to everyone based on race, gender, class, religion etc. when it is made justifiable that the proponents of the society makes it unfair for them.\n\nSharon E. Kahn, author of ''[https://books.google.com.my/books/about/Academic_Freedom_and_the_Inclusive_Unive.html?id=m1KdAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University]'', talks about equality of condition in their work as well and how it correlates to [[freedom]] of individuals. They claim that in order to have individual freedom there needs to be equality of condition \"which requires much more than the elimination of legal barriers: it requires the creation of a [[level playing field]] that eliminates structural barriers to opportunity\".<ref name=\"CAN: UBC Press\">{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Sharon|title=Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University|date=2000|publisher=CAN: UBC Press|location=Vancouver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSlKx1Lxlz8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=equality&f=false|isbn=9780774808088}}</ref> Her work talks about the academic structure and its problem with equalities and claims that to \"ensure equity...we need to recognize that the [[university]] structure and its organizational culture have traditionally privileged some and marginalized other; we need to go beyond theoretical concepts of equality by eliminating systemic barriers that hinder the equal participation of members of all groups; we need to create and equality of condition, not merely an equality of opportunity\".<ref name=\"CAN: UBC Press\"/> \"Notions of equity, diversity, and inclusiveness begin with a set of premises about [[individualism]], freedom and rights that take as given the existence of deeply rooted inequalities in social structure,\" therefore in order to have a culture of the inclusive university, it would have to \"be based on values of equity; that is, equality of condition\" eliminating all systemic barriers that go against equality.<ref name=\"CAN: UBC Press\"/>\n\n==Outcome==\n{{Main article|Equality of outcome}}\nA fourth standard of equality is equality of outcome, which is \"a position that argues each player must end up with the same amount regardless of the fairness\".<ref name=YMAY/>  This ideology is predominately a [[Marxist philosophy]] that is concerned with equal distribution of power and resources rather than the rules of society. In this standard of equality, the idea is that \"everyone contributes to society and to the economy according to what they do best\".<ref name=YMAY/> Under this notion of equality, Conley states that \"nobody will earn more power, prestige, and wealth by working harder\".\n\nWhen defining equality of outcome in [[education]], \"the goals should not be the liberal one of equality of access but equality of outcome for the median number of each identifiable non-educationally defined group, i.e. the average women, negro, or [[Proletariat|proletarian]] or rural dweller should have the same level of educational attainment as the average male, white, suburbanite\".<ref name=\"Palgrave Macmillan\">{{cite book|last1=Hewitt|first1=Martin|title=Welfare & Human Nature : The Human Subject in Twentieth-Century Social Politics|date=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref> The outcome and the benefits from equality from education from this notion of equality promotes that all should have the same outcomes and benefits regardless of race, gender, religion etc. The equality of outcome in Hewitt's point of view is supposed to result in \"a comparable range of achievements between a specific [[disadvantaged]] group \u2013 such as an ethnic [[minority group|minority]], women, lone parents and the disabled \u2013 and society as a whole\".<ref name=\"Palgrave Macmillan\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Matthew Arnold|Arnold, Mathew]] (18759).

Johnny Ace, a local musician and former bandmate, described his first encounter with Johnny Nitro in 1978:<blockquote>\"It was back then that we all met Johnny Nitro, who, at that time, was known as Johnny Newton. He\u2019d usually come in with his wife, Margaret, who played some pretty tasty boogie woogie piano. He had very long, flaming red hair down his back and always wore old Hawaiian shirts that were popular at that time. He looked like he just rolled out of bed. His appearance was a bit gruff. We affectionately called him 'Red.' He was always in very deep thought and a bit uptight too, like he was getting ready to explode, but always a very nice guy.\"<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>By the 1980s, Johnny Nitro had further developed his craft, particularly due to the mentorship he received from Sunny Rhodes, who was living in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. Nitro also received mentorship from Cowboy, the bassist for Sunny Rhodes. Johnny Ace commented, \"I know some of that Texas-Oakland grease got into Nitro\u2019s fingers and soul from that experience.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Nitro was influenced by other Texas blues musicians, such as [[Stevie Ray Vaughan|Stevie Ray Vaughn]] and [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1983, Nitro formed his band, Johnny Nitro and the Doorslammers, and the band issued a 45.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sinasohn.com/nitro/|title=Johnny Nitro and the Doorslammers|website=www.sinasohn.com|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1984, the band began to play the Saloon.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/02/21/johnny-nitro-s-f-blues-legend-dies-at-59/|title=Johnny Nitro, S.F. blues legend, dies at 59|date=2011-02-21|website=The Mercury News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> The bar was an iconic city location, as the oldest running saloon in San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfblues.net/Saloon.html|title=San Francisco Blues on SFBlues.net: The Saloon|website=www.sfblues.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> At first, the band played once per week, but they eventually  began to play twice a week.<ref name=\":4\" /> The original bass player, who was drawn to slap-funk bass style, eventually quit the band.

Johnny Ace, a local musician and former bandmate, described his first encounter with Johnny Nitro in 1978:<blockquote>\"It was back then that we all met Johnny Nitro, who, at that time, was known as Johnny Newton. He\u2019d usually come in with his wife, Margaret, who played some pretty tasty boogie woogie piano. He had very long, flaming red hair down his back and always wore old Hawaiian shirts that were popular at that time. He looked like he just rolled out of bed. His appearance was a bit gruff. We affectionately called him 'Red.' He was always in very deep thought and a bit uptight too, like he was getting ready to explode, but always a very nice guy.\"<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>By the 1980s, Johnny Nitro had further developed his craft, particularly due to the mentorship he received from Sunny Rhodes, who was living in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. Nitro also received mentorship from Cowboy, the bassist for Sunny Rhodes. Johnny Ace commented, \"I know some of that Texas-Oakland grease got into Nitro\u2019s fingers and soul from that experience.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Nitro was influenced by other Texas blues musicians, such as [[Stevie Ray Vaughan|Stevie Ray Vaughn]] and [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]].<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nIn 1983, Nitro formed his band, Johnny Nitro and the Doorslammers, and the band issued a 45.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sinasohn.com/nitro/|title=Johnny Nitro and the Doorslammers|website=www.sinasohn.com|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1984, the band began to play the Saloon.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/02/21/johnny-nitro-s-f-blues-legend-dies-at-59/|title=Johnny Nitro, S.F. blues legend, dies at 59|date=2011-02-21|website=The Mercury News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> The bar was an iconic city location, as the oldest running saloon in San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfblues.net/Saloon.html|title=San Francisco Blues on SFBlues.net: The Saloon|website=www.sfblues.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> At first, the band played once per week, but they eventually  began to play twice a week.<ref name=\":4\" /> The original bass player, who was drawn to slap-funk bass style, eventually quit the band.
