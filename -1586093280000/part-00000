He claimed his club threw the matches against [[NK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[NK Tre\u0161njevka]] towards the end of the season in order to help those two relegation-threatened teams avoid the drop. Specifically, Planini\u0107 claimed that the match played on 31 May 1964 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] when Hajduk beat \u017deljezni\u010dar 4-0 was fixed, as well as the match on 7 June 1964 in [[Sarajevo]] when \u017deljezni\u010dar and Tre\u0161njevka tied 3-3. He was in \u017deljezni\u010dar's goal in both matches. Planini\u0107 made the information public fourteen months later in August 1965 by approaching a ''Ve\u010dernje novine'' journalist Alija Resulovi\u0107 who in turn took Planini\u0107's testimony in form of an interview and the piece was published by the paper, which was circulated in 100,000 copies at the time.<ref name=\"strategija_1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.strategija.org/afera-planinic-prvi-deo-kako-je-sve-pocelo/|title=\u201cAfera Planini\u0107\u201d, prvi deo: Kako je sve po\u010delo \u2026|agency=Sportska kupusara: Bri\u0161emo pra\u0161inu sa starih novina|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref> In his 2006 book ''Ona vremena'', Resulovi\u0107 claims to have contacted FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's president [[Nusret Mahi\u0107]] right before submitting the piece for publishing, informing him of Planini\u0107's allegations, seeking comment, and even offering to sit on the information if he (Mahi\u0107) thinks it necessary.<ref name=\"strategija_1\"/> Resulovi\u0107 further claims that Mahi\u0107's response was: \"Publish it all! It's all a lie that Planini\u0107 concocted as revenge for being fined for an incident he caused at a training session\".<ref name=\"strategija_1\"/>\n\nThe explosive testimony erupted in a nationwide scandal that became known as the 'Planini\u0107 Affair'. On many occasions in the years prior, Yugoslav First League had been plagued by rumours of widespread match-fixing, however, this was the first occasion that a player had come forward and substantiated those claims on the record.\n\n===Investigation===\nRight after Planini\u0107's allegations hit the press, the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav FA]] (FSJ) disciplinary body (disciplinski sud) began an investigation into the two matches Planini\u0107 claimed were fixed. Its findings were summarized in an internal memo that was later obtained by various Yugoslav press outlets:\n\n;NK Hajduk Split vs. FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo played on Sunday, 31 May 1964<ref name=\"zapisnik\"/>\n{{cquote|Several days before the fixture, NK Hajduk managing board member Zdravko Arapovi\u0107 made phone contact with Jakov Brdar, an administrator from [[Zenica]], asking him to immediately travel to [[Sarajevo]] in order to find someone on the FK \u017deljezni\u010dar managing board willing to negotiate a match-fixing deal for the upcoming league fixture between the two teams. As requested, Brdar went to Sarajevo and met up with Ante Dervi\u0161evi\u0107, an FK \u017deljezni\u010dar managing board member he knew from before. Since he had no authority to make a decision of this sort, Dervi\u0161evi\u0107 referred Brdar to the FK \u017deljezni\u010dar club president Nusret Mahi\u0107 and the two met in club offices where Brdar relayed Zdravko Arapovi\u0107's offer. \n\nMahi\u0107 flatly rejected Arapovi\u0107's offer, as relayed to him by Brdar, due to its suggestion of a friendly gesture on FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's part without any monetary compensation, reacting to it by saying: 'Without money \u2014 there will be no deal'. Prodded by Brdar to name the figure he'd expect in return for letting Hajduk win, Mahi\u0107 responded: 'Two and a half million, at least [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]2.5 million'. Brdar then went to [[Split, Croatia|Split]] to inform Arapovi\u0107 of Mahi\u0107's demands.\n\nThe day before the match, right after FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's arrival to Split, Arapovi\u0107 met with Ljubomir Nikoli\u0107, another member of FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's managing board, who was in charge of organizing the club's away trip to Split. On this occasion, Nikoli\u0107 demanded YUD4 million to throw the match \u2014 2 million in cash and the other 2 million as advertising money for FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's newsletter/magazine that Hajduk would line up from Split-based companies. Arapovi\u0107's response to Nikoli\u0107 was that he'll get back to him tomorrow on the day of the match as he has to consult with someone.\n\nRight before the match, as the two teams were already conducting warm-ups on the pitch, Arapovi\u0107 invited Nikoli\u0107 into the office of Hajduk's financial officer where he asked Nikoli\u0107 to lower the price. After haggling over the amount for some time, Nikoli\u0107 conceded and agreed on the sum of YUD1.5 million as \u017deljezni\u010dar's compensation. At that point, Arapovi\u0107 took YUD1 million in cash from Hajduk's financial officer Ante Vido\u0161evi\u0107 and handed it to Nikoli\u0107. According to Vido\u0161evi\u0107's testimony, this million came from the club's 'black fund' while he obtained the remaining YUD500,000 on the very day of the match from his assistants who were in charge of selling match tickets at the gate.\n\nAs soon as he received the agreed upon amount of YUD1.5 million, Nikoli\u0107 went down to the bench in order to inform \u017deljezni\u010dar's head coach [[Vlatko Konjevod]] that the money had been collected. Konjevod, in turn, went to the touchline and communicated with his players [[Ivica Osim]] and [[Mi\u0161o Smajlovi\u0107]] via a hand gesture, a previously agreed signal between the three that meant the players should start letting the opponent win.\n\nRight after receiving head coach Konjevod's signal, Osim and Smajlovi\u0107 began intentionally sabotaging their own team's play, which became obvious to all of the protagonists on the pitch to the point of causing a revolt among the rest of \u017deljezni\u010dar's squad with [[Rade Mati\u0107]] even physically accosting Osim during the match over his obvious lack of trying. Hajduk won easily 4-0.\n\nDays earlier, before \u017deljezni\u010dar's players and management departed Sarajevo for the away league match versus Hajduk, club president Nusret Mahi\u0107 instructed the club's managing board member Ljubomir Nikoli\u0107 how to go about arranging the match-fixing once he arrives in Split and how much money to ask for. Mahi\u0107 furthermore told Nikoli\u0107 to give him a phone call once the job is done, which Nikoli\u0107 did. It has been further determined through Zdravko Arapovi\u0107's testimony that he acted at the behest of Hajduk's club president Josip Ko\u0161to and the rest of the club's managing board. Arapovi\u0107 further testified that he also agreed the match-fixing with the head coaches of the two clubs \u2014 \u017deljezni\u010dar's Konjevod and Hajduk's [[Milovan \u0106iri\u0107]] \u2014 with both aware of the amount that was paid out. \n\nIt is also worth noting that Hajduk's managing board members Ivo Mimica, Frane Markovi\u0107, Ante Vido\u0161evi\u0107, and \u017deljko Vladovi\u0107 were present when Hajduk's club president Josip Ko\u0161to instructed Arapovi\u0107 to pay YUD1.5 million to Nikoli\u0107. Furthermore, \u017deljezni\u010dar's managing board member Edhem Tufo was aware of all the match-fixing details from the very beginning of the deal and he even saw the cash that Nikoli\u0107 showed him upon receiving it.\n\nTaking the money in order to throw the match caused friction and antagonism among the \u017deljezni\u010dar squad with certain players demanding a cut from club management during the return trip to Sarajevo. Due to widespread revolt in the team, club president Mahi\u0107 called a meeting in Sarajevo the day after the match, attempting to explain to his players why the match had been thrown. He talked of \"Hajduk's great contributions\" as well as of \"Hajduk's concessions to \u017deljezni\u010dar several years ago\". The amount of revolt among the players was reflected in Osim's words to club president Mahi\u0107: 'You can demand a lot of things from us players, but this thing that happened in Split \u2014 never again'.<ref name=\"zapisnik\">[http://stav.ba/afera-planinic-kako-su-pali-ivica-i-misa/ AFERA \u201cPLANINI\u0106\u201d: KAKO SU PALI IVICA I MI\u0160A]; ''Stav'', 6 January 2018</ref>}}\n\n===Punishment===\nOn 27 August 1965, the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav FA]]'s disciplinary body (disciplinski sud) presided over by [[Svetozar Savi\u0107]] handed out the following penalties:\n*FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's board members, including club president [[Nusret Mahi\u0107]], got lifelong bans on performing any football-related official functions.\n*FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's head coach at the time [[Vlatko Konjevod]] got a lifetime ban from football.\n*FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's players [[Ivica Osim]] and [[Mi\u0161o Smajlovi\u0107]] each got a one-year ban from football.\n*NK Hajduk Split's board members, including club president [[Josip Ko\u0161to]], got lifelong bans on performing any football-related official functions.\n*NK Hajduk Split's head coach at the time [[Milovan \u0106iri\u0107]] got a lifetime ban from football.\n*Two members of NK Tre\u0161njevka's board got lifelong bans on performing any football-related official functions.\n*NK Tre\u0161njevka's club president [[Ivan Ba\u010dun]] and technical director [[Marjan Matan\u010di\u0107]] got disciplinary motions started against them.\n*NK Dinamo Zagreb's general secretary [[Oto Hofman]] got a lifetime ban from football for acting as a go-between for \u017deljezni\u010dar and Tre\u0161njevka.\n\nDisciplinary body president Svetozar Savi\u0107 also announced that the investigation had revealed that \u017deljezni\u010dar was paid [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]1.5 million by Hajduk Split, and YUD4 million by Tre\u0161njevka for these matches.

He claimed his club threw the matches against [[NK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[NK Tre\u0161njevka]] towards the end of the season in order to help those two relegation-threatened teams avoid the drop. Specifically, Planini\u0107 claimed that the match played on 31 May 1964 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] when Hajduk beat \u017deljezni\u010dar 4-0 was fixed, as well as the match on 7 June 1964 in [[Sarajevo]] when \u017deljezni\u010dar and Tre\u0161njevka tied 3-3. He was in \u017deljezni\u010dar's goal in both matches. Planini\u0107 made the information public fourteen months later in August 1965 by approaching a ''Ve\u010dernje novine'' journalist Alija Resulovi\u0107 who in turn took Planini\u0107's testimony in form of an interview and the piece was published by the paper, which was circulated in 100,000 copies at the time.<ref name=\"strategija_1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.strategija.org/afera-planinic-prvi-deo-kako-je-sve-pocelo/|title=\u201cAfera Planini\u0107\u201d, prvi deo: Kako je sve po\u010delo \u2026|agency=Sportska kupusara: Bri\u0161emo pra\u0161inu sa starih novina|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref> In his 2006 book ''Ona vremena'', Resulovi\u0107 claims to have contacted FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's president [[Nusret Mahi\u0107]] right before submitting the piece for publishing, informing him of Planini\u0107's allegations, seeking comment, and even offering to sit on the information if he (Mahi\u0107) thinks it necessary.<ref name=\"strategija_1\"/> Resulovi\u0107 further claims that Mahi\u0107's response was: \"Publish it all! It's all a lie that Planini\u0107 concocted as revenge for being fined for an incident he caused at a training session\".<ref name=\"strategija_1\"/>\n\nThe explosive testimony erupted in a nationwide scandal that became known as the 'Planini\u0107 Affair'. On many occasions in the years prior, Yugoslav First League had been plagued by rumours of widespread match-fixing, however, this was the first occasion that a player had come forward and substantiated those claims on the record.\n\n===Investigation===\nRight after Planini\u0107's allegations hit the press, the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav FA]] (FSJ) disciplinary body (disciplinski sud) began an investigation into the two matches Planini\u0107 claimed were fixed. Its findings were summarized in an internal memo that was later obtained by various Yugoslav press outlets:\n\n;NK Hajduk Split vs. FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo played on Sunday, 31 May 1964<ref name=\"zapisnik\"/>\n{{cquote|Several days before the fixture, NK Hajduk managing board member Zdravko Arapovi\u0107 made phone contact with Jakov Brdar, an administrator from [[Zenica]], asking him to immediately travel to [[Sarajevo]] in order to find someone on the FK \u017deljezni\u010dar managing board willing to negotiate a match-fixing deal for the upcoming league fixture between the two teams. As requested, Brdar went to Sarajevo and met up with Ante Dervi\u0161evi\u0107, an FK \u017deljezni\u010dar managing board member he knew from before. Since he had no authority to make a decision of this sort, Dervi\u0161evi\u0107 referred Brdar to the FK \u017deljezni\u010dar club president Nusret Mahi\u0107 and the two met in club offices where Brdar relayed Zdravko Arapovi\u0107's offer. \n\nMahi\u0107 flatly rejected Arapovi\u0107's offer, as relayed to him by Brdar, due to its suggestion of a friendly gesture on FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's part without any monetary compensation, reacting to it by saying: 'Without money \u2014 there will be no deal'. Prodded by Brdar to name the figure he'd expect in return for letting Hajduk win, Mahi\u0107 responded: 'Two and a half million, at least [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]2.5 million'. Brdar then went to [[Split, Croatia|Split]] to inform Arapovi\u0107 of Mahi\u0107's demands.\n\nThe day before the match, right after FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's arrival to Split, Arapovi\u0107 met with Ljubomir Nikoli\u0107, another member of FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's managing board, who was in charge of organizing the club's away trip to Split. On this occasion, Nikoli\u0107 demanded YUD4 million to throw the match \u2014 2 million in cash and the other 2 million as advertising money for FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's newsletter/magazine that Hajduk would line up from Split-based companies. Arapovi\u0107's response to Nikoli\u0107 was that he'll get back to him tomorrow on the day of the match as he has to consult with someone.\n\nRight before the match, as the two teams were already conducting warm-ups on the pitch, Arapovi\u0107 invited Nikoli\u0107 into the office of Hajduk's financial officer where he asked Nikoli\u0107 to lower the price. After haggling over the amount for some time, Nikoli\u0107 conceded and agreed on the sum of YUD1.5 million as \u017deljezni\u010dar's compensation. At that point, Arapovi\u0107 took YUD1 million in cash from Hajduk's financial officer Ante Vido\u0161evi\u0107 and handed it to Nikoli\u0107. According to Vido\u0161evi\u0107's testimony, this million came from the club's 'black fund' while he obtained the remaining YUD500,000 on the very day of the match from his assistants who were in charge of selling match tickets at the gate.\n\nAs soon as he received the agreed upon amount of YUD1.5 million, Nikoli\u0107 went down to the bench in order to inform \u017deljezni\u010dar's head coach [[Vlatko Konjevod]] that the money had been collected. Konjevod, in turn, went to the touchline and communicated with his players [[Ivica Osim]] and [[Mi\u0161o Smajlovi\u0107]] via a hand gesture, a previously agreed signal between the three that meant the players should start letting the opponent win.\n\nRight after receiving head coach Konjevod's signal, Osim and Smajlovi\u0107 began intentionally sabotaging their own team's play, which became obvious to all of the protagonists on the pitch to the point of causing a revolt among the rest of \u017deljezni\u010dar's squad with [[Rade Mati\u0107]] even physically accosting Osim during the match over his obvious lack of trying. Hajduk won easily 4-0.\n\nDays earlier, before \u017deljezni\u010dar's players and management departed Sarajevo for the away league match versus Hajduk, club president Nusret Mahi\u0107 instructed the club's managing board member Ljubomir Nikoli\u0107 how to go about arranging the match-fixing once he arrives in Split and how much money to ask for. Mahi\u0107 furthermore told Nikoli\u0107 to give him a phone call once the job is done, which Nikoli\u0107 did. It has been further determined through Zdravko Arapovi\u0107's testimony that he acted at the behest of Hajduk's club president Josip Ko\u0161to and the rest of the club's managing board. Arapovi\u0107 further testified that he also agreed the match-fixing with the head coaches of the two clubs \u2014 \u017deljezni\u010dar's Konjevod and Hajduk's [[Milovan \u0106iri\u0107]] \u2014 with both aware of the amount that was paid out. \n\nIt is also worth noting that Hajduk's managing board members Ivo Mimica, Frane Markovi\u0107, Ante Vido\u0161evi\u0107, and \u017deljko Vladovi\u0107 were present when Hajduk's club president Josip Ko\u0161to instructed Arapovi\u0107 to pay YUD1.5 million to Nikoli\u0107. Furthermore, \u017deljezni\u010dar's managing board member Edhem Tufo was aware of all the match-fixing details from the very beginning of the deal and he even saw the cash that Nikoli\u0107 showed him upon receiving it.\n\nTaking the money in order to throw the match caused friction and antagonism among the \u017deljezni\u010dar squad with certain players demanding a cut from club management during the return trip to Sarajevo. Due to widespread revolt in the team, club president Mahi\u0107 called a meeting in Sarajevo the day after the match, attempting to explain to his players why the match had been thrown. He talked of \"Hajduk's great contributions\" as well as of \"Hajduk's concessions to \u017deljezni\u010dar several years ago\". The amount of revolt among the players was reflected in Osim's words to club president Mahi\u0107: 'You can demand a lot of things from us players, but this thing that happened in Split \u2014 never again'.<ref name=\"zapisnik\">[http://stav.ba/afera-planinic-kako-su-pali-ivica-i-misa/ AFERA \u201cPLANINI\u0106\u201d: KAKO SU PALI IVICA I MI\u0160A]; ''Stav'', 6 January 2018</ref>}}\n\n===Punishment===\nOn 27 August 1965, the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav FA]]'s disciplinary body (disciplinski sud) presided over by [[Svetozar Savi\u0107]] handed out the following penalties:\n*FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's board members, including club president [[Nusret Mahi\u0107]], got lifelong bans on performing any football-related official functions.\n*FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's head coach at the time [[Vlatko Konjevod]] got a lifetime ban from football.\n*FK \u017deljezni\u010dar's players [[Ivica Osim]] and [[Mi\u0161o Smajlovi\u0107]] each got a one-year ban from football.\n*NK Hajduk Split's board members, including club president [[Josip Ko\u0161to]], got lifelong bans on performing any football-related official functions.\n*NK Hajduk Split's head coach at the time [[Milovan \u0106iri\u0107]] got a lifetime ban from football.\n*Two members of NK Tre\u0161njevka's board got lifelong bans on performing any football-related official functions.\n*NK Tre\u0161njevka's club president [[Ivan Ba\u010dun]] and technical director [[Marjan Matan\u010di\u0107]] got disciplinary motions started against them.\n*NK Dinamo Zagreb's general secretary [[Oto Hofman]] got a lifetime ban from football for acting as a go-between for \u017deljezni\u010dar and Tre\u0161njevka.\n\nDisciplinary body president Svetozar Savi\u0107 also announced that the investigation had revealed that \u017deljezni\u010dar was paid [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]1.5 million by Hajduk Split, and YUD4 million by Tre\u0161njevka for these matches.

In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man.

The film is loosely based on the life of the [[English people|English]] school teacher [[Anna Leonowens]], it portrays a fictionalized account of her historical encounter with the King of Siam [[Mongkut]], and royal court. The voice cast stars [[Miranda Richardson]] and [[Martin Vidnovic]] as Leonowens and Mongkut, respectively, with [[Ian Richardson]], [[Darrell Hammond]], and [[Adam Wylie]]. The score, songs, and some of the character names come from [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]'s [[Musical theatre|stage musical]] [[The King and I|of the same name]]. Screenwriters Peter Bakalian, [[Jacqueline Feather]], and [[David Seidler]] took creative liberties with the history and with the source material from the musical in an attempt to make the film palatable to all audiences.\n\n''The King and I'' was released on March 19, 1999 to mixed reactions from reviewers, who praised its musical score and songs but criticized its animation and story, while the film's racial overtones and [[artistic license]] received polarized responses. ''The King and I'' earned $12 million at the box office<ref name=\"mojo\"/> and its gross was seen as a disappointment compared to that of other animated films released at the time. The film received five nominations including the [[London Film Critics' Circle|London Critics Circle Film Award]] for British Actress of the Year for Richarson and the [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Golden Reel Award]] for Best Sound Editing in Animated Feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000452/2000/1?ref_=ttawd_ev_3|title=Motion Picture Sound Editors, USA 2000 Awards|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1862, a ship sails from [[London]] to [[Bangkok]], on board are [[Anna Leonowens]] and her son [[Louis T. Leonowens|Louis]]. The [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]], Kralahome uses his powers of illusion to cause it to appear as if a massive [[Sea serpent|sea serpent]] is attacking the ship as its battered in a storm. Anna with the help of Captain Orton manage to save Louis from drowning. As they approach the Captain fills Anna in on the political structure of the kingdom.\n\nIn the [[Grand Palace]], in [[Siam]], Anna witnesses King [[Mongkut]] receive the gift of a slave, Tuptim a young woman from [[Burma]]. Despite being promised her own house outside of the Palace, Anna is denied such. The King drags Anna to his workshop were he tests new inventions such as [[hot air balloon]]s, and [[train]]s. Louis is taken on a tour of the [[Arsenal|armory]] by Master Little, who barely misses injury. The King's wives help Anna unpack despite her protests, this is when Anna sees Prince Chululongkorn and Tuptim getting to know each other in the courtyard. Anna who wants to leave since she won't be receiving the house, changes her mind after she meets the Royal Children, namely Prince [[Chulalongkorn]].\n\nWith Kralahome still plotting to over throw the king, he write a letter to the [[British Empire|British]] claiming Anna is in danger. Anna begins to teach the children only to learn they've never been outside the Palace walls. To give the hands on experience she takes all of the royal children all around the City to see how other people live, this in turn angers the king. It boils over into a fight with Anna still complaining about the house she was promised but didn't receive.\n\nChululongkorn meets with his father to discuss traditions, wanting to be with Tuptim but knowing his father would never allow it. Confused, Mongkut goes to pray to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. While he is the Kralahome uses his powers on the statues in the room to try and attack the king, which the king's [[Black panther|black panther]] Rama fights off. When the Chululongkorn is kickboxing, Tuptim finally learns he is the prince and that their love is forbidden. But he tells her that he doesn't care about tradition and wants to be with her. Master Little learns of their relationship tells Kralahome who plans to use it to excite the king at the right time.\n\nAnna goes to the king, he is troubled after learning the British are coming because he is allegedly a [[Barbarian|barbarian]], which she knows isn't true. Anna advising the King to throw a banquet for the British when they arrive to show they are civilized. At the dinner, Kralahome mentions the Ivory pendant the king is supposed to wear, the one which he have to his son, who then gave it to Tuptim. When it is revealed Chululongkorn gave it away, Tuptim is brought in by guards. Dishonored by the relationship Mongkut threatens to whip Tuptim to death, but she and Chululongkorn escape into the jungle along with Louis.\n\nWhile they're escaping Kralahome uses his powers to guide them through the Jungle across a rope bridge. The bridge collapses and Tuptim is swept away by the river. Mongkut using one of his hot air balloons catches Tuptim, and saves everyone else. But on their journey back to the Palace Kralahome fires a firework destroying the Balloon causing it to crash to the ground. Everyone but the king was able to jump into a lake to safety, when Kralahome leaves victorious, Sir Edward and the royal guards get angry at him for trying to kill the King. An injured bedridden Mongkut lays in bed telling his son to be ready to lead Siam when he dies. Kralahome loses his position as Prime Minister, and his punishment would be permanently working the elephant stables by cleaning their dung with Master Little as his boss. He then gets beaten up by Master Little after getting angry about his last tooth falling out. But the King doesn't die, he heals and presents Anna with her house outside of the Palace walls, and the two of them dance.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Miranda Richardson]]  as [[Anna Leonowens]]\n** [[Christiane Noll]] (singing voice)\n* [[Martin Vidnovic]] as [[Mongkut|King Mongkut of Siam]]\n* Allen D.

But it wasn't until the success of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] ''The Lion King'', and all Hollywood studios began looking at getting into the [[animation]] field that the company began to develop animated feature films internally. In 1991 [[Morgan Creek Entertainment]] began a production and distribution deal with Warner Bros. In 1993 the company established [[Warner Bros. Feature Animation]] led by [[Max Howard]] to produce their own animated films while still distributing third party animated films. Warner Bros. distributed ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'', and [[New Line Cinema]] distributed ''[[The Swan Princess]]'' in 1994, before releasing their first internally created feature film ''[[Space Jam]]'' in 1996. With the film a financial success, the next film was quickly underway ''[[Quest for Camelot]]''. [[Arthur Rankin Jr.]] the head of [[Rankin/Bass Productions]], who had been brought in to co-produce the film, was able to convince the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] Organization who is in charge of the rights to their works that an animated feature film \"would be a superb way,\" to expand the property.<ref name=Kickbox>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/shall-we-kickbox-animated-king-and-i-opens-at-movie-theatres-march-19-com-80730|title=Shall We Kickbox?

The film is loosely based on the life of the [[English people|English]] school teacher [[Anna Leonowens]], it portrays a fictionalized account of her historical encounter with the King of Siam [[Mongkut]], and royal court. The voice cast stars [[Miranda Richardson]] and [[Martin Vidnovic]] as Leonowens and Mongkut, respectively, with [[Ian Richardson]], [[Darrell Hammond]], and [[Adam Wylie]]. The score, songs, and some of the character names come from [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]'s [[Musical theatre|stage musical]] [[The King and I|of the same name]]. Screenwriters Peter Bakalian, [[Jacqueline Feather]], and [[David Seidler]] took creative liberties with the history and with the source material from the musical in an attempt to make the film palatable to all audiences.\n\n''The King and I'' was released on March 19, 1999 to mixed reactions from reviewers, who praised its musical score and songs but criticized its animation and story, while the film's racial overtones and [[artistic license]] received polarized responses. ''The King and I'' earned $12 million at the box office<ref name=\"mojo\"/> and its gross was seen as a disappointment compared to that of other animated films released at the time. The film received five nominations including the [[London Film Critics' Circle|London Critics Circle Film Award]] for British Actress of the Year for Richarson and the [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Golden Reel Award]] for Best Sound Editing in Animated Feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000452/2000/1?ref_=ttawd_ev_3|title=Motion Picture Sound Editors, USA 2000 Awards|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1862, a ship sails from [[London]] to [[Bangkok]], on board are [[Anna Leonowens]] and her son [[Louis T. Leonowens|Louis]]. The [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]], Kralahome uses his powers of illusion to cause it to appear as if a massive [[Sea serpent|sea serpent]] is attacking the ship as its battered in a storm. Anna with the help of Captain Orton manage to save Louis from drowning. As they approach the Captain fills Anna in on the political structure of the kingdom.\n\nIn the [[Grand Palace]], in [[Siam]], Anna witnesses King [[Mongkut]] receive the gift of a slave, Tuptim a young woman from [[Burma]]. Despite being promised her own house outside of the Palace, Anna is denied such. The King drags Anna to his workshop were he tests new inventions such as [[hot air balloon]]s, and [[train]]s. Louis is taken on a tour of the [[Arsenal|armory]] by Master Little, who barely misses injury. The King's wives help Anna unpack despite her protests, this is when Anna sees Prince Chululongkorn and Tuptim getting to know each other in the courtyard. Anna who wants to leave since she won't be receiving the house, changes her mind after she meets the Royal Children, namely Prince [[Chulalongkorn]].\n\nWith Kralahome still plotting to over throw the king, he write a letter to the [[British Empire|British]] claiming Anna is in danger. Anna begins to teach the children only to learn they've never been outside the Palace walls. To give the hands on experience she takes all of the royal children all around the City to see how other people live, this in turn angers the king. It boils over into a fight with Anna still complaining about the house she was promised but didn't receive.\n\nChululongkorn meets with his father to discuss traditions, wanting to be with Tuptim but knowing his father would never allow it. Confused, Mongkut goes to pray to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. While he is the Kralahome uses his powers on the statues in the room to try and attack the king, which the king's [[Black panther|black panther]] Rama fights off. When the Chululongkorn is kickboxing, Tuptim finally learns he is the prince and that their love is forbidden. But he tells her that he doesn't care about tradition and wants to be with her. Master Little learns of their relationship tells Kralahome who plans to use it to excite the king at the right time.\n\nAnna goes to the king, he is troubled after learning the British are coming because he is allegedly a [[Barbarian|barbarian]], which she knows isn't true. Anna advising the King to throw a banquet for the British when they arrive to show they are civilized. At the dinner, Kralahome mentions the Ivory pendant the king is supposed to wear, the one which he have to his son, who then gave it to Tuptim. When it is revealed Chululongkorn gave it away, Tuptim is brought in by guards. Dishonored by the relationship Mongkut threatens to whip Tuptim to death, but she and Chululongkorn escape into the jungle along with Louis.\n\nWhile they're escaping Kralahome uses his powers to guide them through the Jungle across a rope bridge. The bridge collapses and Tuptim is swept away by the river. Mongkut using one of his hot air balloons catches Tuptim, and saves everyone else. But on their journey back to the Palace Kralahome fires a firework destroying the Balloon causing it to crash to the ground. Everyone but the king was able to jump into a lake to safety, when Kralahome leaves victorious, Sir Edward and the royal guards get angry at him for trying to kill the King. An injured bedridden Mongkut lays in bed telling his son to be ready to lead Siam when he dies. Kralahome loses his position as Prime Minister, and his punishment would be permanently working the elephant stables by cleaning their dung with Master Little as his boss. He then gets beaten up by Master Little after getting angry about his last tooth falling out. But the King doesn't die, he heals and presents Anna with her house outside of the Palace walls, and the two of them dance.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Miranda Richardson]]  as [[Anna Leonowens]]\n** [[Christiane Noll]] (singing voice)\n* [[Martin Vidnovic]] as [[Mongkut|King Mongkut of Siam]]\n* Allen D.

But it wasn't until the success of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] ''The Lion King'', and all Hollywood studios began looking at getting into the [[animation]] field that the company began to develop animated feature films internally. In 1991 [[Morgan Creek Entertainment]] began a production and distribution deal with Warner Bros. In 1993 the company established [[Warner Bros. Feature Animation]] led by [[Max Howard]] to produce their own animated films while still distributing third party animated films. Warner Bros. distributed ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'', and [[New Line Cinema]] distributed ''[[The Swan Princess]]'' in 1994, before releasing their first internally created feature film ''[[Space Jam]]'' in 1996. With the film a financial success, the next film was quickly underway ''[[Quest for Camelot]]''. [[Arthur Rankin Jr.]] the head of [[Rankin/Bass Productions]], who had been brought in to co-produce the film, was able to convince the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] Organization who is in charge of the rights to their works that an animated feature film \"would be a superb way,\" to expand the property.<ref name=Kickbox>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/shall-we-kickbox-animated-king-and-i-opens-at-movie-theatres-march-19-com-80730|title=Shall We Kickbox?
