The segment is largely [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 71 in Arkansas and Texas|US&nbsp;71]]. The first exit along this segment of I-540/US&nbsp;71 is with [[U.S. Route 64 in Arkansas|US&nbsp;64]] and [[U.S. Route 71B (Fort Smith, Arkansas)|US&nbsp;71B]] (US&nbsp;71B), which leads west into the [[Van Buren Historic District]] and east to [[Alma, Arkansas|Alma]]. Continuing south, I-540/US 71 passes over [[Arkansas Highway 162|Highway&nbsp;162 (Kibler Road)]], with no access between the routes. An exit providing access to [[Arkansas Highway 59|Highway&nbsp;59]], via Riggs Drive (southbound) or Twin Circle Drive (northbound), is just prior crossing the [[Arkansas River]]. After crossing the river, the highways enter Fort Smith and Sebastian County. I-540/US 71 run through a commercial area and has three exits with city collector roads before an exit for Phoenix Avenue, which gives access to [[Fort Smith Regional Airport]]. However, this exit does not have any access to southbound I-540/US 71.\n\nNow turning toward the southwest, I-540/US 71 have exits with [[Arkansas Highway 45|Highway&nbsp;45 (Greenwood Road)]] and [[Arkansas Highway 255|Highway&nbsp;255 (Zero Street)]]. Following these intersections, US 71 departs I-540 southbound toward [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], with US 71B terminating at the parent route at the exit. I-540 begins to pass through a residential area before its final exit at [[U.S. Route 271|US&nbsp;271]] and [[Arkansas Highway 253|Highway&nbsp;253]]. Following this exit, the roadway continues but ceases to be I-540, becoming US&nbsp;271 and entering [[Oklahoma]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==History==\nThe Interstate spur opened in phases. According to a 1970 road map of Fort Smith,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} exits 2-11 (Van Buren through the Zero Street exit) were opened, with later exits (12-14) and the roadway itself still under construction. Portions of the roadway that became I-540 around Fayetteville were built in the early 1970s, but upgraded and extended in the mid-1990s. The highway around Fayetteville originally received US 71 signage until the complete I-540 spur was opened.\n\nOriginally, I-540 running from I-40 to Oklahoma through Fort Smith was originally signed east\u2013west, but with the construction of the spur that ran north through [[Fayetteville\u2013Springdale\u2013Rogers Metropolitan Area|Northwest Arkansas]] to [[Bella Vista, Arkansas|Bella Vista]] the entire I-540 was resigned as a north\u2013south road. It is one of the few that have changed this way.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nIn the late 1990s, I-540 was extended into Northwest Arkansas. It had been planned since the 1970s as a bypass of [[U.S. Highway 71 (Arkansas)|U.S. Highway 71]].  The first section, between Alma and [[Mountainburg, Arkansas|Mountainburg]] was known as [[Arkansas Highway 540]]. Originally, the [[Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department]] (AHTD) asked the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO), who are in charge of Interstate and U.S. Highway route numbering, to allow the Interstate segment between Fort Smith and Bentonville to be named I-49, in order to emphasize plans to extend the route from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], through Arkansas to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web |author= [[Arkansas State Highway Commission]] |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/minute_orders/Mo90-99.pdf |format= PDF |title= Minutes of the Meeting |date= January 22, 1991 |publisher= Arkansas State Highway Commission |page= 868 |accessdate= December 24, 2013 }}</ref>  AASHTO refused and the route opened on January 8, 1999, as a northern extension of I-540.<ref>{{cite web |author= Arkansas State Highway Commission |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/minute_orders/Mo90-99.pdf |format= PDF |title= Minutes of the Meeting |date= August 6, 1997 |publisher=Arkansas State Highway Commission |page= 960 |accessdate= December 24, 2013 }}</ref>  On October 18, 2013, AASHTO approved AHTD's application to designate I-49 across the state, specifically allowing the state to renumber I-540 as I-49.<ref name=Vitale>{{AASHTO minutes |year=2013A |accessdate= May 4, 2014 |page=2}}</ref>   The northern section of I-540 was renumbered I-49 in April 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rozelle |first= Jonathan |title= I-540 Becomes Interstate 49 |url= http://www.4029tv.com/news/interstate-540-becomes-interstate-49-tuesday/25596626 |publisher= KHBS/KHOG-TV |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |location= Fort Smith\u2013Rogers, AR }}</ref>\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit |length_ref=<ref name=\"db\" /> }}\n{{ARint|exit\n|type=concur\n|county=Crawford\n|cspan=4\n|location=Van Buren\n|lspan=4\n|road={{jct|state=AR|I|540|dir1=ends|I|49|dir2=north|I|40|dir3=east|US|71|dir4=north}}\n|notes=Northern end of I-40 Concurrency;

The segment is largely [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 71 in Arkansas and Texas|US&nbsp;71]]. The first exit along this segment of I-540/US&nbsp;71 is with [[U.S. Route 64 in Arkansas|US&nbsp;64]] and [[U.S. Route 71B (Fort Smith, Arkansas)|US&nbsp;71B]] (US&nbsp;71B), which leads west into the [[Van Buren Historic District]] and east to [[Alma, Arkansas|Alma]]. Continuing south, I-540/US 71 passes over [[Arkansas Highway 162|Highway&nbsp;162 (Kibler Road)]], with no access between the routes. An exit providing access to [[Arkansas Highway 59|Highway&nbsp;59]], via Riggs Drive (southbound) or Twin Circle Drive (northbound), is just prior crossing the [[Arkansas River]]. After crossing the river, the highways enter Fort Smith and Sebastian County. I-540/US 71 run through a commercial area and has three exits with city collector roads before an exit for Phoenix Avenue, which gives access to [[Fort Smith Regional Airport]]. However, this exit does not have any access to southbound I-540/US 71.\n\nNow turning toward the southwest, I-540/US 71 have exits with [[Arkansas Highway 45|Highway&nbsp;45 (Greenwood Road)]] and [[Arkansas Highway 255|Highway&nbsp;255 (Zero Street)]]. Following these intersections, US 71 departs I-540 southbound toward [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], with US 71B terminating at the parent route at the exit. I-540 begins to pass through a residential area before its final exit at [[U.S. Route 271|US&nbsp;271]] and [[Arkansas Highway 253|Highway&nbsp;253]]. Following this exit, the roadway continues but ceases to be I-540, becoming US&nbsp;271 and entering [[Oklahoma]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==History==\nThe Interstate spur opened in phases. According to a 1970 road map of Fort Smith,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} exits 2-11 (Van Buren through the Zero Street exit) were opened, with later exits (12-14) and the roadway itself still under construction. Portions of the roadway that became I-540 around Fayetteville were built in the early 1970s, but upgraded and extended in the mid-1990s. The highway around Fayetteville originally received US 71 signage until the complete I-540 spur was opened.\n\nOriginally, I-540 running from I-40 to Oklahoma through Fort Smith was originally signed east\u2013west, but with the construction of the spur that ran north through [[Fayetteville\u2013Springdale\u2013Rogers Metropolitan Area|Northwest Arkansas]] to [[Bella Vista, Arkansas|Bella Vista]] the entire I-540 was resigned as a north\u2013south road. It is one of the few that have changed this way.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nIn the late 1990s, I-540 was extended into Northwest Arkansas. It had been planned since the 1970s as a bypass of [[U.S. Highway 71 (Arkansas)|U.S. Highway 71]].  The first section, between Alma and [[Mountainburg, Arkansas|Mountainburg]] was known as [[Arkansas Highway 540]]. Originally, the [[Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department]] (AHTD) asked the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO), who are in charge of Interstate and U.S. Highway route numbering, to allow the Interstate segment between Fort Smith and Bentonville to be named I-49, in order to emphasize plans to extend the route from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], through Arkansas to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web |author= [[Arkansas State Highway Commission]] |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/minute_orders/Mo90-99.pdf |format= PDF |title= Minutes of the Meeting |date= January 22, 1991 |publisher= Arkansas State Highway Commission |page= 868 |accessdate= December 24, 2013 }}</ref>  AASHTO refused and the route opened on January 8, 1999, as a northern extension of I-540.<ref>{{cite web |author= Arkansas State Highway Commission |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/minute_orders/Mo90-99.pdf |format= PDF |title= Minutes of the Meeting |date= August 6, 1997 |publisher=Arkansas State Highway Commission |page= 960 |accessdate= December 24, 2013 }}</ref>  On October 18, 2013, AASHTO approved AHTD's application to designate I-49 across the state, specifically allowing the state to renumber I-540 as I-49.<ref name=Vitale>{{AASHTO minutes |year=2013A |accessdate= May 4, 2014 |page=2}}</ref>   The northern section of I-540 was renumbered I-49 in April 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rozelle |first= Jonathan |title= I-540 Becomes Interstate 49 |url= http://www.4029tv.com/news/interstate-540-becomes-interstate-49-tuesday/25596626 |publisher= KHBS/KHOG-TV |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |location= Fort Smith\u2013Rogers, AR }}</ref>\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit |length_ref=<ref name=\"db\" /> }}\n{{ARint|exit\n|type=concur\n|county=Crawford\n|cspan=4\n|location=Van Buren\n|lspan=4\n|road={{jct|state=AR|I|540|dir1=ends|I|49|dir2=north|I|40|dir3=east|US|71|dir4=north}}\n|notes=Northern end of I-40 Concurrency;

National Geographic Virtual Library, Accessed 17 May 2018.'' \"The westernmost among the emerging nations of the Pacific, the Republic of Palau (or Belau), population more than 15,000, is divided into 16 separate states, each with its own [[List of current state governors in Palau|governor]], lieutenant governor, and legislature.  Most state populations are very small, and one wonders if anyone has time for anything but government, American style and democratic though it may be.\nAn example is [[Peleliu]], the tragic island where more than 13,000 Americans and Japanese died during [[Battle of Peleliu|less than three months of fighting]], often hand to hand, in the autumn of 1944.  Pat and I went to Peleliu from [[Koror]], the republic's capital, by speedboat, a wave-tossing, rear-slapping 45&nbsp;minutes, and arrived to discover it was election day, with five candidates running for governor.  Although Peleliu claims a population of 2,000 people, only 400 actually live there.  More registered voters live in Koror than on their home island, and 800 send votes from [[Guam]].  The situation is similar in Palau's other states.\nA current joke puts a laugh in the truth.  A man walks into a bar in Koror and calls out, \"Hey, Governor!\"  And half the men in the place stand up.\nBut that's only the state story.  The national government is headed by President [[Lazarus Salii]], followed by a [[Vice President of Palau|vice president]], a cabinet responsible for five ministries, a [[judiciary of Palau|judiciary]], and a legislature with a 16-member [[House of Delegates of Palau|house]] and a 14-member [[Senate of Palau|senate]].\nThe there's the hereditary leadership.

Palau is the most over-governed place on earth, with 16 states and both a tribal chiefdom and elected legislature in each state, for 20,000 people.<ref>''Patterson, Carolyn Bennett, et al. \"At the Birth of Nations: In the Far Pacific.\" National Geographic Magazine, October 1986 page 493. National Geographic Virtual Library, Accessed 17 May 2018.'' \"The westernmost among the emerging nations of the Pacific, the Republic of Palau (or Belau), population more than 15,000, is divided into 16 separate states, each with its own [[List of current state governors in Palau|governor]], lieutenant governor, and legislature.  Most state populations are very small, and one wonders if anyone has time for anything but government, American style and democratic though it may be.\nAn example is [[Peleliu]], the tragic island where more than 13,000 Americans and Japanese died during [[Battle of Peleliu|less than three months of fighting]], often hand to hand, in the autumn of 1944.  Pat and I went to Peleliu from [[Koror]], the republic's capital, by speedboat, a wave-tossing, rear-slapping 45&nbsp;minutes, and arrived to discover it was election day, with five candidates running for governor.  Although Peleliu claims a population of 2,000 people, only 400 actually live there.  More registered voters live in Koror than on their home island, and 800 send votes from [[Guam]].  The situation is similar in Palau's other states.\nA current joke puts a laugh in the truth.  A man walks into a bar in Koror and calls out, \"Hey, Governor!\"  And half the men in the place stand up.\nBut that's only the state story.  The national government is headed by President [[Lazarus Salii]], followed by a [[Vice President of Palau|vice president]], a cabinet responsible for five ministries, a [[judiciary of Palau|judiciary]], and a legislature with a 16-member [[House of Delegates of Palau|house]] and a 14-member [[Senate of Palau|senate]].\nThe there's the hereditary leadership.  Each village has ten chiefs, ranked in importance.  And, dividing the island group, there are two [[paramount chiefs]].  Never, I thought, have so few been governed by so many.\"</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
