The government stood by its decision and claimed these games were recreation for war workers.<ref>[https://spartacus-educational.com/2WWfootball.htm Football and the Second World War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225213503/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWfootball.htm |date=25 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMany war workers and guest players who played these games however supported the wartime league, claiming it allowed them an outlet from the war.<ref name=\u201c10-facts-about-football\u201d/>\n\n===Player statistics===\nTotal records of goals and appearances during the Wartime League have been ignored in respective career and league statistics, allowing players post-World War II to go higher than some of them in goal-scoring and appearance rankings.  \n\nMany critics do not acknowledge the wartime league as counting for career goals and appearances. The original invention of the Wartime Football League stated that the matches were to be regarded as friendlies. Friendly matches are not included in record terms for any team or player.<ref name=\"Younger 2006 68\">{{cite book|title=Newcastle's Cult heroes|first=Dylan|last=Younger|publisher=Know the Score Books Ltd|isbn=9781905449033|year=2006|page=68}}</ref> Despite leagues being established in this time, the number of Guest players, one-off appearances, resignations of teams from fixtures leading to adding up goal difference and appearances to go up the table, leads to many seeing these records as inaccurate, unfair, or unnecessary. Majority of fan-based arguments debate that a player who exceeds one's record through their wartime matches should nonetheless be seen as the club's highest goal scorer or appearance having been part of the team's squad even if only for a short time. \n\nA notable argument relates to the goal-difference between Jackie Milburn's and [[Alan Shearer]]\u2019s Newcastle United goal-scoring records. When counting Jackie's wartime matches, he scored a total of 238 professional goals for Newcastle United FC.<ref name=\"nufc.premiumtv.co.uk\" /> In May 2005, Alan Shearer finished his career at 206 goals.

The lack of availability for footballers to participate wore down the league's performance.  Despite guest players being introduced, many teams still struggled to produce a full squad and resigned many matches. League table points were often added up by goal average or appearances as opposed to match results.\n\nThe Blitz was still taking place when the 1941 Football League War Cup Final took place at Wembley on 31 May. Preston North End and Arsenal drew 1\u20131 in front of a 60,000 crowd. Preston won the replay at Blackburn, 2\u20131.

During the first season of The Football Wartime League, Britain had not experienced any bombings or military attack by Germany or its allies. Whilst public attendance was reduced, fears of Britain's safety were moderate. However, despite the Phoney War ending and attacks on Britain and France beginning, the games continued and increases in attendance and match fixtures were introduced during [[the Blitz]]. The government stood by its decision and claimed these games were recreation for war workers.<ref>[https://spartacus-educational.com/2WWfootball.htm Football and the Second World War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225213503/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWfootball.htm |date=25 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMany war workers and guest players who played these games however supported the wartime league, claiming it allowed them an outlet from the war.<ref name=\u201c10-facts-about-football\u201d/>\n\n===Player statistics===\nTotal records of goals and appearances during the Wartime League have been ignored in respective career and league statistics, allowing players post-World War II to go higher than some of them in goal-scoring and appearance rankings.  \n\nMany critics do not acknowledge the wartime league as counting for career goals and appearances. The original invention of the Wartime Football League stated that the matches were to be regarded as friendlies. Friendly matches are not included in record terms for any team or player.<ref name=\"Younger 2006 68\">{{cite book|title=Newcastle's Cult heroes|first=Dylan|last=Younger|publisher=Know the Score Books Ltd|isbn=9781905449033|year=2006|page=68}}</ref> Despite leagues being established in this time, the number of Guest players, one-off appearances, resignations of teams from fixtures leading to adding up goal difference and appearances to go up the table, leads to many seeing these records as inaccurate, unfair, or unnecessary. Majority of fan-based arguments debate that a player who exceeds one's record through their wartime matches should nonetheless be seen as the club's highest goal scorer or appearance having been part of the team's squad even if only for a short time. \n\nA notable argument relates to the goal-difference between Jackie Milburn's and [[Alan Shearer]]\u2019s Newcastle United goal-scoring records. When counting Jackie's wartime matches, he scored a total of 238 professional goals for Newcastle United FC.<ref name=\"nufc.premiumtv.co.uk\" /> In May 2005, Alan Shearer finished his career at 206 goals. He has since been defined as the club's highest ever goal scorer.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.premierleague.com/players/89/Alan-Shearer/overview|title=Alan Shearer| work = Premier League|accessdate = 22 January 2020}}</ref> The wartime league's exclusion from Jackie's United record sees him taken down to 200 goals.<ref name=\"Younger 2006 68\" /><ref>{{cite book|title= The Toon's Greatest 100 Players...EVER!|last= Fletcher|first=Kev |year= 2016|isbn=132629685X|pages=266 & 267}}</ref> It has been debated among the Newcastle United fans that Shearer should be quoted as 2nd to Milburn in this respect.

In his prime, Goldsmith was six-foot-one-inch tall and weighed 195 pounds.\n\n==The Great Curveball Debate: Goldsmith or Cummings?==\nThe two strongest candidates for inventing the [[curveball]] are Fred Goldsmith and [[Candy Cummings]], Goldsmith's old rival when the two played in the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players]] in 1877\u201378\u2014Goldsmith with the pennant-winning [[London Tecumsehs]] and Cummings with the [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], Live Oaks. Cummings was also the first president of the International Association when he pitched for the Lynn Live Oaks.\n\nWhile it is difficult, if not impossible, to pin down definitively who did first invent or throw the first curveball, the lore is that Candy Cummings threw the first known curveball during a game in 1867 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], with the [[Excelsior of Brooklyn|Brooklyn Excelsiors]].\n\nFred Goldsmith is credited with giving the first publicly recorded demonstration of a curveball to sportswriter-baseball historian [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] on August 16, 1870, at the [[Capitoline Grounds]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>''Brooklyn Eagle'' newspaper, August 17, 1870.</ref>\n\n[[Sportscaster]]-American actor [[Bill Stern]] waded into the debate in 1949 with a \"favorite story\" firmly crediting Goldsmith as the inventor and with transforming baseball. (See [[Bill Stern#Bill Stern on the curveball|Bill Stern on the curveball]].)\n\nAdditionally, an article in ''[[The London Free Press]]'' (''Fred Goldsmith Invented The Curveball'') of June 21, 1939, credits Goldsmith with inventing the curveball and says that \"Just three days following Fred Goldsmith's death [on March 28, 1939], ''The Sporting News'' devoted an editorial to Goldsmith's feat of 61 years ago and asked that he be officially recognized as the inventor of the curve ball.\"\n\nFurther, an article in the August 2, 1938, ''London Free Press'' (''Nick Altrock Is Here For Today'') indicates that former Major League pitcher [[Nick Altrock]] also believed that Goldsmith invented the curveball. Altrock and Goldsmith were in London, Ontario, for an Old Boys Reunion and afternoon game at [[Labatt Park]] between a team from [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], and a London Seniors team.\n\nIronically, Cummings was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] in 1939\u2014the same year that Goldsmith died\u2014largely due to Cummings's supposed invention of the curveball.\n\n==Goldsmith's professional career==\n\nDuring his lifetime, Goldsmith pitched professionally for the [[New Haven]] New Havens (1875); the London Tecumsehs (in 1876, before the Tecumsehs joined the International Association) and after the Tecumsehs joined the fledgling International Association (1877\u201378); the [[Troy, New York]] Trojans of the [[National League]] (1879); the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] of the National League (1880\u20131884) and briefly for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1884).\n\nPitching for the Chicago White Stockings, Goldsmith had four seasons with 20 wins or more: 1880 (21-3); 1881 (24-13); 1882 (28-17); 1883 (25-19).\n\nGoldsmith's win-loss percentage of .622 (112-68) does not include his games in New Haven or in [[London, Ontario]], Canada, with the International Association pennant winners, the London Tecumsehs.\n\nDuring Goldsmith's five-season stint pitching for the Chicago White Stockings, he played with first baseman [[Cap Anson]] and for team President [[A.G. Spalding]], when Chicago won several league pennants. Goldsmith's final game in the pro ranks was on September 10, 1884.\n\n==Images of Fred Goldsmith==\n<gallery>\nImage:Fred_Goldsmith_in_1876_1877_1878_London_Tecumseh_Team_London_Ontario_Canada.jpg|1.

(See [[Bill Stern#Bill Stern on the curveball|Bill Stern on the curveball]].)\n\nAdditionally, an article in ''[[The London Free Press]]'' (''Fred Goldsmith Invented The Curveball'') of June 21, 1939, credits Goldsmith with inventing the curveball and says that \"Just three days following Fred Goldsmith's death [on March 28, 1939], ''The Sporting News'' devoted an editorial to Goldsmith's feat of 61 years ago and asked that he be officially recognized as the inventor of the curve ball.\"\n\nFurther, an article in the August 2, 1938, ''London Free Press'' (''Nick Altrock Is Here For Today'') indicates that former Major League pitcher [[Nick Altrock]] also believed that Goldsmith invented the curveball. Altrock and Goldsmith were in London, Ontario, for an Old Boys Reunion and afternoon game at [[Labatt Park]] between a team from [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], and a London Seniors team.\n\nIronically, Cummings was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] in 1939\u2014the same year that Goldsmith died\u2014largely due to Cummings's supposed invention of the curveball.\n\n==Goldsmith's professional career==\n\nDuring his lifetime, Goldsmith pitched professionally for the [[New Haven]] New Havens (1875); the London Tecumsehs (in 1876, before the Tecumsehs joined the International Association) and after the Tecumsehs joined the fledgling International Association (1877\u201378); the [[Troy, New York]] Trojans of the [[National League]] (1879); the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] of the National League (1880\u20131884) and briefly for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1884).\n\nPitching for the Chicago White Stockings, Goldsmith had four seasons with 20 wins or more: 1880 (21-3); 1881 (24-13); 1882 (28-17); 1883 (25-19).\n\nGoldsmith's win-loss percentage of .622 (112-68) does not include his games in New Haven or in [[London, Ontario]], Canada, with the International Association pennant winners, the London Tecumsehs.\n\nDuring Goldsmith's five-season stint pitching for the Chicago White Stockings, he played with first baseman [[Cap Anson]] and for team President [[A.G. Spalding]], when Chicago won several league pennants. Goldsmith's final game in the pro ranks was on September 10, 1884.\n\n==Images of Fred Goldsmith==\n<gallery>\nImage:Fred_Goldsmith_in_1876_1877_1878_London_Tecumseh_Team_London_Ontario_Canada.jpg|1.
