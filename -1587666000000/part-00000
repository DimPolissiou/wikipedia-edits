By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=2.2.4|title=Lessons We Don't Learn: A Study of the Lessons of Disasters, Why We Repeat Them, and How We Can Learn Them|work=hsaj.org|date=July 2006|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924171804/http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=2.2.4|archive-date=September 24, 2006|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Memorial observances==\n\n===Oklahoma City National Memorial===\n{{Main|Oklahoma City National Memorial}}\nFor two&nbsp;years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building.<ref name=\"TouristsHistory105\">{{cite book|title=Tourists of History|last=Sturken|first=Marita|page=105|isbn=978-0-8223-4122-2|date=November 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTVisitors\">{{cite news|last=Yardley |first=Jim |title=Uneasily, Oklahoma City Welcomes Tourists |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/11/us/uneasily-oklahoma-city-welcomes-tourists.html |date=June 11, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422200709/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/11/us/uneasily-oklahoma-city-welcomes-tourists.html |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996,<ref name=\"Unfinished119\">{{cite book|last=Linenthal|first=Edward|title=The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory|page=119|isbn=978-0-19-516107-6|year=2003}}</ref> when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350&nbsp;members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing.<ref name=\"DMN\"/> On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624&nbsp;submissions.<ref name=\"OKBMS\">{{cite web |title=About the Designers |publisher=[[Oklahoma City National Memorial]] |url=http://www.oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/secondary.php?section=2&catid=31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616153214/http://www.oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/secondary.php?section=2&catid=31 |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The memorial was designed at a cost of $29&nbsp;million, which was raised by public and private funds.<ref name=\"TouristsHistory109\">{{cite book|title=Tourists of History|last=Sturken|first=Marita|page=109|isbn=978-0-8223-4122-2|date=November 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"29million\">{{cite news|last=McLeod |first=Michael |title=Hundreds still live with scars of Oklahoma City bombing every day |work=[[The Orlando Sentinel]] |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8332312_ITM |date=June 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103230052/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-120953680/hundreds-still-live-scars.html |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The [[List of national memorials of the United States|national memorial]] is part of the [[National Park Service|National Park System]] as an affiliated area and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg.<ref name=\"NYTVisitors\"/> It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing.<ref name=\"OKBMS\"/><ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web|title=Oklahoma City National Memorial |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |url=http://www.nps.gov/okci/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514123638/http://www.nps.gov/okci/index.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Within the first year, it had 700,000&nbsp;visitors.<ref name=\"NYTVisitors\"/>\n\nThe memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast.

Irwin was subsequently sent to the colony as a major in command of a detachment of the [[63rd Regiment of Foot]], whose mission was to protect and help establish the colony.

This was to be among the most controversial of Irwin's initiatives during his tenure in the Swan River Colony. According to his account, immediately after a series of skirmishes Irwin conferred with his Executive Council \u2018to take such steps for a prompt and summary retaliation, as the means at my disposal admitted.\u2019 A proclamation was issued and published in the Perth Gazette offering a reward of 30 pounds for the capture \u2018dead or alive\u2019 of Yagan, and 20 pounds of \u2018Midgigooroo\u2019 and Munday. The proclamation declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws \u2018deprived of the protection of British laws, and I do hereby authorize and command all and every His Majesty\u2019s subjects residents in any part of this colony to capture, or aid or assist in capturing the body of the said \u2018Egan\u2019 DEAD OR ALIVE, and to produce the said body forthwith before the nearest Justice of the Peace.\u2019  Frederick Irwin rationalized his actions to the Secretary of State in the following terms: This pecuniary stimulus has had the hoped for effect, by bringing forward some efficient volunteers among the Settlers whose ----- and occupations have necessarily given them a more intimate knowledge of the haunts of the natives in the neighbourhood of the settled district than is possessed by the Military, but no volunteers have received permission to act unless headed by a Magistrate or a Constable. Parties of the Military have also been in constant movement, traversing the bush is such directions as reports or conjecture rendered most likely to lead to a discovery of the lurking place of the offending tribes. These parties have all received express instructions to attempt the lives of no other than the three outlaws, unless hostility on the part of others of the tribe should render it necessary in self defense. I am happy to say these measures have already been attended with considerable effect. The whole of this hostile tribe have been harassed by the constant succession of parties sent against them, and in some instances have been hotly pursued to a considerable distance in different directions.\n\nBy the time Irwin\u2019s dispatch had been received in London, Midgegooroo had been captured and executed. Despite his efforts to convince his superiors that his actions were justified, Irwin was criticized by the Secretary of State, who would have preferred a sentence of imprisonment, believing that execution would do little to improve relationships between the traditional owners and the colonists. But as Irwin intended, the search for Midgegooroo, Yagan and Munday proceeded quickly as the military and private settlers combed the region. One volunteer party led by a colonist named Thomas Hunt (according to G.F. Moore, \u2018a most appropriate name\u2019 who had previously been a constable in London) headed south \u2018in the direction of the Murray\u2019 and came across a number of \u2018native huts\u2019 not far from the south shore of the Swan. They \u2018routed\u2019 the Aboriginal people there, and pursued a group south, shooting and killing one man who was believed to be the brother of Midgegooroo and according to Moore, bringing his ears home \u2018as a token.\u2019 According to the Perth Gazette, throughout the period immediately after the proclamation, Midgegooroo remained near the property of the Drummonds on the Helena River \u2018employed as he usually had been of late in taking care of the women and children of the tribe\u2019 and clearly unaware of his outlaw status and his impending doom. On Thursday 16 May, a military party led by Captain Ellis, acting on information that Midgegooroo was in the area, joined forces with a number of civilians, including Thomas Hardey and J. Hancock. After camping overnight, the next morning they came across Midgegooroo and his young son: The old man finding a retreat impossible, became desperate; Jeffers, a private of the 63rd ... rushed forward and seized him by the hair, Captain Ellis seized his spears and broke them in his hand, he still retained the barbed ends, with which he struck at Jeffers repeatedly; the alarm he created by crying out for Yagan, and the apprehensions of his escaping, required the exercise of the greatest firmness on the part of Captain Ellis to accomplish his being brought in alive. The capture of this man as effected in a masterly manner, and redounds highly to the credit of Captain Ellis. ... Midgegooroo in his dungeon presents a most pitiable object. In the same issue, the Perth Gazette went on to invite citizens to \u2018forward the ends of justice\u2019 by coming forward with their evidence of Midgegooroo's wrongdoings, indicative of the close relationship between the early colonial media, the Government and the nascent system of justice. The Perth Gazette constitutes one of the principle records of the events over the next few days, and it is difficult to be definite about the chronological sequence between Midgegooroo's capture on 17 May and execution on the 22nd. It appears likely that Irwin spent the period weighing up his alternatives, consulting with the Executive Council as well as men such as G.F. Moore who, as well as being a private colonist, held the official post of Commissioner of the Civil Court. On Monday 20 May, Moore records a meeting with Irwin and hints that his personal view was that Midgegooroo should be transported but there was a strong public sentiment that he should be executed; \u2018there is a great puzzle to know what to do with him. The populace cry loudly for his blood, but it is a hard thing to shoot him in cold blood. There is a strong intention of sending him into perpetual banishment in some out of the way place.\u2019 Irwin told the Secretary of State he had conducted a \u2018patient examination\u2019 and had received statements from \u2018several credible witnesses\u2019, twelve-year-old Ralph Entwhistle, John Staunton of the 63rd Regiment of Foot, Charles Bourne, constable Thomas Hunt, James Lacey, Thomas Yule (sworn before Magistrates at Fremantle) and John Ellis. Each gave brief details of Midgegooroo's alleged crimes, and identified the prisoner as the same man. Irwin reported that he gave \u2018much anxious consideration\u2019 to Midgegooroo's punishment: \"The experiment of confinement, which had been tried to some extent in the case of the three Natives whose transportation to Carnac Island and ultimate escape I have reported to your Lordship in a former dispatch appeared to have produced no good effect on the subjects of that trial, and the age of the prisoner in question apparently exceeding fifty years, forbad any sanguine hopes from such an experiment in his case.\" \nThere was no trial, even in the sense of an informal hearing. Midgegooroo was clearly not allowed the opportunity to give evidence or defend himself and indeed it is probable that he did not understand what was being alleged.\nBy 22 May, Irwin had made up his mind: \"With the unanimous advice of the Council, I therefore decided on his execution as the only sure mode of securing the Colony from an enemy, who was doubly dangerous from his apparently implacable hostility and from his influence as an acknowledged Chief. The latter circumstance being also calculated to render his death a more striking example.\" The Perth Gazette recorded the execution as follows: \"In the absence of a Sherriff, the warrant was directed to the Magistrates of the District of Perth, the duty therefore devolved upon J. Morgan Esq., as Government Resident, who immediately proceeded to carry the sentence into execution. The death warrant was read aloud to the persons assembled who immediately afterwards went inside the Jail, with the Constables and the necessary attendants, to prepare the Prisoner for his fate. Midgegooroo, on seeing that preparations were making [sic.] to punish him, yelled and struggled most violently to escape. These efforts availed him little, in less than five minutes he was pinioned and blindfolded, and bound to the outer door of the Jail. The Resident then reported to his Honor the Lieutenant Governor (who was on the spot accompanied by the Members of the Council), that all was prepared, \u2013 the warrant being declared final \u2013 he turned around and gave the signal to the party of the 63rd [which had volunteered] to advance and halt at 6 paces, \u2013 they then fired \u2013 and Midgegooroo fell. \u2013 The whole arrangement and execution after the death warrant had been handed over to the Civil Authorities, did not occupy half an hour.\" \nIrwin reported simply: \u2018He was accordingly shot, in front of the jail at Perth on the 22 Ultimo.\u2019 Moore also recorded the execution although it is not clear whether he was a witness: \u2018The native Midgegoroo, after being fully identified as being a principal in 3 murders at least, was fastened to the gaol door & fired on by a Military party, receiving 3 balls in his head, one in his body.\u2019 According to the Perth Gazette, the execution was witnessed by a \u2018great number of persons \u2026 although the Execution was sudden and the hour unknown.\u2019 \"The feeling which was generally expressed was that of satisfaction at what had taken place, and in some instances loud and vehement exaltation, which the solemnity of the scene, \u2013 a fellow human being \u2013 although a native \u2013 launched into eternity \u2013 ought to have suppressed.\"\n\nThe aftermath it appears from the extant record that, while there was a crowd in attendance at the execution, few if any Aboriginal people were present. The boy who was captured along with Midgegooroo, who was identified as his son \u2018Billy\u2019 (later referred to also as \u2018young Midgegooroo\u2019) was estimated to be between five and eight years old. He was removed \u2018out of sound and hearing of what was to happen to his father and has since been forwarded to the Government Schooner, Ellen, now lying off Garden Island, with particular instructions from the Magistrates to ensure him every protection and kind treatment.\u2019 Irwin informed the Secretary of State that \u2018the child has been kept in ignorance of his father\u2019s fate, and it is my present intention to retain him in confinement, and by kind treatment I am in hope from his tender age he may be so inured to civilized habits as to make it improbable he will revert to a barbarous life when grown up.\u2019 The Noongar population appears to have remained unaware of Midgegooroo's fate, possibly to ensure that the news would not reach the feared Yagan. Four days after the execution, G. F. Moore recorded an encounter with Yagan near his homestead when he arrived with Munday, Migo and seven others, possibly with the aim of finding out from Moore what had happened to his father. Moore, caught by surprise, decided to conceal the truth from Yagan, whereupon Yagan told him that if Midgegooroo's life was taken, he would retaliate by killing three white men. Six days later, it appears that news of the killing had still not penetrated the Noongar community for, when Moore was visited on 2 June by Weeip, Yagan's son Narral, and some women, they asked him again about Midgegooroo and his young son. Moore again concealed the execution but assured them that his son \u2018would come back again by & bye.\u2019 Two days later, Moore recorded that thefts of sheep and goats continued on the Canning River, and expressed his despair at the prospects for a people in whom he felt \u2018a very great interest\u2019: \u2018These things are very dispiriting. I fear it must come to an act of extermination between us at last if we cannot graze our flocks in safety.\u2019 It was not until 11 July that the colonists succeeded in killing Yagan, his death at the hands of sixteen-year-old James Keats on the Upper Swan, who duly collected his reward and left the colony.\n\nThe Perth Gazette recorded its satisfaction at the deaths and believed that most of the citizenry supported the ruthless actions of the Government. Midgegooroo's execution, it claimed, met with \u2018general satisfaction \u2026 his name has long rung in our ears, associated with every enormity committed by the natives; we therefore join cordially in commending this prompt and decisive measure.\u2019 On the other hand, it is clear that a number of colonists were unhappy with the actions of the government. Robert Lyon, who published his account of the period in 1839 after he had left the colony, wrote that while the killing of Midgegooroo and Yagan was \u2018applauded by a certain class\u2019, they were \u2018far from being universally approved. Many were silent, but some of the most respectable of the settlers loudly expressed their disapprobation.\u2019 There was criticism also from other Australian colonies about the execution of Midgegooroo. The Hobart Town Review of 20 August 1833 was full of vitriol for Irwin's actions: \"It is hard to conceive any offence on the part of the poor unfortunate wretch that could justify the putting him to death, even in the open field, but to slay him in cool blood to us appears a cruel murder without palliation.\"\n\nIrwin, however, was convinced that his actions were merited. Writing in England about two years after the events of 1833, he asserted that \u2018these acts of justice so completely succeeded in their object of intimidating the natives on the Swan and Canning Rivers that recent accounts from the colony represent the shepherds and others in the habit of going about the country, as having for a considerable laid aside their usual precaution of carrying firearms, so peaceable had the conduct of those tribes become.\u2019\n\nIn September 1833, after more than four years in Western Australia,[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020006b.htm] Irwin returned to [[England]], partly to give an account to the [[Colonial Office]] of the events that had occurred in the colony while it was under his charge.[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9152341_ITM]  While there, he published ''The State and Position of Western Australia'', the first published account of the colony. He also sought religious assistance for the colony, resulting in the arrival of the colony's first missionary, [[Louis Giustiniani]], in 1836. He married his wife Elizabeth Courthope, sister of auditor-general of Western Australia in December 1836.[http://www.daao.org.au/main/read/3437] In 1837, having been promoted to Major, he returned to Western Australia, and was made permanent Commandant of the [[Colonial forces of Australia|Western Australian Forces]].  He was further promoted to [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in 1845.\n\nOn the death of Governor [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1793)|Andrew Clarke]] in February 1847, Irwin took office as acting Governor until the arrival of the new governor, [[Charles Fitzgerald]], in August 1848. His administration was extremely unpopular with the settlers of Western Australia, due to both the poor financial state of the colony and his stern character,<ref name=adb/> and the arrival of Fitzgerald was widely celebrated. Irwin retired from the army in 1854 and returned to England in 1856, where he died in [[Cheltenham]] in 1860.\n\nIn 1839 the explorer [[George Grey]] named the [[Irwin River]] after him while on his second disastrous exploration expedition along the Western Australian coast.\n\nIn 1948 the [[Irwin Barracks|Irwin Army Barracks]] in [[Karrakatta, Western Australia|Karrakatta]] were named after him, in recognition of his place in Western Australia's military history.\n\nIn 1991 the [[Frederick Irwin Anglican School]] was opened and named in honour of his contributions to Western Australia.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book |author=The Constitution Centre of Western Australia |year=2002 |chapter=Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Chidley Irwin 1847\u20131848 |chapterurl=http://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/ExhibitionsOnline/GovernorsAndPremiers/Governors/Pages/Irwin.aspx |title=Governors and Premiers of Western Australia |url=http://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/exhibitionsonline/GovernorsAndPremiers/Governors/Pages/Default.aspx |location=West Perth, Western Australia |publisher=The Constitution Centre of Western Australia |isbn=0-7307-3821-3}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-gov}}\n{{succession box | \ntitle=[[Governor of Western Australia]] | \nbefore=[[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1793)|Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Clarke]] | \nafter=[[Charles Fitzgerald|Captain Charles Fitzgerald]] | \nyears=1847\u20131848}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Governors of Western Australia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Irwin, Frederick Chidley}}\n[[Category:1788 births]]\n[[Category:1860 deaths]]\n[[Category:83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot officers]]\n[[Category:63rd Regiment of Foot officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:Governors of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council]]\n[[Category:Settlers of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order]]\n[[Category:19th-century Australian public servants]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Frederick Irwin (1788-1860).jpg|thumbnail|Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Chidley Irwin]]\n[[Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''Frederick Chidley Irwin''', [[Royal Guelphic Order|KH]] (22 March 1794 \u2013 31 March 1860)<ref name=adb>\n{{Australian Dictionary of Biography\n |first=David |last=Mossenson\n |title=Irwin, Frederick Chidley (1794\u20131860)\n |id2=irwin-frederick-chidley-2263\n |accessdate=25 November 2019\n}}</ref> was acting [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1847 to 1848.\n\nBorn in 1794 in [[Drogheda]], [[Ireland]], Frederick Chidley Irwin was the son of Reverend James Irwin.<ref name=adb/> Some sources give the year 1788 as his birthyear.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://librariesaustralia.nla.gov.au/search/display?dbid=auth&id=36436015|publisher=Libraries Australia|title=Irwin, Frederick Chidley, 1788-1860|accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> In 1808, he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] into the [[83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot]].

This was to be among the most controversial of Irwin's initiatives during his tenure in the Swan River Colony. According to his account, immediately after a series of skirmishes Irwin conferred with his Executive Council \u2018to take such steps for a prompt and summary retaliation, as the means at my disposal admitted.\u2019 A proclamation was issued and published in the Perth Gazette offering a reward of 30 pounds for the capture \u2018dead or alive\u2019 of Yagan, and 20 pounds of \u2018Midgigooroo\u2019 and Munday. The proclamation declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws \u2018deprived of the protection of British laws, and I do hereby authorize and command all and every His Majesty\u2019s subjects residents in any part of this colony to capture, or aid or assist in capturing the body of the said \u2018Egan\u2019 DEAD OR ALIVE, and to produce the said body forthwith before the nearest Justice of the Peace.\u2019  Frederick Irwin rationalized his actions to the Secretary of State in the following terms: This pecuniary stimulus has had the hoped for effect, by bringing forward some efficient volunteers among the Settlers whose ----- and occupations have necessarily given them a more intimate knowledge of the haunts of the natives in the neighbourhood of the settled district than is possessed by the Military, but no volunteers have received permission to act unless headed by a Magistrate or a Constable. Parties of the Military have also been in constant movement, traversing the bush is such directions as reports or conjecture rendered most likely to lead to a discovery of the lurking place of the offending tribes. These parties have all received express instructions to attempt the lives of no other than the three outlaws, unless hostility on the part of others of the tribe should render it necessary in self defense. I am happy to say these measures have already been attended with considerable effect. The whole of this hostile tribe have been harassed by the constant succession of parties sent against them, and in some instances have been hotly pursued to a considerable distance in different directions.\n\nBy the time Irwin\u2019s dispatch had been received in London, Midgegooroo had been captured and executed. Despite his efforts to convince his superiors that his actions were justified, Irwin was criticized by the Secretary of State, who would have preferred a sentence of imprisonment, believing that execution would do little to improve relationships between the traditional owners and the colonists. But as Irwin intended, the search for Midgegooroo, Yagan and Munday proceeded quickly as the military and private settlers combed the region. One volunteer party led by a colonist named Thomas Hunt (according to G.F. Moore, \u2018a most appropriate name\u2019 who had previously been a constable in London) headed south \u2018in the direction of the Murray\u2019 and came across a number of \u2018native huts\u2019 not far from the south shore of the Swan. They \u2018routed\u2019 the Aboriginal people there, and pursued a group south, shooting and killing one man who was believed to be the brother of Midgegooroo and according to Moore, bringing his ears home \u2018as a token.\u2019 According to the Perth Gazette, throughout the period immediately after the proclamation, Midgegooroo remained near the property of the Drummonds on the Helena River \u2018employed as he usually had been of late in taking care of the women and children of the tribe\u2019 and clearly unaware of his outlaw status and his impending doom. On Thursday 16 May, a military party led by Captain Ellis, acting on information that Midgegooroo was in the area, joined forces with a number of civilians, including Thomas Hardey and J. Hancock. After camping overnight, the next morning they came across Midgegooroo and his young son: The old man finding a retreat impossible, became desperate; Jeffers, a private of the 63rd ... rushed forward and seized him by the hair, Captain Ellis seized his spears and broke them in his hand, he still retained the barbed ends, with which he struck at Jeffers repeatedly; the alarm he created by crying out for Yagan, and the apprehensions of his escaping, required the exercise of the greatest firmness on the part of Captain Ellis to accomplish his being brought in alive. The capture of this man as effected in a masterly manner, and redounds highly to the credit of Captain Ellis. ... Midgegooroo in his dungeon presents a most pitiable object. In the same issue, the Perth Gazette went on to invite citizens to \u2018forward the ends of justice\u2019 by coming forward with their evidence of Midgegooroo's wrongdoings, indicative of the close relationship between the early colonial media, the Government and the nascent system of justice. The Perth Gazette constitutes one of the principle records of the events over the next few days, and it is difficult to be definite about the chronological sequence between Midgegooroo's capture on 17 May and execution on the 22nd. It appears likely that Irwin spent the period weighing up his alternatives, consulting with the Executive Council as well as men such as G.F. Moore who, as well as being a private colonist, held the official post of Commissioner of the Civil Court. On Monday 20 May, Moore records a meeting with Irwin and hints that his personal view was that Midgegooroo should be transported but there was a strong public sentiment that he should be executed; \u2018there is a great puzzle to know what to do with him. The populace cry loudly for his blood, but it is a hard thing to shoot him in cold blood. There is a strong intention of sending him into perpetual banishment in some out of the way place.\u2019 Irwin told the Secretary of State he had conducted a \u2018patient examination\u2019 and had received statements from \u2018several credible witnesses\u2019, twelve-year-old Ralph Entwhistle, John Staunton of the 63rd Regiment of Foot, Charles Bourne, constable Thomas Hunt, James Lacey, Thomas Yule (sworn before Magistrates at Fremantle) and John Ellis. Each gave brief details of Midgegooroo's alleged crimes, and identified the prisoner as the same man. Irwin reported that he gave \u2018much anxious consideration\u2019 to Midgegooroo's punishment: \"The experiment of confinement, which had been tried to some extent in the case of the three Natives whose transportation to Carnac Island and ultimate escape I have reported to your Lordship in a former dispatch appeared to have produced no good effect on the subjects of that trial, and the age of the prisoner in question apparently exceeding fifty years, forbad any sanguine hopes from such an experiment in his case.\" \nThere was no trial, even in the sense of an informal hearing. Midgegooroo was clearly not allowed the opportunity to give evidence or defend himself and indeed it is probable that he did not understand what was being alleged.\nBy 22 May, Irwin had made up his mind: \"With the unanimous advice of the Council, I therefore decided on his execution as the only sure mode of securing the Colony from an enemy, who was doubly dangerous from his apparently implacable hostility and from his influence as an acknowledged Chief. The latter circumstance being also calculated to render his death a more striking example.\" The Perth Gazette recorded the execution as follows: \"In the absence of a Sherriff, the warrant was directed to the Magistrates of the District of Perth, the duty therefore devolved upon J. Morgan Esq., as Government Resident, who immediately proceeded to carry the sentence into execution. The death warrant was read aloud to the persons assembled who immediately afterwards went inside the Jail, with the Constables and the necessary attendants, to prepare the Prisoner for his fate. Midgegooroo, on seeing that preparations were making [sic.] to punish him, yelled and struggled most violently to escape. These efforts availed him little, in less than five minutes he was pinioned and blindfolded, and bound to the outer door of the Jail. The Resident then reported to his Honor the Lieutenant Governor (who was on the spot accompanied by the Members of the Council), that all was prepared, \u2013 the warrant being declared final \u2013 he turned around and gave the signal to the party of the 63rd [which had volunteered] to advance and halt at 6 paces, \u2013 they then fired \u2013 and Midgegooroo fell. \u2013 The whole arrangement and execution after the death warrant had been handed over to the Civil Authorities, did not occupy half an hour.\" \nIrwin reported simply: \u2018He was accordingly shot, in front of the jail at Perth on the 22 Ultimo.\u2019 Moore also recorded the execution although it is not clear whether he was a witness: \u2018The native Midgegoroo, after being fully identified as being a principal in 3 murders at least, was fastened to the gaol door & fired on by a Military party, receiving 3 balls in his head, one in his body.\u2019 According to the Perth Gazette, the execution was witnessed by a \u2018great number of persons \u2026 although the Execution was sudden and the hour unknown.\u2019 \"The feeling which was generally expressed was that of satisfaction at what had taken place, and in some instances loud and vehement exaltation, which the solemnity of the scene, \u2013 a fellow human being \u2013 although a native \u2013 launched into eternity \u2013 ought to have suppressed.\"\n\nThe aftermath it appears from the extant record that, while there was a crowd in attendance at the execution, few if any Aboriginal people were present. The boy who was captured along with Midgegooroo, who was identified as his son \u2018Billy\u2019 (later referred to also as \u2018young Midgegooroo\u2019) was estimated to be between five and eight years old. He was removed \u2018out of sound and hearing of what was to happen to his father and has since been forwarded to the Government Schooner, Ellen, now lying off Garden Island, with particular instructions from the Magistrates to ensure him every protection and kind treatment.\u2019 Irwin informed the Secretary of State that \u2018the child has been kept in ignorance of his father\u2019s fate, and it is my present intention to retain him in confinement, and by kind treatment I am in hope from his tender age he may be so inured to civilized habits as to make it improbable he will revert to a barbarous life when grown up.\u2019 The Noongar population appears to have remained unaware of Midgegooroo's fate, possibly to ensure that the news would not reach the feared Yagan. Four days after the execution, G. F. Moore recorded an encounter with Yagan near his homestead when he arrived with Munday, Migo and seven others, possibly with the aim of finding out from Moore what had happened to his father. Moore, caught by surprise, decided to conceal the truth from Yagan, whereupon Yagan told him that if Midgegooroo's life was taken, he would retaliate by killing three white men. Six days later, it appears that news of the killing had still not penetrated the Noongar community for, when Moore was visited on 2 June by Weeip, Yagan's son Narral, and some women, they asked him again about Midgegooroo and his young son. Moore again concealed the execution but assured them that his son \u2018would come back again by & bye.\u2019 Two days later, Moore recorded that thefts of sheep and goats continued on the Canning River, and expressed his despair at the prospects for a people in whom he felt \u2018a very great interest\u2019: \u2018These things are very dispiriting. I fear it must come to an act of extermination between us at last if we cannot graze our flocks in safety.\u2019 It was not until 11 July that the colonists succeeded in killing Yagan, his death at the hands of sixteen-year-old James Keats on the Upper Swan, who duly collected his reward and left the colony.\n\nThe Perth Gazette recorded its satisfaction at the deaths and believed that most of the citizenry supported the ruthless actions of the Government.

By this the apostle would signify, that the reason why women are not to speak in the church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in the ministerial function, is, because this is an act of power, and authority; of rule and government, and so contrary to that subjection which God in his law requires of women unto men. The extraordinary instances of Deborah, Huldah, and Anna, must not be drawn into a rule or example in such cases.<ref>[http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/1-corinthians-14-34.html Gill, 1 Corinthians 14:34]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Methodists===\nMethodist founder [[John Wesley]] (1703\u20131791) and Methodist theologian [[Adam Clarke]] (1762\u20131832) both upheld male headship, but allowed that spiritual Christian women could publicly speak in church meetings if they \"are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit\" (Wesley),<ref>[http://www.godrules.net/library/wesley/wesley1cor14.htm], John Wesley's notes on the Bible, 1 Corinthians 14:34,35</ref> and that such were to obey that influence, and that \"the apostle lays down directions in chap. 11 for regulating her personal appearance when thus employed.\u201d  (Clarke)<ref>[http://www.godrules.net/library/clarke/clarke1cor14.htm Adam Clarke's commentary on the whole Bible], 1 Cor. 14:34,35</ref>  Puritan theologian [[Matthew Poole]] (1624\u20131679) concurred with Wesley, adding,\n<blockquote>\nBut setting aside that extraordinary case of a special afflatus, [strong Divine influence] it was, doubtless, unlawful for a woman to speak in the church.<ref>Poole, ''Annotations upon the Holy Bible''  (1852)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Matthew Henry]] (1662\u20131714) in his commentary, entertains allowing \u201cpraying, and uttering hymns inspired\u201d by women, as such \u201cwere not teaching\u201d.<ref>http://www.searchgodsword.org/com/mhc-com/view.cgi?book=1co&chapter=014</ref>\n\nWesley's hesitancy to allow women formal leadership roles was more a product of his social milieu than theological beliefs.

Hastings Boss, D.D., writing in 1870 in the ''Bibliotheca sacra and theological review'', found no sanctioned \u201cinstance in the Bible of a woman's speaking in public\u201d, in that of Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, Anna, and stated that \n\n:If these prophetesses had each been called to public speaking, they would have been exceptions to the general rule, in striking contrast with the conduct of all other women under the law. Certainly no rule could have been or can now be founded upon these exceptional cases. \n\n:Joel predicts ([[Joel 2:28-32]]) and Peter quotes ([[Acts 2:17-21]]) that \"in the last days\" God's Spirit should lead \"daughters\" and hand-maidens,\" as well as men, to \"prophesy\"; but neither prophet nor apostle specifies any particular place, as the church, in which it should be done. Now Paul nowhere forbids women to prophesy, except \" in the churches.\" They could have exercised their gift in private, or in a congregation of women, as did the four virgin daughters of Philip...A prophetess would have had enough to do among her own sex, without speaking in the assemblies.\n\nBoss also concluded that Galatians 3:28 is not applicable to the issue of women speaking in the assemblies, due to it having to do with salvation, not positions in service, \u201cthat salvation by faith is the same to all mankind, whatever be their race, condition, or sex, though natural distinctions still exist in full force.\u201d He did not, however, see any restrictions on women singing, and also allowed for women teaching out of necessity, if competent men were not to be had.

But let not the inspired prohibitions of the great apostle of the Gentiles, as found in his Epistles to the Corinthians and to Timothy, be violated. To teach and exhort, or to lead in prayer in public and promiscuous assemblies, is clearly forbidden to women in the holy oracles.\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nUYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA165&dq=%22silence+in+the+churches%22&lr=&output=html_text \u201cWomen in the church,\u201d The Presbyterian quarterly], Volume 3, NO. 8.- April, 1889. pp. 166-179</ref>\n\nCommenting on the same passage, Presbyterian theologian and Bible commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] (1798\u20131870) stated (in part) :\n\n:No rule in the New Testament is more positive than this; and however plausible may be the reasons which may be urged for disregarding it, and for suffering women to take part in conducting public worship, yet the authority of the apostle Paul is positive, and his meaning cannot be mistaken; compare 1Ti_2:11-12...\n\n:This evidently and obviously refers to the church assembled for public worship, in the ordinary and regular acts of devotion. There the assembly is made up of males and females, of old and young, and there it is improper for them to take part in conducting the exercises. But this cannot be interpreted as meaning that it is improper for females to speak or to pray in meetings of their own sex, assembled for prayer or for benevolence; nor that it is improper for a female to speak or to pray in a Sunday School.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/barnes/ntnotes.x.xiv.xxxiv.html Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible], 1 Cor. 14:34,35</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtnfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=index+ausbund&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUqenStNjgAhUhzIMKHRFkBisQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&q=index%20ausbund&f=false Profiles of Anabaptist Women: Sixteenth-Century Reforming Pioneers] edited by C.

In her teens she lectured on Cicero and Calvin's works.<ref>{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_m4x6 | url-access=registration | authors= Robin, Diana Maury, Larsen, Anne R. and Levin, Carole| year=2007 | publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc|page= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_m4x6/page/269 269]}}</ref> Her writings were published posthumously and also placed on the ''Index''. Another famous reformer John Calvin was known for contacting several noblewomen to ascertain their opinions on certain religious topics.<ref>Lindberg, Carter. \u201cLegacies of the Reformation,\u201d in The European Reformation Sourcebook. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. 261.</ref> This indicates that even the most well known of reformers were contacting women to hear what they may have to say on certain topics. In 1650, [[Silesians|Silesian]] astronomer [[Maria Cunitz]] published ''[[Urania Propitia]],'' which improved on [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s mathematical methods for locating planets. The book was published in both Latin ''and'' German, an unconventional decision that made the scientific text more accessible for non-university educated readers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-astronomer-who-took-on-most-advanced-science-180962142/|title=The 17th-Century Lady Astronomer Who Took Measure of the Stars|last=McNeill|first=Leila|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome women were part of social groups. For example, [[Princess Elisabeth Sophie of Saxe-Altenburg]] was a member of the ''Virtuous Society''.<ref>Erika Alma Metzger, Richard E. Schade: ''Sprachgesellschaften, galante Poetinnen'', Daphnis, Amsterdam 1988, p. 622.</ref>\n\n==Denominational positions==\n===Baptists===\n[[Baptist]] theologian Dr. [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]] (1690\u20131771) comments on 1 Corinthians 14:34,35, stating \n<blockquote>\nIn Genesis 3:16, \"thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee\". By this the apostle would signify, that the reason why women are not to speak in the church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in the ministerial function, is, because this is an act of power, and authority; of rule and government, and so contrary to that subjection which God in his law requires of women unto men. The extraordinary instances of Deborah, Huldah, and Anna, must not be drawn into a rule or example in such cases.<ref>[http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/1-corinthians-14-34.html Gill, 1 Corinthians 14:34]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Methodists===\nMethodist founder [[John Wesley]] (1703\u20131791) and Methodist theologian [[Adam Clarke]] (1762\u20131832) both upheld male headship, but allowed that spiritual Christian women could publicly speak in church meetings if they \"are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit\" (Wesley),<ref>[http://www.godrules.net/library/wesley/wesley1cor14.htm], John Wesley's notes on the Bible, 1 Corinthians 14:34,35</ref> and that such were to obey that influence, and that \"the apostle lays down directions in chap. 11 for regulating her personal appearance when thus employed.\u201d  (Clarke)<ref>[http://www.godrules.net/library/clarke/clarke1cor14.htm Adam Clarke's commentary on the whole Bible], 1 Cor. 14:34,35</ref>  Puritan theologian [[Matthew Poole]] (1624\u20131679) concurred with Wesley, adding,\n<blockquote>\nBut setting aside that extraordinary case of a special afflatus, [strong Divine influence] it was, doubtless, unlawful for a woman to speak in the church.<ref>Poole, ''Annotations upon the Holy Bible''  (1852)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Matthew Henry]] (1662\u20131714) in his commentary, entertains allowing \u201cpraying, and uttering hymns inspired\u201d by women, as such \u201cwere not teaching\u201d.<ref>http://www.searchgodsword.org/com/mhc-com/view.cgi?book=1co&chapter=014</ref>\n\nWesley's hesitancy to allow women formal leadership roles was more a product of his social milieu than theological beliefs. His own mother, [[Susanna_Wesley|Susanna Wesley]], was his first teacher and led enormously popular Sunday afternoon services. <ref>Haddal, Ingvar. John Wesley. New York: Abingdon Press, 1961, p 20-21</ref>\n\n===Congregationalists===\nNineteenth century Congregationalist A. Hastings Boss, D.D., writing in 1870 in the ''Bibliotheca sacra and theological review'', found no sanctioned \u201cinstance in the Bible of a woman's speaking in public\u201d, in that of Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, Anna, and stated that \n\n:If these prophetesses had each been called to public speaking, they would have been exceptions to the general rule, in striking contrast with the conduct of all other women under the law. Certainly no rule could have been or can now be founded upon these exceptional cases. \n\n:Joel predicts ([[Joel 2:28-32]]) and Peter quotes ([[Acts 2:17-21]]) that \"in the last days\" God's Spirit should lead \"daughters\" and hand-maidens,\" as well as men, to \"prophesy\"; but neither prophet nor apostle specifies any particular place, as the church, in which it should be done. Now Paul nowhere forbids women to prophesy, except \" in the churches.\" They could have exercised their gift in private, or in a congregation of women, as did the four virgin daughters of Philip...A prophetess would have had enough to do among her own sex, without speaking in the assemblies.\n\nBoss also concluded that Galatians 3:28 is not applicable to the issue of women speaking in the assemblies, due to it having to do with salvation, not positions in service, \u201cthat salvation by faith is the same to all mankind, whatever be their race, condition, or sex, though natural distinctions still exist in full force.\u201d He did not, however, see any restrictions on women singing, and also allowed for women teaching out of necessity, if competent men were not to be had. Boss, ''The silence of women in the churches \u2014objections considered,''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VsQAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA740&dq=%22silence+in+the+churches%22&output=html_text] Article viii; Bibliotheca sacra and theological review, Volume 27, pp. 739-763</ref>\n\n===Presbyterians===\nThe Presbyterian Quarterly, April, 2020, in examining both 1 Cor. 14:34,35 and 1 Tim. 11-15, stated,\n\n:As early as the year 1832, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in this country, in a pastoral letter to the churches in reference to dangers to be avoided in revivals, calls attention to a tendency then just beginning to appear, and uses this strong language (Baird, Digest, p. 220), \"Meetings of pious women by themselves for conversation and prayer, whenever they can conveniently be held, we entirely approve. But let not the inspired prohibitions of the great apostle of the Gentiles, as found in his Epistles to the Corinthians and to Timothy, be violated. To teach and exhort, or to lead in prayer in public and promiscuous assemblies, is clearly forbidden to women in the holy oracles.\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nUYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA165&dq=%22silence+in+the+churches%22&lr=&output=html_text \u201cWomen in the church,\u201d The Presbyterian quarterly], Volume 3, NO. 8.- April, 1889. pp. 166-179</ref>\n\nCommenting on the same passage, Presbyterian theologian and Bible commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] (1798\u20131870) stated (in part) :\n\n:No rule in the New Testament is more positive than this; and however plausible may be the reasons which may be urged for disregarding it, and for suffering women to take part in conducting public worship, yet the authority of the apostle Paul is positive, and his meaning cannot be mistaken; compare 1Ti_2:11-12...\n\n:This evidently and obviously refers to the church assembled for public worship, in the ordinary and regular acts of devotion. There the assembly is made up of males and females, of old and young, and there it is improper for them to take part in conducting the exercises. But this cannot be interpreted as meaning that it is improper for females to speak or to pray in meetings of their own sex, assembled for prayer or for benevolence; nor that it is improper for a female to speak or to pray in a Sunday School.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/barnes/ntnotes.x.xiv.xxxiv.html Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible], 1 Cor. 14:34,35</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtnfAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=index+ausbund&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUqenStNjgAhUhzIMKHRFkBisQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&q=index%20ausbund&f=false Profiles of Anabaptist Women: Sixteenth-Century Reforming Pioneers] edited by C.

Its well-preserved medieval towns of [[Kotor]], [[Risan]], [[Tivat]], [[Perast]], [[Pr\u010danj]] and [[Herceg Novi]], along with their natural surroundings, are major tourist attractions. The [[Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor]] was designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1979. Its numerous [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] churches and monasteries attract numerous religious and cultural pilgrims.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Perast and Bay of Kotor from Saint Nicholas' Church.jpg|thumb|left|Perast and Bay of Kotor from Saint Nicholas' Church]]\n[[File:Perast 12.jpg|thumb|left|Bay of Kotor.]]\n\nThe bay is about {{convert|28|km}} long with a shoreline extending {{convert|107.3|km}}. It is surrounded by two [[massif]]s of the [[Dinaric Alps]]: the [[Orjen]] mountains to the west, and the [[Lov\u0107en]] mountains to the east. The narrowest section of the bay, the {{convert|2300|m|adj=on}} long Verige Strait, is only {{convert|340|m}} wide at its narrowest point.<ref>D Maga\u0161. \"Natural-Geographic Characteristics of the Boka Kotosdka Area As the Basis of Development\". ''Geoadria'' Vol. 7 No. 1, Croatian Geographical Society and University of Zadar Department of Geography, Zadar, 2002, pp. 53.</ref> The bay is a [[ria]] of the vanished Bokelj River, which used to flow from the high mountain plateaus of [[Mount Orjen]].\n\nThe bay is composed of several smaller broad bays, united by narrower channels. The bay inlet was formerly a river system. Tectonic and [[karst]]ification processes led to the disintegration of this river. After heavy rains, the waterfall of Sopot spring at [[Risan]] appears, and \u0160kurda, another well-known spring, runs through a canyon from Lov\u0107en.\n\nThe outermost part of the bay is the Bay of [[Tivat]]. On the seaward side is the Bay of [[Herceg Novi]], at the main entrance to the Bay of Kotor. The inner bays are the Bay of [[Risan]] to the northwest and the Bay of [[Kotor]] to the southeast.\n\nThe Verige Strait represents the bay's narrowest section and is located between Cape St. Nedjelja and Cape Opatovo; it separates the inner bay east of the strait from the Bay of Tivat.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Bay lies within the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] and northwards the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone, but its peculiar topography and high mountains make it one of the wettest places in Europe, with Europe's wettest inhabited areas (although certain [[List of glaciers of Iceland|Icelandic glaciers]] are wetter<ref>{{cite web|title=Late Holocene Glacial History of S\u00f3lheimaj\u00f6kull, Southern Iceland|url=http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/7407/19823/1/Bjarki_Friis_master_thesis_ready_for_printing_V3.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320114211/http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/7407/19823/1/Bjarki_Friis_master_thesis_ready_for_printing_V3.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-20}}</ref>). The littoral Dinarids and the [[Prokletije]] mountains receive the most precipitation, leading to small glaciers surviving well above the {{convert|0|C|F}} mean annual [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]]. November thunderstorms sometimes drop large amounts of water. By contrast, in August the area is frequently completely dry, leading to [[forest fire]]s. With a maximum discharge of {{convert|200|m\u00b3/s|abbr=on}}, one of the biggest [[karst]] [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, the Sopot spring, reflects this seasonal variation. Most of the time it is inactive but after heavy rain a waterfall appears {{convert|20|m}} above the Bay of Kotor.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"toccolours\" style=\"align:left; margin:0.5em 0 0; border-style:solid; border:1px solid #7f7f7f; border-right-width:2px; border-bottom-width:2px; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Station\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Height [m]\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Type\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Character\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Precipitation [mm]\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Snow\n|-\n| '''[[Veliki kabao]]'''\n|  1894\n|   '''D'''\n|perhumid Mediterranean snowclimate\n|  c.

Strong cold [[Katabatic wind|downslope wind]]s of the Bora type appear in winter and are most severe in the Bay of Risan.

As elsewhere in the Balkans, Slavs mixed with the Roman population of these Byzantine coastal cities. The [[Theme of Dalmatia]] was established in the 870s. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (ca. 960), [[Risan]] was part of [[Travunia]], a Serbian principality ruled by the [[Belojevi\u0107 noble family|Belojevi\u0107 family]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, the coastal region was under both Churches. In 1171, [[Stefan Nemanja]] sided with the [[Venetian Republic]] in a dispute with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Venetians incited the [[Slavs]] of the eastern [[Adriatic]] [[littoral]] to rebel against Byzantine rule and Nemanja joined them, launching an offensive towards [[Kotor]]. The Bay was thenceforth under the rule of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]]. In 1195 Nemanja and his son Vukan constructed the Church of Saint Luka in Kotor.   In 1219 [[Saint Sava]] founded the seat of the [[Eparchy of Zeta]] on [[Prevlaka]],{{sfn|Popovi\u0107|2002|p=173}} one of the eparchies of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Due to its protected location, Kotor became a major city for the salt trade. The area flourished during the 14th century under the rule of Serbian emperor [[Stefan Du\u0161an|Du\u0161an \"The Mighty\"]] who, notorious for his aggressive law enforcement, made the Bay of Kotor a particularly safe place for doing business.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gik5DgAAQBAJ&pg=PT148&lpg=PT148&dq=serbian+empire+dusan+dubrovnik&source=bl&ots=J_xBCEUPxN&sig=1Vv3AGYhAOPZU5iywuiZOvRe5hQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHyq7LieDcAhVGXBoKHZ00C4YQ6AEwEXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=serbian%20empire%20dusan%20dubrovnik&f=false Rick Steves Snapshot Dubrovnik] by Rick Steves and Cameron Hewitt</ref>\n\nThe city of Kotor was under Nemanji\u0107 rule until 1371. It was followed by a period of frequent political changes in the region. Local lords from [[Vojinovi\u0107 noble family|Vojinovi\u0107]] and [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family|Bal\u0161i\u0107]] noble families fought over the influence in the region. Since 1377, northern parts of the Bay region came under the rule of [[Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]], who proclaimed himself [[King of the Serbs and Bosnia]]. For several years (1385-1391), the city of Kotor also recognized the suzerainty of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]]. After 1391, it gained political independence, and functioned as a city-state until 1420. Its merchant fleet and importance gradually increased, but so was the interest of the powerful [[Republic of Venice]] for the city and the bay region. From 1405 to 1412, the [[First Scutari War]] was fought in the region.\n\n===Venetian rule (1420\u20131797)===\nIn 1420, the city of Kotor recognized the Venetian rule,{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=92}} marking the beginning of an era that would last until 1797. Northern parts of the Bay region still remained under the Kingdom of Bosnia, while southern parts were controlled the [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Lordship of Zeta]], followed by the [[Serbian Despotate]]. In the meanwhile, the [[Second Scutari War]] was fought in the region, resulting in the peace treaties of 1423 and 1426.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, northern parts of the Bay region became incorporated into the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]]. In 1482, Ottomans took the city of [[Herceg Novi|Novi]], establishing their rule in the northern parts of the Bay area. Under Ottoman rule, those regions were attached to the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. The Ottoman possessions in the Bay region were retaken at the end of the 17th century and the whole area became part of the Venetian Republic, within the province called the [[Albania Veneta]]. Until the 20th century the difference between the two parts was visible because the former Ottoman part had an [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] majority, while the part that was under Venetian rule had a [[Catholic]] majority.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=185}}\n\nThe town of [[Perast]] had difficult moments in 1654 when the Ottomans attacked, retaliating against Bokeljs who had sunk an Ottoman ship. The Bokeljs' successful defence of Perast and Boka received attention all over Europe. It attracted [[Petar Zrinski]], a statesman in Europe who had fought dramatic battles with the Turks. During his three-day sojourn in Perast he presented his legendary sword to the town in recognition for their efforts to defend their homeland, and to stop the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1669, according to [[Andrija Zmajevi\u0107]], [[hajduk]]s of the Bay<ref name=\"Milo\u0161evi\u01071988\">{{cite book|author=Milo\u0161 Milo\u0161evi\u0107|title=Hajduci u Boki Kotorskoj 1648\u20131718|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EfajmgEACAAJ|year=1988|publisher=CANU}}</ref> wished to build a church, but were denied due to Zmajevi\u0107's intervention on the ''providur'' of Kotor and captain of Perast.<ref name=\"Ja\u010dov1992\">{{cite book|author=Marko Ja\u010dov|title=Le Missioni cattoliche nei Balcani durante la Guerra di Candia (1645\u20131669)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiMUAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA709|year=1992|publisher=Biblioteca apostolica vaticana|isbn=978-88-210-0638-8|pages=709\u2013}}</ref> Turkish travel writer [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] visits the Bay of Kotor and mentione Croats who live in the [[Herceg Novi]]<ref>http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/odcrnojevica_dopetrovica/kako_je_evlija_celebija_pisao_o_hn_m_bojanic.htm</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Boka oldmap.gif|thumb|right|200px|Historic map of the Bay of Kotor]]\n[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|right|200px| Bay of Kotor within the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] in [[Austria-Hungary]]]]\n\nBy the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (1797), the Bay region came under the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] rule. By the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] (1805), the region was set to be transferred to the French rule, but that was effectively achieved only after the [[Peace of Tilsit]] (1807). Under the French rule, the Bay region was included in the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]] and later in the [[Illyrian provinces]],{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=187}} which were a part of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. The region was later conquered by [[Montenegro]] with Russian help by [[Prince-Bishop]] [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] and, in 1813, a union of the bay area with [[Montenegro]] was declared. In 1815, the bay was annexed by the [[Austrian Empire]] and was included in the province of [[Dalmatia]] (part of [[Cisleithania]] since 1867). In 1848, when the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|numerous revolutions sparked in the Austrian Empire]], an Assembly of the Gulf of Kotor was held sponsored by [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Montenegro, to decide on the proposition of Boka's unification with Croatian Ban [[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]] in an attempt to unite [[Dalmatia]], Croatia and [[Slavonia]] under the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] crown. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] attempted to take the bay during [[World War I]]. It was bombarded from [[Lov\u0107en]], but by 1916 Austria-Hungary had defeated Montenegro. During Austro-Hungarian rule majority of people participated on retreat with Serbian army through Albania. On 7 November 1918 the Serbian army entered the bay. Within a month, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] was formed and was renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929. The bay was a municipality of Dalmatia until it was re-organized into smaller districts in 1922. It was incorporated into the Zeta Area and from 1939 Zeta Banate. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAccording to the 1910 census, the bay had 40,582 inhabitants, of whom 24,794 were Orthodox Christians and 14,523 Catholics.\n\nThe Bay region was occupied by the Italian Army in April 1941 and was included in the Italian [[Governatorato di Dalmazia]] until September 1943. Since 1945, it has been part of the Republic of [[Montenegro]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Culture==\nMost of the region's inhabitants are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], declaring themselves on census forms of either Montenegrins or Serbians, while a minority are Croatians. The Bay region is under the protection of [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO]] due to its rich cultural heritage.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe Boka region has a long naval tradition and has harbored a strong naval fleet since the Middle Ages. The fleet peaked at 300 ships in the 18th century, when Boka was a rival to [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Venice]].\n\nOn the landward side, long walls run from the fortified old town of Kotor to the castle of Saint John, far above; the heights of the Krivo\u0161ije, a group of barren plateaus in Mount Orjen, were crowned by small forts.\n\nThe shores of the bay Herceg Novi house the Orthodox convent of St. Sava near (Savina monastery) standing amid surrounding gardens. It was founded in the 16th century and contains many specimens of 17th century silversmiths' work. 12.87&nbsp;km east of Herceg Novi, there is a Benedictine monastery on a small island opposite Perast (Perasto). Perast itself was for a time an independent state in the 14th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Kotor and Boka kotorska - view from city wall.jpg|thumb|300px|Kotor and Boka kotorska]]\nThe '''Bokelj''' (''\u0411\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0459'') people (pl.

Its well-preserved medieval towns of [[Kotor]], [[Risan]], [[Tivat]], [[Perast]], [[Pr\u010danj]] and [[Herceg Novi]], along with their natural surroundings, are major tourist attractions. The [[Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor]] was designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1979. Its numerous [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] churches and monasteries attract numerous religious and cultural pilgrims. \n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Perast and Bay of Kotor from Saint Nicholas' Church.jpg|thumb|left|Perast and Bay of Kotor from Saint Nicholas' Church]]\n[[File:Perast 12.jpg|thumb|left|Bay of Kotor.]]\n\nThe bay is about {{convert|28|km}} long with a shoreline extending {{convert|107.3|km}}. It is surrounded by two [[massif]]s of the [[Dinaric Alps]]: the [[Orjen]] mountains to the west, and the [[Lov\u0107en]] mountains to the east. The narrowest section of the bay, the {{convert|2300|m|adj=on}} long Verige Strait, is only {{convert|340|m}} wide at its narrowest point.<ref>D Maga\u0161. \"Natural-Geographic Characteristics of the Boka Kotosdka Area As the Basis of Development\". ''Geoadria'' Vol. 7 No. 1, Croatian Geographical Society and University of Zadar Department of Geography, Zadar, 2002, pp. 53.</ref> The bay is a [[ria]] of the vanished Bokelj River, which used to flow from the high mountain plateaus of [[Mount Orjen]].\n\nThe bay is composed of several smaller broad bays, united by narrower channels. The bay inlet was formerly a river system. Tectonic and [[karst]]ification processes led to the disintegration of this river. After heavy rains, the waterfall of Sopot spring at [[Risan]] appears, and \u0160kurda, another well-known spring, runs through a canyon from Lov\u0107en.\n\nThe outermost part of the bay is the Bay of [[Tivat]]. On the seaward side is the Bay of [[Herceg Novi]], at the main entrance to the Bay of Kotor. The inner bays are the Bay of [[Risan]] to the northwest and the Bay of [[Kotor]] to the southeast.\n\nThe Verige Strait represents the bay's narrowest section and is located between Cape St. Nedjelja and Cape Opatovo; it separates the inner bay east of the strait from the Bay of Tivat.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Bay lies within the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] and northwards the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone, but its peculiar topography and high mountains make it one of the wettest places in Europe, with Europe's wettest inhabited areas (although certain [[List of glaciers of Iceland|Icelandic glaciers]] are wetter<ref>{{cite web|title=Late Holocene Glacial History of S\u00f3lheimaj\u00f6kull, Southern Iceland|url=http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/7407/19823/1/Bjarki_Friis_master_thesis_ready_for_printing_V3.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320114211/http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/7407/19823/1/Bjarki_Friis_master_thesis_ready_for_printing_V3.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-20}}</ref>). The littoral Dinarids and the [[Prokletije]] mountains receive the most precipitation, leading to small glaciers surviving well above the {{convert|0|C|F}} mean annual [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]]. November thunderstorms sometimes drop large amounts of water. By contrast, in August the area is frequently completely dry, leading to [[forest fire]]s. With a maximum discharge of {{convert|200|m\u00b3/s|abbr=on}}, one of the biggest [[karst]] [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, the Sopot spring, reflects this seasonal variation.

According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (ca. 960), [[Risan]] was part of [[Travunia]], a Serbian principality ruled by the [[Belojevi\u0107 noble family|Belojevi\u0107 family]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, the coastal region was under both Churches. In 1171, [[Stefan Nemanja]] sided with the [[Venetian Republic]] in a dispute with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Venetians incited the [[Slavs]] of the eastern [[Adriatic]] [[littoral]] to rebel against Byzantine rule and Nemanja joined them, launching an offensive towards [[Kotor]]. The Bay was thenceforth under the rule of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]]. In 1195 Nemanja and his son Vukan constructed the Church of Saint Luka in Kotor.   In 1219 [[Saint Sava]] founded the seat of the [[Eparchy of Zeta]] on [[Prevlaka]],{{sfn|Popovi\u0107|2002|p=173}} one of the eparchies of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Due to its protected location, Kotor became a major city for the salt trade. The area flourished during the 14th century under the rule of Serbian emperor [[Stefan Du\u0161an|Du\u0161an \"The Mighty\"]] who, notorious for his aggressive law enforcement, made the Bay of Kotor a particularly safe place for doing business.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gik5DgAAQBAJ&pg=PT148&lpg=PT148&dq=serbian+empire+dusan+dubrovnik&source=bl&ots=J_xBCEUPxN&sig=1Vv3AGYhAOPZU5iywuiZOvRe5hQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHyq7LieDcAhVGXBoKHZ00C4YQ6AEwEXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=serbian%20empire%20dusan%20dubrovnik&f=false Rick Steves Snapshot Dubrovnik] by Rick Steves and Cameron Hewitt</ref>\n\nThe city of Kotor was under Nemanji\u0107 rule until 1371. It was followed by a period of frequent political changes in the region. Local lords from [[Vojinovi\u0107 noble family|Vojinovi\u0107]] and [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family|Bal\u0161i\u0107]] noble families fought over the influence in the region. Since 1377, northern parts of the Bay region came under the rule of [[Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]], who proclaimed himself [[King of the Serbs and Bosnia]]. For several years (1385-1391), the city of Kotor also recognized the suzerainty of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]]. After 1391, it gained political independence, and functioned as a city-state until 1420. Its merchant fleet and importance gradually increased, but so was the interest of the powerful [[Republic of Venice]] for the city and the bay region. From 1405 to 1412, the [[First Scutari War]] was fought in the region.\n\n===Venetian rule (1420\u20131797)===\nIn 1420, the city of Kotor recognized the Venetian rule,{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=92}} marking the beginning of an era that would last until 1797. Northern parts of the Bay region still remained under the Kingdom of Bosnia, while southern parts were controlled the [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Lordship of Zeta]], followed by the [[Serbian Despotate]]. In the meanwhile, the [[Second Scutari War]] was fought in the region, resulting in the peace treaties of 1423 and 1426.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nBy the middle of the 15th century, northern parts of the Bay region became incorporated into the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]]. In 1482, Ottomans took the city of [[Herceg Novi|Novi]], establishing their rule in the northern parts of the Bay area. Under Ottoman rule, those regions were attached to the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. The Ottoman possessions in the Bay region were retaken at the end of the 17th century and the whole area became part of the Venetian Republic, within the province called the [[Albania Veneta]]. Until the 20th century the difference between the two parts was visible because the former Ottoman part had an [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] majority, while the part that was under Venetian rule had a [[Catholic]] majority.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=185}}\n\nThe town of [[Perast]] had difficult moments in 1654 when the Ottomans attacked, retaliating against Bokeljs who had sunk an Ottoman ship. The Bokeljs' successful defence of Perast and Boka received attention all over Europe. It attracted [[Petar Zrinski]], a statesman in Europe who had fought dramatic battles with the Turks. During his three-day sojourn in Perast he presented his legendary sword to the town in recognition for their efforts to defend their homeland, and to stop the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1669, according to [[Andrija Zmajevi\u0107]], [[hajduk]]s of the Bay<ref name=\"Milo\u0161evi\u01071988\">{{cite book|author=Milo\u0161 Milo\u0161evi\u0107|title=Hajduci u Boki Kotorskoj 1648\u20131718|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EfajmgEACAAJ|year=1988|publisher=CANU}}</ref> wished to build a church, but were denied due to Zmajevi\u0107's intervention on the ''providur'' of Kotor and captain of Perast.<ref name=\"Ja\u010dov1992\">{{cite book|author=Marko Ja\u010dov|title=Le Missioni cattoliche nei Balcani durante la Guerra di Candia (1645\u20131669)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiMUAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA709|year=1992|publisher=Biblioteca apostolica vaticana|isbn=978-88-210-0638-8|pages=709\u2013}}</ref> Turkish travel writer [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] visits the Bay of Kotor and mentione Croats who live in the [[Herceg Novi]]<ref>http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/odcrnojevica_dopetrovica/kako_je_evlija_celebija_pisao_o_hn_m_bojanic.htm</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Boka oldmap.gif|thumb|right|200px|Historic map of the Bay of Kotor]]\n[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|right|200px| Bay of Kotor within the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] in [[Austria-Hungary]]]]\n\nBy the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (1797), the Bay region came under the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] rule. By the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] (1805), the region was set to be transferred to the French rule, but that was effectively achieved only after the [[Peace of Tilsit]] (1807). Under the French rule, the Bay region was included in the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]] and later in the [[Illyrian provinces]],{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=187}} which were a part of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. The region was later conquered by [[Montenegro]] with Russian help by [[Prince-Bishop]] [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] and, in 1813, a union of the bay area with [[Montenegro]] was declared. In 1815, the bay was annexed by the [[Austrian Empire]] and was included in the province of [[Dalmatia]] (part of [[Cisleithania]] since 1867). In 1848, when the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|numerous revolutions sparked in the Austrian Empire]], an Assembly of the Gulf of Kotor was held sponsored by [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Montenegro, to decide on the proposition of Boka's unification with Croatian Ban [[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]] in an attempt to unite [[Dalmatia]], Croatia and [[Slavonia]] under the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] crown. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] attempted to take the bay during [[World War I]]. It was bombarded from [[Lov\u0107en]], but by 1916 Austria-Hungary had defeated Montenegro. During Austro-Hungarian rule majority of people participated on retreat with Serbian army through Albania. On 7 November 1918 the Serbian army entered the bay. Within a month, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] was formed and was renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929. The bay was a municipality of Dalmatia until it was re-organized into smaller districts in 1922. It was incorporated into the Zeta Area and from 1939 Zeta Banate. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAccording to the 1910 census, the bay had 40,582 inhabitants, of whom 24,794 were Orthodox Christians and 14,523 Catholics.\n\nThe Bay region was occupied by the Italian Army in April 1941 and was included in the Italian [[Governatorato di Dalmazia]] until September 1943. Since 1945, it has been part of the Republic of [[Montenegro]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Culture==\nMost of the region's inhabitants are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], declaring themselves on census forms of either Montenegrins or Serbians, while a minority are Croatians. The Bay region is under the protection of [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO]] due to its rich cultural heritage.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe Boka region has a long naval tradition and has harbored a strong naval fleet since the Middle Ages. The fleet peaked at 300 ships in the 18th century, when Boka was a rival to [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Venice]].\n\nOn the landward side, long walls run from the fortified old town of Kotor to the castle of Saint John, far above; the heights of the Krivo\u0161ije, a group of barren plateaus in Mount Orjen, were crowned by small forts.\n\nThe shores of the bay Herceg Novi house the Orthodox convent of St. Sava near (Savina monastery) standing amid surrounding gardens. It was founded in the 16th century and contains many specimens of 17th century silversmiths' work. 12.87&nbsp;km east of Herceg Novi, there is a Benedictine monastery on a small island opposite Perast (Perasto).

The crown is used as a heraldic symbol in the coats of arms of the Commonwealth and the states of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Crowns are also visible on police and military badges. The [[Queen's Birthday]] is observed as a public holiday in all states.\n\n\"[[God Save the Queen]]\" is Australia's [[royal anthem]]. The \"Vice-Regal Salute\", played only for the Governor-General and each state governor, is the first four and last four bars of \"[[Advance Australia Fair]]\".\n\nThere are also hundreds of places named after Australian and British monarchs and members of the Royal Family. The states of [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were named after [[Queen Victoria]]; [[Adelaide]], the capital of South Australia is named after [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], the [[Queen consort|consort]] of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]; numerous streets, squares, parks and buildings are also named in honour of past or present members of the Royal Family.\n\n===Religious role===\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip with Canberra Anglicans 23Oct11.jpg|thumb|right|The Queen and Prince Philip attending an Anglican service in Canberra]]\nUntil its new constitution went into force in 1962, the [[Anglican Church of Australia]] was part of the [[Church of England]].

Still, Elizabeth remained both as a queen who reigned in Australia both as Queen of Australia (in the federal jurisdiction) and Queen of the United Kingdom (in each of the states), as a result of the states not wishing to have the Statute of Westminster apply to them, believing that the ''status quo'' better protected their sovereign interests against an expansionist federal government, which left the Colonial Laws Validity Act in effect. Thus, the British monarch could still{{spaced ndash}}at least in theory, if not with some difficulty in practice{{spaced ndash}}legislate for the Australian states, and the [[viceroy]]s in the states were appointed by and represented the sovereign of the United Kingdom, not that of Australia;<ref>Craig; p.43</ref> as late as 1976, the British ministry advised the Queen to reject [[Colin Hannah]] as the nominee of the [[Queensland]] Cabinet for [[Governors of Queensland|governor]],<ref>Chipp, Don; ''An Individual View''; p.144</ref> and court cases from Australian states could be appealed directly to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London, thereby bypassing the Australian High Court.

His parents separated when he was three years old, causing him to sometimes live with either of his parents and sometimes his grandparents, depending on situations and circumstances. His father died in 1943 in a Nazi concentration camp, [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]]. Remco then went to live with his mother. They returned to [[Amsterdam]] after [[World War II]] in 1945, after having spent the three preceding years in the town of [[Epe, Netherlands|Epe]].\n\n==His writings==\nIn Amsterdam, he started a secondary education at the ''Amsterdam Lyceum'', occasionally writing articles or drawing comics for the school's newspaper. As the years went on, he skipped more and more classes and spent increasing amounts of time in cinemas, jazz clubs or pubs. He finally left school without graduating. With [[Rudy Kousbroek]], a school friend, he founded the magazine ''Braak'' in May 1950. Between 1949 and 1952 Campert drew cartoons for the Dutch magazine ''Mandrill'' and ''[[Het Parool]]'' and in the 1970s for ''[[Haagse Post]]'' too. In 1979 he drew comics for [[NRC Handelsblad]].<ref name=\"lambiek.net\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/campert_remco.htm|title=Remco Campert|website=lambiek.net}}</ref>\n\nCampert married Freddie Rutgers in 1949, but they separated five years later. In order to finance his living, Campert resorted to writing commercial texts or jingles as well as translating foreign literary works. He later married author Fritzi ten Harmsen van der Beek (daughter of comics artist [[Harmsen van der Beek]] <ref name=\"lambiek.net\"/>), with whom he lived in Blaricum until 1957, when he returned to Amsterdam. He divorced his second wife and married Lucia van den Berg in 1961. They moved to [[Antwerp]] in 1964, but Campert returned to Amsterdam two years later. There, he met art gallery owner Deborah Wolf, with whom he lived until 1980.\n\nHe has mostly kept quiet about his life in the following years, however, he once explained his situation in 1994, in an interview to Cees van Hoore, journalist of newspaper 'Nieuwsblad van het Noorden'. He was quoted as saying; \"I don't choke myself. I'm my own best company. Whenever I lived together with someone, I felt like being underwater for days on end. To be together is to be twice alone and I don't need that. I'm more than happily married to my career.\"\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, he had written very little. He explained to journalist Jan Brokken of the Dutch newspaper ''Haagse Post'': \"I couldn't write for years on end. I didn't feel like it. I felt a physical repulsion towards it. I thought about it, but I was paralysed by doubts.\"\n\nHe resumed writing in 1979. He wrote ''Somberman's actie'' in 1985. From 1989 until 1995, Campert starred in theatres throughout the nation and beyond in a play he had created together with [[Jan Mulder (footballer)|Jan Mulder]] (author and ex-football player). Their shows were based on both their literary works. 1995 was also the year he read his bestseller novel 'Het leven is vurrukkulluk' on the radio.\n\nDutch people of older generations will most likely associate his name with ''CaMu'', the partnership between Remco Campert and Jan Mulder that wrote daily front-page columns for national newspaper '[[de Volkskrant]]' from 1995 until 2006. These columns traditionally have been bundled into books titled ''CaMu ....: Het jaaroverzicht van Remco Campert en Jan Mulder'' at the end of each year.\n\n==Bibliography==\n[[File:Remco Campert signeert.jpg|thumb|Campert signing a book at a poetry event celebrating his 80th birthday]]\n* 1950 'Ten lessons with Timothy' (poems).\n* 1951 'Vogels vliegen toch' (poems).\n* 1952 'Een standbeeld opwinden' (poems).\n* 1953 'Berchtesgaden' (poems).\n* 1953 'Eendjes voeren' (short stories).\n* 1955 'Alle dagen feest' (short stories).\n* 1955 'Het huis waarin ik woonde' (poems).\n* 1955 'Met man en muis' (poems).\n* 1956 'Lodewijk Sebastiaan' (short stories).\n* 1956 'Van de wijs' (short stories).\n* 1958 'De jongen met het mes en andere verhalen' (short stories).\n* 1959 'Bij hoog en bij laag' (poems).\n* 1960 'Een ellendige nietsnut en andere verhalen' (short stories).\n* 1961 'Het leven is vurrukkulluk' (novel).\n* 1962 'Dit gebeurde overal' (poems, also appeared in English under the title 'This happened everywhere').\n* 1962 'Het paard van Ome Loeks' (short stories).\n* 1963 'Liefdes schijnbewegingen : een leesboek' (novel, also appeared in English under the title 'No holds barred')\n* 1964 'Nacht op de kale dwerg' (short stories).\n* 1965 'Het gangstermeisje' (novel, also appeared in English under the title 'The gangster girl').\n* 1965 'Hoera, hoera' (poems).\n* 1968 'Fabeltjes vertellen' (short stories).\n* 1968 'Mijn leven's liederen' (poems).\n* 1968 'Tjeempie! of Liesje in Luiletterland' (novel).\n* 1969 'Hoe ik mijn verjaardag vierde' (short stories).\n* 1970 'Betere tijden' (poems).\n* 1971 'Campert Compleet' (short stories).\n* 1972 'James Dean en het verdriet' (short stories).\n* 1974 'Basta het toverkonijn' (short stories).\n* 1974 'Op reis' (novel, written together with Willem Malsen).\n* 1976 'Alle bundels gedichten' (poems).\n* 1976 'Luister goed naar wat ik verzwijg' (thoughts and philosophies).\n* 1978 'Waar is Remco Campert?'
