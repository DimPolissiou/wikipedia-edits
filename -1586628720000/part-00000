In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \"[[I Wanna Talk About Me]]\" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by [[Toby Keith]], whose version was a number 1 single.<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nInstead, Giant released \"[[Austin (song)|Austin]]\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company [[Warner Bros. Records]]. \"Austin\" became Shelton's first number one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's [[Blake Shelton (album)|self-titled debut album]], which was produced by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]]. It also produced the Top 20 hits \"[[All Over Me (Blake Shelton song)|All Over Me]]\", which Shelton co-wrote with [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and Mike Pyle, and \"[[Ol' Red]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Although Shelton's rendition of \"Ol' Red\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his [[signature song]], and it has become popular in [[concert]].<ref name=\"AutoRD-3\"/> The album received a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blake+Shelton&ti=#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of [[Allmusic]], who called \"Austin\" \"tremendously imaginative\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.<ref name=\"AutoRD-4\"/> ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the \"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\".<ref name=\"AutoRD-5\"/>\n\nShelton's second album, ''The Dreamer'', was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \"The Baby\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (\"Heavy Liftin'\" and \"Playboys of the Southwestern World\", respectively) only reached No.32 and No.&nbsp;24, ''The Dreamer'' earned gold certification as well.

In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \"[[I Wanna Talk About Me]]\" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by [[Toby Keith]], whose version was a number 1 single.<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nInstead, Giant released \"[[Austin (song)|Austin]]\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company [[Warner Bros. Records]]. \"Austin\" became Shelton's first number one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's [[Blake Shelton (album)|self-titled debut album]], which was produced by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]]. It also produced the Top 20 hits \"[[All Over Me (Blake Shelton song)|All Over Me]]\", which Shelton co-wrote with [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and Mike Pyle, and \"[[Ol' Red]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Although Shelton's rendition of \"Ol' Red\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his [[signature song]], and it has become popular in [[concert]].<ref name=\"AutoRD-3\"/> The album received a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blake+Shelton&ti=#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of [[Allmusic]], who called \"Austin\" \"tremendously imaginative\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.<ref name=\"AutoRD-4\"/> ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the \"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\".<ref name=\"AutoRD-5\"/>\n\nShelton's second album, ''The Dreamer'', was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \"The Baby\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Charged particles cannot be trapped in 3D by just electrostatic forces because of [[Earnshaw's theorem]].  Instead, an electric field oscillating at [[radio frequency]] (RF) is applied, forming a potential with the shape of a saddle spinning at the RF frequency. If the RF field has the right parameters (oscillation frequency and field strength), the charged particle becomes effectively trapped at the [[saddle point]] by a restoring force, with the motion described by a set of [[Mathieu function|Mathieu equations]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThis saddle point is the point of minimized energy magnitude, <math>|E(\\overrightarrow{x})|</math>, for the ions in the potential field.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/ion-trap-quantum-computing-group/intro-to-ion-trap-qc|title=Introduction to Ion Trap Quantum Computing {{!}} University of Oxford Department of Physics|website=www2.physics.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref> The Paul trap is often described as a harmonic potential well that traps ions in two dimensions (assume <math>\\widehat{x\n    \n}</math> and <math>\\widehat{y}</math> without loss of generality) and does not trap ions in the <math>\\widehat{z}</math> direction.

The same year, a key step in the controlled-NOT gate was experimentally realized at [[NIST]] Ion Storage Group, and research in quantum computing began to take off worldwide.  Many traditional ion trapping research groups have made the transition to quantum computing research, while, more recently, many other new research groups have joined the effort. An enormous amount of progress in this field has been made in the past decade and trapped ions remain a leading candidate for quantum computation.\n\n==Requirements for quantum computation==\n[[Image:Planar Ion Trap; Magnesium Ions (5884514798).jpg|thumb|Magnesium ions in a trap.]]\nThe full requirements for a functional quantum computer are not entirely known, but there are many generally accepted requirements. DiVincenzo outlined several of these criterion for quantum computing (see [[DiVincenzo's criteria]]).<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Qubits===\nAny two-level quantum system can form a qubit, and there are two predominant ways to form a qubit using the electronic states of an ion:\n\n# Two ground state [[hyperfine]] levels (these are called \"hyperfine qubits\")\n# A ground state level and an excited level (these are called the \"optical qubits\")\n\nHyperfine qubits are extremely long-lived (decay time of the order of thousands to millions of years) and phase/frequency stable (traditionally used for atomic frequency standards).<ref name=\":12\" /> Optical qubits are also relatively long-lived (with a decay time of the order of a second), compared to the logic gate operation time (which is of the order of [[microseconds]]). The use of each type of qubit poses its own distinct challenges in the laboratory.\n\n===Initialization===\nIonic qubit states can be prepared in a specific qubit state using a process called [[optical pumping]]. In this process, a laser couples the ion to some excited states which eventually decay to one state which is not coupled to the laser. Once the ion reaches that state, it has no excited levels to couple to in the presence of that laser and, therefore, remains in that state. If the ion decays to one of the other states, the laser will continue to excite the ion until it decays to the state that does not interact with the laser. This initialization process is standard in many physics experiments and can be performed with extremely high [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity]] (>99.9%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schindler|first=Philipp|last2=Nigg|first2=Daniel|last3=Monz|first3=Thomas|last4=Barreiro|first4=Julio T.|last5=Martinez|first5=Esteban|last6=Wang|first6=Shannon X.|last7=Stephan Quint|last8=Brandl|first8=Matthias F.|last9=Nebendahl|first9=Volckmar|date=2013|title=A quantum information processor with trapped ions|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/15/i=12/a=123012|journal=New Journal of Physics|volume=15|issue=12|pages=123012|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/15/12/123012|issn=1367-2630|arxiv=1308.3096}}</ref>\n\nThe system's initial state for quantum computation can therefore be described by the ions in their hyperfine and motional ground states, resulting in an initial center of mass phonon state of <math>|0\\rangle</math>(zero phonons).<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Measurement===\nMeasuring the state of the qubit stored in an ion is quite simple.  Typically, a laser is applied to the ion that couples only one of the qubit states.  When the ion collapses into this state during the measurement process, the laser will excite it, resulting in a photon being released when the ion decays from the excited state.  After decay, the ion is continually excited by the laser and repeatedly emits photons. These photons can be collected by a [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]] (PMT) or a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera. If the ion collapses into the other qubit state, then it does not interact with the laser and no photon is emitted. By counting the number of collected photons, the state of the ion may be determined with a very high accuracy (>99.9%).\n\n===Arbitrary single qubit rotation===\nOne of the requirements of universal quantum computing is to coherently change the state of a single qubit. For example, this can transform a qubit starting out in 0 into any arbitrary superposition of 0 and 1 defined by the user. In a trapped ion system, this is often done using [[magnetic dipole transition]]s or stimulated [[Raman transitions]] for hyperfine qubits and electric quadrupole transitions for optical qubits.  The term \"rotation\" alludes to the [[Bloch sphere]] representation of a qubit pure state. Gate fidelity can be greater than 99%.\n\nThe operations <math>R_x(\\theta)</math>and <math>R_y(\\theta)</math>can be applied to individual ions by manipulating the frequency of an external electromagnetic field from and exposing the ions to the field for specific amounts of time. These controls create a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the form <math>H_I^i=\\hbar\\Omega/2(S_+\\exp(i\\phi)+S_-\\exp(-i\\phi))</math>. Here, <math>S_+</math>and <math>S_-</math>are the raising and lowering operators of spin (see [[Ladder operator]]). These rotations are the universal building blocks for single-qubit gates in quantum computing.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nTo obtain the Hamiltonian for the ion-laser interaction, apply the [[Jaynes\u2013Cummings model]]. Once the Hamiltonian is found, the formula for the unitary operation performed on the qubit can be derived using the principles of quantum time evolution. Although this model utilizes the [[Rotating wave approximation]], it proves to be effective for the purposes of trapped-ion quantum computing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Two qubit entangling gates===\nBesides the controlled-NOT gate proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 1995, many equivalent, but more robust, schemes have been proposed and implemented experimentally since. Recent theoretical work by Garcia-Ripoll, Cirac, and Zoller have shown that there are no fundamental limitations to the speed of entangling gates, but gates in this impulsive regime (faster than 1 microsecond) have not yet been demonstrated experimentally. The fidelity of these implementations has been greater than 99%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garcia-Ripoll|first=J.J.|last2=Zoller|first2=P.|last3=Circac|first3=J. I.|date=October 25, 2018|title=Fast and robust two-qubit gates for scalable ion trap quantum computing|url=|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Scalable trap designs===\nQuantum computers must be capable of initializing, storing, and manipulating many qubits at once in order to solve difficult computational problems. However, as previously discussed, a finite number of qubits can be stored in each trap while still maintaining their computational abilities. It is therefore necessary to design interconnected ion traps that are capable of transferring information from one trap to another. Ions can be separated from the same interaction region to individual storage regions and brought back together without losing the quantum information stored in their internal states. Ions can also be made to turn corners at a \"T\" junction, allowing a two dimensional trap array design. Semiconductor fabrication techniques have also been employed to manufacture the new generation of traps, making the 'ion trap on a chip' a reality. An example is the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) designed by Kielpinski, Monroe, and Wineland.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal|last=Kielpinski|first=D.|last2=Monroe|first2=C.|last3=Wineland|first3=D. J.|date=June 2002|title=Architecture for a large-scale ion-trap quantum computer|journal=Nature|volume=417|issue=6890|pages=709\u2013711|doi=10.1038/nature00784|issn=0028-0836|hdl=2027.42/62880|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62880/1/nature00784.pdf}}</ref> QCCDs resemble mazes of electrodes with designated areas for storing and manipulating qubits.\n\nThe variable electric potential created by the electrodes can both trap ions in specific regions and move them through the transport channels, which negates the necessity of containing all ions in a single trap. Ions in the QCCD's memory region are isolated from any operations and therefore the information contained in their states is kept for later use. Gates, including those that entangle two ion states, are applied to qubits in the interaction region by the method already described in this article.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Decoherence in Scalable Traps ====\nWhen an ion is being transported between regions in an interconnected trap and is subjected to a nonuniform magnetic field, decoherence can occur in the form of the equation below (see [[Zeeman effect]]).<ref name=\":02\" /> This is effectively changes the relative phase of the quantum state. The up and down arrows correspond to a general superposition qubit state, in this case the ground and excited states of the ion.\n\n<math>\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle + \\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle\\longrightarrow \\exp(i\\alpha)\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle + \\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nAdditional relative phases could arise from physical movements of the trap or the presence of unintended electric fields. If the user could determine the parameter \u03b1, accounting for this decoherence would be relatively simple, as known quantum information processes exist for correcting a relative phase.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, since \u03b1 from the interaction with the magnetic field is path-dependent, the problem is highly complex. Considering the multiple ways that decoherence of a relative phase can be introduced in an ion trap, reimagining the ion state in a new basis that minimizes decoherence could be a way to eliminate the issue.\n\nOne way to combat decoherence is to represent the quantum state in a new basis called the Decoherence Free Subspace, or DFS., with basis states <math>\\left|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\right\\rangle</math> and <math>\\left|\\downarrow\\uparrow\\right\\rangle</math>. The DFS is actually the subspace of two ion states, such that if both ions acquire the same relative phase, the total quantum state in the DFS will be unaffected.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Overall analysis of DiVincenzo's criteria ===\nTrapped ion quantum computers theoretically meet all of DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing, but implementation of the system can be quite difficult. The main challenges facing trapped ion quantum computing are the initialization of the ion's motional states, and the relatively brief lifetimes of the phonon states.<ref name=\":0\"/> Decoherence also proves to be challenging to eliminate, and is caused when the qubits interact with the external environment undesirably.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== CNOT gate implementation ==\nThe [[Controlled NOT gate]] is a crucial component for quantum computing, as any quantum gate can be created by a combination of CNOT gates and single-qubit rotations.<ref name=\":12\" /> It is therefore important that a trapped-ion quantum computer can perform this operation by meeting the following three requirements.\n\nFirst, the trapped ion quantum computer must be able to perform arbitrary rotations on qubits, which are already discussed in the \"arbitrary single-qubit rotation\" section.\n\nThe next component of a CNOT gate is the controlled phase-flip gate, or the controlled-Z gate (see [[Quantum logic gate]]). In a trapped ion quantum computer, the state of the center of mass phonon functions as the control qubit, and the internal atomic spin state of the ion is the working qubit. The phase of the working qubit will therefore be flipped if the phonon qubit is in the state <math>|1\\rangle</math>.\n\nLastly, a SWAP gate must be implemented, acting on both the ion state and the phonon state.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nTwo alternate schemes to represent the CNOT gates are presented in Chuang's ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information'' and Cirac and Zoller's \"Quantum Computation with Cold_trapped Ions\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Wineland | first1 = D.

Charged particles cannot be trapped in 3D by just electrostatic forces because of [[Earnshaw's theorem]].  Instead, an electric field oscillating at [[radio frequency]] (RF) is applied, forming a potential with the shape of a saddle spinning at the RF frequency.

The same year, a key step in the controlled-NOT gate was experimentally realized at [[NIST]] Ion Storage Group, and research in quantum computing began to take off worldwide.  Many traditional ion trapping research groups have made the transition to quantum computing research, while, more recently, many other new research groups have joined the effort. An enormous amount of progress in this field has been made in the past decade and trapped ions remain a leading candidate for quantum computation.\n\n==Requirements for quantum computation==\n[[Image:Planar Ion Trap; Magnesium Ions (5884514798).jpg|thumb|Magnesium ions in a trap.]]\nThe full requirements for a functional quantum computer are not entirely known, but there are many generally accepted requirements. DiVincenzo outlined several of these criterion for quantum computing (see [[DiVincenzo's criteria]]).<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Qubits===\nAny two-level quantum system can form a qubit, and there are two ways to form a qubit using the electronic states of an ion:\n\n# Two ground state [[hyperfine]] levels (these are called \"hyperfine qubits\")\n# A ground state level and an excited level (these are called the \"optical qubits\")\n\nHyperfine qubits are extremely long-lived (decay time of the order of thousands to millions of years) and phase/frequency stable (traditionally used for atomic frequency standards).<ref name=\":12\" /> Optical qubits are also relatively long-lived (with a decay time of the order of a second), compared to the logic gate operation time (which is of the order of [[microseconds]]). The use of each type of qubit poses its own distinct challenges in the laboratory.\n\n===Initialization===\nIonic qubit states can be prepared in a specific qubit state using a process called [[optical pumping]]. In this process, a laser couples the ion to some excited states which eventually decay to one state which is not coupled to the laser. Once the ion reaches that state, it has no excited levels to couple to in the presence of that laser and, therefore, remains in that state. If the ion decays to one of the other states, the laser will continue to excite the ion until it decays to the state that does not interact with the laser. This initialization process is standard in many physics experiments and can be performed with extremely high [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity]] (>99.9%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schindler|first=Philipp|last2=Nigg|first2=Daniel|last3=Monz|first3=Thomas|last4=Barreiro|first4=Julio T.|last5=Martinez|first5=Esteban|last6=Wang|first6=Shannon X.|last7=Stephan Quint|last8=Brandl|first8=Matthias F.|last9=Nebendahl|first9=Volckmar|date=2013|title=A quantum information processor with trapped ions|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/15/i=12/a=123012|journal=New Journal of Physics|volume=15|issue=12|pages=123012|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/15/12/123012|issn=1367-2630|arxiv=1308.3096}}</ref>\n\nThe system's initial state for quantum computation can therefore be described by the ions in their hyperfine and motional ground states, resulting in an initial center of mass phonon state of <math>|0\\rangle</math>(zero phonons).<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Measurement===\nMeasuring the state of the qubit stored in an ion is quite simple.  Typically, a laser is applied to the ion that couples only one of the qubit states.  When the ion collapses into this state during the measurement process, the laser will excite it, resulting in a photon being released when the ion decays from the excited state.  After decay, the ion is continually excited by the laser and repeatedly emits photons. These photons can be collected by a [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]] (PMT) or a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera. If the ion collapses into the other qubit state, then it does not interact with the laser and no photon is emitted. By counting the number of collected photons, the state of the ion may be determined with a very high accuracy (>99.9%).\n\n===Arbitrary single qubit rotation===\nOne of the requirements of universal quantum computing is to coherently change the state of a single qubit. For example, this can transform a qubit starting out in 0 into any arbitrary superposition of 0 and 1 defined by the user. In a trapped ion system, this is often done using [[magnetic dipole transition]]s or stimulated [[Raman transitions]] for hyperfine qubits and electric quadrupole transitions for optical qubits.  The term \"rotation\" alludes to the [[Bloch sphere]] representation of a qubit pure state. Gate fidelity can be greater than 99%.\n\nThe operations <math>R_x(\\theta)</math>and <math>R_y(\\theta)</math>can be applied to individual ions by manipulating the frequency of an external electromagnetic field from and exposing the ions to the field for specific amounts of time. These controls create a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the form <math>H_I^i=\\hbar\\Omega/2(S_+\\exp(i\\phi)+S_-\\exp(-i\\phi))</math>. Here, <math>S_+</math>and <math>S_-</math>are the raising and lowering operators of spin (see [[Ladder operator]]). These rotations are the universal building blocks for single-qubit gates in quantum computing.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nTo obtain the Hamiltonian for the ion-laser interaction, apply the [[Jaynes\u2013Cummings model]]. Once the Hamiltonian is found, the formula for the unitary operation performed on the qubit can be derived using the principles of quantum time evolution. Although this model utilizes the [[Rotating wave approximation]], it proves to be effective for the purposes of trapped-ion quantum computing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Two qubit entangling gates===\nBesides the controlled-NOT gate proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 1995, many equivalent, but more robust, schemes have been proposed and implemented experimentally since. Recent theoretical work by Garcia-Ripoll, Cirac, and Zoller have shown that there are no fundamental limitations to the speed of entangling gates, but gates in this impulsive regime (faster than 1 microsecond) have not yet been demonstrated experimentally. The fidelity of these implementations has been greater than 99%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garcia-Ripoll|first=J.J.|last2=Zoller|first2=P.|last3=Circac|first3=J. I.|date=October 25, 2018|title=Fast and robust two-qubit gates for scalable ion trap quantum computing|url=|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Scalable trap designs===\nQuantum computers must be capable of initializing, storing, and manipulating many qubits at once in order to solve difficult computational problems. However, as previously discussed, a finite number of qubits can be stored in each trap while still maintaining their computational abilities. It is therefore necessary to design interconnected ion traps that are capable of transferring information from one trap to another. Ions can be separated from the same interaction region to individual storage regions and brought back together without losing the quantum information stored in their internal states. Ions can also be made to turn corners at a \"T\" junction, allowing a two dimensional trap array design. Semiconductor fabrication techniques have also been employed to manufacture the new generation of traps, making the 'ion trap on a chip' a reality. An example is the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) designed by Kielpinski, Monroe, and Wineland.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal|last=Kielpinski|first=D.|last2=Monroe|first2=C.|last3=Wineland|first3=D. J.|date=June 2002|title=Architecture for a large-scale ion-trap quantum computer|journal=Nature|volume=417|issue=6890|pages=709\u2013711|doi=10.1038/nature00784|issn=0028-0836|hdl=2027.42/62880|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62880/1/nature00784.pdf}}</ref> QCCDs resemble mazes of electrodes with designated areas for storing and manipulating qubits.\n\nThe variable electric potential created by the electrodes can both trap ions in specific regions and move them through the transport channels, which negates the necessity of containing all ions in a single trap. Ions in the QCCD's memory region are isolated from any operations and therefore the information contained in their states is kept for later use. Gates, including those that entangle two ion states, are applied to qubits in the interaction region by the method already described in this article.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Decoherence in Scalable Traps ====\nWhen an ion is being transported between regions in an interconnected trap and is subjected to a nonuniform magnetic field, decoherence can occur in the form of the equation below (see [[Zeeman effect]]).<ref name=\":02\" /> This is effectively changes the relative phase of the quantum state. The up and down arrows correspond to a general superposition qubit state, in this case the ground and excited states of the ion.\n\n<math>\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle + \\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle\\longrightarrow \\exp(i\\alpha)\\left|\\uparrow\\right\\rangle + \\left|\\downarrow\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nAdditional relative phases could arise from physical movements of the trap or the presence of unintended electric fields. If the user could determine the parameter \u03b1, accounting for this decoherence would be relatively simple, as known quantum information processes exist for correcting a relative phase.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, since \u03b1 from the interaction with the magnetic field is path-dependent, the problem is highly complex. Considering the multiple ways that decoherence of a relative phase can be introduced in an ion trap, reimagining the ion state in a new basis that minimizes decoherence could be a way to eliminate the issue.\n\nOne way to combat decoherence is to represent the quantum state in a new basis called the Decoherence Free Subspace, or DFS., with basis states <math>\\left|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\right\\rangle</math> and <math>\\left|\\downarrow\\uparrow\\right\\rangle</math>. The DFS is actually the subspace of two ion states, such that if both ions acquire the same relative phase, the total quantum state in the DFS will be unaffected.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Overall analysis of DiVincenzo's criteria ===\nTrapped ion quantum computers theoretically meet all of DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing, but implementation of the system can be quite difficult. The main challenges facing trapped ion quantum computing are the initialization of the ion's motional states, and the relatively brief lifetimes of the phonon states.<ref name=\":0\"/> Decoherence also proves to be challenging to eliminate, and is caused when the qubits interact with the external environment undesirably.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== CNOT gate implementation ==\nThe [[Controlled NOT gate]] is a crucial component for quantum computing, as any quantum gate can be created by a combination of CNOT gates and single-qubit rotations.<ref name=\":12\" /> It is therefore important that a trapped-ion quantum computer can perform this operation by meeting the following three requirements.\n\nFirst, the trapped ion quantum computer must be able to perform arbitrary rotations on qubits, which are already discussed in the \"arbitrary single-qubit rotation\" section.\n\nThe next component of a CNOT gate is the controlled phase-flip gate, or the controlled-Z gate (see [[Quantum logic gate]]). In a trapped ion quantum computer, the state of the center of mass phonon functions as the control qubit, and the internal atomic spin state of the ion is the working qubit. The phase of the working qubit will therefore be flipped if the phonon qubit is in the state <math>|1\\rangle</math>.\n\nLastly, a SWAP gate must be implemented, acting on both the ion state and the phonon state.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nTwo alternate schemes to represent the CNOT gates are presented in Chuang's ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information'' and Cirac and Zoller's \"Quantum Computation with Cold_trapped Ions\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Additional Resources==\n\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Wineland | first1 = D.

Codenamed \"Project Mars\", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]] until the release of the [[Sega Saturn]]. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own [[ROM cartridge]]s and has its own [[List of Sega 32X games|library of games]]. The add-on was distributed under the name {{nihongo foot|'''Super 32X'''|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc32{{ruby|X|\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9}}|S\u016bp\u0101 Sanj\u016bni Ekkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --> in Japan, '''Genesis 32X''' in North America, '''Mega Drive 32X''' in the [[PAL]] region, and '''Mega 32X''' in Brazil.\n\nUnveiled by [[Sega]] at June 1994's [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the [[Atari Jaguar]] and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful.  The final design contained two 32-bit [[central processing units]] and a 3D&nbsp;graphics processor.  To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party [[video game developer]]s and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on's hardware, including Genesis [[porting|ports]]. Sega produced 800,000 units of the 32X and managed to sell an estimated 665,000 by the end of 1994, selling the rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.\n\nThe 32X is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]]. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.\n\n\n==History==\nThe [[Sega Genesis]], initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]] of video game consoles.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42\u201347}}</ref> The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\"/>\n\nAlthough the earlier release of the [[Sega CD]] add-on had been commercially disappointing,<ref name=\"Retroinspection\">{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Retroinspection: Sega 32X|last=McFerran|first=Damien|issue=77|pages=44\u201349}}</ref><ref name=\"EurogamerRAF\">{{cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|title=The Rise and Fall of Sega Enterprises|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|website=Eurogamer|access-date=May 1, 2014|date=February 22, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216124431/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|archive-date=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Sega began to develop a [[Improvisation|stop-gap]] solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the [[Sega Saturn]], serving as a less expensive entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]].<ref name=\"32XIGN\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=32X Follies|website=[[IGN]]|date=October 24, 2008|access-date=May 25, 2013|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417080118/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|archive-date=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO [[Hayao Nakayama]] and broadly supported by Sega of America employees.  According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the [[64-bit]] [[Atari Jaguar]]. As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Development===\nDuring the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1994, Sega of America [[research and development]] head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar.  Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz.  One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as \"Project Jupiter\", an entirely new independent console.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the [[Sega Genesis#Sega Virtua Processor|Sega Virtua Processor]] chip.  Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite web|author=Horowitz, Ken|title=Interview: Joe Miller|publisher=Sega-16|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|date=February 7, 2013|access-date=January 10, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233248/http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|archive-date=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, \"Oh, that's just a horrible idea.  If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on.  If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great.  But if the only thing it does is double the colors....\"<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions.  One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>  This would come in the form of an add-on.  From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed \"Project Mars\", was advanced.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nAt the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit [[SuperH]]-2 processors.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\">{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\nAlthough the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/> This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=EGM Goes One-on-One with Sega's Chief - Tom Kalinske|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|pages=191}}</ref><ref name=\"Allgame32X\" /> Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it \"a coder's dream for the day\" with its twin processors and 3D capabilities.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/> Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato's team at Sega of Japan.  Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nBefore the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America.  Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously.  Their answer was to call the 32X a \"transitional device\" between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, \"[f]rankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Pre-launch promotion, release, and marketing===\n[[Image:Sega-Saturn-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Sega Saturn, released in November 1994.  The 32X was incompatible with Saturn software.]]\nThe unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago.  Promoted as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games\", 32X was marketed for its [[United States dollar|US$]]159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn.  However, Sega would not answer as to whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software.  Founder of [[The 3DO Company]], [[Trip Hawkins]], was willing to point out that it would not, stating, \"Everyone knows that 32X is a [[Band-Aid]].  It's not a 'next generation system.'  It's fairly expensive.  It's not particularly high-performance.  It's hard to program for, and it's not compatible with the Saturn.\"<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>\n\nIn August of that year, ''[[GamePro]]'' highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that \"[n]o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or [[PlayStation]] systems and games from Japan.  For the rest of us, however, 32X may well be the system of choice in '94.\"<ref name=\"GP32X\">{{cite journal|author=\"The Whizz\"|title=32X: On the Upgrade Path|journal=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|page=30|date=August 1994}}</ref>  In promotion for the new system, Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers.<ref name=\"GP32X\"/>\n\nThe 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the [[Christmas holiday season|holiday season]] that year.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up with orders for the new system.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995.<ref name=\"Allgame32X\" />  Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch.<ref name=\"32XIGN\" /> Despite Sega's initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Star Wars Arcade]]'', ''[[Virtua Racing|Virtua Racing Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Cosmic Carnage]]''.

Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, [[Nintendo 64]], and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/> The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was \"a technological dead-end\", many developers decided not to make games for the system.<ref name=\"GamesRadar+\" />  Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X.  According to Bayless, \"games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way.  Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch.  By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nJournalists were similarly concerned about Sega's tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Sega's approach to that of [[General Motors]] and segmenting the market for its consoles.<ref name=\"FinWorld\">{{cite journal|author=Morris, Kathleen|title=Nightmare in the Fun House|journal=[[Financial World]]|date=February 21, 1995|volume=32}}</ref> In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to [[San Francisco]] for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Tom Kalinske, live music with a local rapper praising the 32X, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate History of Video Games|last=Kent|first=Steven|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=495\u2013496}}</ref>\n\nThough the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared.

Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]] for doing so.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, \"The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on.  An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, \"I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn\u2019t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons.

Codenamed \"Project Mars\", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]] until the release of the [[Sega Saturn]]. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own [[ROM cartridge]]s and has its own [[List of Sega 32X games|library of games]]. The add-on was distributed under the name {{nihongo foot|'''Super 32X'''|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc32{{ruby|X|\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9}}|S\u016bp\u0101 Sanj\u016bni Ekkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --> in Japan, '''Genesis 32X''' in North America, '''Mega Drive 32X''' in the [[PAL]] region, and '''Mega 32X''' in Brazil.\n\nUnveiled by [[Sega]] at June 1994's [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the [[Atari Jaguar]] and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful.  The final design contained two 32-bit [[central processing units]] and a 3D&nbsp;graphics processor.  To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party [[video game developer]]s and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on's hardware, including Genesis [[porting|ports]]. Sega produced 800,000 units of the 32X and managed to sell an estimated 665,000 by the end of 1994, selling the rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.\n\nThe 32X is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]]. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Sega Genesis]], initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]] of video game consoles.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42\u201347}}</ref> The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.<ref name=\"RetroinspectionG\"/>\n\nAlthough the earlier release of the [[Sega CD]] add-on had been commercially disappointing,<ref name=\"Retroinspection\">{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Retroinspection: Sega 32X|last=McFerran|first=Damien|issue=77|pages=44\u201349}}</ref><ref name=\"EurogamerRAF\">{{cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|title=The Rise and Fall of Sega Enterprises|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|website=Eurogamer|access-date=May 1, 2014|date=February 22, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216124431/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|archive-date=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Sega began to develop a [[Improvisation|stop-gap]] solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the [[Sega Saturn]], serving as a less expensive entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]].<ref name=\"32XIGN\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=32X Follies|website=[[IGN]]|date=October 24, 2008|access-date=May 25, 2013|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417080118/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|archive-date=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO [[Hayao Nakayama]] and broadly supported by Sega of America employees.  According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the [[64-bit]] [[Atari Jaguar]]. As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Development===\nDuring the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1994, Sega of America [[research and development]] head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar.  Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz.  One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as \"Project Jupiter\", an entirely new independent console.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the [[Sega Genesis#Sega Virtua Processor|Sega Virtua Processor]] chip.  Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{cite web|author=Horowitz, Ken|title=Interview: Joe Miller|publisher=Sega-16|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|date=February 7, 2013|access-date=January 10, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233248/http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|archive-date=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, \"Oh, that's just a horrible idea.  If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on.  If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great.  But if the only thing it does is double the colors....\"<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions.  One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>  This would come in the form of an add-on.  From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed \"Project Mars\", was advanced.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nAt the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit [[SuperH]]-2 processors.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\">{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\nAlthough the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/> This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=EGM Goes One-on-One with Sega's Chief - Tom Kalinske|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|pages=191}}</ref><ref name=\"Allgame32X\" /> Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it \"a coder's dream for the day\" with its twin processors and 3D capabilities.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/> Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato's team at Sega of Japan.  Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nBefore the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America.  Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously.  Their answer was to call the 32X a \"transitional device\" between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, \"[f]rankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\n===Pre-launch promotion, release, and marketing===\n[[Image:Sega-Saturn-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Sega Saturn, released in November 1994.  The 32X was incompatible with Saturn software.]]\nThe unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago.  Promoted as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games\", 32X was marketed for its [[United States dollar|US$]]159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn.  However, Sega would not answer as to whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software.  Founder of [[The 3DO Company]], [[Trip Hawkins]], was willing to point out that it would not, stating, \"Everyone knows that 32X is a [[Band-Aid]].  It's not a 'next generation system.'  It's fairly expensive.  It's not particularly high-performance.  It's hard to program for, and it's not compatible with the Saturn.\"<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>\n\nIn August of that year, ''[[GamePro]]'' highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that \"[n]o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or [[PlayStation]] systems and games from Japan.  For the rest of us, however, 32X may well be the system of choice in '94.\"<ref name=\"GP32X\">{{cite journal|author=\"The Whizz\"|title=32X: On the Upgrade Path|journal=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|page=30|date=August 1994}}</ref>  In promotion for the new system, Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers.<ref name=\"GP32X\"/>\n\nThe 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the [[Christmas holiday season|holiday season]] that year.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up with orders for the new system.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995.<ref name=\"Allgame32X\" />  Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch.<ref name=\"32XIGN\" /> Despite Sega's initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Star Wars Arcade]]'', ''[[Virtua Racing|Virtua Racing Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Cosmic Carnage]]''.

Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, [[Nintendo 64]], and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/> The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was \"a technological dead-end\", many developers decided not to make games for the system.<ref name=\"GamesRadar+\" />  Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X.  According to Bayless, \"games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way.  Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch.  By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>\n\nJournalists were similarly concerned about Sega's tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Sega's approach to that of [[General Motors]] and segmenting the market for its consoles.<ref name=\"FinWorld\">{{cite journal|author=Morris, Kathleen|title=Nightmare in the Fun House|journal=[[Financial World]]|date=February 21, 1995|volume=32}}</ref> In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to [[San Francisco]] for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Tom Kalinske, live music with a local rapper praising the 32X, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate History of Video Games|last=Kent|first=Steven|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=495\u2013496}}</ref>\n\nThough the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared. Over the first three months of 1995, several of the 32X's third party publishers, including [[Capcom]] and [[Konami]], cancelled their 32X projects so that they could focus on producing games for the Saturn and PlayStation.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=32X Update|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=138}}</ref> The 32X failed to catch on with the public, and is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]].<ref name=\"Kent_493_496\"/>  By 1995, the Genesis had still not proven successful in Japan, where it was known as Mega Drive, and the Saturn was beating the PlayStation, so Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to force Sega of America to focus on the Saturn and cut support for Genesis products, executing a surprise early launch of the Saturn in the early summer of 1995.

Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/> In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: \"I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X.

According to Buchanan, \"I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one.\"<ref name=\"32XIGN\" />\n\nIn particular, the console's status as an add-on and poor timing after the announcement of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers.

According to reviewer Blake Snow, \"Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need?

Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar+\" />  Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that \"(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar+\" />  Writing for ''IGN'', Buchanan points out, \"Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this\u2014a power booster\u2014permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience.\"<ref name=\"32XIGN\" />\n\nFormer executives at Sega have mixed opinions of the 32X.  Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]] for doing so.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, \"The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on.  An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device.\"<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/>  Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, \"I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn\u2019t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons.
