Aberdare finished 9th in the [[1925-26 in English football|1925/26]] season, but a combination of circumstances, including industrial action amongst the local mining community which affected attendances and the burning down of a wooden grandstand, meant that Aberdare's poor financial situation deteriorated.

In Germany, Haribo was not an exclusive gourmet product, but a mass market candy. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Haribo's gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through areas such as drugstores, grocery stores, and discount stores. The packaging was translated into English, and package weights were adjusted to match U.S. candy price points and package sizes. A laydown bag was developed for the US supermarket trade, instead of the hanging bag commonly found in German supermarkets, and a boxed product was developed for theaters. \n\nOnce this was done and Haribo products in US-style packaging were introduced at confectionery and fancy food shows, Haribo became a popular item. Sales soared the first year, and gummy bears became so popular in the US, Haribo in Germany could not supply enough products, so the US market was soon flooded with competitors such as German [[Trolli]] and American [[Black Forest Gummy Bears|Black Forest]].\n\nOn 23 March 2017, Haribo announced they will be opening their first United States factory, a 500,000 sq ft (46,500 m\u00b2), 400 employee manufacturing plant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, scheduled to open in 2020.\nHaribo products made in the US regularly have [[corn syrup]] and artificial flavors and colors. Production with artificial ingredients is cheaper, however, and the U.S. operation is poised to profit from this lower cost.\n\n==International distribution==\n[[File:Haribo Normanton Distribution.jpg|New Haribo factory and distribution centre located in Castleford, West Yorkshire, UK.|thumb]]\nHaribo plans to expand to China and Brazil.

In Germany, Haribo was not an exclusive gourmet product, but a mass market candy. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Haribo's gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through areas such as drugstores, grocery stores, and discount stores. The packaging was translated into English, and package weights were adjusted to match U.S. candy price points and package sizes. A laydown bag was developed for the US supermarket trade, instead of the hanging bag commonly found in German supermarkets, and a boxed product was developed for theaters. \n\nOnce this was done and Haribo products in US-style packaging were introduced at confectionery and fancy food shows, Haribo became a popular item. Sales soared the first year, and gummy bears became so popular in the US, Haribo in Germany could not supply enough products, so the US market was soon flooded with competitors such as German [[Trolli]] and American [[Black Forest Gummy Bears|Black Forest]].\n\nOn 23 March 2017, Haribo announced they will be opening their first United States factory, a 500,000 sq ft (46,500 m\u00b2), 400 employee manufacturing plant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, scheduled to open in 2020.\nHaribo products made in the US regularly have [[corn syrup]] and artificial flavors and colors.

Normally, the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node) produces an electrical signal to control the heart rate.

Finally, the electrical signal travels into the [[Purkinje fibers]]. The division of the signal into a right and left bundle and then into the Purkinje fibers allows for a simultaneous depolarization and contraction of the right and left ventricles.

Common causes include [[ischemia]] (lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle) or progressive [[fibrosis]] (excessive scaring) of the heart. It is also possible that high degree block can result after cardiac surgery during which the surgeon was in close proximity to the electrical conduction system and accidentally injured it. Reversible causes of Mobitz II and third-degree heart block include untreated [[Lyme disease]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[hyperkalemia]] (high levels of potassium), and drug toxicity. Drugs that slow the conduction of the electrical signal through AV node, such as [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[digoxin]], [[Calcium channel blocker|calcium channel blockers]], and [[amiodarone]], can cause heart block if they are taken in excessive amounts, or the levels in the blood get too high.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Management ==\nManagement is dependent upon the severity, or degree, of the blockage, the consistency of symptoms, as well as the cause of the AV block.\n\nPatients with [[First-degree atrioventricular block|first-degree AV block]] do not have any resulting severe or life-threatening symptoms, such as symptomatic [[bradycardia]] or [[hypotension]], and, thus, do not require treatment.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nSimilarly, patients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz I AV block]] rarely develop life-threatening symptoms, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require treatment.

These patients often respond well to [[atropine]], but make require temporary [[transcutaneous pacing]] or [[transvenous pacing]] until they are not longer symptomatic.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPatients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz II]] and [[Third-degree atrioventricular block|third-degree heart block]] are much more likely to have symptomatic [[bradycardia]] and hemodynamic instability, such as [[hypotension]]. Additionally, there is an increased risk of patients with Mobitz II heart block developing third-degree heart block.

The division of the signal into a right and left bundle and then into the Purkinje fibers allows for a simultaneous depolarization and contraction of the right and left ventricles. The contraction of the ventricles results in the QRS complex seen on an ECG tracing.[[File:ECG Principle fast.gif|thumb|ECG tracing in relation to normal depolarization and contraction of the heart. Red tracing indicates pathway of electrical depolarization. Blue tracing indicates resulting ECG tracing.]]After contraction, the ventricles must repolarize, or reset themselves, in order to allow for a second depolarization and contraction.

Common causes include [[ischemia]] (lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle) or progressive [[fibrosis]] (excessive scaring) of the heart. It is also possible that high degree block can result after cardiac surgery during which the surgeon was in close proximity to the electrical conduction system and accidentally injured it. Reversible causes of Mobitz II and third-degree heart block include untreated [[Lyme disease]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[hyperkalemia]] (high levels of potassium), and drug toxicity. Drugs that slow the conduction of the electrical signal through AV node, such as [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[digoxin]], [[Calcium channel blocker|calcium channel blockers]], and [[amiodarone]], can cause heart block if they are taken in excessive amounts, or the levels in the blood get too high.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Management ==\nManagement is dependent upon the severity, or degree, of the blockage, the consistency of symptoms, as well as the cause of the AV block.\n\nPatients with [[First-degree atrioventricular block|first-degree AV block]] do not have any resulting severe or life-threatening symptoms, such as symptomatic [[bradycardia]] or [[hypotension]], and, thus, do not require treatment.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nSimilarly, patients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz I AV block]] rarely develop life-threatening symptoms, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require treatment. However, in some cases, patients with Mobtz I block can develop life-threatening symptoms that requires intervention. These patients often respond well to [[atropine]], but make require temporary [[transcutaneous pacing]] or [[transvenous pacing]] until they are not longer symptomatic.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPatients with [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-degree Mobitz II]] and [[Third-degree atrioventricular block|third-degree heart block]] are much more likely to have symptomatic [[bradycardia]] and hemodynamic instability, such as [[hypotension]]. Additionally, there is an increased risk of patients with Mobitz II heart block developing third-degree heart block. Therefore, these patients often require temporary pacing with [[Transcutaneous pacing|transcutaneous]] or [[transvenous pacing]] wires, and many will ultimately require a permanent implanted [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]].<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> \n\nIf the heart block is found to be caused by a reversible condition, such as Lyme disease, the underlying condition should first be treated.

\"'''Carl'''\" '''Lewis''' (born July 1, 1961) is an American former [[track and field]] athlete who won nine [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]]s, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] medals, including eight gold. His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only three Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games.\n\nLewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the [[100&nbsp;meters|100&nbsp;m]], [[200&nbsp;meters|200&nbsp;m]] and [[long jump]] events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set [[List of world records in athletics|world records]] in the 100&nbsp;m, [[4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;meters relay|4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m]] and [[4 \u00d7 200&nbsp;meters relay|4 \u00d7 200&nbsp;m relays]], while his [[World records in athletics#Indoor world records|world record]] in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke ten seconds for the 100&nbsp;meters 15 times and 20 seconds for the 200&nbsp;meters 10 times. Lewis also long jumped over 28 feet 71 times.\n\nHis accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] and \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the [[International Olympic Committee]], \"Olympian of the Century\" by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and \"Athlete of the Year\" by ''[[Track & Field News]]'' in 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n\nAfter retiring from his athletics career, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[New Jersey Senate]], but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement.

His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67&nbsp;s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00&nbsp;s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.<ref>''Track and Field News'', July 1981, vol. 34 #6, p. 12</ref> For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100&nbsp;m and the long jump.

Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by ''Track and Field News''. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100&nbsp;m ranking six times (seven if [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third.<ref name=100worldrank /> His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.<ref name=ljworldrank />\n\n===1983 and the inaugural World Championships===\nThe [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] in 1983. Lewis' chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing {{T&Fcalc2|28|0}} the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of {{T&Fcalc|8.55}} defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by {{T&Fcalc|0.26}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=1st IAAF World Championships in Athletics > Long Jump \u2013 men > Final |url=http://www.iaaf.org/results/iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics/1983/1st-iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics-3/men/long-jump/final/result |publisher=IAAF |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe also won the 100&nbsp;m with relative ease.

He risked injury in the cool conditions of the day if he over-extended himself, and his ultimate goal to win four golds might be at risk. He knew that his first jump at {{T&Fcalc|8.54}} was sufficient to win the event. He fouled on his next jump and then passed on his remaining four allotted jumps. Lewis easily won gold, and [[Gary Honey]] of Australia settled for the silver medal with a jump of {{T&Fcalc|8.24}}. The public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of Lewis's quest to surpass Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of {{T&Fcalc|8.90}}.

Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second.<ref name=100worldrank /> In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the [[Goodwill Games]] in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95&nbsp;s. At year's end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly.

This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history's second 29&nbsp;ft long-jumper was in the field: Robert Emmiyan had leaped {{T&Fcalc|8.86}} at altitude in May, just 4&nbsp;cm short of Bob Beamon's record.<ref>''Track and Field News'', July 1987, vol. 40 #7, p. 34</ref> But Emmiyan's best was an {{T&Fcalc|8.53}} leap that day, second to Lewis's {{T&Fcalc|8.67}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=2nd IAAF World Championships in Athletics > Long Jump \u2013 men > Final result |url=http://www.iaaf.org/results/iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics/1987/2nd-iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics-4/men/long-jump/final/result |publisher=IAAF |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Lewis cleared {{T&Fcalc|8.60}} four times.

He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus that had weakened him, and finally, without naming names, said \"There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don't think they are doing it without drugs.\" He added, \"I could run 9.8 or faster in the 100 if I could jump into drugs right away.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">''Track and Field News'', December 1987, vol. 40, #12, p. 28</ref> This was the start of Lewis's calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. Cynics noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, and it only became a cause for Lewis once he was actually defeated.

However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The [[IAAF]] subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100&nbsp;m World Champion.

\"'''Carl'''\" '''Lewis''' (born July 1, 1961) is an American former [[track and field]] athlete who won nine [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]]s, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] medals, including eight gold. His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only three Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games.\n\nLewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the [[100&nbsp;meters|100&nbsp;m]], [[200&nbsp;meters|200&nbsp;m]] and [[long jump]] events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set [[List of world records in athletics|world records]] in the 100&nbsp;m, [[4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;meters relay|4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m]] and [[4 \u00d7 200&nbsp;meters relay|4 \u00d7 200&nbsp;m relays]], while his [[World records in athletics#Indoor world records|world record]] in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke ten seconds for the 100&nbsp;meters 15 times and 20 seconds for the 200&nbsp;meters 10 times. Lewis also long jumped over 28 feet 71 times.\n\nHis accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] and \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the [[International Olympic Committee]], \"Olympian of the Century\" by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and \"Athlete of the Year\" by ''[[Track & Field News]]'' in 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n\nAfter retiring from his athletics career, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[New Jersey Senate]], but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement. Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services including his own.\n\n==Athletic career==\n\n===Fame as a competitive athlete===\n[[File:Carl Lewis as a University of Houston athlete.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing the long jump at the [[University of Houston]]]]\nFrederick Carlton Lewis was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927\u20131987)<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/obituaries/william-lewis-track-coach-and-father-of-olympic-star.html</ref> and [[Evelyn Lawler|Evelyn n\u00e9e Lawler Lewis]].

His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67&nbsp;s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00&nbsp;s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.<ref>''Track and Field News'', July 1981, vol. 34 #6, p. 12</ref> For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100&nbsp;m and the long jump. He won his first national titles in the 100&nbsp;m and long jump. Additionally, he won the [[James E.

During 1982, Lewis cleared {{T&Fcalc2|28|0}} five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as {{T&Fcalc|8.7}} at Indianapolis on July 24.<ref>''Track and Field News'', January 1983, vol. 35 #12, p. 45</ref> He also ran 10.00&nbsp;s in the 100&nbsp;m, the world's fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00&nbsp;s clocking the same weekend he leapt {{T&Fcalc|8.61}} twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record {{T&Fcalc|8.76}} at [[Indianapolis]], he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon's record, the third which several observers said reached {{T&Fcalc2|30|0}}. Lewis said he should have been credited with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.<ref>''Track and Field News'', August 1982, vol. 35, #6, p.28\u201329</ref>\n\nHe repeated his number one ranking in the 100&nbsp;m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200&nbsp;m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by ''Track and Field News''. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100&nbsp;m ranking six times (seven if [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third.<ref name=100worldrank /> His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.<ref name=ljworldrank />\n\n===1983 and the inaugural World Championships===\nThe [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] in 1983. Lewis' chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing {{T&Fcalc2|28|0}} the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of {{T&Fcalc|8.55}} defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by {{T&Fcalc|0.26}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=1st IAAF World Championships in Athletics > Long Jump \u2013 men > Final |url=http://www.iaaf.org/results/iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics/1983/1st-iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics-3/men/long-jump/final/result |publisher=IAAF |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHe also won the 100&nbsp;m with relative ease.

He knew that his first jump at {{T&Fcalc|8.54}} was sufficient to win the event. He fouled on his next jump and then passed on his remaining four allotted jumps. Lewis easily won gold, and [[Gary Honey]] of Australia settled for the silver medal with a jump of {{T&Fcalc|8.24}}. The public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of Lewis's quest to surpass Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of {{T&Fcalc|8.90}}.

Lewis himself would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the \"Carl bashing,\" as he put it, typified by a ''Sports Illustrated'' article before the Olympics.<ref name=NYTimes9E03>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DA123FF93AA25754C0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=3 The Runner Stumbles p3], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 19, 1992.

And for the third year in a row, he was awarded the Athlete of the Year title by ''[[Track & Field News]]''.\n\nThe [[Chicago Bulls]] drafted Lewis in the [[1984 NBA Draft]] as the 208th overall pick, although he had played neither high school nor college basketball. Lewis never played in the NBA. A poll on the NBA's website ranked Lewis second to [[Lusia Harris]], the only woman to be drafted by the NBA, as the most unusual pick in the history of the NBA Draft. Ron Weiss, the head West Coast scout of the Bulls, and Ken Passon, the assistant West Coast scout, recommended Lewis because he was the best athlete available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/jsp/TrivialPollResult.jsp?pollId=4446&team=&showResult=true&title=&useFrag=false&refresh=true |title=Poll Result Display |publisher=Nba.com |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref> Similarly, Lewis was drafted by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as a wide receiver in the 12th round of the [[1984 NFL Draft]], even though he did not play football in college.

His low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American [[Mel Lattany]] with a time of 9.96&nbsp;s shortly before the 1984 Olympics,<ref>''Track and Field News'', January/February 1986, vol. 39 #1\u20132, p. 14</ref> but his biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Johnson would beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others, while winning most of his races. Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second.<ref name=100worldrank /> In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the [[Goodwill Games]] in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95&nbsp;s. At year's end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly. Lewis ended up ranked second behind Soviet [[Robert Emmiyan]], who had the longest legal jump of the year at {{T&Fcalc|8.61}}.<ref name=ljworldrank />\n\nAt the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics]] in Rome, Lewis skipped the 200&nbsp;m to focus on his strongest event, the long jump, and made sure to take all his attempts. This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history's second 29&nbsp;ft long-jumper was in the field: Robert Emmiyan had leaped {{T&Fcalc|8.86}} at altitude in May, just 4&nbsp;cm short of Bob Beamon's record.<ref>''Track and Field News'', July 1987, vol. 40 #7, p. 34</ref> But Emmiyan's best was an {{T&Fcalc|8.53}} leap that day, second to Lewis's {{T&Fcalc|8.67}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=2nd IAAF World Championships in Athletics > Long Jump \u2013 men > Final result |url=http://www.iaaf.org/results/iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics/1987/2nd-iaaf-world-championships-in-athletics-4/men/long-jump/final/result |publisher=IAAF |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Lewis cleared {{T&Fcalc|8.60}} four times.

Lewis, second with 9.93 s, had tied the existing world record, but that was insufficient.<ref>''Track and Field News'', November 1987, vol. 40 #11, p. 9</ref>\n\nWhile Johnson basked in the glory of his achievement, Lewis started to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus that had weakened him, and finally, without naming names, said \"There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don't think they are doing it without drugs.\" He added, \"I could run 9.8 or faster in the 100 if I could jump into drugs right away.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">''Track and Field News'', December 1987, vol. 40, #12, p. 28</ref> This was the start of Lewis's calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. Cynics noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, and it only became a cause for Lewis once he was actually defeated. In response to the accusations, Johnson replied \"When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won't complain about that either\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9080-825664,00.html |title=Ambition naivety and tantalising prospect of inheriting the world |work=The Times |date=September 22, 2003 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |last=Slot |first=Owen |location=London}}</ref>\n\n===1988 Summer Olympics===\nLewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, he also lost his father.

Lewis leaped {{T&Fcalc|8.72}}, a low-altitude Olympic best, and none of his competitors could match it. The Americans swept the medals in the event for the first time in 84 years. In the 200&nbsp;m, Lewis dipped under his Olympic record from 1984, running 19.79 s, but did so in second place to [[Joe DeLoach]], who claimed the new record and Olympic gold in 19.75 s. In the final event he entered, the 4 \u00d7 100&nbsp;m relay, Lewis never made it to the track as the Americans fumbled an exchange in a heat and were disqualified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/content/results-and-medalists/gamesandsportsummary/?sport=32588&games=1988%2f1&event=32568 |title=Athletics Results \u2013 Seoul 1988 \u2013 Olympic Medals |work=olympic.org}}</ref>\n\nA subsequent honor would follow: Lewis eventually was credited with the 100&nbsp;m world record for the 9.92 s he ran in Seoul. Though Ben Johnson's 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s he ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The [[IAAF]] subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100&nbsp;m World Champion. The IAAF also declared that Lewis had also, therefore, twice tied the \"true\" world record (9.93 s) for his 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Z\u00fcrich meet where he defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records.<ref name=\"iaaf\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/15/63/20090706014834_httppostedfile_p345-688_11303.pdf |title=12th IAAF World Championships In Athletics: IAAF Statistics Handbook.

Lewis had skipped the mandatory relay training camp and demanded to run the anchor leg, which added to the debate. The final decision was to exclude Lewis from the team.

Before showing the documents to ''Sports Illustrated'', Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case \"baseless\" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-23-sp-oly23-story.html|title=Just a Dash of Drugs in Lewis, DeLoach|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 23, 2003|author=Abrahamson, Alan|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Anti-Doping Official Says U.S. Covered Up|work=The New York Times|date=April 17, 2003|page=S6}}</ref>\n\nLewis was among the named athletes. Exum's documents revealed that he had tested [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|positive]] three times at the 1988 Olympics trials for minimum amounts of [[pseudoephedrine]], [[ephedrine]], and [[phenylpropanolamine]], which were banned [[stimulant]]s. [[Bronchodilator]]s are also found in cold medication.  Due to the rules, his case could have led to disqualification from the Seoul Olympics and suspension from competition for six months. The levels of the combined stimulants registered in the separate tests were 2 [[part per million|ppm]], 4 ppm and 6 ppm.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nLewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain \"Ma huang\", the Chinese name for [[Ephedra]] (ephedrine is known to help weight loss).<ref name=\":0\"/> Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates [[Joe DeLoach]] and [[Floyd Heard]] were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Pete McEntegart|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2003/04/14/341393/scorecard|title=Scorecard|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=April 14, 2003}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/carl-lewiss-positive-test-covered-up-20030418-gdgmdt.html|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=April 18, 2003|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test.

Nickel can be in different or even mixed oxidation states, ranging from +1, +2, +3 to +4. The anions can contain a single nickel ion, or multiple to form a cluster ion. The solid mixed oxide compounds are often ceramics, but can also be metallic.  They have a variety of electrical and magnetic properties. [[Rare-earth element]]s form a range of '''perovskite nickelates''', in which the properties vary systematically as the rare-earth element changes.  Fine tuning of properties is achievable with mixtures of elements, applying stress or pressure, or varying the physical form.\n\nInorganic chemists call many compounds that contain nickel centred anions \"nickelates\".  These include the [[chloronickelate]]s, [[fluoronickelate]]s, [[tetrabromonickelate]]s, [[tetraiodonickelate]]s, [[cyanonickelate]]s, [[nitronickelate]]s and other nickel-organic acid complexes such as [[oxalatonickelate]]s.\n\n==Alkali nickelates==\nThe lithium nickelates are of interest to researchers as cathodes in [[lithium cell]]s, as these substance can hold a variable amount of lithium, with the nickel varying in oxidation state.<ref name=shino/>\n\n==Rare-earth nickelates==\nRare-earth nickelates with nickel in a +1 oxidation state have an electronic configuration to same as for [[cuprate]]s and so are of interest to [[high-temperature superconductor]] researchers.

Nickel can be in different or even mixed oxidation states, ranging from +1, +2, +3 to +4. The anions can contain a single nickel ion, or multiple to form a cluster ion. The solid mixed oxide compounds are often ceramics, but can also be metallic.  They have a variety of electrical and magnetic properties. [[Rare-earth element]]s form a range of '''perovskite nickelates''', in which the properties vary systematically as the rare-earth element changes.  Fine tuning of properties is achievable with mixtures of elements, applying stress or pressure, or varying the physical form.\n\nInorganic chemists call many compounds that contain nickel centred anions \"nickelates\".  These include the [[chloronickelate]]s, [[fluoronickelate]]s, [[tetrabromonickelate]]s, [[tetraiodonickelate]]s, [[cyanonickelate]]s, [[nitronickelate]]s and other nickel-organic acid complexes such as [[oxalatonickelate]]s.\n\n==Alkali nickelates==\nThe lithium nickelates are of interest to researchers as cathodes in [[lithium cell]]s, as these substance can hold a variable amount of lithium, with the nickel varying in oxidation state.<ref name=shino/>\n\n==Rare-earth nickelates==\nRare-earth nickelates with nickel in a +1 oxidation state have an electronic configuration to same as for [[cuprate]]s and so are of interest to [[high-temperature superconductor]] researchers. Other rare-earth nickelates can function as [[fuel cell]] catalysts. The ability to switch between an insulating and a conducting state in some of these materials is of interest in the development of new transistors, that have higher on to off current ratios.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Notman|first1=Nina|title=Edging towards silicon-free transistors|journal=Materials Today|date=December 2014|volume=17|issue=10|pages=473|doi=10.1016/j.mattod.2014.10.034}}</ref>\n\nThe rare-earth nickelates were first made by Demazeau et al. in 1971, by heating a mixture of oxides under high pressure oxygen, or potassium perchlorate.
