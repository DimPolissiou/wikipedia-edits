The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment.

since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The school has around 72 students for both its three-year acting program and two-year production program. Studio 58 operates a small theatre and presents 4 full-length productions annually as well as a smaller presentation of a student created show in a separate space. Professional directors and designers are hired to work on each production, and occasionally guest performing artists. Studio 58 productions are open to the public and reviewed by the Vancouver media.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/arts/studio-58s-production-comedy-errors-fireworks|title=Studio 58's production of The Comedy of Errors is like fireworks|date=31 January 2011|author=Colin Thomas|publisher=[[The Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in 1965 as a small [[theatre arts]] course first held on the King Edward Campus of Vancouver City College, now [[Vancouver Community College]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SzpmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H4sNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3111,4789620&dq=studio-58+vancouver&hl=en|publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|title= Intelligent restraint marks student acting|date= 12 April 1973|author=Christopher Dafoe|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref> Led under the direction of [[Antony Holland]] the course grew into a full program.

Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was in ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegr\u00eda}}, meaning \"joy\" in Spanish. [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] described the festivities for the Aztec god {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}} (whose name means \"left side of the hummingbird\"; hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}. People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.\n\nAmaranth is native to the New World and has been first found in the Old World as part of an archaeological excavation in Narhan, India, dated to 1000-800 B.C.E.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saraswat |first1=K.S. |last2=Sharma |first2=N.K. |last3=Saini |first3=D.C. |title=Plant Economy at Ancient Narhan (ca. 1300 B.C.-300/400 A.D.) in Excavations at Narhan (1984-1989), Appendix IV |date=1994 |publisher=Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Banaras Hindu University |location=Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India |pages=225\u2013337}}</ref>{{dubious|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in amaranth seeds (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America. Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are [[pseudocereal]]s because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.\n\n=== Seed ===\n[[File:D\u00eda de muertos.jpg|thumb|Skull shapes made of amaranth and honey for [[Day of the Dead]] in Mexico]]\n[[File:Dulce de amaranto..JPG|thumb|Traditional Mexican candy made with amaranth]]\nSeveral species are raised for amaranth [[pseudograin|\"grain\"]] in Asia and the Americas.

Most amaranth in American food products starts as a ground flour, blended with wheat or other flours to create cereals, crackers, cookies, bread or other baked products. Despite utilization studies showing that amaranth can be blended with other flours at levels above 50% without affecting functional properties or taste, most commercial products use amaranth only as a minor portion of their ingredients despite them being marketed as \"amaranth\" products.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.extension.iastate.edu/alternativeag/cropproduction/amaranth.html |title=Amaranth: Alternative Agriculture |last=Delate |first=Kathleen |publisher=Iowa State University|date=2013}}</ref>\n<!--original research === Seed flour ===\n\nAmaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52\u201374% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}</ref>\n -->\n\n=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===\nAmaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world.

Notes on Economic Plants. ''Economic Botany'' 57(4): 646-649</ref>\n\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called {{lang|id|bayam}}. In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India, it is called ''chaulai'' and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chili peppers to make a dish called ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed and mashed with light seasoning of salt, red chili pepper, and cumin. It is called ''keerai masial''. In ''Andhra Pradesh'', this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called {{lang|te|thotakura pappu}} in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''shravani maath'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''khada saga'', it is used to prepare ''saga bhaja'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.\n\nIn China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called {{lang|vi|rau d\u1ec1n}} and is used to make [[soup]].

It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.\n\nIn Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, often considered an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported ''A. caudatus'' cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of {{lang|pt|caruru}} or {{lang|pt|bredo}}, which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, [[rice and beans]].\n\n===Oil===\nMaking up about 5% of the total [[fatty acid]]s of amaranth, [[squalene]]<ref name=\"HeCai2002\">{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=Han-Ping|last2=Cai|first2=Yizhong|last3=Sun|first3=Mei|last4=Corke|first4=Harold|title=Extraction and Purification of Squalene from Amaranthus Grain|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=50|issue=2|year=2002|pages=368\u2013372|issn=0021-8561|doi=10.1021/jf010918p|pmid=11782209}}</ref> is extracted as a vegetable-based alternative to the more expensive [[shark oil]] for use in [[dietary supplements]] and [[cosmetics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/squalene-market-size-to-exceed-usd-240-million-by-2022-global-market-insights-inc-577232031.html |title=Squalene Market Size to Exceed USD 240 Million by 2022|publisher= Global Market Insights Inc. |date=27 April 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Dyes ===\nThe flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]].

Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was in ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegr\u00eda}}, meaning \"joy\" in Spanish. [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] described the festivities for the Aztec god {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}} (whose name means \"left side of the hummingbird\"; hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}. People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.\n\nAmaranth is native to the New World and has been first found in the Old World as part of an archaeological excavation in Narhan, India, dated to 1000-800 B.C.E.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saraswat |first1=K.S. |last2=Sharma |first2=N.K. |last3=Saini |first3=D.C. |title=Plant Economy at Ancient Narhan (ca. 1300 B.C.-300/400 A.D.) in Excavations at Narhan (1984-1989), Appendix IV |date=1994 |publisher=Department of Ancient Indian History, Cultre and Archaeology, Banaras Hindu University |location=Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India |pages=225\u2013337}}</ref>{{dubious|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in amaranth seeds (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America. Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are [[pseudocereal]]s because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.\n\n=== Seed ===\n[[File:D\u00eda de muertos.jpg|thumb|Skull shapes made of amaranth and honey for [[Day of the Dead]] in Mexico]]\n[[File:Dulce de amaranto..JPG|thumb|Traditional Mexican candy made with amaranth]]\nSeveral species are raised for amaranth [[pseudograin|\"grain\"]] in Asia and the Americas.

Most amaranth in American food products starts as a ground flour, blended with wheat or other flours to create cereals, crackers, cookies, bread or other baked products. Despite utilization studies showing that amaranth can be blended with other flours at levels above 50% without affecting functional properties or taste, most commercial products use amaranth only as a minor portion of their ingredients despite them being marketed as \"amaranth\" products.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.extension.iastate.edu/alternativeag/cropproduction/amaranth.html |title=Amaranth: Alternative Agriculture |last=Delate |first=Kathleen |publisher=Iowa State University|date=2013}}</ref>\n<!--original research === Seed flour ===\n\nAmaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52\u201374% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}</ref>\n -->\n\n=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===\nAmaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world. Four species of ''Amaranthus'' are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus blitum]], [[Amaranthus dubius]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus tricolor]]''.<ref>Costea (2003). Notes on Economic Plants. ''Economic Botany'' 57(4): 646-649</ref>\n\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called {{lang|id|bayam}}. In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India, it is called ''chaulai'' and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chili peppers to make a dish called ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed and mashed with light seasoning of salt, red chili pepper, and cumin. It is called ''keerai masial''. In ''Andhra Pradesh'', this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called {{lang|te|thotakura pappu}} in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''shravani maath'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''khada saga'', it is used to prepare ''saga bhaja'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.\n\nIn China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called {{lang|vi|rau d\u1ec1n}} and is used to make [[soup]]. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n \u0111\u1ecf}} (''Amaranthus tricolor'') and {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n c\u01a1m}} or {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n tr\u1eafng}} (''Amaranthus viridis'').\n\nA traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc=34344933 |doi= 10.17226/11763|id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&page=35 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nIn Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as ''doodo'' or ''litoto''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Goode, P.

It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.\n\nIn Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, often considered an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported ''A. caudatus'' cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of {{lang|pt|caruru}} or {{lang|pt|bredo}}, which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, [[rice and beans]].\n\n===Oil===\nMaking up about 5% of the total [[fatty acid]]s of amaranth, [[squalene]]<ref name=\"HeCai2002\">{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=Han-Ping|last2=Cai|first2=Yizhong|last3=Sun|first3=Mei|last4=Corke|first4=Harold|title=Extraction and Purification of Squalene from Amaranthus Grain|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=50|issue=2|year=2002|pages=368\u2013372|issn=0021-8561|doi=10.1021/jf010918p|pmid=11782209}}</ref> is extracted as a vegetable-based alternative to the more expensive [[shark oil]] for use in [[dietary supplements]] and [[cosmetics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/squalene-market-size-to-exceed-usd-240-million-by-2022-global-market-insights-inc-577232031.html |title=Squalene Market Size to Exceed USD 240 Million by 2022|publisher= Global Market Insights Inc. |date=27 April 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Dyes ===\nThe flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]].
