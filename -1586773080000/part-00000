It not only brings investment but also provides the necessary support through nudging for the right use and encouragement of use. In addition to the investments, the project also takes into account local/scientific knowledge/techniques to influence water availability.

Since this society consists mainly of [[small-scale farming]] families, a link is also made to the strengthening of small-scale agriculture and exemplary water management is strengthened around the schools.<ref name=\"hotspot\"/> \n\nNot only the school's hygiene and water supply are positively affected but also the surrounding community. The municipality has meetings with the partners, school and the community. For example, there is local foundationof the project and the investments. The investments are necessary and will be met with local contractors and the surrounding community. It not only brings investment but also provides the necessary support through nudging for the right use and encouragement of use. In addition to the investments, the project also takes into account local/scientific knowledge/techniques to influence water availability. The design of the latrines is the right one adapted for the [[environment]]. The project thinks about sustainability, is open to improvement and learns from mistakes.<ref name = \"jeroen\"/>\n\n== Impact on [[Sustainable Development Goals]] <ref name = \"jeroen\"/> ==\n* SDG 6: water and sanitation \n* SDG 1: no poverty\n* SDG 2: no hunger \n* SDG 3: health \n* SDG 4: education \n* SDG 13: climate \n* SDG 17: partnerships\n\n== Partnership ==\nThe partners involved have extensive experience in Ethiopia, knowledge of the proposed project activities and have been working together for several years with the local partners of [[Degua Tembien|Dogu'a Tembien]] district administration and [[Mekelle University]]. [[Ghent University]] avails its expertise and useful equipment. [[Engineers Without Borders (Belgium)]] is involved in the preparation of the technical plans and the engineer-specific support for the planned infrastructure. [[Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen]] provides support for the development of learning and communication tools. The [[Belgian Red Cross]] provides expertise in the field of [[WASH]] and sensitisation.
