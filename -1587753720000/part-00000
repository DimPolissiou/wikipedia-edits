Though the financial structure and annual revenue of Zomba during the company's independent period was only known to [[CEO]] [[Clive Calder]] (the company was registered privately offshore in the [[Dutch Antilles]]<ref name=\"White1\"/>), Zomba was widely regarded as the most successful of the [[independent record label|independent music companies]].\n\nThe group is perhaps best known for its role in developing some of the most popular forms of music, such as [[hip-hop]] in the 1980s, and the [[teen pop]]/[[boy band]] phenomenon in the late 1990s through their first record label [[Jive Records|Jive]], though they have also had substantial activities in both the Christian and gospel music field.  Calder and Simon both served as CEOs until 1990 when Calder bought out Simon's share and ran the company himself until 2002.  In 2002, BMG purchased the company and subsequently restructured the labels under the umbrella company '''Zomba Label Group''', which was the most public face of the company.  The label group served as a parent for many different labels including Jive, [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]], [[Volcano Entertainment|Volcano]] and [[LaFace Records|LaFace]].\n\nToday, the only Zomba labels that still in operation are [[So So Def Recordings]], [[Music for Nations]], [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]] and Christian focused music labels. Big part of the Zomba labels were absorbed into [[RCA Records]] and [[Epic Records]], as well [[Legacy Recordings]], Sony's division for catalogue reissues.\n\nThe company still own the \"Zomba\" and \"Jive\" trademarks as of 2018 through a Swiss company called Zomba Corporation.\n\n==History==\n\n===South African Roots: Calder, Simon and Lange===\nIn late 1971, Clive Calder and Ralph Simon began their two-decade partnership in forming businesses in record production and promotion, music publishing, artist management and concert promotion in South Africa.<ref name=\"White1\">{{cite journal |first1=Adam |last1=White |first2=Melinda|last2=Newman |date=5 May 2001 |title=The Untold Saga of the Zomba Group |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=18 |pages=1, 98\u2013100 |url= }}</ref>  Because of the market in South Africa, there was a need to branch out into various aspects of the business, instead of just focusing on one aspect of the industry.  \"You couldn't do just one thing.  It was too small,\" explained David Gresham, CEO of David Gresham Record Company.  \"This is not a country where you have a million-seller.  A No. 1 record is a 10,000 unit seller.

Although Calder has no stake in it now, it still exists as a wholly owned subsidiary of EMI, specializing in the recording, development and marketing of domestic artists.  Calder's relationship with EMI began when he had been an A&R Manager at EMI South Africa for eighteen months.  There he had signed some big groups for the time such as Freedom's Children and the Otis Waygood Blues Band.<ref name=\"whitecoetzer\"/>  During this time, Calder was also a bassist in a few bands.  He formed the Four Dukes and the In Crowd with EMI artist Peter Vee, whom he also produced.  Calder eventually paired Lee with a young producer named [[Mutt Lange]],who at the time had produced for David Gresham and David Gresham Records local hit \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\" by Jessica Jones on Gresham's Nitty Gritty Records.\n\n===Zomba in London===\nThe trio of Calder, Simon and Lange decided in 1974 that they had to get out of South Africa.  \"We were politically very much opposed to the old apartheid regime\" says Simon.  They pooled together what little money they had and moved to London.<ref name=\"knopper1\">{{cite book |title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age |last=Knopper |first=Steve |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4165-5215-4|oclc= |page= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/appetiteforselfd00knop_0/page/80 80\u2013104] |url=https://archive.org/details/appetiteforselfd00knop_0|url-access=registration |accessdate=}}</ref>  Having landed right in the middle of the British [[punk rock]] movement, they felt their experience would not be best utilized in marketing and promotion in such a different context.

The first was [[Henri Belolo]], the French producer who helped create the [[Village People]].  Zomba became the [[disco]] group's British publisher.  Though the band had been turned down by a few UK labels, Calder and Simon thought they could retain the most control of Zomba if they stayed in the publishing and management business, allowing other labels to release their artists' music.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Meanwhile, Lange was building a name for himself as a producer, with albums by the [[Boomtown Rats]], [[Graham Parker]] and eventually [[AC/DC|AC/DC's]] 1979 ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', his breakthrough album.<ref name=\"Malan1\">{{cite journal |last=Malan |first=Rian |date=25 July 2002 |title=The $3 Billion Man: Clive Calder |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |volume=901 |issue= |pages=26, 28}}</ref>  This led to Lange becoming one of the world's leading hard-rock producers, later adding [[Def Leppard]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Bryan Adams]] to his resume. For Zomba, this meant increased exposure and credibility leading to many new producer and songwriter management deals.  Additionally, artists would sign publishing deals, giving their publishing company a constantly burgeoning collection.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>\n\nIn early 1978, Zomba opened offices in [[New York City]] and began looking for more artists and songwriters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Norman |title=R&B, Rhythm and Business: The Political Economy of Black music |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Akashic Books |location=New York |pages=38\u201342 |isbn=978-1-55862-482-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYGpETIiY-YC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%22zomba+group+of+companies%22&source=bl&ots=hOvq2XUUbq&sig=O0SnFmBjMtXz9Z1xiI09hATU1IA&hl=en&ei=qPeKSvvdHIP2NYSYpcEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=%22zomba%20group%20of%20companies%22&f=falserelevant |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref> [[Clive Davis]] was one of the first to contact the group, who used his recently formed [[Arista Records]] to distribute Zomba artists.  The first major signing was [[Billy Ocean]].<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Over the next few years, Zomba's songwriters hit it big and the publishing profits kicked in, marking the beginning of the company's first major expansion into record labels. Though Davis wanted Calder to head his West Coast A&R operations, Calder had different plans altogether, and instead presented [[Jive Records]] to Davis.\n\n===Jive: taking a chance with rap===\nArista had been having trouble pushing rock acts in the US, and Clive Davis had hoped that with Zomba's Mutt Lange connection, Jive would fill that role.  However, Calder had other ideas.  In 1981, Jive began operations by releasing British dance and pop music such as [[Q-Feel]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]] and [[Tight Fit]].  By 1982, Calder was introduced to a young fresh college graduate named [[Barry Weiss]] who, for his job interview with Zomba, took Calder out to [[hip-hop]] and black clubs all over New York City.  Calder was immediately impressed with the man and had him scanning sales data all over the country searching for unknown acts on small labels selling large numbers.  Calder got one of his songwriters [[Thomas Dolby]] to create a catchy hook for a local DJ [[Mr. Magic]] to rap over.  Mr. Magic had to cancel at the last minute, but fortunately he knew another rapper, Jalil Hutchins.  Weiss's stress level shot up when Hutchins came to the session with another unknown rapper named Ecstasy and no rhymes.  After two days, the group created and recorded \"Magic's Wand\" which turned into a hit single.  Weiss named the group Houdini, but Calder changed it to [[Whodini]].  Calder flew the group to London to record an album, then to Germany to record with producer [[Conny Plank|Konrad \"Conny\" Plank]] of [[Devo]] and [[Ultravox]] fame.  While the group would eventually leave Jive after a few albums, the early success resulted in Jive becoming a label with a focus on hip-hop artists throughout the eighties.  At a time when the record establishment wouldn't touch \"ghetto\" music like rap, a white South African successfully marketed some of the edgiest black music.<ref name=\"Malan1\"/>\n\nAfter Whodini, Jive began signing other rap artists into the later half of the decade. [[Boogie Down Productions]] was signed on the strength of their first record ''[[Criminal Minded]]'', and their Jive debut ''[[By All Means Necessary]]'' was released in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p14|pure_url=yes}} |title=Boogie Down Productions - Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |date= |work=allmusic.com |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>  Young [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] rapper [[Too Short]] was picked up by Jive after his independently released ''[[Born to Mack]]'' sold over 50,000 copies.  Jive gave the album national distribution which led to gold status, and then quickly issued his follow up  ''[[Life Is...Too Short]]'' which achieved platinum status.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p92135|pure_url=yes}} |title=KRS-One - Biography |last=Bush |first=  John |date= |work=allmusic.com |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>  Meanwhile, Jive signed [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]] in 1986 and released their debut ''[[Rock the House (album)|Rock the House]]''.  The duo was a great success for Jive, helping make rap more accessible.\n\nJive continued supporting rap artists into the nineties.  Most of the aforementioned groups continued on Jive into the next decade.  [[KRS-One]], the primary force behind Boogie Down Productions, released a string of solo albums with Jive beginning with ''[[Return of the Boom Bap]]'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p92135|pure_url=yes}} |title=KRS-One - Biography |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |date= |work=allmusic.com |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>  In 1991, Jive signed R&B artist [[R.

Contrary to most other record businesses at the time, Zomba spared no time with frills.  \"The Jive offices were crummy, cardboard desks.  They just really did everything on the cheap\", says attorney Gary Stiffelman.  The company began to attract more major label attention when EMI attempted to buy the company, but was ultimately turned down.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/><ref name=\"Pederson1\"/> This period also saw Ralph Simon leaving Zomba at the start of the decade.  Through an unspecified \"ethical disagreement\", Calder and Simon ended their relationship of over two decades.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Calder bought out Simon's half of the company and subsequently gained full control of the company.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  In late 1991, BMG furthered its relationship with Zomba buy purchasing a 25% stake in their music publishing business, allowing them to sub-publish Zomba compositions in foreign markets.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  BMG continued with a 20% purchase of Zomba's records division in 1996.<ref name=\"Clark-Meads1\">{{cite journal |last=Clark-Meads |first=Jeff |date=9 November 1996 |title=BMG Entertainment Acquires Share in Zomba Group Record Division |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=45 |pages=6, 72 |url= }}</ref>\n\nBuilding on the successes of the Jive label, Zomba began expanding its reach by purchasing and creating new labels, and by creating new divisions that helped expose more people to Zomba artists and services.  In 1988, [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]] formed the UK-based '''[[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]]''' under the Zomba Group.  While Jive focused on hip hop, Silvertone focused on more rock-oriented music.  The label's roster was initially bolstered by [[The Stone Roses]], but quickly expanded to include blues, acoustic, and roots music.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  Other artists featured early on Silvertone include [[John Lee Hooker]], [[J.J. Cale]] and [[The Men They Couldn't Hang]].  This period also saw one of the few times that Zomba attempted cracking the [[classical music]] market.  In 1992, Zomba purchased UK classical music group '''Conifer Classics''' with the aide of the group's head Alison Wenham.  Though the deal seemed to be solid, Zomba sold the company to BMG in 1995.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  Classical music activities have remained minimal{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} within the company since then.  Building on existing publishing deals, Zomba briefly co-owned the UK label '''[[Sanctuary Records]]'''.  While the co-ownership only lasted between 1989 and 1991, the two companies continued dealing together in other avenues, including a publishing deal with Sanctuary artists [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"White1\"/>  In 1998, Zomba purchased a 50% stake in the troubled label '''[[Volcano Entertainment]]''' (called [[Freeworld Entertainment|Freeworld]] at the time).  The label had been under financial pressure due to various reasons, including a lawsuit from flagship artist [[Tool (band)|Tool]].  The purchase was shared with management firm Q-Prime, though shortly after they sold their half to Zomba, making Volcano a wholly owned subsidiary.  The first action was to settle the lawsuit with Tool, who would go on to become another Zomba success throughout the 2000s, representing the broad stylistic reach of artists under the Zomba Group. In December 2000, Volcano Entertainment purchased [[Capricorn Records]] from [[Phil Walden]], an independent record label launched by Walden, his brother [[Alan Walden]] and [[Frank Fenter]] in 1969. With it, the Zomba subsidiary acquired a large catalog of music as well as active bands [[311 (band)|311]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[2 Skinnee J's]] and the jam bands Galactic and [[Widespread Panic]].\n\nIn 1993, Zomba created '''Zomba! Music Services''' in order to facilitate publishing rights for those in the film and television industry.<ref name=\"Pederson1\"/>  The division would act as a channel through which clients could acquire products and services from any company within Zomba.  Songs published by Zomba Music Publishers Ltd., or released on any of the Zomba labels, or specialty recordings owned by the division itself, could be sourced for inclusion on film soundtracks, television shows or commercials.<ref name=\"White2\">{{cite journal |last=White |first=Paul |date=September 1994 |title=LOONY TUNES Danny Chang: Writing Music For Cartoons |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/sep94/dannychang.html |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=Richard |date=19 December 1998 |title=Media Exposure |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=51 |pages= |url= }}</ref>  This move gave Zomba profits by providing an accessible method of accessing the company's vast publishing catalogue.\n\nThe year 1994 saw the first of many of Zomba's successful forays into the Christian music scene with the purchase of the '''Brentwood Music Group'''.<ref name=\"White1\"/><ref name=\"Deborah1\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=15 March 1997 |title=Zomba Buys Benson Group: Plans Christian Music Umbrella Co. |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=12 |url= }}</ref>  Brentwood was an established company consisting of an extensive Christian distribution network, several labels, and one of the largest music publishing divisions in printed choral music in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Darden |first=Bob |date=19 February 1994 |title=Zomba acquires Brentwood Group |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=106 |issue=8 |pages= |url= }}</ref>  Expanding on the Brentwood purchase, Zomba purchased the Christian label group '''[[Reunion Records]]''' from BMG in October 1996.<ref name=\"White1\"/><ref name=\"Price3\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=19 October 1996 |title=Arista Nashville's Reunion Record Purchased By The Zomba Group |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=42 |pages=10, 99 |url= }}</ref>  In 1997, Zomba purchased yet another Christian music affiliated company, the '''[[Benson Records|Benson Music Group]]''', from Music Entertainment Group.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=7 June 1997 |title=Higher Ground |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=15 |pages=62 |url= }}</ref><ref name=\"Price5\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=20 January 2001 |title=Benson Is Shuttered |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=6, 74 |url= }}</ref>  Benson became Zomba's third label to focus on Christian music following Brentwood Music and Reunion Records.  An important asset of the Brentwood acquisition was the publishing arm, founded in 1902, that included 46,000 copyrights from artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Willie Nelson]].\n\nIn reaction to the surge in Christian-oriented labels gathered over so few years, Zomba created the '''[[Provident Label Group|Provident Music Group]]''' in June 1997.  The Nashville-based group was led by Jim Van Hook and was essentially a continuation of the Brentwood group and an amalgamation of the other Christian-oriented labels.  The group consisted of the Benson, Brentwood and Reunion groups, as well as the Brentwood/Benson Publishing Group and newly formed Provident Music Distribution arms.<ref name=\"Price2\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=28 June 1997 |title=Zomba Forms Christian Music Umbrella: Provident Music Group to Unite Interests in Nashville |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=109 |issue=26 |pages=6, 87 |url= }}</ref>  This new group allowed the three main sublabels to have unified resources and distribution while still retaining their unique personalities in the market.\n\nIn 1996, Zomba acquired the Windsong Holdings which gave them control of many new companies including '''[[Windsong International]]''', '''[[Pinnacle Entertainment (UK)|Pinnacle Entertainment]]''' and '''[[Music For Nations]]'''.<ref name=\"Clark-Meads2\"/>  It also gave them control of the established music company '''[[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]''' (80% of Rough Trade Records [[Germany]]/[[Switzerland]]/[[Austria]] (GSA) and 100% of Rough Trade [[Benelux]]).  Rough Trade was primarily known as a distributor, but it also ran many [[electronic dance music|electronic]] labels based in Germany.  In July 1999, Rough Trade GSA was renamed '''Zomba Records GmbH''', while the Benelux operation (which only had distribution at the time) was absorbed into '''Zomba Distribution'''.  The Rough Trade name remained as an imprint of Zomba Records GmbH, but was largely abandoned by Zomba.\n\nWith the successful integration of Rough Trade into its operations in the GSA region and Benelux and to expand on recent teen pop successes, Zomba created a London-based international label group, '''Zomba International Records Group'''.<ref name=\"McClure2\">{{cite journal |last=McClure |first=Steve |date=11 September 1999 |title=Zomba Expands Internationally |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=111 |issue=37 |pages=16 |url= }}</ref>  Directed by Stuart Watson,  the new organization allowed each new local territory to freely sign and develop acts on its own.<ref name=\"Masson2\" />  If those artists could create a strong regional profile, it would be possible to \"export\" them to Zomba International for broader exposure.<ref name=\"Pride2\">{{cite journal |last=Pride |first=Dominic |date=30 October 1999 |title=The Secret of Jive's Int'l Success |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=111 |issue=44 |pages=72 |url= }}</ref><ref name=\"Howorth1\">{{cite journal |last=Howorth |first=Adam |date=23 November 2002 |title=Zomba Takes Local Approach to International Operations |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=47 |pages=41 |url= }}</ref>  Simultaneously, it allowed Zomba artists increased international exposure.  The expansion was largely unhampered, save for some legal issues with the Australian branch.  Australian record company Festival Mushroom Group lost at least a dozen employees to Zomba in early 1999, and placed an injunction that stopped them from soliciting Mushroom employees, and accused former employee Scott Murphy of trying to bolster Zomba's presence while still working for Mushroom.<ref name=\"Eliezer1\">{{cite journal |last=Eliezer |first=Christie |date=24 April 1999 |title=Aussie Labels Clash |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=111 |issue=17 |pages=8, 79 |url= }}</ref> However, the issue was resolved fairly amicably and ended with a distribution deal with BFM Distribution (a joint venture of Festival Mushroom Group and BMG).<ref name=\"Eliezer2\">{{cite journal |last=Eliezer |first=Christie |date=24 April 1999 |title=Business as Usual Down Under: Zomba Australia Holds Course After MD Departs |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=9 |page=38 |url= }}</ref>\n\nAs the record industry began evolving due to the widespread use of the Internet, and the increasing ease with which artists can record at home, Zomba made moves that illustrated their desire to change with the times.

Pearlman had put together a new group, [[Backstreet Boys]], which was languishing on [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] without any hits.  He presented the group to Calder along with [[Dave McPherson (musician)|David McPherson]].  Though initially uninterested due to the dominance of grunge and alternative rock, Calder thought that the group could help expand his operations overseas.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Zomba bought out the boys' contract for $35,000 and moved the group over to Zomba imprint [[Jive Records|Jive]].  Calder immediately sent the group to Sweden and matched them with a group of producers recently found by Zomba scouts: [[Denniz Pop|Dag Volle]] and [[Max Martin|Martin Sandberg]].  In mid-1995, the band recorded their three songs including their first single at [[Cheiron Studios]] in [[Stockholm]]. Next Calder matched them with an old friend, Stuart Watson, who ran SWAT Enterprises, a company specializing in promotion in Asia.  The group went to Asia began touring relentlessly and released their [[Backstreet Boys (International)|first album]] which sold one million copies in three weeks.  In 1997, when Calder thought the grunge phenomenon had sufficiently passed, he took the group back over to the United States where their [[Backstreet Boys (US)|North American debut]] ended up selling upwards of 14 million copies, creating the first in a run of many hits that Zomba and the Backstreet Boys would enjoy together.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>\n\nWhile Pearlman and Watson were breaking the Backstreet Boys overseas, Jive A&R man Steve Lunt was busy in the US seeking a female star, and was greeted with 15-year-old [[Britney Spears]].

Jive initially announced that they would not renew their deal with BMG, but reconsidered following the lawsuit with BMG and Trans Continental.

In addition to the regional mergers, the Zomba and BMG publishing companies were integrated.  The US and UK offices remained as stand-alone units, but many of the back-office functions were consolidated into BMG.  The Provident Music Group, Zomba's foray into the Christian music market, was reassigned as a RCA sub-label.<ref name=\"Brandle1\"/>  By 2004, the record labels were reorganized under the Zomba Label Group.<ref name=\"revolution1\"/>\n\nIn 2004, [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment]] merged to form [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] taking Zomba with it.  Though the merger was plagued with controversy and eventually ended with Sony buying out BMG's stake in late 2008, Zomba executives continued to expand the company's operations in various aspects.  In 2007, as part of Sony BMG integration and consolidation, RCA Music Group and Zomba Label Group merged their international, sales and field staffs to form the BMG Label Group under Sony BMG.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=Chris M. |date=8 September 2007 |title=RCA, Zomba merge |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=119 |issue=36 |pages= |url= }}</ref>  RCA and Zomba kept separate groups under BMG, but this configuration was short-lived due to the dissolution of the Sony BMG merger.

Beginning with the appointment of David Mantel in 2005 as the head of Zomba Music Publishing US operations, the company began to take a different signing approach that focused on unknown or unsigned artists.

Also sometime during that period, they started a production division initially called Zomba Productions Ltd., which would become Zomba Recording Corporation.  From a legal standpoint, Zomba's [[holding company|holdings]] are divided into their music publishing business ('''Zomba Music Holdings [[Besloten Vennootschap|BV]]''') and music recording business ('''Zomba Record Holdings BV''').<ref name=\"EC report\"/>  The former holds only music publishing (i.e., written music) rights, while the latter holds all of the recorded music rights, along with some publishing groups acquired over the years.

The '''Provident Label Group''' contained other labels after its purchase in 1997, but is no longer a part of Zomba.  The '''Windsong''' purchase gave Zomba control of labels through a variety of company structures including Pinnacle and Rough Trade, however, some of these labels are no longer a part of Zomba.  These three groups are organized separately below, followed by a list of inactive or formerly owned labels from various periods.\n\nZomba's first, and flagship label is Jive, formed in 1981.  Since then, Zomba has acquired and created a variety of labels and label groups that either operate independently from, or under Jive.  During its independent period, the various record labels under Zomba all reported directly to a records division.  There was no formal public face for the  labels until BMG formed '''Zomba Label Group''' in 2004.  Though the term \"Zomba label group\" or \"Zomba Group records division\"<ref name=\"Clark-Meads1\"/><ref>For example, in Clark-Meads (reference 15.) the \"records division\" is said to comprise the Jive, Silvertone, and Verity labels along with the Pinnacle Group, but no label called Zomba.</ref> had been used previously to refer to the various labels owned by the company, it wasn't until then that an actual company was created to control the labels specifically.<ref name=\"revolution1\">{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Music on the move: BMG's Jon Davis and Clive Rich tell Philip Smith how the record company is making mobile work for its artists |publisher=Revolution UK |date=1 June 2004 |work=RevolutionMagazine.com |url=http://www.revolutionmagazine.com/news/212579/ |accessdate= }}</ref><ref name=\"ZombaAPRO1\"/>  The Zomba Recording Corporation continues to coordinate production activities on many Zomba subsidiary releases.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1987, Zomba labels were distributed by [[Arista Records|Arista]].

The end of the deal coincided with BMG purchasing a large share of RCA and a deal with BMG was signed for distribution.  BMG remained the North American distributor for Zomba until after the purchase in 2002, however, other regions had various other distributors over time.<ref name=\"EC report\"/>   [[EMI]] became an important distributor for Zomba in Europe via [[Virgin Records]], but distribution details are listed below in the Regional Branches section.

In those areas, Zomba also distributed for other, smaller independent labels.  In France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, Zomba had its own marketing and sales, however, distribution was handled by EMI (through Virgin in most cases).  In Finland and Greece, Zomba material was exclusively licensed to EMI who controlled marketing, sales and distribution.  North American distribution has almost exclusively been with BMG. Following the BMG purchase in December 2002 and subsequent integration in June 2003 and the end of contracts with EMI (also in June), all distribution has been handled by the local BMG companies.  When BMG merged with Sony, [[Sony BMG]] became Zomba's distributor from 2004 until early 2009.

Under Zomba, the Provident Label Group had this configuration:\n*'''[[Benson Records]]'''\n**'''Diadem Records'''\n*'''[[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]]'''\n**'''[[Sub\u2022Lime Records]]'''\n**'''Watershed Records'''\n*'''[[Flicker Records]]'''\n*'''[[Reunion Records]]'''\n**'''Rode Dog Records'''\n*'''[[Verity Records]]'''\n\nAfter BMG bought Zomba in 2002 and integrated the company in June 2003, the Provident Music Group was moved under the aegis of [[RCA Records|RCA]] with the exception of the Publishing division which was moved under BMG Publishing (Provident would later create its own publishing division, Essential Music Publishing, with no connection to Zomba<ref>\n{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Provident Music Group Launches Publishing Division Holly Zabka Tapped To Lead The Newly Formed 'Essential Music' |publisher=Breathe Cast |date=2 October 2008 |work=BREATHEcast.com |url=http://www.breathecast.com/Christian.Music.Artist-Provident.Music.Group.Launches.Publishing.Division.Holly.Zabka.Tapped.To.Lead.The.Newly.Formed.Essential.Music/Article-379_2555.htm |accessdate=25 September 2009 }}</ref>).

Before being absorbed into BMG's operations, Zomba Records GmbH consisted of the following regional labels, most of which focused on [[electronic dance music]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zomba.de/labels/ |title=Zomba Records - Labels |author= |work=Zomba.de |publisher=Zomba Records GmbH | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202083651/http://www.zomba.de/labels/ | archivedate=2 February 2003|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Advanced'''\n*'''Air'''\n*'''Form & Function'''\n*'''Our Choice'''\n*'''Reihe Ego'''\n*'''Rough Trade'''\n*'''World Service'''\nZomba Records GmbH was integrated into BMG's German operation along with the other regional offices.  The Rough Trade name was later reacquired by [[Geoff Travis]] and [[Jeannette Lee (Rough Trade)|Jeanette Lee]] who eventually continued it independently.  When BMG restructured Zomba in 2003, Windsong/Pinnacle was moved under [[Bertelsmann|Bertelsmann's]] [[Arvato|Arvato AG]].  Through a [[management buyout]], Windsong/Pinnacle gained its independence in early 2008, but was forced into [[Administration (law)|administration]] late in the year due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|economic crisis]].\n\n====Zomba International Records Group====\nZomba International Records Group managed the various regional branches opened as early as 1997 and as late as 2003.  The group served to solidify the operations in these regions, some of which already had small offices with activities from scouting, promoting (such as Sweden), or as much as distribution for smaller labels or operating a few regional record labels (such as Germany).  Following the BMG purchase, all of the remaining regional labels (with the exception of the main US and UK offices) and the Zomba International Records Group activities were merged with their respective local BMG offices in mid-2003.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

In 2011, the RCA/Jive Label Group was split in half. Multiple Jive Label Group artists were moved to [[Epic Records]] while others stayed with Jive as it moved under the [[RCA Music Group]]. In October 2011 Jive Records was shut down and their artists were moved to [[RCA Records]].<ref>http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-peter-edge-tom-corson-on-the-shuttering-1005394732.story</ref>\n\nFounded independently in the mid-seventies by [[Clive Calder]] and [[Ralph Simon]], the group has had interests in music release, distribution, production, publishing, equipment rental, recording studios, and artist management. Though the financial structure and annual revenue of Zomba during the company's independent period was only known to [[CEO]] [[Clive Calder]] (the company was registered privately offshore in the [[Dutch Antilles]]<ref name=\"White1\"/>), Zomba was widely regarded as the most successful of the [[independent record label|independent music companies]].\n\nThe group is perhaps best known for its role in developing some of the most popular forms of music, such as [[hip-hop]] in the 1980s, and the [[teen pop]]/[[boy band]] phenomenon in the late 1990s through their first record label [[Jive Records|Jive]], though they have also had substantial activities in both the Christian and gospel music field.  Calder and Simon both served as CEOs until 1990 when Calder bought out Simon's share and ran the company himself until 2002.  In 2002, BMG purchased the company and subsequently restructured the labels under the umbrella company '''Zomba Label Group''', which was the most public face of the company.  The label group served as a parent for many different labels including Jive, [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]], [[Volcano Entertainment|Volcano]] and [[LaFace Records|LaFace]].\n\nToday, the only Zomba labels that still in operation are [[So So Def Recordings]], [[Music for Nations]], [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]] and Christian focused music labels. Big part of the Zomba labels were absorbed into [[RCA Records]] and [[Epic Records]], as well [[Legacy Recordings]], Sony's division for catalogue reissues.\n\nThe company still own the \"Zomba\" and \"Jive\" trademarks as of 2018 through a Swiss company called Zomba Corporation.\n\n==History==\n\n===South African Roots: Calder, Simon and Lange===\nIn late 1971, Clive Calder and Ralph Simon began their two-decade partnership in forming businesses in record production and promotion, music publishing, artist management and concert promotion in South Africa.<ref name=\"White1\">{{cite journal |first1=Adam |last1=White |first2=Melinda|last2=Newman |date=5 May 2001 |title=The Untold Saga of the Zomba Group |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=18 |pages=1, 98\u2013100 |url= }}</ref>  Because of the market in South Africa, there was a need to branch out into various aspects of the business, instead of just focusing on one aspect of the industry.  \"You couldn't do just one thing.  It was too small,\" explained David Gresham, CEO of David Gresham Record Company.  \"This is not a country where you have a million-seller.  A No. 1 record is a 10,000 unit seller. That only pays the rent for a month or two.\"<ref name=\"whitecoetzer\">{{cite journal |first1=Adam |last1=White |first2=Diane|last2=Coetzer |date=5 May 2001 |title=Zomba Seed Sown in South Africa |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=18 |pages=98 |url= }}</ref>  While almost mandatory in South Africa, this early style of music company would be adapted to other markets throughout the companies history, and would become a staple of Calder's managing legacy.\n\nEarly companies formed by Calder and Simon were '''Sagittarius Management''' and '''Clive Calder Productions''' (CCP).<ref name=\"White1\"/>  CCP was distributed by EMI Records South Africa who purchased the company in 1972.  Although Calder has no stake in it now, it still exists as a wholly owned subsidiary of EMI, specializing in the recording, development and marketing of domestic artists.  Calder's relationship with EMI began when he had been an A&R Manager at EMI South Africa for eighteen months.  There he had signed some big groups for the time such as Freedom's Children and the Otis Waygood Blues Band.<ref name=\"whitecoetzer\"/>  During this time, Calder was also a bassist in a few bands.  He formed the Four Dukes and the In Crowd with EMI artist Peter Vee, whom he also produced.  Calder eventually paired Lee with a young producer named [[Mutt Lange]],who at the time had produced for David Gresham and David Gresham Records local hit \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\" by Jessica Jones on Gresham's Nitty Gritty Records.\n\n===Zomba in London===\nThe trio of Calder, Simon and Lange decided in 1974 that they had to get out of South Africa.  \"We were politically very much opposed to the old apartheid regime\" says Simon.  They pooled together what little money they had and moved to London.<ref name=\"knopper1\">{{cite book |title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age |last=Knopper |first=Steve |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4165-5215-4|oclc= |page= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/appetiteforselfd00knop_0/page/80 80\u2013104] |url=https://archive.org/details/appetiteforselfd00knop_0|url-access=registration |accessdate=}}</ref>  Having landed right in the middle of the British [[punk rock]] movement, they felt their experience would not be best utilized in marketing and promotion in such a different context.  Instead, they opted to create a publishing company and '''Zomba Corporation''' was officially registered in [[Switzerland]] in 1975, operating out of Calder's bedroom space in London.<ref name=\"White1\"/><ref name=\"woweu0506/3\">{{cite book |title=Who Owns Who: Continental Europe 2005/06 |last=|first= |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Dun & Bradstreet]] |location=[[Buckinghamshire|Bucks]] |volume=3 |isbn=}}</ref>  The name \"[[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]]\" referred to the capital of African country [[Malawi]] ([[Lilongwe]] superseded Zomba as Malawi's capital in 1974).<ref name=\"Pederson1\">{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories |last=Pederson |first=Jay |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=[[St. James Press]] |location=New York |volume=52 |isbn=978-1-55862-482-5 |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nNext, Calder and Simon began looking for songwriters.  The first was [[Henri Belolo]], the French producer who helped create the [[Village People]].  Zomba became the [[disco]] group's British publisher.  Though the band had been turned down by a few UK labels, Calder and Simon thought they could retain the most control of Zomba if they stayed in the publishing and management business, allowing other labels to release their artists' music.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Meanwhile, Lange was building a name for himself as a producer, with albums by the [[Boomtown Rats]], [[Graham Parker]] and eventually [[AC/DC|AC/DC's]] 1979 ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', his breakthrough album.<ref name=\"Malan1\">{{cite journal |last=Malan |first=Rian |date=25 July 2002 |title=The $3 Billion Man: Clive Calder |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |volume=901 |issue= |pages=26, 28}}</ref>  This led to Lange becoming one of the world's leading hard-rock producers, later adding [[Def Leppard]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Bryan Adams]] to his resume. For Zomba, this meant increased exposure and credibility leading to many new producer and songwriter management deals.  Additionally, artists would sign publishing deals, giving their publishing company a constantly burgeoning collection.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>\n\nIn early 1978, Zomba opened offices in [[New York City]] and began looking for more artists and songwriters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelley |first=Norman |title=R&B, Rhythm and Business: The Political Economy of Black music |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Akashic Books |location=New York |pages=38\u201342 |isbn=978-1-55862-482-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYGpETIiY-YC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%22zomba+group+of+companies%22&source=bl&ots=hOvq2XUUbq&sig=O0SnFmBjMtXz9Z1xiI09hATU1IA&hl=en&ei=qPeKSvvdHIP2NYSYpcEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=%22zomba%20group%20of%20companies%22&f=falserelevant |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref> [[Clive Davis]] was one of the first to contact the group, who used his recently formed [[Arista Records]] to distribute Zomba artists.  The first major signing was [[Billy Ocean]].<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Over the next few years, Zomba's songwriters hit it big and the publishing profits kicked in, marking the beginning of the company's first major expansion into record labels. Though Davis wanted Calder to head his West Coast A&R operations, Calder had different plans altogether, and instead presented [[Jive Records]] to Davis.\n\n===Jive: taking a chance with rap===\nArista had been having trouble pushing rock acts in the US, and Clive Davis had hoped that with Zomba's Mutt Lange connection, Jive would fill that role.  However, Calder had other ideas.  In 1981, Jive began operations by releasing British dance and pop music such as [[Q-Feel]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]] and [[Tight Fit]].  By 1982, Calder was introduced to a young fresh college graduate named [[Barry Weiss]] who, for his job interview with Zomba, took Calder out to [[hip-hop]] and black clubs all over New York City.  Calder was immediately impressed with the man and had him scanning sales data all over the country searching for unknown acts on small labels selling large numbers.  Calder got one of his songwriters [[Thomas Dolby]] to create a catchy hook for a local DJ [[Mr. Magic]] to rap over.  Mr. Magic had to cancel at the last minute, but fortunately he knew another rapper, Jalil Hutchins.  Weiss's stress level shot up when Hutchins came to the session with another unknown rapper named Ecstasy and no rhymes.  After two days, the group created and recorded \"Magic's Wand\" which turned into a hit single.  Weiss named the group Houdini, but Calder changed it to [[Whodini]].  Calder flew the group to London to record an album, then to Germany to record with producer [[Conny Plank|Konrad \"Conny\" Plank]] of [[Devo]] and [[Ultravox]] fame.  While the group would eventually leave Jive after a few albums, the early success resulted in Jive becoming a label with a focus on hip-hop artists throughout the eighties.  At a time when the record establishment wouldn't touch \"ghetto\" music like rap, a white South African successfully marketed some of the edgiest black music.<ref name=\"Malan1\"/>\n\nAfter Whodini, Jive began signing other rap artists into the later half of the decade. [[Boogie Down Productions]] was signed on the strength of their first record ''[[Criminal Minded]]'', and their Jive debut ''[[By All Means Necessary]]'' was released in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p14|pure_url=yes}} |title=Boogie Down Productions - Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |date= |work=allmusic.com |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>  Young [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] rapper [[Too Short]] was picked up by Jive after his independently released ''[[Born to Mack]]'' sold over 50,000 copies.  Jive gave the album national distribution which led to gold status, and then quickly issued his follow up  ''[[Life Is...Too Short]]'' which achieved platinum status.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p92135|pure_url=yes}} |title=KRS-One - Biography |last=Bush |first=  John |date= |work=allmusic.com |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>  Meanwhile, Jive signed [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]] in 1986 and released their debut ''[[Rock the House (album)|Rock the House]]''.  The duo was a great success for Jive, helping make rap more accessible.\n\nJive continued supporting rap artists into the nineties.  Most of the aforementioned groups continued on Jive into the next decade.  [[KRS-One]], the primary force behind Boogie Down Productions, released a string of solo albums with Jive beginning with ''[[Return of the Boom Bap]]'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p92135|pure_url=yes}} |title=KRS-One - Biography |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |date= |work=allmusic.com |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>  In 1991, Jive signed R&B artist [[R.

Contrary to most other record businesses at the time, Zomba spared no time with frills.  \"The Jive offices were crummy, cardboard desks.  They just really did everything on the cheap\", says attorney Gary Stiffelman.  The company began to attract more major label attention when EMI attempted to buy the company, but was ultimately turned down.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/><ref name=\"Pederson1\"/> This period also saw Ralph Simon leaving Zomba at the start of the decade.  Through an unspecified \"ethical disagreement\", Calder and Simon ended their relationship of over two decades.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Calder bought out Simon's half of the company and subsequently gained full control of the company.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  In late 1991, BMG furthered its relationship with Zomba buy purchasing a 25% stake in their music publishing business, allowing them to sub-publish Zomba compositions in foreign markets.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  BMG continued with a 20% purchase of Zomba's records division in 1996.<ref name=\"Clark-Meads1\">{{cite journal |last=Clark-Meads |first=Jeff |date=9 November 1996 |title=BMG Entertainment Acquires Share in Zomba Group Record Division |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=45 |pages=6, 72 |url= }}</ref>\n\nBuilding on the successes of the Jive label, Zomba began expanding its reach by purchasing and creating new labels, and by creating new divisions that helped expose more people to Zomba artists and services.  In 1988, [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]] formed the UK-based '''[[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]]''' under the Zomba Group.  While Jive focused on hip hop, Silvertone focused on more rock-oriented music.  The label's roster was initially bolstered by [[The Stone Roses]], but quickly expanded to include blues, acoustic, and roots music.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  Other artists featured early on Silvertone include [[John Lee Hooker]], [[J.J. Cale]] and [[The Men They Couldn't Hang]].  This period also saw one of the few times that Zomba attempted cracking the [[classical music]] market.  In 1992, Zomba purchased UK classical music group '''Conifer Classics''' with the aide of the group's head Alison Wenham.  Though the deal seemed to be solid, Zomba sold the company to BMG in 1995.<ref name=\"White1\"/>  Classical music activities have remained minimal{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} within the company since then.  Building on existing publishing deals, Zomba briefly co-owned the UK label '''[[Sanctuary Records]]'''.  While the co-ownership only lasted between 1989 and 1991, the two companies continued dealing together in other avenues, including a publishing deal with Sanctuary artists [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"White1\"/>  In 1998, Zomba purchased a 50% stake in the troubled label '''[[Volcano Entertainment]]''' (called [[Freeworld Entertainment|Freeworld]] at the time).  The label had been under financial pressure due to various reasons, including a lawsuit from flagship artist [[Tool (band)|Tool]].  The purchase was shared with management firm Q-Prime, though shortly after they sold their half to Zomba, making Volcano a wholly owned subsidiary.  The first action was to settle the lawsuit with Tool, who would go on to become another Zomba success throughout the 2000s, representing the broad stylistic reach of artists under the Zomba Group. In December 2000, Volcano Entertainment purchased [[Capricorn Records]] from [[Phil Walden]], an independent record label launched by Walden, his brother [[Alan Walden]] and [[Frank Fenter]] in 1969. With it, the Zomba subsidiary acquired a large catalog of music as well as active bands [[311 (band)|311]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[2 Skinnee J's]] and the jam bands Galactic and [[Widespread Panic]].\n\nIn 1993, Zomba created '''Zomba! Music Services''' in order to facilitate publishing rights for those in the film and television industry.<ref name=\"Pederson1\"/>  The division would act as a channel through which clients could acquire products and services from any company within Zomba.  Songs published by Zomba Music Publishers Ltd., or released on any of the Zomba labels, or specialty recordings owned by the division itself, could be sourced for inclusion on film soundtracks, television shows or commercials.<ref name=\"White2\">{{cite journal |last=White |first=Paul |date=September 1994 |title=LOONY TUNES Danny Chang: Writing Music For Cartoons |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/sep94/dannychang.html |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=Richard |date=19 December 1998 |title=Media Exposure |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=51 |pages= |url= }}</ref>  This move gave Zomba profits by providing an accessible method of accessing the company's vast publishing catalogue.\n\nThe year 1994 saw the first of many of Zomba's successful forays into the Christian music scene with the purchase of the '''Brentwood Music Group'''.<ref name=\"White1\"/><ref name=\"Deborah1\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=15 March 1997 |title=Zomba Buys Benson Group: Plans Christian Music Umbrella Co. |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=12 |url= }}</ref>  Brentwood was an established company consisting of an extensive Christian distribution network, several labels, and one of the largest music publishing divisions in printed choral music in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Darden |first=Bob |date=19 February 1994 |title=Zomba acquires Brentwood Group |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=106 |issue=8 |pages= |url= }}</ref>  Expanding on the Brentwood purchase, Zomba purchased the Christian label group '''[[Reunion Records]]''' from BMG in October 1996.<ref name=\"White1\"/><ref name=\"Price3\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=19 October 1996 |title=Arista Nashville's Reunion Record Purchased By The Zomba Group |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=42 |pages=10, 99 |url= }}</ref>  In 1997, Zomba purchased yet another Christian music affiliated company, the '''[[Benson Records|Benson Music Group]]''', from Music Entertainment Group.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=7 June 1997 |title=Higher Ground |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=15 |pages=62 |url= }}</ref><ref name=\"Price5\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=20 January 2001 |title=Benson Is Shuttered |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=6, 74 |url= }}</ref>  Benson became Zomba's third label to focus on Christian music following Brentwood Music and Reunion Records.  An important asset of the Brentwood acquisition was the publishing arm, founded in 1902, that included 46,000 copyrights from artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Willie Nelson]].\n\nIn reaction to the surge in Christian-oriented labels gathered over so few years, Zomba created the '''[[Provident Label Group|Provident Music Group]]''' in June 1997.  The Nashville-based group was led by Jim Van Hook and was essentially a continuation of the Brentwood group and an amalgamation of the other Christian-oriented labels.  The group consisted of the Benson, Brentwood and Reunion groups, as well as the Brentwood/Benson Publishing Group and newly formed Provident Music Distribution arms.<ref name=\"Price2\">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=28 June 1997 |title=Zomba Forms Christian Music Umbrella: Provident Music Group to Unite Interests in Nashville |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=109 |issue=26 |pages=6, 87 |url= }}</ref>  This new group allowed the three main sublabels to have unified resources and distribution while still retaining their unique personalities in the market.\n\nIn 1996, Zomba acquired the Windsong Holdings which gave them control of many new companies including '''[[Windsong International]]''', '''[[Pinnacle Entertainment (UK)|Pinnacle Entertainment]]''' and '''[[Music For Nations]]'''.<ref name=\"Clark-Meads2\"/>  It also gave them control of the established music company '''[[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]''' (80% of Rough Trade Records [[Germany]]/[[Switzerland]]/[[Austria]] (GSA) and 100% of Rough Trade [[Benelux]]).  Rough Trade was primarily known as a distributor, but it also ran many [[electronic dance music|electronic]] labels based in Germany.  In July 1999, Rough Trade GSA was renamed '''Zomba Records GmbH''', while the Benelux operation (which only had distribution at the time) was absorbed into '''Zomba Distribution'''.  The Rough Trade name remained as an imprint of Zomba Records GmbH, but was largely abandoned by Zomba.\n\nWith the successful integration of Rough Trade into its operations in the GSA region and Benelux and to expand on recent teen pop successes, Zomba created a London-based international label group, '''Zomba International Records Group'''.<ref name=\"McClure2\">{{cite journal |last=McClure |first=Steve |date=11 September 1999 |title=Zomba Expands Internationally |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=111 |issue=37 |pages=16 |url= }}</ref>  Directed by Stuart Watson,  the new organization allowed each new local territory to freely sign and develop acts on its own.<ref name=\"Masson2\" />  If those artists could create a strong regional profile, it would be possible to \"export\" them to Zomba International for broader exposure.<ref name=\"Pride2\">{{cite journal |last=Pride |first=Dominic |date=30 October 1999 |title=The Secret of Jive's Int'l Success |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=111 |issue=44 |pages=72 |url= }}</ref><ref name=\"Howorth1\">{{cite journal |last=Howorth |first=Adam |date=23 November 2002 |title=Zomba Takes Local Approach to International Operations |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=47 |pages=41 |url= }}</ref>  Simultaneously, it allowed Zomba artists increased international exposure.  The expansion was largely unhampered, save for some legal issues with the Australian branch.  Australian record company Festival Mushroom Group lost at least a dozen employees to Zomba in early 1999, and placed an injunction that stopped them from soliciting Mushroom employees, and accused former employee Scott Murphy of trying to bolster Zomba's presence while still working for Mushroom.<ref name=\"Eliezer1\">{{cite journal |last=Eliezer |first=Christie |date=24 April 1999 |title=Aussie Labels Clash |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=111 |issue=17 |pages=8, 79 |url= }}</ref> However, the issue was resolved fairly amicably and ended with a distribution deal with BFM Distribution (a joint venture of Festival Mushroom Group and BMG).<ref name=\"Eliezer2\">{{cite journal |last=Eliezer |first=Christie |date=24 April 1999 |title=Business as Usual Down Under: Zomba Australia Holds Course After MD Departs |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=9 |page=38 |url= }}</ref>\n\nAs the record industry began evolving due to the widespread use of the Internet, and the increasing ease with which artists can record at home, Zomba made moves that illustrated their desire to change with the times.  In 2000, they joined the growing list of record companies that made some music available via digital download with online distribution company Amplified Entertainment.<ref name=\"Gillen1\">{{cite journal |last=Gillen |first=Marilyn A. |date=26 August 2000 |title=New Media: Sites + Sounds: Zomba Joins Digital-Download Parade; EMarker Readies to Launch Device |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=112 |issue=35 |pages=70 |url= }}</ref>  In 2002, Zomba joined [[major label|majors]] EMI, Universal and BMG, with approving some of their Jive catalog for release on the new [[DataPlay]] media.

Pearlman had put together a new group, [[Backstreet Boys]], which was languishing on [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] without any hits.  He presented the group to Calder along with [[Dave McPherson (musician)|David McPherson]].  Though initially uninterested due to the dominance of grunge and alternative rock, Calder thought that the group could help expand his operations overseas.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  Zomba bought out the boys' contract for $35,000 and moved the group over to Zomba imprint [[Jive Records|Jive]].  Calder immediately sent the group to Sweden and matched them with a group of producers recently found by Zomba scouts: [[Denniz Pop|Dag Volle]] and [[Max Martin|Martin Sandberg]].  In mid-1995, the band recorded their three songs including their first single at [[Cheiron Studios]] in [[Stockholm]]. Next Calder matched them with an old friend, Stuart Watson, who ran SWAT Enterprises, a company specializing in promotion in Asia.  The group went to Asia began touring relentlessly and released their [[Backstreet Boys (International)|first album]] which sold one million copies in three weeks.  In 1997, when Calder thought the grunge phenomenon had sufficiently passed, he took the group back over to the United States where their [[Backstreet Boys (US)|North American debut]] ended up selling upwards of 14 million copies, creating the first in a run of many hits that Zomba and the Backstreet Boys would enjoy together.<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>\n\nWhile Pearlman and Watson were breaking the Backstreet Boys overseas, Jive A&R man Steve Lunt was busy in the US seeking a female star, and was greeted with 15-year-old [[Britney Spears]].  Initially horrified by Spears' karaoke [[demo (music)|demo]] of a [[Toni Braxton]] song sung in the wrong register, Lunt was intrigued by a brief moment at the end where he heard the \"kind of soul she had.\"<ref name=\"knopper1\"/>  As was the virtually the standard at Zomba, Lunt took Spears to in-house songwriter and producer Eric Foster White in the company's publishing division, and the two recorded \"[[You Got It All (The Jets song)|You Got It All]].\"  Like the Backstreet Boys, Spears was hooked up with Cheiron producer [[Max Martin]].  Within 30 days of letting a music director at [[KFMB-FM|Star 100.7]] in [[San Diego]] hear \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\", the song was number one on the charts in 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Zomba was involved in a \"boy band controversy\" when trying to sign another group that Pearlman had put together himself, [[*NSYNC]].<ref name=\"wolk1\">{{cite journal |last=Wolk |first=Josh |date=13 October 1999 |title=News Summary: 'N Court |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84723,00.html}}</ref>  *NSYNC had recently left RCA due to allegations that Pearlman had taken approximately 50% of their profits and not the one-sixth that he had agreed to.<ref name=\"manning1\">{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=Kara |date=24 November 1999 |title='N Sync Scores Small Victory As Legal Battle Begins |journal=[[MTV News]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432531/19991124/n_sync.jhtml}}</ref>  Seeing the group as a \"free-agent,\" Jive quickly signed them and prepared to release their next album.

Second, the lawsuit temporarily strained Zomba's relationship with BMG, whose distribution deal with Zomba was coming to a close.  Jive initially announced that they would not renew their deal with BMG, but reconsidered following the lawsuit with BMG and Trans Continental.  The distribution deal may have been a determining factor in the outcome of the lawsuit, since distributed Zomba product accounted for 5.5% of BMG's US market share, and company CEO Strauss Zelnick was under pressure not to lose that.<ref name=\"Newman2\"/>  They also signed a new deal with the Backstreet Boys that gave the band a 20% royalty rate.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Mark |date=11 November 1999 |title=Backstreet Boys Pave Golden Road In New Deal With Jive Record |journal=[[Live Daily]] |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Backstreet_Boys_Pave_Golden_Road_In_New_Deal_With_Jive_Records-421.html |access-date=9 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207212308/http://www.livedaily.com/news/Backstreet_Boys_Pave_Golden_Road_In_New_Deal_With_Jive_Records-421.html |archive-date=7 December 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===From BMG to Sony, and recent activities===\nBMG had owned 25% of Zomba's publishing business since 1991 and 20% of its recording business since 1996.<ref name=\"Benz1\">{{cite journal |last=Benz |first=Matthew |date=7 December 2002 |title=BMG's New Task: Maintaining Zomba's Culture, Creativity |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=49 |pages=3\u20134 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Masson |first=Gordon \t|date=22 June 2002 |title=BMG's Zomba Buy Sets Calder Free: As BMG Absorbs Mandatory Deal, Industry Ponders Zomba Co-Founder's Plans \t |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=25 |pages=1, 78 |url= }}</ref>  As part of BMG's 1996 agreement with Zomba, the music giant was required to follow through on a [[put option]] and buy the remaining shares it did not already own before 31 December 2002.<ref name=\"Spahr1\">{{cite journal |last=Spahr |first=Wolfgang |date=10 August 2002 |title=Bertelsmann Chief Aims to Rein in Debt |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=32 |pages=1, 68 |url= }}</ref><ref name=\"harding1\">{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=James |date=26 September 2002 |title=Zomba's price hits sour note |journal=[[Financial Times|Financial Times World Media Abstracts]] |volume= |issue= |pages=1 |url= }}</ref>  In June 2002, Clive Calder decided to exercise the put option.<ref name=\"Waters1\">{{cite journal |last=Waters |first=Richard |date=12 June 2002 |title=The Price of Britney |journal=[[Financial Times]] |volume= |issue= |pages=1 |url= }}</ref>  Effective 26 November 2002, BMG Entertainment concluded its deal with Zomba for the purchase of the company's entire assets.<ref>{{cite book |title=Structuring Mergers & Acquisitions: A Guide to Creating Shareholder Value |last=Hunt|first=Peter A. |authorlink= |year=2004 |edition=2 |publisher=[[Aspen]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |volume= |isbn= |page=287}}</ref>  While Calder had originally requested $3.2 billion for his shares in Zomba, valuation of the label's assets varied from $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion.<ref name=\"harding1\"/>  Following the purchase negotiations, a price of $2.74 billion was agreed upon, the biggest purchase of an independent at the time.  Zomba's sale had been the latest in a series of independent label sellouts including Island Records and Geffen Records (both sold to [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] for $300 million and $550 million respectively), and Virgin (sold for $950 million to [[EMI]]).  The $2.74 billion paid for the Zomba Group was more than was paid for the purchase of many others labels including Island, Geffen, Virgin, A&M, Motown, Chrysalis, and Def Jam, combined.\n\nInitially, BMG took its time in integrating Zomba with the rest of its labels, hoping that the former independent would lift BMGs worldwide rank from fifth to fourth-largest record company.<ref>{{cite journal |last=LeGrand |first=Emmanuel |date=14 December 2002 |title=BMG Begins Zomba's Integration Process |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=50 |pages=6 |url= }}</ref>  Calder resigned his position as CEO immediately after the purchase, but stayed on in an advisory position for about another year.<ref name=\"Benz1\"/>  In mid-2003, BMG began its worldwide integration of Zomba cutting hundreds of jobs through the consolidation of regional operations.<ref name=\"Brandle1\">{{cite journal |last=Brandle |first=Lars |date=5 April 2003 |title=BMG 2002 Profits Up; Zomba Cuts Begin |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=115 |issue=14 |pages=7 |url= }}</ref>  While many of the key managers stayed, and the large offices in the US and the UK remained operational, all of the other regional offices were assimilated into BMG.  In addition to the regional mergers, the Zomba and BMG publishing companies were integrated.  The US and UK offices remained as stand-alone units, but many of the back-office functions were consolidated into BMG.  The Provident Music Group, Zomba's foray into the Christian music market, was reassigned as a RCA sub-label.<ref name=\"Brandle1\"/>  By 2004, the record labels were reorganized under the Zomba Label Group.<ref name=\"revolution1\"/>\n\nIn 2004, [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment]] merged to form [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] taking Zomba with it.  Though the merger was plagued with controversy and eventually ended with Sony buying out BMG's stake in late 2008, Zomba executives continued to expand the company's operations in various aspects.  In 2007, as part of Sony BMG integration and consolidation, RCA Music Group and Zomba Label Group merged their international, sales and field staffs to form the BMG Label Group under Sony BMG.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=Chris M. |date=8 September 2007 |title=RCA, Zomba merge |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=119 |issue=36 |pages= |url= }}</ref>  RCA and Zomba kept separate groups under BMG, but this configuration was short-lived due to the dissolution of the Sony BMG merger.  Zomba is currently owned wholly by, and operates under Sony.\n\nOn 2 November 2004 the [[American Federation of Musicians]] announced that it had entered into an agreement with Zomba.  Effective 1 January 2005, the labor union covered all artists on any Zomba subsidiary labels (and any future labels) under the Federation's Sound Recording Labor Agreement.<ref name=\"making strides\"/>  The deal ensured that all artists under the Zomba aegis would receive, for the first time, a full range of benefits and protections, among which are scale payments, industry standard working conditions and pension contributions.\n\nIn 2005, Zomba formed '''Zomba Gospel''' under the Zomba Label Group in an effort to collate its recently expanding gospel labels. Zomba's interest in gospel began in the form of a distribution deal with [[GospoCentric Records]] (and sublabel B'Rite Music) in October 2001, which Zomba later purchased in 2004.<ref name=\"Collins1\">{{cite journal |last=Collins |first=Lisa |date=20 October 2001 |title=Gospo, B'rite Pact with Zomba |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=113 |issue=42 |pages=33 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=12 October 2004 |title=Zomba Buys GospoCentric  |journal=Billboard.biz |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4371548-1.html }}</ref>  Verity Records president Max Siegel was charged with heading the new entity which included Zomba labels Verity and GospoCentric, as well as four artist owned imprints: Quiet Water Entertainment ([[Donald Lawrence]]), Fo Yo Soul Entertainment ([[Kirk Franklin]]), New Life Records ([[John P.

Beginning with the appointment of David Mantel in 2005 as the head of Zomba Music Publishing US operations, the company began to take a different signing approach that focused on unknown or unsigned artists.  Mantel's first signing was [[T-Pain]], whose two singles \"I'm Sprung\" and \"I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)\" hit number 8 and 5 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=\"Butler1\">{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=Susan |date=8 July 2006 |title=Zomba's Development Plan: Talent Focus Is on Up-and-Coming, Unaffiliated Artists |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=118 |issue=27 |pages=20 |url= }}</ref>  This type of signing was also used in the records division were artists or producers were given their own imprint.

They expanded to the US, first with a publishing sector in 1978, then a records division in 1981 while the management and publishing divisions became separate companies.  Also sometime during that period, they started a production division initially called Zomba Productions Ltd., which would become Zomba Recording Corporation.  From a legal standpoint, Zomba's [[holding company|holdings]] are divided into their music publishing business ('''Zomba Music Holdings [[Besloten Vennootschap|BV]]''') and music recording business ('''Zomba Record Holdings BV''').<ref name=\"EC report\"/>  The former holds only music publishing (i.e., written music) rights, while the latter holds all of the recorded music rights, along with some publishing groups acquired over the years.

The '''Provident Label Group''' contained other labels after its purchase in 1997, but is no longer a part of Zomba.  The '''Windsong''' purchase gave Zomba control of labels through a variety of company structures including Pinnacle and Rough Trade, however, some of these labels are no longer a part of Zomba.  These three groups are organized separately below, followed by a list of inactive or formerly owned labels from various periods.\n\nZomba's first, and flagship label is Jive, formed in 1981.  Since then, Zomba has acquired and created a variety of labels and label groups that either operate independently from, or under Jive.  During its independent period, the various record labels under Zomba all reported directly to a records division.  There was no formal public face for the  labels until BMG formed '''Zomba Label Group''' in 2004.  Though the term \"Zomba label group\" or \"Zomba Group records division\"<ref name=\"Clark-Meads1\"/><ref>For example, in Clark-Meads (reference 15.) the \"records division\" is said to comprise the Jive, Silvertone, and Verity labels along with the Pinnacle Group, but no label called Zomba.</ref> had been used previously to refer to the various labels owned by the company, it wasn't until then that an actual company was created to control the labels specifically.<ref name=\"revolution1\">{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Music on the move: BMG's Jon Davis and Clive Rich tell Philip Smith how the record company is making mobile work for its artists |publisher=Revolution UK |date=1 June 2004 |work=RevolutionMagazine.com |url=http://www.revolutionmagazine.com/news/212579/ |accessdate= }}</ref><ref name=\"ZombaAPRO1\"/>  The Zomba Recording Corporation continues to coordinate production activities on many Zomba subsidiary releases.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1987, Zomba labels were distributed by [[Arista Records|Arista]].

The end of the deal coincided with BMG purchasing a large share of RCA and a deal with BMG was signed for distribution.  BMG remained the North American distributor for Zomba until after the purchase in 2002, however, other regions had various other distributors over time.<ref name=\"EC report\"/>   [[EMI]] became an important distributor for Zomba in Europe via [[Virgin Records]], but distribution details are listed below in the Regional Branches section.

In those areas, Zomba also distributed for other, smaller independent labels.  In France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, Zomba had its own marketing and sales, however, distribution was handled by EMI (through Virgin in most cases).  In Finland and Greece, Zomba material was exclusively licensed to EMI who controlled marketing, sales and distribution.  North American distribution has almost exclusively been with BMG. Following the BMG purchase in December 2002 and subsequent integration in June 2003 and the end of contracts with EMI (also in June), all distribution has been handled by the local BMG companies.  When BMG merged with Sony, [[Sony BMG]] became Zomba's distributor from 2004 until early 2009.

Zomba had purchased Brentwood Music Group in February 1994 and founder Jim Van Cook was charged with leading the new music group.  The group consisted of three sections: '''Provident Label Group''', '''Provident-Integrity Distribution''' and the '''Brentwood/Benson Publishing Group'''.\n\nAs part of the music group, Zomba amalgamated their Christian labels under the Provident Label Group.  The new group initially consisted of Brentwood Records, Benson Records and Reunion Records, though Brentwood was shut down in 2001.  Since then, other labels have been added.  Under Zomba, the Provident Label Group had this configuration:\n*'''[[Benson Records]]'''\n**'''Diadem Records'''\n*'''[[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]]'''\n**'''[[Sub\u2022Lime Records]]'''\n**'''Watershed Records'''\n*'''[[Flicker Records]]'''\n*'''[[Reunion Records]]'''\n**'''Rode Dog Records'''\n*'''[[Verity Records]]'''\n\nAfter BMG bought Zomba in 2002 and integrated the company in June 2003, the Provident Music Group was moved under the aegis of [[RCA Records|RCA]] with the exception of the Publishing division which was moved under BMG Publishing (Provident would later create its own publishing division, Essential Music Publishing, with no connection to Zomba<ref>\n{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Provident Music Group Launches Publishing Division Holly Zabka Tapped To Lead The Newly Formed 'Essential Music' |publisher=Breathe Cast |date=2 October 2008 |work=BREATHEcast.com |url=http://www.breathecast.com/Christian.Music.Artist-Provident.Music.Group.Launches.Publishing.Division.Holly.Zabka.Tapped.To.Lead.The.Newly.Formed.Essential.Music/Article-379_2555.htm |accessdate=25 September 2009 }}</ref>).

The Rough Trade name only remained as an imprint of Zomba Records GmbH.  Before being absorbed into BMG's operations, Zomba Records GmbH consisted of the following regional labels, most of which focused on [[electronic dance music]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zomba.de/labels/ |title=Zomba Records - Labels |author= |work=Zomba.de |publisher=Zomba Records GmbH | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202083651/http://www.zomba.de/labels/ | archivedate=2 February 2003|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Advanced'''\n*'''Air'''\n*'''Form & Function'''\n*'''Our Choice'''\n*'''Reihe Ego'''\n*'''Rough Trade'''\n*'''World Service'''\nZomba Records GmbH was integrated into BMG's German operation along with the other regional offices.  The Rough Trade name was later reacquired by [[Geoff Travis]] and [[Jeannette Lee (Rough Trade)|Jeanette Lee]] who eventually continued it independently.  When BMG restructured Zomba in 2003, Windsong/Pinnacle was moved under [[Bertelsmann|Bertelsmann's]] [[Arvato|Arvato AG]].  Through a [[management buyout]], Windsong/Pinnacle gained its independence in early 2008, but was forced into [[Administration (law)|administration]] late in the year due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|economic crisis]].\n\n====Zomba International Records Group====\nZomba International Records Group managed the various regional branches opened as early as 1997 and as late as 2003.  The group served to solidify the operations in these regions, some of which already had small offices with activities from scouting, promoting (such as Sweden), or as much as distribution for smaller labels or operating a few regional record labels (such as Germany).  Following the BMG purchase, all of the remaining regional labels (with the exception of the main US and UK offices) and the Zomba International Records Group activities were merged with their respective local BMG offices in mid-2003.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

In [[Hawaii]], native Hawaiians are publicly educated by the Hawai\u02bbi State [[Department of Education]], an ethnically diverse school system that is the United States' largest and most centralized.\n\nUnder the administration of Governor [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]] from 1994 to 2002, the state's educational system established special Hawaiian language immersion schools. In these schools, all subject courses are taught in the Hawaiian language and use native Hawaiian subject matter in curricula.

The largest and wealthiest [[private school]] in the United States, Kamehameha Schools was intended to benefit indigents and orphans, with preference given to native Hawaiians. The Kamehameha Schools provides a quality education to thousands of children of entire and part native Hawaiian ancestry at its campuses during the regular school year, and also has quality summer and off-campus programs that are not restricted by ancestry. Kamehameha Schools' practice of accepting primarily gifted students, in lieu of intellectually challenged children, has been a controversial topic amongst the native Hawaiian community. Many 'rejected' families feel that the gifted students could excel at any learning institution, public or private. Thus, the Hawaiian community may be better served by educating children from high-risk, high-crime districts so that a greater proportion of disadvantaged youths may grow up to be responsible community contributors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAs with other children in Hawai\u02bbi, some native Hawaiians are educated by other prominent private academies in the Aloha State.

The phrase \u201c''E ho\u02bbohuli ka lima i lalo''\u201d (The palms of the hands should be turned down) was used to communicate the idea that idleness (associated with upturned palms) was to be avoided.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Collaborative and flexible ensembles'''\n\nNative Hawaiian children [[Cooperation|cooperate]] with flexible leadership to combine their skills, ideas, and abilities, like that found in [[observational learning]] in the indigenous communities of the Americas. Family organization is a \u201cshared-function\u201d system that includes flexible roles and fluid responsibility within the group. Basic family values include interdependence, responsibility for others, sharing of work and resources, obedience, and respect. Children assume important family responsibilities early and act as members of a sibling workforce that is held collectively responsible for completing tasks.<ref name=\":4\">G. Tharp, Cathie Jordan, Gisela E. Speidel, Kathryn Hu-pei Au, Thomas W. Klein, Roderick P. Calkins, Kim C. M. Sloat, Ronald Gallimore (2007). Education and Native Hawaiian Children: Revisiting KEEP.

Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found to take the initiative to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, homework, and caring for younger siblings.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Learning to transform participation'''\n\nAmong Native Hawaiians, the goal of learning is to transform [[Youth participation|participation]] to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community,<ref name=\":0\" /> like that found in [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]]. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed in case of a tragic incident with the parents.<ref>Cicirelli, V. (1994). Sibling Relationships in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Journal of Marriage and Family,56(1), 7-20. {{doi|10.2307/352697}}\n</ref> Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go off on their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.\n\n[[Fosterage|Assuming and initiating care]] has been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy [[Aloha|(''aloha'']]).<ref name=\":6\">Donner, W. W. (1999). Sharing and Compassion: Fosterage in a Polynesian Society. Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 30(4), autumn, 703-722. Retrieved May 25, 2017.</ref> As children mature within the family, they go through a process of having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n'''Wide and keen attention for contribution'''\n\nThe Hawaiians\u2019 ways of learning include wide keen attention from the children while adults are available for guidance, also found in the model of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because the children [[Observational learning|learn through observation]], and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother's frequent use of non-verbal communication.<ref>Speidel, G. E., Farran, D. C., & Jordan, C. (1989). 6: On the Learning and Thinking Styles of Hawaiian Children. In Thinking Across Cultures (pp. 55-77). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref>\n\n'''Coordination through shared reference'''\n\nIn some Native Hawaiian communities, there is a constant use of [[Storytelling|\u201ctalk story\u201d]] which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble.<ref>Smith-Hefner, N. J. (1987), Speaking Relating and Learning: A Study of Hawaiian Children at Home and at School: Stephen T. Boggs. TESOL Quarterly, 21: 759\u2013763. {{doi|10.2307/3586993}}</ref> Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.\n\nAnother example of verbal communication in the Native Hawaiian culture is through the use of [[chant]]ing, which can allow a child to understand the relationship of their present experiences to those of their ancestors, both alive and deceased. Chanting also allows children to understand the connections of their chants to mother earth. For instance, chanting can voice the need for rain to produce plants and induce ponds to grow fish for harvest.<ref name=\":5\">Meyer, Manu Aluli (1998) Native Hawaiian Epistemology: Sites of Empowerment and Resistance, Equity & Excellence in Education, 31:1, 22-28, {{DOI|10.1080/1066568980310104}}</ref>\n\nA study comparing Midwestern and Hawaiian mother \u2013 Kindergartener pairs presented with a novel task,<ref name=\":4\" /> found Hawaiian mothers to be much lower than their Midwestern counterparts in the use of verbal-control techniques and much higher in non-verbal communication, a finding which implies coordination through [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] and verbal means.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Aspects of togetherness, continuity, purpose, and significance are a part of learning and coincide with the Native Hawaiian's spiritual connection to earth and environment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n'''Feedback that appraises mastery and support for learning'''\n\nThere is verbal and nonverbal guidance from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a pat on the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way.<ref name=\":2\" /> This example relates to the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]] model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.\n\nIn the context of producing objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product before moving on to learn the skills of producing something else. Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback. The perfected final products were kept as a special reminder and never used. Their production was seen as a necessary first step in \u201cclearing the way\u201d for other products to come; an indication of mastery for that skill set.<ref name=\":1\" /> Throughout several research articles, it becomes clear that many of the Native Hawaiian ways of learning resemble the defining characteristics of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]], which is common in many Indigenous communities of the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Hawaiian cultural revival==\n\n{{see also|Culture of the Native Hawaiians|Hawaii#Culture}}\n\nNative Hawaiian culture has seen a revival in recent years as an outgrowth of decisions made at the [[1978 Hawai\u02bbi State Constitutional Convention]], held 200 years after the arrival of Captain Cook. At the convention, the Hawai\u02bbi state government committed itself to a progressive study and preservation of native Hawaiian culture, history, and language.\n\nA comprehensive Hawaiian culture curriculum was introduced into the State of Hawai\u02bbi's public elementary schools teaching: ancient Hawaiian art, lifestyle, geography, [[hula]], and Hawaiian language vocabulary. Intermediate and high schools were mandated to impose two sets of Hawaiian history curricula on every candidate for graduation.\n\nStatutes and charter amendments were passed acknowledging a policy of preference for Hawaiian place and street names. For example, with the closure of [[Barbers Point Naval Air Station]] in the 1990s, the region formerly occupied by the base was renamed [[Kalaeloa]].\n\n==Office of Hawaiian Affairs==\n{{main|Office of Hawaiian Affairs}}\nAnother important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawai\u02bbi State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawai\u02bbi political stars [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]], [[John D. Waihee III]], and [[Jeremy Harris (politician)|Jeremy Harris]] enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park).<ref name=\"OHA Waimia Valley press release\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |title=OHA gains Waimea Valley title |first=Manu |last=Boyd |date=July 3, 2006 |publisher=[[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927173615/http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |url-status= |accessdate=May 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBesides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawai\u02bbi, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the [[Territory of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawai\u02bbi as public lands in 1959.\n\nOHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawai\u02bbi through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. [[Rice v. Cayetano]]\u2014suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections\u2014reached the [[United States Supreme Court]], which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawai\u02bbi, regardless of ethnicity.\n\n==Federal developments==\n\n===Native American Programs Act===\nIn 1974, the Native American Programs Act was amended to include native Hawaiians. This paved the way for native Hawaiians to become eligible for some, but not all, federal assistance programs originally intended for [[Native Americans in the United States|Continental Native Americans]]. Today, Title 45 CFR Part 1336.62 defines a Native Hawaiian as \"an individual any of whose ancestors were natives of the area which consists of the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778\".\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether or not native Hawaiians should be considered in the same light as Native Americans.<ref name=\"Indian Country Today\">{{cite journal |author=Editors Report |date=August 13, 2001 |title=Native Hawaiian recognition is overdue |journal=[[Indian Country Today]] |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network |id={{oclc|61312545|43291273}} |issn=0744-2238 |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2001/08/13/native-hawaiian-recognition-is-overdue-84826 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025002449/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=73 |archivedate=October 25, 2006 |url-status=live |quote=Native Hawaiians have rightfully demanded recognition of their aboriginal standing by the United States.}}</ref><ref name=conklin>{{cite web|url=http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|title=Are kanaka maoli indigenous to Hawai'i?|work=kenconklin.org|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082145/http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|archivedate=May 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===United States apology resolution===\nOn November 23, 1993, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed United States Public Law 103\u2013150, also known as the [[Apology Resolution]], which had previously passed Congress.

The significance of the bill is that it would establish, for the first time in the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThis bill came under scrutiny by the Bush administration's Department of Justice, as well as the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. The political context surrounding the Akaka Bill is both controversial and complex. Proponents, who consider the legislation an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices, include Hawai\u02bbi's Congressional delegation, as well as the former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor, [[Linda Lingle]]. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|Hawaiian sovereignty activists]], (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nA Ward Research poll commissioned in 2003 by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reported that \"Eighty-six percent of the 303 Hawaiian residents polled by Ward Research said 'yes.'

The inaugural director of Ka Huli Ao is Honolulu attorney [http://www.law.hawaii.edu/personnel/mackenzie/melody Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie]. MacKenzie is also recognized as the chief editor of the Native Hawaiian Rights Handbook, which is a legal publication that describes Native Hawaiian law, a subset of laws of the State of Hawai\u02bbi. MacKenzie worked as a clerk to the school of law\u02bbs namesake, William S. Richardson, for four years, and also served as the Executive Director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation for four years, then worked as a senior staff attorney for another six years.\n\nKa Huli Ao focuses on research, scholarship, and community outreach. Ka Huli Ao provides a monthly lunch-time discussion forum referred to as ''Maoli Thursday'', which is free and open to the public. Ka Huli Ao maintains its own [http://uhm-nativehawaiianlaw.blogspot.com/ blog], as well as a Twitter account and a Facebook group. Ka Huli Ao also provides law students with summer fellowships. Law school graduates are eligible to apply for post-J.D. fellowships that last for one year.\n\n==Notable Native Hawaiians==\n{{main|List of Native Hawaiians}}\n\nIn 1873 the first native Hawaiians were given permission from [[King Lunalilo]] (prior emigration of native Hawaiians was not allowed) to permanently emigrate to the United States (Salt Lake City, Utah) whose names were Kiha Kaawa, and Kahana Pukahi. Kiha was adopted by Mormon Missionary President George Nebeker immediately upon arrival making Kiha Kaawa (Nebeker) the first native Hawaiian to become a US citizen in 1873.\n\n==Culture and arts==\n{{main|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}\n[[File:Native Hawaiian man pounding taro into poi with two children by his sides., c. 1890s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Hawaiian man with his two children, circa 1890.]]\nSeveral cultural preservation societies and organizations have been established over the course of the twentieth century. The largest of those institutions is the Bernice Pauahi [[Bishop Museum]], established in 1889 and designated as the Hawai\u02bbi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History. Bishop Museum houses the largest collection of native Hawaiian artifacts, documents, and other information available for educational use. Most objects are held for preservation alone. The museum has links with major colleges and universities throughout the world to facilitate research.\n\nWith the support of the Bishop Museum, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s double-hulled canoe, ''[[Hokulea|H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a]]'', has contributed to rediscovery of native Hawaiian culture, especially in the revival of non-instrument navigation, by which ancient Polynesians originally settled Hawai\u02bbi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|title=Hawaiian Cultural Heritage|last=Unattributed|date=July 25, 2007|work=Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument|publisher=United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|language=en-US, haw|accessdate=September 6, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916044123/http://www.hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|archivedate=September 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}} Discusses ''H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a's'' ''[[Hokulea#2003 - 2004 Navigating Change project|Navigating Change]]'' voyage which also raised consciousness of the interdependence of Hawaiians, their environment, and their culture.</ref>\n \nOne of the most commonly known arts of Hawaii is [[hula]] dancing. Now in  days in 21st century many people recognize the hula dance in two different categories which are Hula Kahiko and Hula Auana.\n\nHula Kahiko which is an \u201cold\u201d style of the hula dancing  which  is an interpretive dance, famous for its grace and romantic feel, that expresses stories and feeling from almost any phase of life & culture of Hawaiians. While dancing they also use percussion instruments and traditional chanting. Hawaiians make their own traditional instruments to use while the dancers are dancing which are: PAHU HULA, KILU or PUNIU, IPU, HANO or \u2018OHE HANO IHU, KA, PU, OEOE, PAHUPAHU or [[Ka'eke'eke|KA\u2019EKE\u2019EKE]], HOKIO, and WI. Dancers employ implements to create sounds. Some of the traditional hula implements are: \u2018ULI\u2019ULI, PU\u2019ILI, \u2018ILI\u2019ILI, PAPAHEHI,and KALA\u2019AU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaimi.org/education/instruments/|title=Instruments {{!}} Ka'Imi Na'auao O Hawai'i Nei Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\nHula Auana is a Hula that was changed by Western influences and performed with musical instruments that don't originate from the Hawaiian Islands. It was popularized and influenced by the influx of tourists to the Hawaiians Islands. The stories are told primarily with the movements of the body and hands. Musis, ukuleles and guitars to accompany the dancers, and the entire performance which makes it more entertaining for those who are new to the culture. Traditionally, hula was a religious ritualistic dance that was more about honoring the gods and goddesses than about entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/fitness/history-hula-dance/|title=The History Of The Hula Dance|website=EverydayHealth.com|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Hawaiian people have various traditions and holidays they celebrate annually. One of the most important holidays among the locals is Prince Kuhio day. Celebrated every year (since 1949) on his birthday (March 26), Prince Kuhio day honors Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, a congressman who succeeded in helping Native Hawaiian families become public landowners.

A major factor for this change was an 1896 law that required that English \"be the only medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools\". This law prevented the Hawaiian language from being taught as a second language.

The Hawaiian language has been promoted for revival most recently by a state program of cultural preservation enacted in 1978. Programs included the opening of Hawaiian language immersion schools, and the establishment of a Hawaiian language department at the [[University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa]]. As a result, Hawaiian language learning has climbed among all races in Hawai\u02bbi.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn 2006, the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] established a masters program in the Hawaiian Language.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1143838 Master's Degree in Hawaiian], npr.org</ref> In fall 2006, they established a doctoral ([[Ph.D]]) program in the Hawaiian Language.

In [[Hawaii]], native Hawaiians are publicly educated by the Hawai\u02bbi State [[Department of Education]], an ethnically diverse school system that is the United States' largest and most centralized.\n\nUnder the administration of Governor [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]] from 1994 to 2002, the state's educational system established special Hawaiian language immersion schools. In these schools, all subject courses are taught in the Hawaiian language and use native Hawaiian subject matter in curricula. These schools were created in the [[spirit]] of cultural preservation and are not exclusive to native Hawaiian children.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nNative Hawaiians are eligible for an education from the [[Kamehameha Schools]], established through the last will and testament of [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] of the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha Dynasty]]. The largest and wealthiest [[private school]] in the United States, Kamehameha Schools was intended to benefit indigents and orphans, with preference given to native Hawaiians. The Kamehameha Schools provides a quality education to thousands of children of entire and part native Hawaiian ancestry at its campuses during the regular school year, and also has quality summer and off-campus programs that are not restricted by ancestry. Kamehameha Schools' practice of accepting primarily gifted students, in lieu of intellectually challenged children, has been a controversial topic amongst the native Hawaiian community. Many 'rejected' families feel that the gifted students could excel at any learning institution, public or private. Thus, the Hawaiian community may be better served by educating children from high-risk, high-crime districts so that a greater proportion of disadvantaged youths may grow up to be responsible community contributors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAs with other children in Hawai\u02bbi, some native Hawaiians are educated by other prominent private academies in the Aloha State. They include: [[Punahou School]], [[Saint Louis School]], [[Mid-Pacific Institute]], and [[Iolani School]].\n\n==Native Hawaiian ways of learning==\n\nNative Hawaiians exemplify patterns of [[observational learning]], a model that captures seven interrelated descriptions, or facets, of learning found in Indigenous communities in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\">Rogoff, B.

Honolulu, HI: Hui Hanai.</ref>\n\n'''Learner collaboration and contribution'''\n\nSimilar to the indigenous communities of the Americas, Native Hawaiian children contribute alongside the adults, and the adults' presence is there to offer support. In most Native Hawaiian communities, household work tasks, such as ironing and cooking, etc., play a major role in contributing to the home life and children's participation enhances their importance within the family.<ref name=\":2\">Boggs, Joan. 1968.

Family organization is a \u201cshared-function\u201d system that includes flexible roles and fluid responsibility within the group. Basic family values include interdependence, responsibility for others, sharing of work and resources, obedience, and respect. Children assume important family responsibilities early and act as members of a sibling workforce that is held collectively responsible for completing tasks.<ref name=\":4\">G.

Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found to take the initiative to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, homework, and caring for younger siblings.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Learning to transform participation'''\n\nAmong Native Hawaiians, the goal of learning is to transform [[Youth participation|participation]] to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community,<ref name=\":0\" /> like that found in [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]]. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed in case of a tragic incident with the parents.<ref>Cicirelli, V. (1994). Sibling Relationships in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Journal of Marriage and Family,56(1), 7-20. {{doi|10.2307/352697}}\n</ref> Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go off on their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.\n\n[[Fosterage|Assuming and initiating care]] has been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy [[Aloha|(''aloha'']]).<ref name=\":6\">Donner, W. W. (1999). Sharing and Compassion: Fosterage in a Polynesian Society. Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 30(4), autumn, 703-722. Retrieved May 25, 2017.</ref> As children mature within the family, they go through a process of having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n'''Wide and keen attention for contribution'''\n\nThe Hawaiians\u2019 ways of learning include wide keen attention from the children while adults are available for guidance, also found in the model of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because the children [[Observational learning|learn through observation]], and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother's frequent use of non-verbal communication.<ref>Speidel, G. E., Farran, D. C., & Jordan, C. (1989). 6: On the Learning and Thinking Styles of Hawaiian Children. In Thinking Across Cultures (pp. 55-77). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref>\n\n'''Coordination through shared reference'''\n\nIn some Native Hawaiian communities, there is a constant use of [[Storytelling|\u201ctalk story\u201d]] which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble.<ref>Smith-Hefner, N. J. (1987), Speaking Relating and Learning: A Study of Hawaiian Children at Home and at School: Stephen T. Boggs. TESOL Quarterly, 21: 759\u2013763. {{doi|10.2307/3586993}}</ref> Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.\n\nAnother example of verbal communication in the Native Hawaiian culture is through the use of [[chant]]ing, which can allow a child to understand the relationship of their present experiences to those of their ancestors, both alive and deceased. Chanting also allows children to understand the connections of their chants to mother earth. For instance, chanting can voice the need for rain to produce plants and induce ponds to grow fish for harvest.<ref name=\":5\">Meyer, Manu Aluli (1998) Native Hawaiian Epistemology: Sites of Empowerment and Resistance, Equity & Excellence in Education, 31:1, 22-28, {{DOI|10.1080/1066568980310104}}</ref>\n\nA study comparing Midwestern and Hawaiian mother \u2013 Kindergartener pairs presented with a novel task,<ref name=\":4\" /> found Hawaiian mothers to be much lower than their Midwestern counterparts in the use of verbal-control techniques and much higher in non-verbal communication, a finding which implies coordination through [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] and verbal means.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Aspects of togetherness, continuity, purpose, and significance are a part of learning and coincide with the Native Hawaiian's spiritual connection to earth and environment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n'''Feedback that appraises mastery and support for learning'''\n\nThere is verbal and nonverbal guidance from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a pat on the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way.<ref name=\":2\" /> This example relates to the [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|LOPI]] model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.\n\nIn the context of producing objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product before moving on to learn the skills of producing something else. Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback.

At the convention, the Hawai\u02bbi state government committed itself to a progressive study and preservation of native Hawaiian culture, history, and language.\n\nA comprehensive Hawaiian culture curriculum was introduced into the State of Hawai\u02bbi's public elementary schools teaching: ancient Hawaiian art, lifestyle, geography, [[hula]], and Hawaiian language vocabulary. Intermediate and high schools were mandated to impose two sets of Hawaiian history curricula on every candidate for graduation.\n\nStatutes and charter amendments were passed acknowledging a policy of preference for Hawaiian place and street names. For example, with the closure of [[Barbers Point Naval Air Station]] in the 1990s, the region formerly occupied by the base was renamed [[Kalaeloa]].\n\n==Office of Hawaiian Affairs==\n{{main|Office of Hawaiian Affairs}}\nAnother important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawai\u02bbi State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawai\u02bbi political stars [[Benjamin J. Cayetano]], [[John D. Waihee III]], and [[Jeremy Harris (politician)|Jeremy Harris]] enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park).<ref name=\"OHA Waimia Valley press release\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |title=OHA gains Waimea Valley title |first=Manu |last=Boyd |date=July 3, 2006 |publisher=[[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927173615/http://www.oha.org/content.asp?contentid=561 |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |url-status= |accessdate=May 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBesides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawai\u02bbi, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the [[Territory of Hawai\u02bbi]] in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawai\u02bbi as public lands in 1959.\n\nOHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawai\u02bbi through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. [[Rice v. Cayetano]]\u2014suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections\u2014reached the [[United States Supreme Court]], which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawai\u02bbi, regardless of ethnicity.\n\n==Federal developments==\n\n===Native American Programs Act===\nIn 1974, the Native American Programs Act was amended to include native Hawaiians. This paved the way for native Hawaiians to become eligible for some, but not all, federal assistance programs originally intended for [[Native Americans in the United States|Continental Native Americans]]. Today, Title 45 CFR Part 1336.62 defines a Native Hawaiian as \"an individual any of whose ancestors were natives of the area which consists of the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778\".\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether or not native Hawaiians should be considered in the same light as Native Americans.<ref name=\"Indian Country Today\">{{cite journal |author=Editors Report |date=August 13, 2001 |title=Native Hawaiian recognition is overdue |journal=[[Indian Country Today]] |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network |id={{oclc|61312545|43291273}} |issn=0744-2238 |accessdate=May 19, 2012 |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2001/08/13/native-hawaiian-recognition-is-overdue-84826 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025002449/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=73 |archivedate=October 25, 2006 |url-status=live |quote=Native Hawaiians have rightfully demanded recognition of their aboriginal standing by the United States.}}</ref><ref name=conklin>{{cite web|url=http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|title=Are kanaka maoli indigenous to Hawai'i?|work=kenconklin.org|accessdate=June 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082145/http://kenconklin.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Are_kanaka_maoli_indigenous_to_Hawai%27i%3F|archivedate=May 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===United States apology resolution===\nOn November 23, 1993, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed United States Public Law 103\u2013150, also known as the [[Apology Resolution]], which had previously passed Congress.

The significance of the bill is that it would establish, for the first time in the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThis bill came under scrutiny by the Bush administration's Department of Justice, as well as the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. The political context surrounding the Akaka Bill is both controversial and complex. Proponents, who consider the legislation an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices, include Hawai\u02bbi's Congressional delegation, as well as the former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor, [[Linda Lingle]]. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|Hawaiian sovereignty activists]], (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nA Ward Research poll commissioned in 2003 by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reported that \"Eighty-six percent of the 303 Hawaiian residents polled by Ward Research said 'yes.'

Kiha was adopted by Mormon Missionary President George Nebeker immediately upon arrival making Kiha Kaawa (Nebeker) the first native Hawaiian to become a US citizen in 1873.\n\n==Culture and arts==\n{{main|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}\n[[File:Native Hawaiian man pounding taro into poi with two children by his sides., c. 1890s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Hawaiian man with his two children, circa 1890.]]\nSeveral cultural preservation societies and organizations have been established over the course of the twentieth century. The largest of those institutions is the Bernice Pauahi [[Bishop Museum]], established in 1889 and designated as the Hawai\u02bbi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History. Bishop Museum houses the largest collection of native Hawaiian artifacts, documents, and other information available for educational use. Most objects are held for preservation alone. The museum has links with major colleges and universities throughout the world to facilitate research.\n\nWith the support of the Bishop Museum, the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]]'s double-hulled canoe, ''[[Hokulea|H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a]]'', has contributed to rediscovery of native Hawaiian culture, especially in the revival of non-instrument navigation, by which ancient Polynesians originally settled Hawai\u02bbi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|title=Hawaiian Cultural Heritage|last=Unattributed|date=July 25, 2007|work=Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument|publisher=United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|language=en-US, haw|accessdate=September 6, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916044123/http://www.hawaiireef.noaa.gov/heritage/welcome.html|archivedate=September 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}} Discusses ''H\u014dk\u016ble&lsquo;a's'' ''[[Hokulea#2003 - 2004 Navigating Change project|Navigating Change]]'' voyage which also raised consciousness of the interdependence of Hawaiians, their environment, and their culture.</ref>\n \nOne of the most commonly known arts of Hawaii is [[hula]] dancing. Now in  days in 21st century many people recognize the hula dance in two different categories which are Hula Kahiko and Hula Auana.\n\nHula Kahiko which is an \u201cold\u201d style of the hula dancing  which  is an interpretive dance, famous for its grace and romantic feel, that expresses stories and feeling from almost any phase of life & culture of Hawaiians. While dancing they also use percussion instruments and traditional chanting. Hawaiians make their own traditional instruments to use while the dancers are dancing which are: PAHU HULA, KILU or PUNIU, IPU, HANO or \u2018OHE HANO IHU, KA, PU, OEOE, PAHUPAHU or [[Ka'eke'eke|KA\u2019EKE\u2019EKE]], HOKIO, and WI. Dancers employ implements to create sounds. Some of the traditional hula implements are: \u2018ULI\u2019ULI, PU\u2019ILI, \u2018ILI\u2019ILI, PAPAHEHI,and KALA\u2019AU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaimi.org/education/instruments/|title=Instruments {{!}} Ka'Imi Na'auao O Hawai'i Nei Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-01}}</ref>\n\nHula Auana is a Hula that was changed by Western influences and performed with musical instruments that don't originate from the Hawaiian Islands. It was popularized and influenced by the influx of tourists to the Hawaiians Islands. The stories are told primarily with the movements of the body and hands. Musis, ukuleles and guitars to accompany the dancers, and the entire performance which makes it more entertaining for those who are new to the culture.

One of the most important holidays among the locals is Prince Kuhio day. Celebrated every year (since 1949) on his birthday (March 26), Prince Kuhio day honors Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, a congressman who succeeded in helping Native Hawaiian families become public landowners.

''Tokusatsu'' entertainment often deals with [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] or [[horror film|horror]], but films and television shows in other genres can sometimes count as ''tokusatsu'' as well. The most popular types of tokusatsu include [[kaiju]] monster films such as the ''[[Godzilla (film series)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Gamera]]'' film series; [[superhero]] TV serials such as the ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'' and ''[[Metal Hero Series|Metal Hero]]'' series; and [[mecha]] dramas  like ''[[Giant Robo (tokusatsu)|Giant Robo]]'' and ''[[Ambassador Magma]]''.

Modern ''tokusatsu'', however, did not begin to take shape until the early 1950s,{{cn|date=October 2014}} with the conceptual and creative birth of [[Godzilla]], one of the most famous monsters (''kaiju'') of all time.\n\nThe special-effects artist [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] and the director [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] became the driving forces behind 1954's ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''. Tsuburaya, inspired by the American film ''[[King Kong]]'', formulated many of the techniques that would become staples of the genre, such as so-called [[suitmation]]\u2014the use of a human actor in a costume to play a giant monster\u2014combined with the use of miniatures and scaled-down city sets. ''Godzilla'' forever changed the landscape of Japanese science fiction, fantasy, and cinema by creating a uniquely Japanese vision in a genre typically dominated by American cinema.<ref>''Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination'', pp. 47\u20138. {{ISBN|0-520-24565-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, ''Godzilla'' kickstarted the ''kaiju'' genre in Japan called the \"Monster Boom\", which remained extremely popular for several decades, with characters such as the aforementioned Godzilla, Gamera and [[King Ghidorah]] leading the market.<ref>''Meet Godzilla''. {{ISBN|1-4042-0269-2}}</ref> However, in 1957 [[Shintoho]] produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character [[Super Giant]], signaling a shift in popularity that favored masked heroes over giant monsters called the \"Henshin Boom\" started by [[Kamen Rider]]. Along with the [[anime]] ''[[Astro Boy]]'', the ''Super Giant'' serials had a profound effect on the world of ''tokusatsu''.

The photo also features anime character [[Doraemon]] on the far left.]]\n\nSince about 1960, several long-running television-series have combined various other themes. [[Tsuburaya Productions]] has had the ''[[Ultra Series]]'' starting with ''[[Ultra Q]]'' and ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' in 1966. [[P Productions]] began their foray into ''tokusatsu'' in 1966 with the series ''[[Ambassador Magma]]''. They also had involvement in the ''[[Lion-Maru]]'' series which concluded in November 2006.\n\n[[Toei Company]] has several series that fall under their ''[[List of superhero productions created by Toei|Toei Superheroes]]'' category of programming, starting in 1961 with the single series, ''[[Moonlight Mask]]''. Then, they produced several other long running series, starting with [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s ''[[Kamen Rider Series]]'' in 1971, the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series in 1975, the ''[[Metal Hero Series]]'' in 1982, and the ''[[Toei Fushigi Comedy Series]]'' in 1981. Toei also produced several other television series based on Ishinomori's works, including ''[[Android Kikaider]]'' and ''[[Kikaider 01]]'', ''[[Robot Detective]]'', ''[[Inazuman]]'' and ''[[Inazuman Flash]]'', and ''[[Kaiketsu Zubat]]''. Toei was also involved in the ''[[Spider-Man (Toei TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' television series, which influenced their subsequent Super Sentai series. In 2003, [[TV Asahi]] began broadcasting the ''Super Sentai'' and ''Kamen Rider'' series in a one-hour block airing each week known as ''[[Super Hero Time]]''. [[Toho]], the creators of [[Godzilla]], also had their hands in creating the ''[[Chouseishin Series]]'' of programs from 2003 to 2006 and the ''[[Zone Fighter]]'' franchise.\n\nIn 2006, [[Keita Amemiya]]'s ''[[Garo (TV series)|Garo]]'', a mature late-night tokusatsu drama was released, starting a franchise composed of several television series and films. Other mature late-night series followed, including a revival of ''Lion-Maru'' in ''[[Lion-Maru G]]'', the ''[[Daimajin Kanon]]'' television series (based on the ''[[Daimajin]]'' film series), and ''[[Shougeki Gouraigan!!]]'' (also created by Amemiya).\n\n===''Tokusatsu'' movies===\nVarious movies classified as ''tokusatsu'' actually work like generalized [[science fiction film]]s.

Though suitmation typifies ''tokusatsu'', some productions may use [[stop-motion]] to animate their monsters instead, for example ''[[Majin Hunter Mitsurugi]]'' in 1973. TV shows may use traditional ''tokusatsu'' techniques, but are cast with puppets or marionettes: ''[[Uchuusen Silica]]'' (1960); ''[[Ginga Shonen Tai]]'' (1963); ''[[Kuchuu Toshi 008]]'' (1969); and [[Go Nagai]]'s ''[[X Bomber]]'' (1980). Some ''tokusatsu'' may employ animation in addition to its live-action components: [[Tsuburaya Productions]]' ''[[Dinosaur Expedition Team Bornfree]]'' (1976), ''[[Dinosaur War Aizenborg]]'' (1977) and ''[[Pro-Wrestling Star Aztekaiser]]'' (1976).\n\n===Japanese fan films===\n[[Hideaki Anno]], [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]], [[Takami Akai]], and [[Shinji Higuchi]] set up a fan-based group called Daicon Film,  which they renamed [[Gainax]] in 1985 and turned into an animation studio. Besides anime sequences, they also produced a series of ''tokusatsu'' shorts parodying monster movies and superhero shows. These productions include ''[[Kaiketsu Noutenki|Swift Hero Noutenki]]'' (1982), ''[[Aikoku Sentai Dai-Nippon|Patriotic Squadron Dai-Nippon]]'' (1983), ''[[Return of Ultraman (parody)|Return of Ultraman]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yamata no Orochi no Gyakushuu|The Eight-Headed Giant Serpent Strikes Back]]'' (1985).\n\n===Outside of Japan===\n''Tokusatsu'' techniques have spread outside Japan due to the popularity of the Godzilla films.\n\n====Adaptations====\n''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'' first appeared in English in 1956. Rather than a simple dub of the Japanese-language original, this work represented an entirely re-edited version which restructured the plot to incorporate a new character played by a native English-speaking actor, [[Raymond Burr]]. ''Ultraman'' gained popularity when [[United Artists]] dubbed it for American audiences in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Haim Saban]] acquired the distribution rights for the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series from [[Toei Company]] and combined the original Japanese action footage with new footage featuring American actors, resulting in the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise<ref>{{cite news|last=Heffley|first=Lynne|title=Low-Tech Equals High Ratings : Fox's Offbeat 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' Flexes Its Kidvid Muscle|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/entertainment/ca-60885_1_mighty-morphin-power-rangers|accessdate=August 28, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 25, 1993}}</ref> which has continued since then into sequel TV series (with ''[[Power Rangers Beast Morphers]]'' set to premiere in 2019<ref name=\"press\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/power-rangers/270797/power-rangers-beast-morphers-confirmed|title=Power Rangers Beast Morphers Confirmed|work=Den of Geek!|last=Kelley|first=Shamus|date=February 17, 2018|accessdate=February 17, 2018}}</ref>), comic books,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/power-rangers/247373/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-comics-coming-from-boom-studios|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Comics Coming From BOOM!

[[DIC Entertainment]] joined this boom by acquiring the rights to ''[[Gridman the Hyper Agent]]'' and turning it into ''[[Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad]]''.\n\nIn 2002, [[4Kids Entertainment]] bought the rights to ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'', but simply produced a [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the Japanese footage, broadcast on the [[Fox Box]]. And in 2009, [[Adness Entertainment]] took 2002's ''[[Kamen Rider Ryuki]]'' and turned it into ''[[Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight]]'', which began broadcast on [[The CW4Kids]] in 2009.

That same year, [[Saga Studios]] in [[Denmark]] made another Godzilla-style giant monster film, ''[[Reptilicus]]'', bringing its monster to life using a marionette on a miniature set. In 1967, South Korea produced its own monster movie titled ''[[Yongary, Monster from the Deep|Yonggary]]''. In 1975, [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]] produced a superhero film called ''[[The Super Inframan]]'', based on the huge success of Ultraman and Kamen Rider there. The film starred [[Danny Lee (actor)|Danny Lee]] in the title role. Although there were several other similar superhero productions in Hong Kong, ''The Super Inframan'' came first. With help from Japanese special effects artists under [[Sadamasa Arikawa]], they also produced a Japanese-styled monster movie, ''[[The Mighty Peking Man]]'', in 1977.\n\nConcurrent with their work on ''Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad'', DIC attempted an original concept based on the popularity of ''Power Rangers'' in 1994's ''[[Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills]]''. In 1998, video from an [[Sailor Moon#American remake|attempted ''Power Rangers''-styled adaptation]] of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' surfaced, combining original footage of American actresses with original animated sequences. \n\nSaban also attempted at making their own unique tokusatsu series entitled ''[[Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog]]'', set in medieval [[Ireland]] and featured four, later five knights who transform using the power of the elements (for the most part) at they protected their kingdom from evil. Saban had also produced the live action ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' series ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', which was known in the turtles fandom for introducing a female turtle exclusive to that series called ''Venus de Milo'' and eliminating the fact that the other turtles were brothers. The show primarily featured actors in costumes most of the time, but featured similar choreographed fights like other tokusatsu shows.\n\nIn the 2000s, production companies in other East Asian countries began producing their own original ''tokusatsu''-inspired television series: [[Thailand]]'s ''[[Sport Ranger]]'' and [[South Korea]]'s ''[[Erexion]]'' in 2006; the [[Philippines]]' ''[[Zaido: Pulis Pangkalawakan]]'' (itself a sanctioned spinoff of Toei's ''[[Space Sheriff Shaider]]'') in 2007;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/13162/GMA-7-acquires-exclusive-rights-to-Shaider|title=GMA-7 acquires exclusive rights to \"Shaider\"|website=pep.ph|accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> [[China]]'s ''[[Armor Hero]]'' ({{zh|c=\u94e0\u7532\u52c7\u58eb|p=K\u01cei Ji\u01ce Y\u01d2ng Sh\u00ec}}) in 2009, ''[[Giant Saver]]'' ({{zh|c=\u5de8\u795e\u6218\u51fb\u961f\u7b2c |p=J\u00f9sh\u00e9n zh\u00e0n j\u00ed du\u00ec}}) in 2013, ''[[Metal Kaiser]]'' ({{zh|c=\u4e94\u9f99\u5947\u5251\u58eb|p=W\u01d4 L\u00f3ng Q\u00ed Ji\u00e0n Sh\u00ec}}); and [[Indonesia]]'s ''[[Bima Satria Garuda]]'' which began in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pewarta: Nanien Yuniar |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/373464/bandai-buat-mainan-bima-satria-garuda |title=Bandai buat mainan BIMA Satria Garuda |publisher=ANTARA News |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Pewarta: Nanien Yuniar |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/373453/bima-satria-garuda-ksatria-baja-hitam-indonesia |title=BIMA Satria Garuda, Ksatria Baja Hitam Indonesia |publisher=ANTARA News |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>\n\nOn July the 1st, 2019, [[Vietnam]]'s [[Transform Studio]] co-operating with [[Dive Into Eden]] announced their own original ''tokusatsu'' series, ''[[Mighty Guardian]]'' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: {{lang|vi|Chi\u1ebfn Th\u1ea7n}}).

The techniques developed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] for [[Toho Studios]] continue to be used in the ''tokusatsu'' film and television industry.]]\n{{Fantasy}}\n\n'''''Tokusatsu''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: \u7279\u64ae, \"special filming\") is a Japanese term for [[live action]] [[film]] or [[television drama]] that makes heavy use of [[special effect]]s. ''Tokusatsu'' entertainment often deals with [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] or [[horror film|horror]], but films and television shows in other genres can sometimes count as ''tokusatsu'' as well. The most popular types of tokusatsu include [[kaiju]] monster films such as the ''[[Godzilla (film series)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Gamera]]'' film series; [[superhero]] TV serials such as the ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'' and ''[[Metal Hero Series|Metal Hero]]'' series; and [[mecha]] dramas  like ''[[Giant Robo (tokusatsu)|Giant Robo]]'' and ''[[Ambassador Magma]]''. Some ''tokusatsu'' television programs combine several of these subgenres, for example the ''[[Ultra Series|Ultraman]]'' and ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series. \n\n''Tokusatsu'' is one of the most popular forms of Japanese entertainment, but despite the popularity of films and television programs based on ''tokusatsu'' properties such as ''Godzilla'' or ''Super Sentai'', only a small proportion of ''tokusatsu'' films and television programs are widely known outside and inside Asia.\n\n==History==\n''Tokusatsu'' has origins in early [[Japanese theater]], specifically in [[kabuki]] (with its action- and fight-scenes) and in [[bunraku]], which utilized some of the earliest forms of special effects, specifically [[puppetry]]. Modern ''tokusatsu'', however, did not begin to take shape until the early 1950s,{{cn|date=October 2014}} with the conceptual and creative birth of [[Godzilla]], one of the most famous monsters (''kaiju'') of all time.\n\nThe special-effects artist [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] and the director [[Ishir\u014d Honda]] became the driving forces behind 1954's ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''. Tsuburaya, inspired by the American film ''[[King Kong]]'', formulated many of the techniques that would become staples of the genre, such as so-called [[suitmation]]\u2014the use of a human actor in a costume to play a giant monster\u2014combined with the use of miniatures and scaled-down city sets. ''Godzilla'' forever changed the landscape of Japanese science fiction, fantasy, and cinema by creating a uniquely Japanese vision in a genre typically dominated by American cinema.<ref>''Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination'', pp. 47\u20138. {{ISBN|0-520-24565-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, ''Godzilla'' kickstarted the ''kaiju'' genre in Japan called the \"Monster Boom\", which remained extremely popular for several decades, with characters such as the aforementioned Godzilla, Gamera and [[King Ghidorah]] leading the market.<ref>''Meet Godzilla''. {{ISBN|1-4042-0269-2}}</ref> However, in 1957 [[Shintoho]] produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character [[Super Giant]], signaling a shift in popularity that favored masked heroes over giant monsters called the \"Henshin Boom\" started by [[Kamen Rider]]. Along with the [[anime]] ''[[Astro Boy]]'', the ''Super Giant'' serials had a profound effect on the world of ''tokusatsu''. The following year, ''[[Moonlight Mask]]'' premiered, the first of numerous televised superhero dramas that would make up one of the most popular ''tokusatsu'' subgenres.<ref>''Japan Pop!: Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture'', p. 262 {{ISBN|0-7656-0560-0}}</ref> Created by [[K\u014dhan Kawauchi]], he followed-up its success with the tokusatsu superhero shows ''[[Seven Color Mask]]'' (1959) and ''[[Messenger of Allah (TV series)|Messenger of Allah]]'' (1960), both starring a young [[Sonny Chiba]].\n\nThese original productions preceded the first color-television ''tokusatsu'' series, ''[[Ambassador Magma]]'' and ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'', which heralded the [[Kyodai Hero]] genre, wherein a regular-sized protagonist grows to larger proportions to fight equally large monsters.<ref>Porter, Hal.

[[Tsuburaya Productions]] has had the ''[[Ultra Series]]'' starting with ''[[Ultra Q]]'' and ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'' in 1966. [[P Productions]] began their foray into ''tokusatsu'' in 1966 with the series ''[[Ambassador Magma]]''. They also had involvement in the ''[[Lion-Maru]]'' series which concluded in November 2006.\n\n[[Toei Company]] has several series that fall under their ''[[List of superhero productions created by Toei|Toei Superheroes]]'' category of programming, starting in 1961 with the single series, ''[[Moonlight Mask]]''. Then, they produced several other long running series, starting with [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s ''[[Kamen Rider Series]]'' in 1971, the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series in 1975, the ''[[Metal Hero Series]]'' in 1982, and the ''[[Toei Fushigi Comedy Series]]'' in 1981. Toei also produced several other television series based on Ishinomori's works, including ''[[Android Kikaider]]'' and ''[[Kikaider 01]]'', ''[[Robot Detective]]'', ''[[Inazuman]]'' and ''[[Inazuman Flash]]'', and ''[[Kaiketsu Zubat]]''. Toei was also involved in the ''[[Spider-Man (Toei TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' television series, which influenced their subsequent Super Sentai series. In 2003, [[TV Asahi]] began broadcasting the ''Super Sentai'' and ''Kamen Rider'' series in a one-hour block airing every Sunday known as ''[[Super Hero Time]]''. [[Toho]], the creators of [[Godzilla]], also had their hands in creating the ''[[Chouseishin Series]]'' of programs from 2003 to 2006 and the ''[[Zone Fighter]]'' franchise.\n\nIn 2006, [[Keita Amemiya]]'s ''[[Garo (TV series)|Garo]]'', a mature late-night tokusatsu drama was released, starting a franchise composed of several television series and films. Other mature late-night series followed, including a revival of ''Lion-Maru'' in ''[[Lion-Maru G]]'', the ''[[Daimajin Kanon]]'' television series (based on the ''[[Daimajin]]'' film series), and ''[[Shougeki Gouraigan!!]]'' (also created by Amemiya).\n\n===''Tokusatsu'' movies===\nVarious movies classified as ''tokusatsu'' actually work like generalized [[science fiction film]]s.

Though suitmation typifies ''tokusatsu'', some productions may use [[stop-motion]] to animate their monsters instead, for example ''[[Majin Hunter Mitsurugi]]'' in 1973. TV shows may use traditional ''tokusatsu'' techniques, but are cast with puppets or marionettes: ''[[Uchuusen Silica]]'' (1960); ''[[Ginga Shonen Tai]]'' (1963); ''[[Kuchuu Toshi 008]]'' (1969); and [[Go Nagai]]'s ''[[X Bomber]]'' (1980). Some ''tokusatsu'' may employ animation in addition to its live-action components: [[Tsuburaya Productions]]' ''[[Dinosaur Expedition Team Bornfree]]'' (1976), ''[[Dinosaur War Aizenborg]]'' (1977) and ''[[Pro-Wrestling Star Aztekaiser]]'' (1976).\n\n===Japanese fan films===\n[[Hideaki Anno]], [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]], [[Takami Akai]], and [[Shinji Higuchi]] set up a fan-based group called Daicon Film,  which they renamed [[Gainax]] in 1985 and turned into an animation studio. Besides anime sequences, they also produced a series of ''tokusatsu'' shorts parodying monster movies and superhero shows. These productions include ''[[Kaiketsu Noutenki|Swift Hero Noutenki]]'' (1982), ''[[Aikoku Sentai Dai-Nippon|Patriotic Squadron Dai-Nippon]]'' (1983), ''[[Return of Ultraman (parody)|Return of Ultraman]]'' (1983) and ''[[Yamata no Orochi no Gyakushuu|The Eight-Headed Giant Serpent Strikes Back]]'' (1985).\n\n===Outside of Japan===\n''Tokusatsu'' techniques have spread outside Japan due to the popularity of the Godzilla films.\n\n====Adaptations====\n''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'' first appeared in English in 1956. Rather than a simple dub of the Japanese-language original, this work represented an entirely re-edited version which restructured the plot to incorporate a new character played by a native English-speaking actor, [[Raymond Burr]]. ''Ultraman'' gained popularity when [[United Artists]] dubbed it for American audiences in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Haim Saban]] acquired the distribution rights for the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series from [[Toei Company]] and combined the original Japanese action footage with new footage featuring American actors, resulting in the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise<ref>{{cite news|last=Heffley|first=Lynne|title=Low-Tech Equals High Ratings : Fox's Offbeat 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' Flexes Its Kidvid Muscle|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/entertainment/ca-60885_1_mighty-morphin-power-rangers|accessdate=August 28, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 25, 1993}}</ref> which has continued since then into sequel TV series (with ''[[Power Rangers Beast Morphers]]'' set to premiere in 2019<ref name=\"press\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/power-rangers/270797/power-rangers-beast-morphers-confirmed|title=Power Rangers Beast Morphers Confirmed|work=Den of Geek!|last=Kelley|first=Shamus|date=February 17, 2018|accessdate=February 17, 2018}}</ref>), comic books,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/power-rangers/247373/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-comics-coming-from-boom-studios|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Comics Coming From BOOM!

That same year, [[Saga Studios]] in [[Denmark]] made another Godzilla-style giant monster film, ''[[Reptilicus]]'', bringing its monster to life using a marionette on a miniature set. In 1967, South Korea produced its own monster movie titled ''[[Yongary, Monster from the Deep|Yonggary]]''. In 1975, [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]] produced a superhero film called ''[[The Super Inframan]]'', based on the huge success of Ultraman and Kamen Rider there. The film starred [[Danny Lee (actor)|Danny Lee]] in the title role. Although there were several other similar superhero productions in Hong Kong, ''The Super Inframan'' came first. With help from Japanese special effects artists under [[Sadamasa Arikawa]], they also produced a Japanese-styled monster movie, ''[[The Mighty Peking Man]]'', in 1977.\n\nConcurrent with their work on ''Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad'', DIC attempted an original concept based on the popularity of ''Power Rangers'' in 1994's ''[[Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills]]''. In 1998, video from an [[Sailor Moon#American remake|attempted ''Power Rangers''-styled adaptation]] of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' surfaced, combining original footage of American actresses with original animated sequences. \n\nSaban also attempted at making their own unique tokusatsu series entitled ''[[Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog]]'', set in medieval [[Ireland]] and featured four, later five knights who transform using the power of the elements (for the most part) at they protected their kingdom from evil. Saban had also produced the live action ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' series ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', which was known in the turtles fandom for introducing a female turtle exclusive to that series called ''Venus de Milo'' and eliminating the fact that the other turtles were brothers. The show primarily featured actors in costumes most of the time, but featured similar choreographed fights like other tokusatsu shows.\n\nIn the 2000s, production companies in other East Asian countries began producing their own original ''tokusatsu''-inspired television series: [[Thailand]]'s ''[[Sport Ranger]]'' and [[South Korea]]'s ''[[Erexion]]'' in 2006; the [[Philippines]]' ''[[Zaido: Pulis Pangkalawakan]]'' (itself a sanctioned spinoff of Toei's ''[[Space Sheriff Shaider]]'') in 2007;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/13162/GMA-7-acquires-exclusive-rights-to-Shaider|title=GMA-7 acquires exclusive rights to \"Shaider\"|website=pep.ph|accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> [[China]]'s ''[[Armor Hero]]'' ({{zh|c=\u94e0\u7532\u52c7\u58eb|p=K\u01cei Ji\u01ce Y\u01d2ng Sh\u00ec}}) in 2009, ''[[Giant Saver]]'' ({{zh|c=\u5de8\u795e\u6218\u51fb\u961f\u7b2c |p=J\u00f9sh\u00e9n zh\u00e0n j\u00ed du\u00ec}}) in 2013, ''[[Metal Kaiser]]'' ({{zh|c=\u4e94\u9f99\u5947\u5251\u58eb|p=W\u01d4 L\u00f3ng Q\u00ed Ji\u00e0n Sh\u00ec}}); and [[Indonesia]]'s ''[[Bima Satria Garuda]]'' which began in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pewarta: Nanien Yuniar |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/373464/bandai-buat-mainan-bima-satria-garuda |title=Bandai buat mainan BIMA Satria Garuda |publisher=ANTARA News |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Pewarta: Nanien Yuniar |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/373453/bima-satria-garuda-ksatria-baja-hitam-indonesia |title=BIMA Satria Garuda, Ksatria Baja Hitam Indonesia |publisher=ANTARA News |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>\n\nOn July the 1st, 2019, [[Vietnam]]'s [[Transform Studio]] co-operating with [[Dive Into Eden]] announced their own original ''tokusatsu'' series, ''[[Mighty Guardian]]'' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: {{lang|vi|Chi\u1ebfn Th\u1ea7n}}).

Just before midnight on May 30, 2013, Mora and four female volunteers were abducted by a group of masked men. The women eventually escaped and informed the police. Mora's bound and beaten body was found on the beach the next morning. An [[autopsy]] determined he died by [[asphyxiation]] after suffering a blow to the head.\n\nSea turtles are protected by law in Costa Rica, but [[poaching]] remains common. Locals take eggs, which are believed to be an [[aphrodisiac]], and sell them on the black market. The egg trade has been linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Environmentalists working in [[Lim\u00f3n]] say they are often threatened for trying to protect turtle eggs. Jairo Mora was one such environmentalist working in the area.\n\nIn the wake of Mora's death, the organization he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including a statement from the [[United Nations]] and multiple rewards for information on the case. In Costa Rica, his death led to calls for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister [[Ren\u00e9 Castro]] would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of [[Costa Rican col\u00f3n|\u20a1]]20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to \u20a130 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.\n\n==Background==\nCosta Rica has a good reputation for [[wildlife conservation]] in general, and sea turtles have been protected by national legislation in Costa Rica since 1966.<ref name=Independent /><ref name=Conservation />  The country prides itself on its natural beauty and the nation's economy depends heavily on [[ecotourism]].

Just before midnight on May 30, 2013, Mora and four female volunteers were abducted by a group of masked men. The women eventually escaped and informed the police. Mora's bound and beaten body was found on the beach the next morning. An [[autopsy]] determined he died by [[asphyxiation]] after suffering a blow to the head.\n\nSea turtles are protected by law in Costa Rica, but [[poaching]] remains common. Locals take eggs, which are believed to be an [[aphrodisiac]], and sell them on the black market. The egg trade has been linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Environmentalists working in [[Lim\u00f3n]] say they are often threatened for trying to protect turtle eggs. Jairo Mora was one such environmentalist working in the area.\n\nIn the wake of Mora's death, the organization he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including a statement from the [[United Nations]] and multiple rewards for information on the case. In Costa Rica, his death led to calls for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister [[Ren\u00e9 Castro]] would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of [[Costa Rican col\u00f3n|\u20a1]]20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to \u20a130 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.\n\n==Background==\nCosta Rica has a good reputation for [[wildlife conservation]] in general, and sea turtles have been protected by national legislation in Costa Rica since 1966.<ref name=Independent /><ref name=Conservation />  The country prides itself on its natural beauty and the nation's economy depends heavily on [[ecotourism]].

As a child, she won local children's drawing contests and in her teens attended a school, [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]], known for its arts instruction.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> Between 1924 and 1929 she studied at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] where she worked under [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the summer months she traveled to Europe and during one of these trips studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> She had one additional period of training in the late 1940s when she learned techniques of abstraction and expressionism from [[Jack Tworkov]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\n==Career in art==\n\nWhen she was not traveling, Eisner lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and rented a studio on Cornelia Street.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/><ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> In 1930 she contributed a still life in a group show at the Opportunity Gallery that also included works by [[Edith Hamlin]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1930\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of collectors along with the artist Gifford Beal set up the nonprofit Opportunity Gallery in the fall of 1927.<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\"/> Each exhibition was selected by a well-known artist with the overall goal of showing new talent in a wide range of artistic styles.<ref name=\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Nov 1927\"/> [[Mark Rothko]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] all showed at the gallery during its early years.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Gallery\"/> }} Throughout the rest of the decade her paintings appeared frequently in shows held by nonprofit organizations, including Salons of America (1931, 1932, 1933), the [[Society of Independent Artists]] (1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937), the [[College Art Association]] (traveling exhibitions in 1932 and 1933), the [[National Association of Women Artists|National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]] (annually, 1933 to 1939), the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (1934), and the [[New York Society of Women Artists]] (1935, 1936, 1938).<ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/>{{refn|group=note|In 1922 [[Hamilton Easter Field]] founded Salons of America to give artists an alternative to the Society of Independent Artists whose financial and publicity methods he found objectionable. A reporter said he aimed \"to give equal opportunity to every member, whether he or she be a conservative or a post-Dadaist.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Jul 1922\"/>}} In these large shows Eisner's paintings were regularly singled out for praise by New York critics. Thus, for example, in 1936 the ''New York Post'' critic noted her \"thorough and vigorous\" canvases.<ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/> In 1937 Edward Alden Jewell of the ''Times'' called attention to her free brushwork.<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1937\"/> In 1938, a ''Post'' critic called one of her paintings \"the outstanding canvas of the show.\"<ref name=\"New York Post Feb 1938\"/>\n\nIn 1932 the Morton Gallery mounted her first solo exhibition. In it, she showed paintings depicting life in the mountains of the [[Carolinas]].<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Critics responded favorably to the show. A review in the ''New York Post'' said she had technical facility and showed her subjects freshly and spontaneously.<ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/> Writing in the ''New York Sun'', a critic wrote that the paintings were social documents that revealed life in the southern mountains in a way that was \"vastly entertaining.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/> A critic for the ''New York Times'' noticed that Eisner showed more interest in the people she encountered than in the scenic environment in which they passed their lives and concluded that \"she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/>  Her depiction of a fiddler drew attention in both the ''Sun'' and the ''Times''. Late in life, a contemporary of Eisner's, [[Joseph Solman]], said of the [[Social realism|social realist]] style of the time: \"We were all seeking the flat, and the exaggerated, and the expressionist in our own romantic, different ways.\"<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\"/>\n\nTwo years later the Delphic Studio gave Eisner and Grace Bliss Stewart a duo exhibition. On this occasion the ''New York Sun'' featured a photo of another Carolina mountains painting, \"Franklin's View.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/>{{refn|group=note|Journalist and art patron [[Alma Reed]] founded Delphic Studios in 1929. Mainly known for its emphasis on Mexican art, the gallery also showed photographers, such as [[Edward Weston]] and [[Ansel Adams]] as well as Eisner and other contemporary American artists.<ref name=\"Delphic Studio\"/> }} The ''Sun'''s critic, who found her work to be on the whole \"attractive,\" used the label \"communist\" as shorthand for Eisner's social realist style in her mountain paintings. The critic said, \"[she] paints citizens who have a good deal of the soil upon their clothes.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Howard Devree of the ''New York Times'' said the paintings showed increased strength and sureness and praised her use of warm reds in a generally low palette.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/>\n\n[[File:1937DeweyCommission.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Dewey Commission, 1937, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\nIn the late 1930s Eisner exhibited as a member of a [[popular front]] organization called the [[American Artists' Congress]].<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1937\"/> After the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] in 1940 she and a small group of like-minded artists quit the Congress to found an avowedly non-political organization called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"Federation of modern painters and sculptors 2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of New York artists formed the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in the spring of 1940. All had resigned from the American Artists' Congress to protest its \"Stalinist line\" after the congress had endorsed the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/> The federation aimed to be non-political. Its principal goal was to promote artistic independence and its members adhered to no specific style or school of painting. By means of exhibitions, publications, and lectures it set itself to promote the \"general interest of contemporary art.\" In addition to Eisner and her sister Anne, founding members included [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Anne Goldthwaite]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Balcomb Greene]], and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1942\"/> }} In 1937 Eisner and her husband traveled to Mexico to help the [[Dewey Commission]] investigate charges leveled against [[Leon Trotsky]] by the Soviet government in the [[Moscow Trials]] of 1936\u20131937. Eisner made a painting of commission members interviewing Trotsky in a house on the outskirts of Mexico City owned by Rivera and [[Frida Kahlo]]. The painting (shown at left) contains a view of [[Diego Rivera]] who is making a sketch of the scene.<ref name=\"Trotsky Commission Painting\"/> She also made two portraits of Trotsky. The two of them joked about a time when she scraped off pigment in painting his face. He made an affectionate, albeit macabre joke that she was beheading him.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> This painting is shown in the photo of Trotsky and Eisner at top right.\n\nAfter World War II Eisner traveled widely with her husband. His work as a journalist for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine and his passion for fishing helped to determine the locations they visited. In 1947 they spent time on [[Cape Breton Island]] and, beginning in 1949 they started to make periodic visits to [[Livingston, Montana]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Returning from Montana in the early 1950s, Eisner began a short period of study with [[Jack Tworkov]] in New York.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/>{{refn|group=note|Tworkov taught art throughout much of his career. In the early 1930s he taught briefly at the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]] in Manhattan. Between 1948 and 1958 he was a part-time instructor at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] and [[Pratt Institute]]. He was also at one time an instructor at [[Black Mountain College]] and in the 1960s taught at the [[Yale School of Art]], becoming chair of the art department in 1963.<ref name=\"Tworkov Papers AAA\"/> }} In 1960 she and her husband began spending summer months on [[Great Cranberry Island]].<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\"/>\n\nDuring these years and continuing into the 1970s she continued exhibiting with the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/><ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/> During this period she also continued to be given solo exhibitions in New York commercial galleries. In 1961 she was given a solo exhibition at the James Gallery and in 1966 and in 1969 at the Cisneros Gallery.<ref name=\"New York Times Feb 1961\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1966\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1969\"/>\n\nAfter her death in 1984 she was given a succession of retrospective exhibitions. These included the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]] (1992, \"Dorothy Eisner: Paintings and Collages\"), Acme Fine Art (Boston, 2005, \"Late Expressionist Paintings,\" and 2009, \"Dorothy Eisner on Cranberry Island\"), [[Ogunquit Museum of American Art|Ogunquit Museum]] (2008, Cranberry Island paintings), and Gleason Fine Art (Boothbay Harbor Maine, 2017).<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/><ref name=\"Boothbay Register May 2017\"/> In 2009 her work also appeared in an exhibition called \"The Art of the Cranberry Isles\" in the [[Portland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News Mar 2009\"/>\n\n===Positions in art organizations===\n\nEisner immersed herself in the art world while still young. In 1930, aged twenty-four, she joined the board of the Society of Independent Artists. Not long afterward she became a member of the American Artists' Congress, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the New York Society of Women Artists. As noted above, she was a founding member of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in 1941.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> It seems likely that her marriage, the war, and the birth of a daughter (1942) dampened the impulse to participate in other organizations.\n\n===Artistic style===\n[[File:1931FiddlersConvention.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Fiddlers' Convention, about 1931, black and white photographic print of an oil painting, 9 x 7 inches]]\n[[File:1958YellowstoneRiver.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Yellowstone River, about 1958, oil on canvas, 44 x 36 inches]]\n\nIn reviewing shows of the paintings she made in the 1930s, critics noticed that when choosing subjects Eisner favored people over scenery.<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Two of them saw these paintings as lively and entertaining social documents having an authentic quality.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Others pointed out a muted palette and a tendency to drabness along with strong composition, ability to develop a subject freshly and spontaneously, and overall vigor and thoroughness.<ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/> For example, a critic for the ''New York Sun'' said Eisner painted her subjects \"roughly, but with a curious instinct for balance that makes the panels, as a whole, attractive.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Writing in the ''New York Times'' Howard Devree noted Eisner's skill in delineating subjects convincingly and praised her growing strength and sureness.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/> The painting, \"Fiddlers' Convention\" (shown at left) was mentioned as typical of her better 1930s work.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> In 1934 it was reproduced in an article in the ''Philadelphia Record'' reviewing the Pennsylvania Academy's 129th annual exhibition.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\nEisner's style changed little during the 1930s and war years. During the post-war period, while most of her work remained realist, she began to study under [[Jack Tworkov]]. Although much [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painting was then anti-figurative, Tworkov, like his friend [[Willem de Kooning]], believed that even so-called pure abstraction made, as he said, \"analogy to the figure.\" His obituary in the ''New York Times'' quoted him as saying \"Every painter has a subject whether or not there are objects in his paintings.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Sep 1982\"/> Eisner responded sympathetically to this approach. Later she was quoted as saying, \"Abstract Expressionism made me think differently. I learned from it a language of shapes and color that I was not conscious of when I was young.\"<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> During this period she produced much work in regular visits to the American [[mountain states]], particularly Livingston, Montana, and nearby [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Her painting \"Yellowstone River\" (seen at right) shows the influence of Tworkov's instruction. While it might be taken as a pure abstraction, the title shows it to be an abstract representation of a real place.\n\n[[File:1965PortraitInLight.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Portrait in Light, 1965, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\n[[File:1981InteriorStillLife.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Interior Still Life, 1981, oil on canvas, 24 x 30 inches]] \nIn 1960, when Eisner and her husband began spending summers on Great Cranberry Island, her work showed a new [[figurative art|figurative]] style. She often showed people relaxing and engaging in vacation-time pursuits: playing cards or croquet. Just as often her subjects would be inanimate: desks, chairs, windows, a towel rack. Writing in 2008 concerning a retrospective exhibition that showed these paintings, a critic said, \"her subject matter is so seemingly mundane that the viewer is startled by her choice.\"<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/> Although abstract, her style was firmly grounded in specific places at specific times, and its realist subjects were clearly evident. She made expressionistic use of bold colors, as she had in her 1950s abstractions, but in a style that critics saw as fluid, masterfully composed, and expressionistic.<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/> A critic said the paintings she made on Cranberry Island were orderly, distinct, and painted with great spirit.<ref name=\"Portland Press Herald Oct 2008\"/>\n\nAn early painting from this period, \"Portrait in Light\" (shown at left), has a greater degree of abstraction than a painting, \"Interior Still Life\" (shown at right) made only three years before her death. The latter work seems to show an influence of Matisse that critics saw in her work from the time she spent studying at Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> From its inception in the 1930s through to its culmination in the late paintings, Eisner's output maintained a consistency that a gallerist summarized as derived from European modernism but also grounded in American painting of her own generation and the generation before her.<ref name=\"Gleason Fine Art\"/>\n\n==Personal life and family==\n\nEisner was born in New York on January 17, 1906.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Her father was William J. Eisner. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1880 and died in New York in 1975.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Orphaned while still young, he left school at 13 and later became one of the first makers of wax paper in the United States. Having moved to New York he was for many years president of a business called the Newark Paraffin and Parchment Paper Co.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/> Eisner's mother was Florine Eisner (1883-1974). Florine's father's name was Moritz Eisner. Born in Austria, he studied to be a chemist and after emigrating to the United States founded a business called Eisner-Mendelson Company that sold a malt extract and other health products.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1938\"/> After her marriage in 1905, Florine Eisner's maiden and married surnames were the same.\n\nEisner had a sister, [[Anne Eisner Putnam]] (1911-1967), who followed in her sister's footsteps. She studied at the Art Students League and served on its board of directors. She showed professionally during the 1940s with the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. After her marriage to Patrick Putnam she lived in the [[Ituri Rainforest]] within the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Belgian Congo]] in a campsite adjacent to pygmies of the  [[Mbuti people]]. Patrick Putnam, who had an unpaid position as ''agent sanitaire'', ran an informal dispensary and anthropological laboratory. For eight years Anne Eisner Putnam operated a small collection of guest houses from which she rented out rooms to visitors so as to support her husband's work.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Jun 1956\"/> Following Patrick's death in 1953 she returned to New York where she published a book, ''Madami: My Eight Years of Adventure with the Congo Pygmies'', describing her experiences and celebrating the Mbuti culture which she deeply respected.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Dec 1954\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s Florine Eisner (1883-1974) followed the example set by both daughters by studying at the Art Students League. Using Florine Rensie as her name, she joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and became a professional artist (Rensie is Eisner spelled backward).<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> After he retired from business in the early 1950s, William J. Eisner joined the rest of the family in studying art and becoming a professional artist.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nWilliam and Florine raised their family in Manhattan. During the warm months of the year they frequently traveled to their country home in Woodstock, New York, and, after the children had grown they followed the example they had set and both became serious artists. William exhibited under his own name in galleries in nearby Kingston, New York, while Florine adopted Florine Rensie as her professional name to avoid the appearance of capitalizing on her daughters' artistic successes .<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nEarly in the 1930s Eisner worked in New York for the [[Resettlement Administration]]. In 1935 she met her future husband, [[John McDonald (journalist)|John Dennis McDonald]] (1906-1998), who was then working for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and in 1936 they married.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a master's degree in literature and subsequently immersed himself in the socialist politics of the 1930s, particularly the [[anti-Stalinist left]]. In 1937 he joined the [[Dewey Commission]] as a technical assistant. He and Eisner traveled to Mexico with the commission staff. Chaired by the philosopher [[John Dewey]], the commission aimed to provide [[Leon Trotsky]] with a fair hearing of the charges made against him in the [[Moscow trials|Soviet show trials]] of 1936. While they opposed Stalinism, he and Eisner, like most members of the commission, were not themselves [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the latter part of the 1930s, McDonald worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in Washington, D.C. During World War II he worked in New York for a nonprofit motion picture production company called the American Film Center.{{refn|group=note|Founded by Donald Slesinger, a psychologist and law school dean, and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Film Center supported producers of educational and documentary films and produced films for the [[Office of Civilian Defense]]. Slesinger's inept management brought the center to bankruptcy in 1946.<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\"/>  }} In 1945 he began work as a staff writer at [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine. In 1949 he joined its editorial board and remained in that position until he retired in 1971. His writings showed a wide breadth of his interest, including economic theory and game theory as well as fishing and horse racing.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> The author of scholarly texts as well as journal articles, he was best known for a book that listed him as editor although he was in fact its author: ''My Years with General Motors, by Alfred P. Sloan Jr.'' (1964).<ref name=\"Boston Globe Nov 2002\"/>\n\nMcDonald had a daughter, Joan (born 1929), by a prior, relatively brief, marriage with Lorraine Oven.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> Eisner and McDonald had one child, a daughter, Christie Anne (born 1942), who, at time of this writing, is the Smith Professor of French Language and Literature and Chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/><ref name=\"Christie McDonald Harvard\"/>\n\nEisner died in New York on April 28, 1984.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist\n|colwidth=30em\n|refs=\n\n<!-- journals -->\n\n<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\">{{cite journal |author=Christie McDonald |date=2006 |volume= |issue=30 |pages=142\u2013149 | title=Brushes with History |jstor=27569177 |journal=Harvard Review |location= |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<!-- books -->\n\n<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\">{{cite book |author1=Devin Orgeron |author2=Marsha Orgeron |author3=Dan Streible |title=Learning with the Lights Off: Educational Film in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXxMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA244 |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-045251-3 |pages=243\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\">{{cite book |author1=David Little |author2=Carl Little |title=Art of Acadia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIg1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA181 |date=1 August 2016 |publisher=Down East Books |isbn=978-1-60893-475-1 |page=181}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC |title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life |publisher=Upne |year=1989 |format= |page=302 |author=Roxana Robinson |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\">{{cite book |author1=Lawrence Alloway |author2=Mary D.

Writers have been far in advance of artists in discovering the possibilities of subject-matter in this section. It is not the beauties of mountain landscape that have attracted Miss Eisner, but rather the individuality of people and the interest of their pastimes. A \"Fiddlers' Convention\" and a dance called \"Bird in Buzzard Out\" Miss Eisner evidently watched closely, for she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer. Individuals, too, she has portrayed in portrait studies. Although there is some authentic quality of the South in these paintings, they incline toward drabness of color, and the figures have not enough animation to make them live in paint. Most successfully realized are several still-lifes. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\">{{cite news |title=The Etchings of Georges Rouault |author=Edward Alden Jewell |work=New York Times |location=New York, New York |date=1933-05-07 |page=X8 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\">{{cite news |title=Henry V.

Eisner relished involving herself in the local art scene. In New York, she exhibited broadly and worked tirelessly to further the careers of her fellow artists.

As a child, she won local children's drawing contests and in her teens attended a school, [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]], known for its arts instruction.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> Between 1924 and 1929 she studied at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] where she worked under [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the summer months she traveled to Europe and during one of these trips studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> She had one additional period of training in the late 1940s when she learned techniques of abstraction and expressionism from [[Jack Tworkov]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\n==Career in art==\n\nWhen she was not traveling, Eisner lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and rented a studio on Cornelia Street.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/><ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> In 1930 she contributed a still life in a group show at the Opportunity Gallery that also included works by [[Edith Hamlin]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1930\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of collectors along with the artist Gifford Beal set up the nonprofit Opportunity Gallery in the fall of 1927.<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\"/> Each exhibition was selected by a well-known artist with the overall goal of showing new talent in a wide range of artistic styles.<ref name=\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Nov 1927\"/> [[Mark Rothko]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] all showed at the gallery during its early years.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Gallery\"/> }} Throughout the rest of the decade her paintings appeared frequently in shows held by nonprofit organizations, including Salons of America (1931, 1932, 1933), the [[Society of Independent Artists]] (1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937), the [[College Art Association]] (traveling exhibitions in 1932 and 1933), the [[National Association of Women Artists|National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]] (annually, 1933 to 1939), the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (1934), and the [[New York Society of Women Artists]] (1935, 1936, 1938).<ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/>{{refn|group=note|In 1922 [[Hamilton Easter Field]] founded Salons of America to give artists an alternative to the Society of Independent Artists whose financial and publicity methods he found objectionable. A reporter said he aimed \"to give equal opportunity to every member, whether he or she be a conservative or a post-Dadaist.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Jul 1922\"/>}} In these large shows Eisner's paintings were regularly singled out for praise by New York critics. Thus, for example, in 1936 the ''New York Post'' critic noted her \"thorough and vigorous\" canvases.<ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/> In 1937 Edward Alden Jewell of the ''Times'' called attention to her free brushwork.<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1937\"/> In 1938, a ''Post'' critic called one of her paintings \"the outstanding canvas of the show.\"<ref name=\"New York Post Feb 1938\"/>\n\nIn 1932 the Morton Gallery mounted her first solo exhibition. In it, she showed paintings depicting life in the mountains of the [[Carolinas]].<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Critics responded favorably to the show. A review in the ''New York Post'' said she had technical facility and showed her subjects freshly and spontaneously.<ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/> Writing in the ''New York Sun'', a critic wrote that the paintings were social documents that revealed life in the southern mountains in a way that was \"vastly entertaining.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/> A critic for the ''New York Times'' noticed that Eisner showed more interest in the people she encountered than in the scenic environment in which they passed their lives and concluded that \"she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/>  Her depiction of a fiddler drew attention in both the ''Sun'' and the ''Times''. Late in life, a contemporary of Eisner's, [[Joseph Solman]], said of the [[Social realism|social realist]] style of the time: \"We were all seeking the flat, and the exaggerated, and the expressionist in our own romantic, different ways.\"<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\"/>\n\nTwo years later the Delphic Studio gave Eisner and Grace Bliss Stewart a duo exhibition. On this occasion the ''New York Sun'' featured a photo of another Carolina mountains painting, \"Franklin's View.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/>{{refn|group=note|Journalist and art patron [[Alma Reed]] founded Delphic Studios in 1929. Mainly known for its emphasis on Mexican art, the gallery also showed photographers, such as [[Edward Weston]] and [[Ansel Adams]] as well as Eisner and other contemporary American artists.<ref name=\"Delphic Studio\"/> }} The ''Sun'''s critic, who found her work to be on the whole \"attractive,\" used the label \"communist\" as shorthand for Eisner's social realist style in her mountain paintings. The critic said, \"[she] paints citizens who have a good deal of the soil upon their clothes.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Howard Devree of the ''New York Times'' said the paintings showed increased strength and sureness and praised her use of warm reds in a generally low palette.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/>\n\n[[File:1937DeweyCommission.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Dewey Commission, 1937, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\nIn the late 1930s Eisner exhibited as a member of a [[popular front]] organization called the [[American Artists' Congress]].<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1937\"/> After the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] in 1940 she and a small group of like-minded artists quit the Congress to found an avowedly non-political organization called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"Federation of modern painters and sculptors 2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of New York artists formed the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in the spring of 1940.

Its principal goal was to promote artistic independence and its members adhered to no specific style or school of painting. By means of exhibitions, publications, and lectures it set itself to promote the \"general interest of contemporary art.\" In addition to Eisner and her sister Anne, founding members included [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Anne Goldthwaite]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Balcomb Greene]], and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1942\"/> }} In 1937 Eisner and her husband traveled to Mexico to help the [[Dewey Commission]] investigate charges leveled against [[Leon Trotsky]] by the Soviet government in the [[Moscow Trials]] of 1936\u20131937. Eisner made a painting of commission members interviewing Trotsky in a house on the outskirts of Mexico City owned by Rivera and [[Frida Kahlo]]. The painting (shown at left) contains a view of [[Diego Rivera]] who is making a sketch of the scene.<ref name=\"Trotsky Commission Painting\"/> She also made two portraits of Trotsky. The two of them joked about a time when she scraped off pigment in painting his face. He made an affectionate, albeit macabre joke that she was beheading him.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> This painting is shown in the photo of Trotsky and Eisner at top right.\n\nAfter World War II Eisner traveled widely with her husband. His work as a journalist for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine and his passion for fishing helped to determine the locations they visited. In 1947 they spent time on [[Cape Breton Island]] and, beginning in 1949 they started to make periodic visits to [[Livingston, Montana]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Returning from Montana in the early 1950s, Eisner began a short period of study with [[Jack Tworkov]] in New York.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/>{{refn|group=note|Tworkov taught art throughout much of his career. In the early 1930s he taught briefly at the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]] in Manhattan. Between 1948 and 1958 he was a part-time instructor at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] and [[Pratt Institute]]. He was also at one time an instructor at [[Black Mountain College]] and in the 1960s taught at the [[Yale School of Art]], becoming chair of the art department in 1963.<ref name=\"Tworkov Papers AAA\"/> }} In 1960 she and her husband began spending summer months on [[Great Cranberry Island]].<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\"/>\n\nDuring these years and continuing into the 1970s she continued exhibiting with the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/><ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/> During this period she also continued to be given solo exhibitions in New York commercial galleries. In 1961 she was given a solo exhibition at the James Gallery and in 1966 and in 1969 at the Cisneros Gallery.<ref name=\"New York Times Feb 1961\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1966\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1969\"/>\n\nAfter her death in 1984 she was given a succession of retrospective exhibitions. These included the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]] (1992, \"Dorothy Eisner: Paintings and Collages\"), Acme Fine Art (Boston, 2005, \"Late Expressionist Paintings,\" and 2009, \"Dorothy Eisner on Cranberry Island\"), [[Ogunquit Museum of American Art|Ogunquit Museum]] (2008, Cranberry Island paintings), and Gleason Fine Art (Boothbay Harbor Maine, 2017).<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/><ref name=\"Boothbay Register May 2017\"/> In 2009 her work also appeared in an exhibition called \"The Art of the Cranberry Isles\" in the [[Portland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News Mar 2009\"/>\n\n===Positions in art organizations===\n\nEisner immersed herself in the art world while still young. In 1930, aged twenty-four, she joined the board of the Society of Independent Artists. Not long afterward she became a member of the American Artists' Congress, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the New York Society of Women Artists. As noted above, she was a founding member of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in 1941.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> It seems likely that her marriage, the war, and the birth of a daughter (1942) dampened the impulse to participate in other organizations.\n\n===Artistic style===\n[[File:1931FiddlersConvention.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Fiddlers' Convention, about 1931, black and white photographic print of an oil painting, 9 x 7 inches]]\n[[File:1958YellowstoneRiver.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Yellowstone River, about 1958, oil on canvas, 44 x 36 inches]]\n\nIn reviewing shows of the paintings she made in the 1930s, critics noticed that when choosing subjects Eisner favored people over scenery.<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Two of them saw these paintings as lively and entertaining social documents having an authentic quality.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Others pointed out a muted palette and a tendency to drabness along with strong composition, ability to develop a subject freshly and spontaneously, and overall vigor and thoroughness.<ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/> For example, a critic for the ''New York Sun'' said Eisner painted her subjects \"roughly, but with a curious instinct for balance that makes the panels, as a whole, attractive.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Writing in the ''New York Times'' Howard Devree noted Eisner's skill in delineating subjects convincingly and praised her growing strength and sureness.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/> The painting, \"Fiddlers' Convention\" (shown at left) was mentioned as typical of her better 1930s work.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> In 1934 it was reproduced in an article in the ''Philadelphia Record'' reviewing the Pennsylvania Academy's 129th annual exhibition.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\nEisner's style changed little during the 1930s and war years. During the post-war period, while most of her work remained realist, she began to study under [[Jack Tworkov]]. Although much [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painting was then anti-figurative, Tworkov, like his friend [[Willem de Kooning]], believed that even so-called pure abstraction made, as he said, \"analogy to the figure.\" His obituary in the ''New York Times'' quoted him as saying \"Every painter has a subject whether or not there are objects in his paintings.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Sep 1982\"/> Eisner responded sympathetically to this approach. Later she was quoted as saying, \"Abstract Expressionism made me think differently. I learned from it a language of shapes and color that I was not conscious of when I was young.\"<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> During this period she produced much work in regular visits to the American [[mountain states]], particularly Livingston, Montana, and nearby [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Her painting \"Yellowstone River\" (seen at right) shows the influence of Tworkov's instruction. While it might be taken as a pure abstraction, the title shows it to be an abstract representation of a real place.\n\n[[File:1965PortraitInLight.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Portrait in Light, 1965, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\n[[File:1981InteriorStillLife.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Interior Still Life, 1981, oil on canvas, 24 x 30 inches]] \nIn 1960, when Eisner and her husband began spending summers on Great Cranberry Island, her work showed a new [[figurative art|figurative]] style. She often showed people relaxing and engaging in vacation-time pursuits: playing cards or croquet. Just as often her subjects would be inanimate: desks, chairs, windows, a towel rack. Writing in 2008 concerning a retrospective exhibition that showed these paintings, a critic said, \"her subject matter is so seemingly mundane that the viewer is startled by her choice.\"<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/> Although abstract, her style was firmly grounded in specific places at specific times, and its realist subjects were clearly evident. She made expressionistic use of bold colors, as she had in her 1950s abstractions, but in a style that critics saw as fluid, masterfully composed, and expressionistic.<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/> A critic said the paintings she made on Cranberry Island were orderly, distinct, and painted with great spirit.<ref name=\"Portland Press Herald Oct 2008\"/>\n\nAn early painting from this period, \"Portrait in Light\" (shown at left), has a greater degree of abstraction than a painting, \"Interior Still Life\" (shown at right) made only three years before her death. The latter work seems to show an influence of Matisse that critics saw in her work from the time she spent studying at Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> From its inception in the 1930s through to its culmination in the late paintings, Eisner's output maintained a consistency that a gallerist summarized as derived from European modernism but also grounded in American painting of her own generation and the generation before her.<ref name=\"Gleason Fine Art\"/>\n\n==Personal life and family==\n\nEisner was born in New York on January 17, 1906.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Her father was William J. Eisner. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1880 and died in New York in 1975.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Orphaned while still young, he left school at 13 and later became one of the first makers of wax paper in the United States. Having moved to New York he was for many years president of a business called the Newark Paraffin and Parchment Paper Co.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/> Eisner's mother was Florine Eisner (1883-1974). Florine's father's name was Moritz Eisner. Born in Austria, he studied to be a chemist and after emigrating to the United States founded a business called Eisner-Mendelson Company that sold a malt extract and other health products.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1938\"/> After her marriage in 1905, Florine Eisner's maiden and married surnames were the same.\n\nEisner had a sister, [[Anne Eisner Putnam]] (1911-1967), who followed in her sister's footsteps. She studied at the Art Students League and served on its board of directors. She showed professionally during the 1940s with the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. After her marriage to Patrick Putnam she lived in the [[Ituri Rainforest]] within the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Belgian Congo]] in a campsite adjacent to pygmies of the  [[Mbuti people]]. Patrick Putnam, who had an unpaid position as ''agent sanitaire'', ran an informal dispensary and anthropological laboratory. For eight years Anne Eisner Putnam operated a small collection of guest houses from which she rented out rooms to visitors so as to support her husband's work.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Jun 1956\"/> Following Patrick's death in 1953 she returned to New York where she published a book, ''Madami: My Eight Years of Adventure with the Congo Pygmies'', describing her experiences and celebrating the Mbuti culture which she deeply respected.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Dec 1954\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s Florine Eisner (1883-1974) followed the example set by both daughters by studying at the Art Students League. Using Florine Rensie as her name, she joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and became a professional artist (Rensie is Eisner spelled backward).<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> After he retired from business in the early 1950s, William J. Eisner joined the rest of the family in studying art and becoming a professional artist.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nWilliam and Florine raised their family in Manhattan. During the warm months of the year they frequently traveled to their country home in Woodstock, New York and, after the children had grown they followed the example they had set and both became serious artists. William exhibited under his own name in galleries in nearby Kingston, New York, while Florine adopted Florine Rensie as her professional name to avoid the appearance of capitalizing on her daughters' artistic successes .<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nEarly in the 1930s Eisner worked in New York for the [[Resettlement Administration]]. In 1935 she met her future husband, [[John McDonald (journalist)|John Dennis McDonald]] (1906-1998), who was then working for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and in 1936 they married.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a master's degree in literature and subsequently immersed himself in the socialist politics of the 1930s, particularly the [[anti-Stalinist left]]. In 1937 he joined the [[Dewey Commission]] as a technical assistant. He and Eisner traveled to Mexico with the commission staff. Chaired by the philosopher [[John Dewey]], the commission aimed to provide [[Leon Trotsky]] with a fair hearing of the charges made against him in the [[Moscow trials|Soviet show trials]] of 1936. While they opposed Stalinism, he and Eisner, like most members of the commission, were not themselves [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the latter part of the 1930s, McDonald worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in Washington, D.C.

Writers have been far in advance of artists in discovering the possibilities of subject-matter in this section. It is not the beauties of mountain landscape that have attracted Miss Eisner, but rather the individuality of people and the interest of their pastimes. A \"Fiddlers' Convention\" and a dance called \"Bird in Buzzard Out\" Miss Eisner evidently watched closely, for she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer. Individuals, too, she has portrayed in portrait studies. Although there is some authentic quality of the South in these paintings, they incline toward drabness of color, and the figures have not enough animation to make them live in paint. Most successfully realized are several still-lifes. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\">{{cite news |title=The Etchings of Georges Rouault |author=Edward Alden Jewell |work=New York Times |location=New York, New York |date=1933-05-07 |page=X8 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\">{{cite news |title=Henry V.

The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] and [[Outlaw Posse]] developed a jazz influenced style, whilst MC Mell'O' mixed [[jazz]] and hardcore. [[London Posse]], [[Black Radical Mk II]] and DJ Ruf Cut And Tuf C were more influenced by [[reggae]] and [[disco]] whilst the [[Wee Papa Girl Rappers]], [[Cookie Crew]] and [[Monie Love]] achieved chart success with more radio friendly hip hop.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan whom specialise in UK Hiphop/boombap. Notable artists influenced by the boombap sound included the likes of [[Chester P]], [[Rodney P]], [[Braintax]], [[Blak Twang]], [[DanimaL]], [[Lewis Parker (musician)]] and [[Blak Twang|Blak Twang.]] At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Notable grime acts include [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], [[Shystie]], [[Ghetts]] and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Grime music saw some early success in America with Wiley, Kano and Dizzee Rascal, all releasing music across the atlantic. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|title=Deeper Than Rap: Grime is Not a Subgenre of Hip-Hop|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914112019/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|title=Skepta, grime and urban British youth language: a guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The Conversation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008174156/http://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|archive-date=8 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|title=Grime is Approaching the Breakthrough Moment Hip-Hop Reached in the 90s|last=|first=|date=2016-12-21|website=Vice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105013003/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|archive-date=5 November 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":05\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|title=Grime time: What it is and where to find it|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025044957/https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"complex2\">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/06/hip-hop-dancehall-breaking-down-the-origins-of-grime/dizzee-talks-hip-hop-rosenberg|title=Hip-Hop Or Dancehall?

These rappers strived to bring attention to both positivity and lyricism as well as the injustices of war, gentrification and racism, following in the tradition of conscious rappers such as [[Nas]], [[Mos Def]] and [[Talib Kweli]]. Amongst this new generation included artists such as [[Klashnekoff]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lowkey]] and the Poisonous Poets. \n\nThe mid-2000s saw the emergence of Road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes.

Loud, [[M Huncho]], Nafe Smallz, K-Trap, and [[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz) plus many more. Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre. Many of them talk about braggadocious lifestyles they live and how it affects their music. In several interviews before, [[M Huncho]] has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK [[trap music]], in a genre he has personally dubbed as \"trapwave\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|work=A Nation Of Billions|title=Welcome To The TrapWave: M Huncho|date=29 May 2018|access-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604120145/https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolverhampton artist [[Scarlxrd]] implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as \"[[Rap metal#Trap metal|trap-metal]]\" or \"ragecore\"; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals. Scarlxrd has cited some of his main inspirations and influences as including the likes of [[Eminem]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Travi$ Scott]] and [[Linkin Park]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|work=Kerrang|title=SCARLXRD: \"BRING ME THE HORIZON\u2019S LEGACY INSPIRES ME\"|date=27 February 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806082026/https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|work=XXL|title=Scarlxrd Ditches YouTuber Lifestyle and His Black Mask for Screamo Success|date=25 May 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519003815/https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSgIYzwOYw|work=PopkillerTV|title=SCARLXRD \u2013 interview: \"My style is a mix of Eminem, Travis Scott and Slipknot\" (05.2018) \u2013 YouTube|date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNotable British trap artists and groups include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[D-Block Europe]]\n*[[Fredo (rapper)|Fredo]]\n*[[M Huncho]]\n*[[Octavian (rapper)|Octavian]]\n*[[Scarlxrd]]\n*[[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz)\n*[[Smoke Boys]] (formerly Section Boyz)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Backlash against commercialisation==\nSince grime's post-millennial boom period coincided with UK hip-hop's, the eagerly anticipated commercial breakout of the latter did not happen. Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of 'selling out' from the underground community.<ref>{{cite news|title=British hip-hop heads out of the underground|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215230/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nThe growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]] devoted to \"new black music\" including hip hop, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[UK garage]], [[dancehall]], [[Grime music|grime]] and drum and bass,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |title=BBC Website: 1xtra |accessdate=1 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104060217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop. The cable and satellite channel, Channel AKA (formerly Channel U, now known as [[Now 70s]]) also had the profile of British hip hop and grime.\nYouTube was also a very important outlet for upcoming and significant artists.

Unlike in the US, the British hip hop scene was cross-racial from the beginning, as various ethnic groups in Britain tend not to live in segregated areas, even in areas with a high percentage of non-white individuals. Such places allow youth to share culture with one another, including musical genres such as hip hop.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom\", pp. 86\u2013101 in Global Noise: Rap and Hip Hop Outside of the USA, edited by Tony Mitchell.

The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] and [[Outlaw Posse]] developed a jazz influenced style, whilst MC Mell'O' mixed [[jazz]] and hardcore. [[London Posse]], [[Black Radical Mk II]] and DJ Ruf Cut And Tuf C were more influenced by [[reggae]] and [[disco]] whilst the [[Wee Papa Girl Rappers]], [[Cookie Crew]] and [[Monie Love]] achieved chart success with more radio friendly hip hop.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Notable grime acts include [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], [[Shystie]], [[Ghetts]] and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Grime music saw some early success in America with Wiley, Kano and Dizzee Rascal, all releasing music across the atlantic. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|title=Deeper Than Rap: Grime is Not a Subgenre of Hip-Hop|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914112019/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|title=Skepta, grime and urban British youth language: a guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The Conversation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008174156/http://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|archive-date=8 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|title=Grime is Approaching the Breakthrough Moment Hip-Hop Reached in the 90s|last=|first=|date=2016-12-21|website=Vice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105013003/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|archive-date=5 November 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":05\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|title=Grime time: What it is and where to find it|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025044957/https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"complex2\">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/06/hip-hop-dancehall-breaking-down-the-origins-of-grime/dizzee-talks-hip-hop-rosenberg|title=Hip-Hop Or Dancehall?

Amongst this new generation included artists such as [[Klashnekoff]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lowkey]] and the Poisonous Poets. \n\nThe mid-2000s saw the emergence of Road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes.

Loud, [[M Huncho]], Nafe Smallz, K-Trap, and [[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz) plus many more. Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre. Many of them talk about braggadocious lifestyles they live and how it affects their music. In several interviews before, [[M Huncho]] has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK [[trap music]], in a genre he has personally dubbed as \"trapwave\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|work=A Nation Of Billions|title=Welcome To The TrapWave: M Huncho|date=29 May 2018|access-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604120145/https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolverhampton artist [[Scarlxrd]] implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as \"[[Rap metal#Trap metal|trap-metal]]\" or \"ragecore\"; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals. Scarlxrd has cited some of his main inspirations and influences as including the likes of [[Eminem]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Travi$ Scott]] and [[Linkin Park]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|work=Kerrang|title=SCARLXRD: \"BRING ME THE HORIZON\u2019S LEGACY INSPIRES ME\"|date=27 February 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806082026/https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|work=XXL|title=Scarlxrd Ditches YouTuber Lifestyle and His Black Mask for Screamo Success|date=25 May 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519003815/https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSgIYzwOYw|work=PopkillerTV|title=SCARLXRD \u2013 interview: \"My style is a mix of Eminem, Travis Scott and Slipknot\" (05.2018) \u2013 YouTube|date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNotable British trap artists and groups include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[D-Block Europe]]\n*[[Fredo (rapper)|Fredo]]\n*[[M Huncho]]\n*[[Octavian (rapper)|Octavian]]\n*[[Scarlxrd]]\n*[[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz)\n*[[Smoke Boys]] (formerly Section Boyz)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Backlash against commercialisation==\nSince grime's post-millennial boom period coincided with UK hip-hop's, the eagerly anticipated commercial breakout of the latter did not happen. Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of 'selling out' from the underground community.<ref>{{cite news|title=British hip-hop heads out of the underground|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215230/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nThe growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]] devoted to \"new black music\" including hip hop, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[UK garage]], [[dancehall]], [[Grime music|grime]] and drum and bass,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |title=BBC Website: 1xtra |accessdate=1 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104060217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop. The cable and satellite channel, Channel AKA (formerly Channel U, now known as [[Now 70s]]) also had the profile of British hip hop and grime.\nYouTube was also a very important outlet for upcoming and significant artists.
