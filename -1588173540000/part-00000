Potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position [[transducer]]s, for example, in a [[joystick]]. Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant power (more than a [[watt]]), since the power dissipated in the potentiometer would be comparable to the power in the controlled load.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThere are a number of terms in the electronics industry used to describe certain types of potentiometers:\n\n* '''slide pot''' or '''slider pot''': a potentiometer that is adjusted by sliding the wiper left or right (or up and down, depending on the installation), usually with a finger or thumb\n* '''thumb pot''' or '''thumbwheel pot''': a small rotating potentiometer meant to be adjusted infrequently by means of a small thumbwheel\n* '''trimpot''' or '''trimmer pot''': a [[Trimmer (electronics)|trimmer]] potentiometer typically meant to be adjusted once or infrequently for \"fine-tuning\" an electrical signal\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:Potentiometer cutaway drawing.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Drawing of potentiometer with case cut away, showing parts: (''A'') shaft, (''B'') stationary carbon composition resistance element, (''C'') phosphor bronze wiper, (''D'') shaft attached to wiper, (''E, G'') terminals connected to ends of resistance element, (''F'') terminal connected to wiper. A mechanical stop (''H'') prevents rotation past end points.]]\n[[File:Single-turn potentiometer with internals exposed, oblique view.jpg|thumb|Single-turn potentiometer with metal casing removed to expose wiper contacts and resistive track]]\n\nPotentiometers consist of a [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistive element]], a sliding contact (wiper) that moves along the element, making good electrical contact with one part of it, electrical terminals at each end of the element, a mechanism that moves the wiper from one end to the other, and a housing containing the element and wiper.\n\nSee drawing. Many inexpensive potentiometers are constructed with a resistive element (B) formed into an arc of a circle usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper (C) sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled.  Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal (E, G) on the case.  The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two.  On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the center terminal of three. For single-turn potentiometers, this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.\n\nAnother type is the linear slider potentiometer, which has a wiper which slides along a linear element instead of rotating. Contamination can potentially enter anywhere along the slot the slider moves in, making effective sealing more difficult and compromising long-term reliability. An advantage of the slider potentiometer is that the slider position gives a visual indication of its setting. While the setting of a rotary potentiometer can be seen by the position of a marking on the knob, an array of sliders can give a visual impression of, for example, the effect of a multi-band [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]] (hence the term \"graphic equalizer\").\n\nThe resistive element of inexpensive potentiometers is often made of [[graphite]]. Other materials used include resistance wire, carbon particles in plastic, and a ceramic/metal mixture called [[cermet]].\nConductive track potentiometers use conductive polymer resistor pastes that contain hard-wearing resins and polymers, solvents, and lubricant, in addition to the carbon that provides the conductive properties.\n\n[[File:12 surface mount potentiometers.jpg|thumb|PCB mount [[trimmer (electronics)|trimmer]] potentiometers, or \"trimpots\", intended for infrequent adjustment]]\n\n[[File:Pre-Set Potentiometer.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Electronic symbol for pre-set potentiometer]]\n\nMultiturn potentiometers are also operated by rotating a shaft, but by several turns rather than less than a full turn. Some multiturn potentiometers have a linear resistive element with a sliding contact moved by a lead screw; others have a [[Helix|helical]] resistive element and a wiper that turns through 10, 20, or more complete revolutions, moving along the helix as it rotates. Multiturn potentiometers, both user-accessible and preset, allow finer adjustments; rotation through the same angle changes the setting by typically a tenth as much as for a simple rotary potentiometer.\n\nA [[string potentiometer]] is a multi-turn potentiometer operated by an attached reel of wire turning against a spring, enabling it to convert linear position to a variable resistance.\n\nUser-accessible rotary potentiometers can be fitted with a switch which operates usually at the anti-clockwise extreme of rotation. Before digital electronics became the norm such a component was used to allow radio and television receivers and other equipment to be switched on at minimum volume with an audible click, then the volume increased, by turning a knob. Multiple resistance elements can be ganged together with their sliding contacts on the same shaft, for example, in stereo audio amplifiers for volume control. In other applications, such as domestic light [[dimmer]]s, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.\n\nOthers are enclosed within the equipment and are intended to be adjusted to calibrate equipment during manufacture or repair, and not otherwise touched. They are usually physically much smaller than user-accessible potentiometers, and may need to be operated by a screwdriver rather than having a knob. They are usually called \"preset potentiometers\" or \"trim[ming] pots\". Some presets are accessible by a small screwdriver poked through a hole in the case to allow servicing without dismantling.\n\n=== Resistance\u2013position relationship: \"taper\" ===\n[[File:Pots 10k 100k.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Size scaled 10k and 100k pots that combine traditional mountings and knob shafts with newer and smaller electrical assemblies. Note the \"B\" designating a linear (USA/Asian style) taper.]]\n\nThe relationship between slider position and resistance, known as the \"taper\" or \"law\", is controlled by the manufacturer. In principle any relationship is possible, but for most purposes [[linear]] or [[logarithm]]ic (aka \"audio taper\") potentiometers are sufficient.\n\nA letter code may be used to identify which taper is used, but the letter code definitions are not standardized. Potentiometers made in Asia and the USA are usually marked with an \"A\" for logarithmic taper or a \"B\" for linear taper; \"C\" for the rarely seen reverse logarithmic taper. Others, particularly those from Europe, may be marked with an \"A\" for linear taper, a \"C\" or \"B\" for logarithmic taper, or an \"F\" for reverse logarithmic taper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resistor Guide|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/potentiometer/|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref> The code used also varies between different manufacturers. When a percentage is referenced with a non-linear taper, it relates to the resistance value at the midpoint of the shaft rotation.  A 10% log taper would therefore measure 10% of the total resistance at the midpoint of the rotation; i.e. 10% log taper on a 10&nbsp;kOhm potentiometer would yield 1&nbsp;kOhm at the midpoint. The higher the percentage, the steeper the log curve.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elliot|first=Rod|title=Beginners' Guide to Potentiometers|url=http://sound.whsites.net/pots.htm#markings|publisher=Elliott Sound Products|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Linear taper potentiometer ====\nA ''linear taper potentiometer'' (''linear'' describes the electrical characteristic of the device, not the geometry of the resistive element) has a resistive element of constant cross-section, resulting in a device where the resistance between the contact (wiper) and one end terminal is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the distance between them.  Linear taper potentiometers<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Phillip|title=Linear Type Precision Potentiometer Diagram|url=http://www.betatronix.com/uploads/2010%20SERIES.pdf|website=Precision Sensors|publisher=Betatronix|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> are used when the division ratio of the potentiometer must be proportional to the angle of shaft rotation (or slider position), for example, controls used for adjusting the centering of the display on an analog cathode-ray [[oscilloscope]]. Precision potentiometers have an accurate relationship between resistance and slider position. [[File:Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A 2007.075.002.jpg|thumb|[[Arnold Orville Beckman|Beckman]] Helipot precision potentiometer]]\n\n==== Logarithmic potentiometer ====\nA ''logarithmic taper potentiometer'' is a potentiometer that has a bias built into the resistive element. Basically this means the center position of the potentiometer is not one half of the total value of the potentiometer. The resistive element is designed to follow a logarithmic taper, aka a mathematical exponent or \"squared\" profile. \nA logarithmic taper potentiometer is constructed with a resistive element that either \"tapers\" in from one end to the other, or is made from a material whose resistivity varies from one end to the other.  This results in a device where output voltage is a logarithmic function of the slider position.\n\nMost (cheaper) \"log\" potentiometers are not accurately logarithmic, but use two regions of different resistance (but constant resistivity) to approximate a logarithmic law. The two resistive tracks overlap at approximately 50% of the potentiometer rotation; this gives a stepwise logarithmic taper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Potentiometer taper|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/potentiometer-taper/|publisher=the Resistor Guide|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> A logarithmic potentiometer can also be simulated (not very accurately) with a linear one and an external resistor.  True logarithmic potentiometers are significantly more expensive.\n\nLogarithmic taper potentiometers are often used for volume or signal level in audio systems, as human perception of audio volume is [[Weber\u2013Fechner law|logarithmic]].\n\n== Rheostat ==\n{{see also|Liquid rheostat}}\nThe most common way to vary the resistance in a circuit is to use a '''rheostat'''. The word ''rheostat'' was coined about 1845 by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]], from the Greek {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ''rheos'' meaning \"stream\", and -{{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}} -''states'' (from {{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9}} ''histanai'', \" to set, to cause to stand\") meaning \"setter, regulating device\",<ref>Brian Bowers (ed.), ''Sir Charles Wheatstone FRS: 1802-1875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0-85296-103-0}} pp.104-105</ref><ref>{{OED|stat}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|r(e/os|\u1fe5\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}}, {{LSJ|i(/sthmi|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9|ref}}.</ref> which is a two-terminal variable resistor. The term \"rheostat\" is becoming obsolete,<ref name=\"From Rheostat to Potentiometer\">{{cite web|last1=Dolan|first1=Alexander|title=Potentiometer History and Terminology|url=http://sensor-journal.com/|website=Sensor Journal|publisher=Journal of Sensor History|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> with the general term \"potentiometer\" replacing it.  For low-power applications (less than about 1 watt) a three-terminal potentiometer is often used, with one terminal unconnected or connected to the wiper.\n\nWhere the rheostat must be rated for higher power (more than about 1 watt), it may be built with a resistance wire wound around a semicircular insulator,  with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a heat-resisting cylinder, with the slider made from a number of metal fingers that grip lightly onto a small portion of the turns of resistance wire. The \"fingers\" can be moved along the coil of resistance wire by a sliding knob thus changing the \"tapping\" point.  Wire-wound rheostats made with ratings up to several thousand watts are used in applications such as DC motor drives, electric welding controls, or in the controls for generators. The rating of the rheostat is given with the full resistance value and the allowable power dissipation is proportional to the fraction of the total device resistance in circuit.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Wheatstone Rheostat 1.png|[[Charles Wheatstone]]'s 1843 rheostat with a metal and a wooden cylinder\nFile:Wheatstone Rheostat 2.png|Charles Wheatstone's 1843 rheostat with a moving whisker\nFile:RheostatSymbol.png|Electronic symbol for rheostat\nFile:PreSetRheostatSymbol.png|Electronic symbol for pre-set rheostat\nFile:pot1.jpg|A high-power wirewound potentiometer\n</gallery>\n\n== Digital potentiometer ==\n{{main article|Digital potentiometer}}\nA digital potentiometer (often called digipot) is an electronic component that mimics the functions of analog potentiometers.  Through digital input signals, the resistance between two terminals can be adjusted, just as in an analog potentiometer. There are two main functional types: volatile, which lose their set position if power is removed, and are usually designed to initialise at the minimum position, and non-volatile, which retain their set position using a storage mechanism similar to [[flash memory]] or [[EEPROM]].\n\nUsage of a digipot is far more complex than that of a simple mechanical potentiometer, and there are many limitations to observe; nevertheless they are widely used, often for factory adjustment and calibration of equipment, especially where the limitations of mechanical potentiometers are problematic. A digipot is generally immune to the effects of moderate long-term mechanical vibration or environmental contamination, to the same extent as other semiconductor devices, and can be secured electronically against unauthorised tampering by protecting the access to its programming inputs by various means.\n\nIn equipment which has a [[microprocessor]], [[FPGA]] or other functional logic which can store settings and reload them to the \"potentiometer\" every time the equipment is powered up, a multiplying [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] can be used in place of a digipot, and this can offer higher setting resolution, less drift with temperature, and more operational flexibility.\n\n== Membrane potentiometers ==\nA membrane potentiometer uses a conductive membrane that is deformed by a sliding element to contact a resistor voltage divider. Linearity can range from 0.50% to 5% depending on the material, design and manufacturing process. The repeat accuracy is typically between 0.1&nbsp;mm and 1.0&nbsp;mm with a theoretically infinite resolution.  The service life of these types of potentiometers is typically 1 million to 20 million cycles depending on the materials used during manufacturing and the actuation method; contact and contactless (magnetic) methods are available (to sense position). Many different material variations are available such as [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], FR4, and Kapton. Membrane potentiometer manufacturers offer linear, rotary, and application-specific variations. The linear versions can range from 9&nbsp;mm to 1000&nbsp;mm in length and the rotary versions range from 0\u00b0 to multiple full turns, with each having a height of 0.5&nbsp;mm. Membrane potentiometers can be used for position sensing.<ref>\n[http://www.designworldonline.com/articles/5903/260/Membrane-Potentiometers-Simplify-Position-Sensing.aspx Membrane Potentiometer White Paper]</ref>\n\nFor touch-screen devices using resistive technology, a two-dimensional membrane potentiometer provides x and y coordinates. The top layer is thin glass spaced close to a neighboring inner layer. The underside of the top layer has a transparent conductive coating; the surface of the layer beneath it has a transparent resistive coating. A finger or stylus deforms the glass to contact the underlying layer. Edges of the resistive layer have conductive contacts.\nLocating the contact point is done by applying a voltage to opposite edges, leaving the other two edges temporarily unconnected. The voltage of the top layer provides one coordinate. Disconnecting those two edges, and applying voltage to the other two, formerly unconnected, provides the other coordinate. Alternating rapidly between pairs of edges provides frequent position updates. An analog-to digital converter provides output data.\n\nAdvantages of such sensors are that only five connections to the sensor are needed, and the associated electronics is comparatively simple. Another is that any material that depresses the top layer over a small area works well. A disadvantage is that sufficient force must be applied to make contact. Another is that the sensor requires occasional calibration to match touch location to the underlying display. (Capacitive sensors require no calibration or contact force, only proximity of a finger or other conductive object. However, they are significantly more complex.)\n\n== Applications ==\nPotentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant amounts of power (more than a watt or so). Instead they are used to adjust the level of analog signals (for example [[loudness|volume]] controls on [[audio equipment]]), and as control inputs for electronic circuits. For example, a light [[dimmer]] uses a potentiometer to control the switching of a [[TRIAC]] and so indirectly to control the brightness of lamps.\n\nPreset potentiometers are widely used throughout electronics wherever adjustments must be made during manufacturing or servicing.\n\nUser-actuated potentiometers are widely used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of equipment functions. The widespread use of potentiometers in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with rotary [[incremental encoder]]s, up/down [[push-button]]s, and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors.\n\n=== Audio control ===\n[[File:Faders.jpg|thumb|right|Slide potentiometers ([[Fade (audio engineering)#Fader|faders]])]]\n\nLow-power potentiometers, both slide and rotary, are used to control audio equipment, changing loudness, frequency attenuation, and other characteristics of audio signals.\n\nThe 'log pot', that is, a potentiometer has a resistance, taper, or, \"curve\" (or law) of a logarithmic (log) form, is used as the volume control in [[audio power amplifier]]s, where it is also called an \"audio taper pot\", because the [[amplitude]] response of the human [[ear]] is approximately logarithmic. It ensures that on a volume control marked 0 to 10, for example, a setting of 5 sounds subjectively half as loud as a setting of 10. There is also an ''anti-log pot'' or ''reverse audio taper'' which is simply the reverse of a logarithmic potentiometer. It is almost always used in a ganged configuration with a logarithmic potentiometer, for instance, in an audio balance control.\n\nPotentiometers used in combination with filter networks act as [[Tone control circuit|tone controls]] or [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]].\n\nIn audio systems, the word linear, is sometimes applied in a confusing way to describe slide potentiometers because of the straight line nature of the physical sliding motion. The word linear when applied to a potentiometer regardless of being a slide or rotary type, describes a linear relationship of the pot's position versus the measured value of the pot's tap (wiper or electrical output) pin.\n\n=== Television ===\nPotentiometers were formerly used to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response.  A potentiometer was often used to adjust \"vertical hold\", which affected the synchronization between the receiver's internal sweep circuit (sometimes a [[multivibrator]]) and the received picture signal, along with other things such as audio-video carrier offset, tuning frequency (for push-button sets) and so on. It also helps in frequency modulation of waves.\n\n=== Motion control ===\nPotentiometers can be used as position feedback devices in order to create \"closed loop\" control, such as in a [[servomechanism]]. This method of motion control used in the DC Motor is the simplest method of measuring the angle, speed and displacement.\n\n=== Transducers ===\nPotentiometers  are also very widely used as a part of [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] [[transducer]]s because of the simplicity of construction and because they can give a large output signal.\n\n===Computation===\nIn [[analog computer]]s, high precision potentiometers are used to scale intermediate results by desired constant factors, or to set [[initial condition]]s for a calculation. A motor-driven potentiometer may be used as a [[function generator]], using a non-linear resistance card to supply approximations to trigonometric functions. For example, the shaft rotation might represent an angle, and the voltage division ratio can be made proportional to the cosine of the angle.\n\n== Theory of operation ==\n[[File:Potentiometer with load.svg|left|framed|A potentiometer with a resistive load, showing equivalent fixed resistors for clarity.]]\n\nThe potentiometer can be used as a [[voltage divider]] to obtain a manually adjustable output voltage at the slider (wiper) from a fixed input voltage applied across the two ends of the potentiometer. This is their most common use.\n\nThe voltage across {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} can be calculated by:\n<math display=\"block\">\nV_\\mathrm{L} = { R_2 R_\\mathrm{L} \\over R_1 R_\\mathrm{L} + R_2 R_\\mathrm{L} + R_1 R_2}\\cdot V_s.\n</math>\n\nIf {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} is large compared to the other resistances (like the input to an [[operational amplifier]]), the output voltage can be approximated by the simpler equation:\n<math display=\"block\">\nV_\\mathrm{L} = { R_2 \\over R_1 + R_2 }\\cdot V_s.\n</math>\n(dividing throughout by {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} and cancelling terms with {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} as denominator)\n\nAs an example, assume <math>V_\\mathrm{S} = 10\\ \\mathrm{V}</math>, <math>R_1 = 1\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega}</math>, <math>R_2 = 2\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega}</math>, and <math>R_\\mathrm{L} = 100\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega}.</math>\n\nSince the load resistance is large compared to the other resistances, the output voltage {{math|''V''<sub>L</sub>}} will be approximately:\n<math display=\"block\">\n{2\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega} \\over 1\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega} + 2\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega} } \\cdot 10\\ \\mathrm{V} = {2 \\over 3} \\cdot 10\\ \\mathrm{V} \\approx 6.667\\ \\mathrm{V}.\n</math>\n\nBecause of the load resistance, however, it will actually be slightly lower: {{math|\u2248 6.623 ''V''}}.\n\nOne of the advantages of the potential divider compared to a variable resistor in series with the source is that, while variable resistors have a maximum resistance where some [[current (electricity)|current]] will always flow, dividers are able to vary the output voltage from maximum ({{math|''V''<sub>S</sub>}}) to [[ground (electricity)|ground]] (zero volts) as the wiper moves from one end of the potentiometer to the other. There is, however, always a small amount of [[contact resistance]].\n\nIn addition, the load resistance is often not known and therefore simply placing a variable resistor in series with the load could have a negligible effect or an excessive effect, depending on the load.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Potentiometric sensor]]\n* [[Trimmer (electronics)|Trimmer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Potentiometers}}\n* [http://www.bourns.com/data/global/pdfs/OnlinePotentiometerHandbook.pdf .PDF edition of Carl David Todd (ed), \"The Potentiometer Handbook\",McGraw Hill, New York 1975] {{ISBN|0-07-006690-6}}\n* [http://sound.whsites.net/pots.htm Beginners' Guide to Potentiometers]\n* [http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electrical_Measurements/Potentiometer/Potentiometer.html Pictures of measuring potentiometers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050528085633/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/instruments/test/resistances.htm Electrical calibration equipment including various measurement potentiometers]\n*[http://www.geofex.com/Article_Folders/potsecrets/potscret.htm The Secret Life of Pots - Dissecting and repairing potentiometers]\n*[http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/projects/rheostat.html Making a rheostat]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-voltagedivider.htm Potentiometer calculations as voltage divider - loaded and open circuit (unloaded)]\n\n{{Electronic component}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Resistive components]]\n[[Category:Transducers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Type of resistor, usually with three terminals}}\n{{About|the electrical component|the measuring instrument|Potentiometer (measuring instrument)}}\n{{Infobox electronic component\n|name              = Potentiometer\n|image             = File:Electronic-Component-Potentiometer.jpg\n|image_size        = 220px\n|caption           = A typical single-turn potentiometer\n|type              = [[Passive component|Passive]]\n|working_principle = \n|invented          =\n|first_produced    = \n|symbol            = [[File:Potentiometer symbol Europe.svg|50px]] (IEC Standard)<br/>[[File:Potentiometer symbol.svg|50px]] (ANSI Standard)\n|pins              = \n}}\n\nA '''potentiometer''' is a three-[[terminal (electronics)|terminal]] [[resistor]] with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable [[voltage divider]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms (IEEE 100) | edition = seventh | publisher = IEEE Press | location = Piscataway, New Jersey | isbn = 0-7381-2601-2 | year = 2000 }}</ref> If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a '''variable resistor''' or '''rheostat'''.\n\nThe measuring instrument called a [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)|potentiometer]] is essentially a [[voltage divider]] used for measuring [[electric potential]] (voltage); the component is an implementation of the same principle, hence its name.\n\nPotentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment.

In other applications, such as domestic light [[dimmer]]s, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.\n\nOthers are enclosed within the equipment and are intended to be adjusted to calibrate equipment during manufacture or repair, and not otherwise touched. They are usually physically much smaller than user-accessible potentiometers, and may need to be operated by a screwdriver rather than having a knob. They are usually called \"preset potentiometers\" or \"trim[ming] pots\". Some presets are accessible by a small screwdriver poked through a hole in the case to allow servicing without dismantling.\n\n=== Resistance\u2013position relationship: \"taper\" ===\n[[File:Pots 10k 100k.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Size scaled 10k and 100k pots that combine traditional mountings and knob shafts with newer and smaller electrical assemblies. Note the \"B\" designating a linear (USA/Asian style) taper.]]\n\nThe relationship between slider position and resistance, known as the \"taper\" or \"law\", is controlled by the manufacturer. In principle any relationship is possible, but for most purposes [[linear]] or [[logarithm]]ic (aka \"audio taper\") potentiometers are sufficient.\n\nA letter code may be used to identify which taper is used, but the letter code definitions are not standardized. Potentiometers made in Asia and the USA are usually marked with an \"A\" for logarithmic taper or a \"B\" for linear taper; \"C\" for the rarely seen reverse logarithmic taper. Others, particularly those from Europe, may be marked with an \"A\" for linear taper, a \"C\" or \"B\" for logarithmic taper, or an \"F\" for reverse logarithmic taper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resistor Guide|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/potentiometer/|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref> The code used also varies between different manufacturers. When a percentage is referenced with a non-linear taper, it relates to the resistance value at the midpoint of the shaft rotation.  A 10% log taper would therefore measure 10% of the total resistance at the midpoint of the rotation; i.e. 10% log taper on a 10&nbsp;kOhm potentiometer would yield 1&nbsp;kOhm at the midpoint. The higher the percentage, the steeper the log curve.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elliot|first=Rod|title=Beginners' Guide to Potentiometers|url=http://sound.whsites.net/pots.htm#markings|publisher=Elliott Sound Products|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Linear taper potentiometer ====\nA ''linear taper potentiometer'' (''linear'' describes the electrical characteristic of the device, not the geometry of the resistive element) has a resistive element of constant cross-section, resulting in a device where the resistance between the contact (wiper) and one end terminal is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the distance between them.  Linear taper potentiometers<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Phillip|title=Linear Type Precision Potentiometer Diagram|url=http://www.betatronix.com/uploads/2010%20SERIES.pdf|website=Precision Sensors|publisher=Betatronix|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> are used when the division ratio of the potentiometer must be proportional to the angle of shaft rotation (or slider position), for example, controls used for adjusting the centering of the display on an analog cathode-ray [[oscilloscope]]. Precision potentiometers have an accurate relationship between resistance and slider position. [[File:Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A 2007.075.002.jpg|thumb|[[Arnold Orville Beckman|Beckman]] Helipot precision potentiometer]]\n\n==== Logarithmic potentiometer ====\nA ''logarithmic taper potentiometer'' is a potentiometer that has a bias built into the resistive element. Basically this means the center position of the potentiometer is not one half of the total value of the potentiometer. The resistive element is designed to follow a logarithmic taper, aka a mathematical exponent or \"squared\" profile. \nA logarithmic taper potentiometer is constructed with a resistive element that either \"tapers\" in from one end to the other, or is made from a material whose resistivity varies from one end to the other.  This results in a device where output voltage is a logarithmic function of the slider position.\n\nMost (cheaper) \"log\" potentiometers are not accurately logarithmic, but use two regions of different resistance (but constant resistivity) to approximate a logarithmic law. The two resistive tracks overlap at approximately 50% of the potentiometer rotation; this gives a stepwise logarithmic taper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Potentiometer taper|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/potentiometer-taper/|publisher=the Resistor Guide|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> A logarithmic potentiometer can also be simulated (not very accurately) with a linear one and an external resistor.  True logarithmic potentiometers are significantly more expensive.\n\nLogarithmic taper potentiometers are often used for volume or signal level in audio systems, as human perception of audio volume is [[Weber\u2013Fechner law|logarithmic]].\n\n== Rheostat ==\n{{see also|Liquid rheostat}}\nThe most common way to vary the resistance in a circuit is to use a '''rheostat'''. The word ''rheostat'' was coined about 1845 by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]], from the Greek {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ''rheos'' meaning \"stream\", and -{{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}} -''states'' (from {{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9}} ''histanai'', \" to set, to cause to stand\") meaning \"setter, regulating device\",<ref>Brian Bowers (ed.), ''Sir Charles Wheatstone FRS: 1802-1875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0-85296-103-0}} pp.104-105</ref><ref>{{OED|stat}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|r(e/os|\u1fe5\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}}, {{LSJ|i(/sthmi|\u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9|ref}}.</ref> which is a two-terminal variable resistor. The term \"rheostat\" is becoming obsolete,<ref name=\"From Rheostat to Potentiometer\">{{cite web|last1=Dolan|first1=Alexander|title=Potentiometer History and Terminology|url=http://sensor-journal.com/|website=Sensor Journal|publisher=Journal of Sensor History|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> with the general term \"potentiometer\" replacing it.  For low-power applications (less than about 1 watt) a three-terminal potentiometer is often used, with one terminal unconnected or connected to the wiper.\n\nWhere the rheostat must be rated for higher power (more than about 1 watt), it may be built with a resistance wire wound around a semicircular insulator,  with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a heat-resisting cylinder, with the slider made from a number of metal fingers that grip lightly onto a small portion of the turns of resistance wire. The \"fingers\" can be moved along the coil of resistance wire by a sliding knob thus changing the \"tapping\" point.  Wire-wound rheostats made with ratings up to several thousand watts are used in applications such as DC motor drives, electric welding controls, or in the controls for generators. The rating of the rheostat is given with the full resistance value and the allowable power dissipation is proportional to the fraction of the total device resistance in circuit.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Wheatstone Rheostat 1.png|[[Charles Wheatstone]]'s 1843 rheostat with a metal and a wooden cylinder\nFile:Wheatstone Rheostat 2.png|Charles Wheatstone's 1843 rheostat with a moving whisker\nFile:RheostatSymbol.png|Electronic symbol for rheostat\nFile:PreSetRheostatSymbol.png|Electronic symbol for pre-set rheostat\nFile:pot1.jpg|A high-power wirewound potentiometer\n</gallery>\n\n== Digital potentiometer ==\n{{main article|Digital potentiometer}}\nA digital potentiometer (often called digipot) is an electronic component that mimics the functions of analog potentiometers.  Through digital input signals, the resistance between two terminals can be adjusted, just as in an analog potentiometer. There are two main functional types: volatile, which lose their set position if power is removed, and are usually designed to initialise at the minimum position, and non-volatile, which retain their set position using a storage mechanism similar to [[flash memory]] or [[EEPROM]].\n\nUsage of a digipot is far more complex than that of a simple mechanical potentiometer, and there are many limitations to observe; nevertheless they are widely used, often for factory adjustment and calibration of equipment, especially where the limitations of mechanical potentiometers are problematic. A digipot is generally immune to the effects of moderate long-term mechanical vibration or environmental contamination, to the same extent as other semiconductor devices, and can be secured electronically against unauthorised tampering by protecting the access to its programming inputs by various means.\n\nIn equipment which has a [[microprocessor]], [[FPGA]] or other functional logic which can store settings and reload them to the \"potentiometer\" every time the equipment is powered up, a multiplying [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] can be used in place of a digipot, and this can offer higher setting resolution, less drift with temperature, and more operational flexibility.\n\n== Membrane potentiometers ==\nA membrane potentiometer uses a conductive membrane that is deformed by a sliding element to contact a resistor voltage divider. Linearity can range from 0.50% to 5% depending on the material, design and manufacturing process. The repeat accuracy is typically between 0.1&nbsp;mm and 1.0&nbsp;mm with a theoretically infinite resolution.  The service life of these types of potentiometers is typically 1 million to 20 million cycles depending on the materials used during manufacturing and the actuation method; contact and contactless (magnetic) methods are available (to sense position). Many different material variations are available such as [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], FR4, and Kapton. Membrane potentiometer manufacturers offer linear, rotary, and application-specific variations. The linear versions can range from 9&nbsp;mm to 1000&nbsp;mm in length and the rotary versions range from 0\u00b0 to multiple full turns, with each having a height of 0.5&nbsp;mm. Membrane potentiometers can be used for position sensing.<ref>\n[http://www.designworldonline.com/articles/5903/260/Membrane-Potentiometers-Simplify-Position-Sensing.aspx Membrane Potentiometer White Paper]</ref>\n\nFor touch-screen devices using resistive technology, a two-dimensional membrane potentiometer provides x and y coordinates. The top layer is thin glass spaced close to a neighboring inner layer. The underside of the top layer has a transparent conductive coating; the surface of the layer beneath it has a transparent resistive coating. A finger or stylus deforms the glass to contact the underlying layer. Edges of the resistive layer have conductive contacts.\nLocating the contact point is done by applying a voltage to opposite edges, leaving the other two edges temporarily unconnected. The voltage of the top layer provides one coordinate. Disconnecting those two edges, and applying voltage to the other two, formerly unconnected, provides the other coordinate. Alternating rapidly between pairs of edges provides frequent position updates. An analog-to digital converter provides output data.\n\nAdvantages of such sensors are that only five connections to the sensor are needed, and the associated electronics is comparatively simple. Another is that any material that depresses the top layer over a small area works well. A disadvantage is that sufficient force must be applied to make contact. Another is that the sensor requires occasional calibration to match touch location to the underlying display. (Capacitive sensors require no calibration or contact force, only proximity of a finger or other conductive object. However, they are significantly more complex.)\n\n== Applications ==\nPotentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant amounts of power (more than a watt or so). Instead they are used to adjust the level of analog signals (for example [[loudness|volume]] controls on [[audio equipment]]), and as control inputs for electronic circuits. For example, a light [[dimmer]] uses a potentiometer to control the switching of a [[TRIAC]] and so indirectly to control the brightness of lamps.\n\nPreset potentiometers are widely used throughout electronics wherever adjustments must be made during manufacturing or servicing.\n\nUser-actuated potentiometers are widely used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of equipment functions. The widespread use of potentiometers in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with rotary [[incremental encoder]]s, up/down [[push-button]]s, and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors.\n\n=== Audio control ===\n[[File:Faders.jpg|thumb|right|Slide potentiometers ([[Fade (audio engineering)#Fader|faders]])]]\n\nLow-power potentiometers, both slide and rotary, are used to control audio equipment, changing loudness, frequency attenuation, and other characteristics of audio signals.\n\nThe 'log pot', that is, a potentiometer has a resistance, taper, or, \u201ccurve\u201d (or law) of a logarithmic (log) form, is used as the volume control in [[audio power amplifier]]s, where it is also called an \"audio taper pot\", because the [[amplitude]] response of the human [[ear]] is approximately logarithmic. It ensures that on a volume control marked 0 to 10, for example, a setting of 5 sounds subjectively half as loud as a setting of 10. There is also an ''anti-log pot'' or ''reverse audio taper'' which is simply the reverse of a logarithmic potentiometer. It is almost always used in a ganged configuration with a logarithmic potentiometer, for instance, in an audio balance control.\n\nPotentiometers used in combination with filter networks act as [[Tone control circuit|tone controls]] or [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]].\n\nIn audio systems, the word linear, is sometimes applied in a confusing way to describe slide potentiometers because of the straight line nature of the physical sliding motion. The word linear when applied to a potentiometer regardless of being a slide or rotary type, describes a linear relationship of the pot's position versus the measured value of the pot's tap (wiper or electrical output) pin.\n\n=== Television ===\nPotentiometers were formerly used to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response.  A potentiometer was often used to adjust \"vertical hold\", which affected the synchronization between the receiver's internal sweep circuit (sometimes a [[multivibrator]]) and the received picture signal, along with other things such as audio-video carrier offset, tuning frequency (for push-button sets) and so on. It also helps in frequency modulation of waves.\n\n=== Motion control ===\nPotentiometers can be used as position feedback devices in order to create \"closed loop\" control, such as in a [[servomechanism]]. This method of motion control used in the DC Motor is the simplest method of measuring the angle, speed and displacement.\n\n=== Transducers ===\nPotentiometers  are also very widely used as a part of [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] [[transducer]]s because of the simplicity of construction and because they can give a large output signal.\n\n===Computation===\nIn [[analog computer]]s, high precision potentiometers are used to scale intermediate results by desired constant factors, or to set [[initial condition]]s for a calculation. A motor-driven potentiometer may be used as a [[function generator]], using a non-linear resistance card to supply approximations to trigonometric functions. For example, the shaft rotation might represent an angle, and the voltage division ratio can be made proportional to the cosine of the angle.\n\n== Theory of operation ==\n[[File:Potentiometer with load.svg|left|framed|A potentiometer with a resistive load, showing equivalent fixed resistors for clarity.]]\n\nThe potentiometer can be used as a [[voltage divider]] to obtain a manually adjustable output voltage at the slider (wiper) from a fixed input voltage applied across the two ends of the potentiometer. This is their most common use.\n\nThe voltage across {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} can be calculated by:\n<math display=\"block\">\nV_\\mathrm{L} = { R_2 R_\\mathrm{L} \\over R_1 R_\\mathrm{L} + R_2 R_\\mathrm{L} + R_1 R_2}\\cdot V_s.\n</math>\n\nIf {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} is large compared to the other resistances (like the input to an [[operational amplifier]]), the output voltage can be approximated by the simpler equation:\n<math display=\"block\">\nV_\\mathrm{L} = { R_2 \\over R_1 + R_2 }\\cdot V_s.\n</math>\n(dividing throughout by {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} and cancelling terms with {{math|''R''<sub>L</sub>}} as denominator)\n\nAs an example, assume <math>V_\\mathrm{S} = 10\\ \\mathrm{V}</math>, <math>R_1 = 1\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega}</math>, <math>R_2 = 2\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega}</math>, and <math>R_\\mathrm{L} = 100\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega}.</math>\n\nSince the load resistance is large compared to the other resistances, the output voltage {{math|''V''<sub>L</sub>}} will be approximately:\n<math display=\"block\">\n{2\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega} \\over 1\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega} + 2\\ \\mathrm{k \\Omega} } \\cdot 10\\ \\mathrm{V} = {2 \\over 3} \\cdot 10\\ \\mathrm{V} \\approx 6.667\\ \\mathrm{V}.\n</math>\n\nBecause of the load resistance, however, it will actually be slightly lower: {{math|\u2248 6.623 ''V''}}.\n\nOne of the advantages of the potential divider compared to a variable resistor in series with the source is that, while variable resistors have a maximum resistance where some [[current (electricity)|current]] will always flow, dividers are able to vary the output voltage from maximum ({{math|''V''<sub>S</sub>}}) to [[ground (electricity)|ground]] (zero volts) as the wiper moves from one end of the potentiometer to the other. There is, however, always a small amount of [[contact resistance]].\n\nIn addition, the load resistance is often not known and therefore simply placing a variable resistor in series with the load could have a negligible effect or an excessive effect, depending on the load.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Potentiometric sensor]]\n* [[Trimmer (electronics)|Trimmer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Potentiometers}}\n* [http://www.bourns.com/data/global/pdfs/OnlinePotentiometerHandbook.pdf .PDF edition of Carl David Todd (ed), \"The Potentiometer Handbook\",McGraw Hill, New York 1975] {{ISBN|0-07-006690-6}}\n* [http://sound.whsites.net/pots.htm Beginners' Guide to Potentiometers]\n* [http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electrical_Measurements/Potentiometer/Potentiometer.html Pictures of measuring potentiometers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050528085633/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/instruments/test/resistances.htm Electrical calibration equipment including various measurement potentiometers]\n*[http://www.geofex.com/Article_Folders/potsecrets/potscret.htm The Secret Life of Pots - Dissecting and repairing potentiometers]\n*[http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/projects/rheostat.html Making a rheostat]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-voltagedivider.htm Potentiometer calculations as voltage divider - loaded and open circuit (unloaded)]\n\n{{Electronic component}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Resistive components]]\n[[Category:Transducers]]\n", "name_user": "Opencooper", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAudio control:curly quotes to straight perMOS:CURLY", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer"}

Because of this format, material from the first five seasons did not air, outside of their original run, until 2019 when [[MeTV]] acquired the rights to these earlier seasons and began airing them.  The cast has periodically reunited for various one-off specials and short appearances, and several members of the cast went on to star in ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (1983\u20131990), a half-hour [[sitcom]] based on a sketch series from ''The Carol Burnett Show''.  \n\nIn 2013, ''TV Guide'' ranked ''The Carol Burnett Show'' number 17 on its list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fretts |first=Bruce |last2=Roush |first2=Matt |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time |journal=TV Guide Magazine |date= 23 December 2013 |url= https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBy 1967, Carol Burnett had been a popular veteran of television for 12 years, having made her first appearances in 1955 on ''The Paul Winchell Show'' and the sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' starring the comedian [[Buddy Hackett]]. In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place.

Many of these film parodies were written or co-written by [[Stan Hart]], [[Arnie Kogen]] and [[Larry Siegel]], all prolific contributors for [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine, with each authoring dozens of the magazine's own movie satires.\n\n==After the series==\n\n===Continuations and revivals===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\nIn the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s (as ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', a half-hour edition of selected 1972\u201377 material).\n\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. [[Ernie Flatt]], who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]]. The show also aired on [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|The Family Channel]] in 1996 and on [[TV Land]] as part of that network's inaugural lineup from 1996 to 1997 and again from 2004 to 2005.

In 1959, she became a regular supporting cast member on the CBS-TV variety series ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. Departing the Moore Show in the spring of 1962, she pursued other projects in film,  Broadway productions, and headlining her own television specials.  Burnett signed a contract with CBS for 10 years which required her to do two guest appearances and a special a year. Within the first five years of this contract, she had the option to \"push the button\", a phrase the programming executives used,<ref>{{cite book |last= Burnett|first= Carol|date= 2016|title=  In Such Good Company: Eleven Years of Laughter, Mayhem, and Fun in the Sandbox|url= |location= New York City|publisher= Crown Archetype|page= 4|isbn= 978-1101904657|author-link= }}</ref> and be put on the air in 30 one-hour variety shows, [[pay-or-play]]. After discussion with her husband [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], in the last week of the fifth year of the contract, Burnett decided to call the head of CBS [[Michael Dann]] and exercise the clause. Dann, explaining that variety is a \"man's genre\", offered Burnett a sitcom called ''Here's Agnes''. Burnett had no interest in doing a sitcom, and because of the contract, CBS was obliged to give Burnett her own variety show.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Carol Burnett show cast 1977.JPG|thumb|230px|On the left, main cast members in 1967 (clockwise from the bottom): Burnett, Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner, on the right, the 1977 cast: Burnett, Tim Conway, Lawrence, and Korman]]\nIn addition to Carol Burnett, the cast consisted of:\n*[[Vicki Lawrence]]\n*[[Harvey Korman]] (seasons 1\u201310)\n*[[Lyle Waggoner]] (seasons 1\u20137)\n*[[Tim Conway]] (seasons 9\u201311; frequent guest performer in seasons 1\u20138)\n*[[Dick Van Dyke]] (first half of season 11)\nComedic actor Harvey Korman had done many guest shots in TV sitcoms. From 1963 to 1967, he had been a semi-regular on the CBS variety series ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''. When Kaye's program ended in the spring of 1967, Korman was immediately hired for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. \n\nAt this particular time, actor Lyle Waggoner had recently auditioned for the title role in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series [[Batman]] but was passed over in favor of [[Adam West]]. Shortly after, Waggoner auditioned for the Burnett show and was immediately hired.  He would sometimes play the handsome man for Burnett to fawn over. His participation on the series was somewhat modeled on [[Durward Kirby]]  of ''The Garry Moore Show'' as Waggoner also functioned as the show's announcer in addition to playing in sketches.\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and guest star [[Dinah Shore]] in the 1976 ''[[Went with the Wind!]]'' sketch]]\nVicki Lawrence, a young singer from [[The Young Americans]] wrote a letter to Burnett when she was 17, remarking on their physical resemblance. This led to her audition and getting hired to play Burnett's kid sister in numerous \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.\n\n[[Jim Nabors]] was the guest star on every season premiere of the show. Burnett considered Nabors to be her annual good luck charm.\n\nIn addition, several notable actors were used in the comedy sketches in featured roles, especially in the first season, such as [[William Schallert]], [[Isabel Sanford]], and [[Reta Shaw]].\n\nThe popular variety show not only established Burnett as a television superstar, but it also made her regular supporting cast household names, with such sketches as \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", (a parody of ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\" (a spoof of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), \"Carol & Sis\", \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", and \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" (which led to a [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie titled ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', as well as a spin-off television series titled ''[[Mama's Family]]''), \"Nora Desmond\" (Burnett's send-up of [[Gloria Swanson]]'s character [[Norma Desmond]] in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''), and \"Stella Toddler\". A frequent repeated segment was \"Kitchen Commercials\", in which cast members parodied TV commercials that drove a woman (Burnett) crazy. The long-running show was frequently nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for best variety series and won three times.\n\nA favorite feature consisted of an unrehearsed question-and-answer segment with the audience in CBS Studio 33 (now [[Bob Barker]] Studio) lasting about three to four minutes at the start of most shows. Burnett stated that she borrowed the concept from Garry Moore, who did the same on his variety show, but never taped it.<ref>\"The Florence Henderson Show\" RLTV, 2009</ref> Burnett asked for the lights to be turned up (\"let's bump up the lights\") and then randomly picked audience members who raised their hands. Burnett often ad-libbed funny answers, but occasionally ended up as the straight (wo)man. For example:\n\n:Young woman: \"Have you ever taken acting lessons?\"\n:Carol: \"Yes, I have.\"\n:Young woman: \"Do you think it did any good?\"\n\nThe show was rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) were used for each major performer (\"Carol Burnett: Bump-Up the Lights\"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.\nAs a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as \"Conway's Capers\". Conway would play the first taping straight, but (if the sketch had played well in the first taping, and could be used) would ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a \"club\", Conway sang three verses of \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\" as Waggoner tried in vain to ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 \"Mama's Family\" sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing Novocain or the recurring role of [[The Oldest Man (character)|\"The Oldest Man\"]] \u2013 an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).\n\nThe show also became known for its closing theme song, written by Burnett's husband, with these lyrics:<ref>{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Warren| title=Have a Laugh and Sing a Song| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/bell/bell200511090809.asp| accessdate=August 19, 2011| date=November 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n:I'm so glad we had this time together\n:Just to have a laugh or sing a song\n:Seems we just get started and before you know it\n:Comes the time we have to say, \"So long.\"\n\nAt the close of each episode, Burnett tugged her ear. This silent message was meant for her grandmother, who raised her, and meant she was thinking of her at that moment. After her grandmother's death, Burnett continued the tradition.\n\n==Broadcast==\nWhen ''The Carol Burnett Show'' made its network debut on CBS-TV in September 1967, it was scheduled on Monday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm opposite NBC\u2019s ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' and ABC\u2019s ''[[The Big Valley]]''. At the end of its first season and through the spring of 1971, it consistently ranked among the top-30 programs. (For the 1969\u201370 season, it posted its highest rating ever, ranking at number 13.) For season five, CBS moved the show to Wednesday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm, where its chief competition was NBC\u2019s ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the ABC sitcoms ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]''. Despite the schedule change, the show continued to do well until the fall of 1972, when the ratings slipped. In December 1972, CBS again moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' to Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm (EST) where, for the next four years, it not only received solid ratings, but was also part of a powerhouse Saturday-night lineup of primetime shows that included ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''.\n\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, the \"Family\" sketches (with Burnett as Eunice, Korman as her husband Ed, and Lawrence as Eunice's mother) were introduced and the \"Carol and Sis\" segments were phased out. At the end of that season (the series' seventh), after having been with ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from the beginning, Lyle Waggoner left the series to pursue other acting opportunities. The following season, Waggoner's spot as a supporting regular remained vacant. Don Crichton, the lead male dancer on the show, began to inherit some of Waggoner's duties. Then in season nine, because of his many popular guest appearances on the series, Tim Conway was signed as a full-time regular, joining Korman and Lawrence.\n\n[[File:Tim Conway Carol Burnett Dick Van Dyke Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|150px|From left to right: Conway, Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke in the final season]]\nIn November, 1976, the series' tenth year, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' presented what would become one of its best-known and most well-regarded sketches: \"[[Went with the Wind!]],\" a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', which had its television debut on NBC the week before. After the 1976-77 season ended, Harvey Korman decided to leave the series. After a decade of working with Burnett and winning several Emmy Awards, Korman had been offered a contract by ABC to headline his own series. Also, the ratings had begun to decline. Nevertheless, CBS renewed Burnett's show for an 11th season.\n\nDick Van Dyke, fresh from headlining his own short-lived Emmy-winning variety series, ''Van Dyke & Company'', was brought in to replace Korman. However, his presence did not help stem the sagging ratings, as the show faced new competition in ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]''. After three months, Van Dyke departed the show, and CBS, in a desperate attempt to save the series, moved ''The Carol Burnett Show'' from Saturday nights at 10:00&nbsp;pm to Sunday nights at the same hour, beginning in December 1977. Regular guest stars [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Ken Berry]] were brought in to fill the void left by Korman and Van Dyke. The ratings improved considerably.\n\nCBS wanted to renew the show for another year, but by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre, despite her success in it. With the changes in cast along with the mediocre ratings, she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later. Thus, on March 29, 1978, in a special two-hour finale entitled \"[[A Special Evening with Carol Burnett]]\", ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left primetime television after 11 years, finishing its last season in 66th place. Reruns were aired during the summer of 1978.\n\n==Notable characters/sketches==\n\n[[File:Carol Burnett charwoman character 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as the Charwoman]]\n[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG|thumb|150px|Burnett as Eunice with [[Madeline Kahn]] in \"The Family\" sketch]]\n\n*[[As the Stomach Turns]] \u2013 a [[soap opera]] parody taking place in the fictional town of Canoga Falls with Burnett as the main character Marian Clayton.\n*Carol and Sis \u2013 Burnett as Carol and Lawrence as her sister Chris with Korman as Carol's husband Roger;<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 1\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 239| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> the sketch was based on Burnett's life in New York raising her kid sister in New York with her first husband, and Lawrence was originally hired just for this sketch.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n*The Charwoman \u2013 Burnett's signature character, an unnamed [[charwoman]] (most often in a musical number),<ref name=\"Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004 2\">{{cite book| first= Wesley| last= Hyatt| year= 2006| title= Emmy Award Winning Nighttime Television Shows, 1948-2004| edition=| publisher= McFarland & Company| location=| pages= 240| isbn= 978-0786423293}}</ref> whose animated image has been used in the opening credits, and also in the opening and closing credits of ''Carol Burnett and Friends''.\n*Chiquita \u2013 Burnett's parody of [[Charo]];

Many of these film parodies were written or co-written by [[Stan Hart]], [[Arnie Kogen]] and [[Larry Siegel]], all prolific contributors for [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine, with each authoring dozens of the magazine's own movie satires.\n\n==After the series==\n\n===Continuations and revivals===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}\nIn the fall of 1977, while the series was still running in prime time, the comedy sketches of the show were re-edited into freestanding programs; the resulting show enjoyed success for many years in [[television syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s (as ''Carol Burnett and Friends'', a half-hour edition of selected 1972\u201377 material).\n\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''The Carol Burnett Show'' left the air, Burnett and her husband Joe Hamilton were dining in a restaurant with friends, including Tim Conway. At that gathering, Burnett got wistful and started reminiscing about the show and making suggestions to Conway concerning sketches that she wished they could be creating if the show were still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series. Taking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979. CBS already had its schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, ABC was interested, and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced. Under the title ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'', the show premiered on Saturday, August 18, 1979, and included many favorite sketches such as \"Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins\", \"The Family\", \"As The Stomach Turns\", and Burnett doing her impersonation of Queen Elizabeth II. Its format was very much similar to Burnett's series, with two exceptions. Due to the unavailability of Harvey Korman (who, ironically, had been under contract to ABC since he had left Burnett's show in 1977), comic actors [[Kenneth Mars]] and [[Craig Richard Nelson]] were added to the supporting cast, joining Lawrence and Conway. [[Ernie Flatt]], who had been the choreographer on Burnett's show for its entire 11-year run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars in that four-week period were (chronologically) [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]], and [[Sally Field]]. The reviews of the series were very favorable, with several critics heartily welcoming Burnett back to weekly television, albeit on a limited basis. The ratings also were respectable and plans were announced for the program to become a yearly summer event, but it never happened.\n\nThe \"Family\" sketches led to a 1982 CBS made-for-television film called ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' starring Burnett, Korman, Lawrence, Betty White, and Ken Berry. The success of this program spawned a spin-off sitcom titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring Vicki Lawrence and Ken Berry, which ran from 1983 to 1990. It occasionally featured Burnett and Korman guest-starring as Eunice and Ed Higgins; Burnett's involvement in ''Mama's Family'' was limited due to her divorce from producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123891&page=1 |title=Humor Helps Carol Burnett Cope \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> In the first year and a half of the show's run, Korman also appeared as narrator Alastair Quince, introducing each episode (a parody of [[Alastair Cooke]] hosting ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'') and he also directed 31 episodes of the series.\n\n[[NBC]] aired a comedy half-hour repertory series called ''[[Carol & Company]]'' that premiered in March 1990. It proved to be moderately successful in the ratings and was renewed for a second season. The regulars on the show included [[Peter Krause]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Terry Kiser]], [[Meagen Fay]], [[Anita Barone]], and [[Richard Kind]] (and occasional guest stars, including [[Betty White]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]); each week's show was a different half-hour comedy play. This program lasted until July 1991.\n\nCBS brought back ''The Carol Burnett Show'' for another run in the fall of 1991; new regulars included Meagen Fay and Richard Kind (brought over from the NBC show), and [[Chris Barnes (actor)|Chris Barnes]], [[Roger Kabler]], and [[Jessica Lundy]]. However, the times had changed and Burnett's humor was tame compared to the edgier comedy popular in the 1990s. The series failed to catch on with the public and only six episodes of this revival were aired.\n\nIn 1994, reruns of the syndicated ''Carol Burnett and Friends'' package aired on [[Nick at Nite]]. The show also aired on [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|The Family Channel]] in 1996 and on [[TV Land]] as part of that network's inaugural lineup from 1996 to 1997 and again from 2004 to 2005.
