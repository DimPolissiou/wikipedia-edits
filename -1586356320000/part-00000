However, in his third general election, the major issue was the building of a [[Pipeline Debate|trans-Canada gas pipeline]], with financing from the federal government.  The financing proposal triggered a controversial debate in the House of Commons, which St. Laurent's government ended by the use of [[Cloture|closure]] to push the measure through the Commons.  St. Laurent and the Liberals were defeated in the [[1957 Canadian federal election|general election of 1957]], with [[John Diefenbaker]] forming a minority government.
