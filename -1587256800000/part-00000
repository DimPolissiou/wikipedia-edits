{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987.

This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

{"title_page": "Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation", "text_new": "[[File:Bell AH-1 Cobra flying head on.jpg|thumb|right|Masking their approach using trees, TOW-firing Cobras proved to be devastatingly effective anti-tank weapons.]] \n\nThe '''Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation''' was a series of [[military exercise]]s that tested the use of [[attack helicopter]]s against simulated [[Warsaw Pact]] formations. They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these comments home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref> This resulted in a complex design and development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US equipment that had been captured earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum. On 25 May, the battle opened in earnest. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets. The two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given the increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach conclusively demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Although superior to any NATO [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] of the era, Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nAs might be expected, in the breakout scenario the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft. This would leave the forces in Canada both under-equipped and lacking training.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=59}} Having repeatedly suggested a ''status quo'' approach, updating the Centurions in both Europe and Canada, a wait and see approach developed. An additional factor in the Canadian decision was the advocacy of Major Norman Shackleton, who wrote a series of influential and widely quoted pro-tank articles throughout this period. Among these was a 1967 article that concluded: \"... the foremost antitank weapon is probably another tank sited in the defense.\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Military Review |volume=47 |date=July 1967 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qGU3r9LVwbsC&pg=PA58 |title=The Case for the Defense |first=Norman |last=Shackleton}}</ref> By the early 1980s, the helicopter contingent had not been purchased, while a new tank contingent of Leopards was purchased from Germany in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |website=The Drive |title=Canada Has Given Up Trying To Find A Good Home For Its Retired Leopard Tanks |date=9 July 2018 |url=https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22044/canada-has-given-up-trying-to-find-a-good-home-for-its-retired-leopard-tanks}}</ref>\n\nOther NATO forces also began the process of integrating attack helicopters into their forces, initially with ''ad hoc'' conversions of existing utility designs like the [[Westland Scout]]<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Ferguson | first= James | title =Commando aviation |magazine= Flight International | date =6 February 1982 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200314.html | accessdate =16 November 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref> and [[MBB Bo 105]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eads.com/1024/en/eads/history/airhist/1970_today/bo105_1971.html |title=B\u00f6lkow Bo 105 - History of EADS |publisher=EADS |accessdate=2007-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110626/http://www.eads.com/1024/en/eads/history/airhist/1970_today/bo105_1971.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[J-CATCH]], testing attack helicopters against [[fighter aircraft]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite techreport\n |first=Curtis |last=Ebitz\n |title= The Tank-Attack Helicopter In The European Mid-Intensity Conflict Environment\n |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b006705.pdf\n |date=6 June 1975\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EklRAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA4\n |title=Armor in the October War\n |date=May-June 1974\n |journal=Armor\n |volume=83\n |first=Kenneth |last=Brower\n |pages=10-15\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=A National Force: The Evolution of Canada's Army, 1950-2000\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=VTIAAQAAQBAJ\n |first=Peter |last=Kasurak\n |publisher=UBC Press\n |date=2013\n |isbn=9780774826419\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=The Price of Alliance\n |first=Frank |last=Maas\n |date=2017\n |publisher=UBC Press\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qLo4DwAAQBAJ\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Department of the Army Historical Summary, Fiscal Year 1973\n |first1=Willian |last1= Bell\n |first2=Karl |last2=Cocke\n |url=https://history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM/1973/chIII.htm\n |date=1974\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=Stanley |last=McGowen\n |title=Helicopters: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xLis8p7uLaUC&pg=PA158\n |publisher=ABC-CLIO\n |date=2005\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite journal\n |first=Norman |last=Shackleton\n |title=Will the Tank Go the Way of the Horse?\n |date=September-October 1968\n |pages=4-8\n |journal=Armor\n |volume=77 |number=5\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=eIJNAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=John |last=Burns\n |title= XM-26 TOW: Birth of the Helicopter as a Tank Buster\n |publisher=United States Army\n |date=1994\n |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga2/vnhistory/2RAC.html\n}}\n\n[[Category:Military exercises involving the United States]]\n[[Category:Military exercises and wargames]]\n[[Category:Canadian military exercises\u200e]]\n[[Category:Military aviation exercises]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Bell AH-1 Cobra flying head on.jpg|thumb|right|Masking their approach using trees, TOW-firing Cobras proved to be devastatingly effective anti-tank weapons.]] \n\nThe '''Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation''' was a series of [[military exercise]]s that tested the use of [[attack helicopter]]s against simulated [[Warsaw Pact]] formations.

Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US equipment that had been captured earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum. On 25 May, the battle opened in earnest. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets. The two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given the increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach conclusively demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Although superior to any NATO [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] of the era, Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nAs might be expected, in the breakout scenario the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft. This would leave the forces in Canada both under-equipped and lacking training.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=59}} Having repeatedly suggested a ''status quo'' approach, updating the Centurions in both Europe and Canada, a wait and see approach developed. An additional factor in the Canadian decision was the advocacy of Major Norman Shackleton, who wrote a series of influential and widely quoted pro-tank articles throughout this period. Among these was a 1967 article that concluded: \"... the foremost antitank weapon is probably another tank sited in the defense.\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Military Review |volume=47 |date=July 1967 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qGU3r9LVwbsC&pg=PA58 |title=The Case for the Defense |first=Norman |last=Shackleton}}</ref> By the early 1980s, the helicopter contingent had not been purchased, while a new tank contingent of Leopards was purchased from Germany in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |website=The Drive |title=Canada Has Given Up Trying To Find A Good Home For Its Retired Leopard Tanks |date=9 July 2018 |url=https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22044/canada-has-given-up-trying-to-find-a-good-home-for-its-retired-leopard-tanks}}</ref>\n\nOther NATO forces also began the process of integrating attack helicopters into their forces, initially with ''ad hoc'' conversions of existing utility designs like the [[Westland Scout]]<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Ferguson | first= James | title =Commando aviation |magazine= Flight International | date =6 February 1982 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200314.html | accessdate =16 November 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref> and [[MBB Bo 105]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eads.com/1024/en/eads/history/airhist/1970_today/bo105_1971.html |title=B\u00f6lkow Bo 105 - History of EADS |publisher=EADS |accessdate=2007-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110626/http://www.eads.com/1024/en/eads/history/airhist/1970_today/bo105_1971.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[J-CATCH]], testing attack helicopters against [[fighter aircraft]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite techreport\n |first=Curtis |last=Ebitz\n |title= The Tank-Attack Helicopter In The European Mid-Intensity Conflict Environment\n |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b006705.pdf\n |date=6 June 1975\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EklRAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA4\n |title=Armor in the October War\n |date=May-June 1974\n |journal=Armor\n |volume=83\n |first=Kenneth |last=Brower\n |pages=10-15\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=A National Force: The Evolution of Canada's Army, 1950-2000\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=VTIAAQAAQBAJ\n |first=Peter |last=Kasurak\n |publisher=UBC Press\n |date=2013\n |isbn=9780774826419\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=The Price of Alliance\n |first=Frank |last=Maas\n |date=2017\n |publisher=UBC Press\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qLo4DwAAQBAJ\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Department of the Army Historical Summary, Fiscal Year 1973\n |first1=Willian |last1= Bell\n |first2=Karl |last2=Cocke\n |url=https://history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM/1973/chIII.htm\n |date=1974\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=Stanley |last=McGowen\n |title=Helicopters: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xLis8p7uLaUC&pg=PA158\n |publisher=ABC-CLIO\n |date=2005\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite journal\n |first=Norman |last=Shackleton\n |title=Will the Tank Go the Way of the Horse?\n |date=September-October 1968\n |pages=4-8\n |journal=Armor\n |volume=77 |number=5\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=eIJNAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=John |last=Burns\n |title= XM-26 TOW: Birth of the Helicopter as a Tank Buster\n |publisher=United States Army\n |date=1994\n |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga2/vnhistory/2RAC.html\n}}\n\n[[Category:Military exercises involving the United States]]\n[[Category:Military exercises and wargames]]\n[[Category:Canadian military exercises\u200e]]\n[[Category:Military aviation exercises]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBackground", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Attack_Helicopter_Instrumented_Evaluation"}
