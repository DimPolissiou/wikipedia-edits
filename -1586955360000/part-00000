He made more than 300 appearances in the [[English Football League|Football League]] playing as a [[forward (association football)|striker]].\n\nHe was a \"strong and forceful\" player, able to hold the ball up in order to bring other players into the game.<ref name=\"WBA Whos Who\"/> Horsfield made his Football League debut with [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] as a teenager. Released by the club, he returned to part-time football with [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]], [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]] and [[Witton Albion F.C.|Witton Albion]], before a second spell at Halifax saw him help the club regain their Football League status. He moved on to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], with whom he achieved promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a club record fee. He played in the final of the [[2001 Football League Cup Final|2001 League Cup]] with Birmingham, and the following season helped them reach the [[Premier League]].\n\nAfter a short period at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in 2003, he joined [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], with whom he again won promotion to the Premier League. In 2006, he moved to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], but much of his time there was spent on loan to other clubs, namely [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. Horsfield announced his retirement from football in 2008 after being diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]], but after successful treatment he resumed his career, signing a six-month contract for [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in January 2009. In July of that year he was appointed [[player-manager|player-assistant manager]] at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] under [[Micky Adams]], and the following summer he took up coaching full-time, before leaving the game completely in May 2012. In March 2013 he returned to playing football for [[Alvechurch F.C.|Alvechurch]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early career===\nHorsfield was born in [[Barnsley]], [[South Yorkshire]].<ref

football|footballer]] and football coach. He made more than 300 appearances in the [[English Football League|Football League]] playing as a [[forward (association football)|striker]].\n\nHe was a \"strong and forceful\" player, able to hold the ball up in order to bring other players into the game.<ref name=\"WBA Whos Who\"/> Horsfield made his Football League debut with [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] as a teenager. Released by the club, he returned to part-time football with [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]], [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]] and [[Witton Albion F.C.|Witton Albion]], before a second spell at Halifax saw him help the club regain their Football League status. He moved on to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], with whom he achieved promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a club record fee. He played in the final of the [[2001 Football League Cup Final|2001 League Cup]] with Birmingham, and the following season helped them reach the [[Premier League]].\n\nAfter a short period at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in 2003, he joined [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], with whom he again won promotion to the Premier League. In 2006, he moved to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], but much of his time there was spent on loan to other clubs, namely [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. Horsfield announced his retirement from football in 2008 after being diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]], but after successful treatment he resumed his career, signing a six-month contract for [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in January 2009. In July of that year he was appointed [[player-manager|player-assistant manager]] at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] under [[Micky Adams]], and the following summer he took up coaching full-time, before leaving the game completely in May 2012. In March 2013 he returned to playing football for [[Alvechurch F.C.|Alvechurch]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early career===\nHorsfield was born in [[Barnsley]], [[South Yorkshire]].<ref

{"title_page": "Charles Henry Caffin", "text_new": "[[File:Charles Henry Caffin 001.jpg|thumb|Charles H. Caffin ca. 1900]]\n'''Charles Henry Caffin''' (June 4, 1854 \u2013 January 14, 1918) was an [[English-American|Anglo-American]] [[writer]] and art critic, born in [[Sittingbourne]], Kent, England.  After graduating from [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], in 1876, with a broad background in culture and aesthetics, he engaged in scholastic and theatrical work. In 1888, he married Caroline Scurfield, a British actress and writer. They had two children, daughters Donna and [[Freda Caffin]]. In 1892, he moved to the United States. He worked in the decoration department of the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago Exposition]], and after moving to [[New York City]] in 1897, he was the art critic of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', the New York [[New York Post|''Evening Post]]'', the New York [[New York Sun (historical)|''Sun]]'' (1901&ndash;04), the ''International Studio'', and the ''New York American''. His publications are of a popular rather than a scholarly character, but he was an important early if equivocal advocate of modern art in America. His writings were suggestive and stimulating to laymen and encouraged interest in many fields of art. One of his last books, ''Art for Life's Sake'' (1913), described his philosophy, which argued that the arts must be seen as \"an integral part of life....[not] an orchid-like parasite on life\" or a specialized or elite indulgence.<ref>Charles Caffin. ''Art for Life's Sake'' (New York: Prang Co., 1913), p. 18.</ref> He also argued strenuously for art education in American elementary schools and high schools and was a frequent lecturer.\n\n==Career==\nCaffin's earliest writings did not suggest that he would ever be sympathetic to the modernist attack on traditional aesthetic values. His many articles and books, which were surveys intended for a general audience, focused on the major names in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European painting and sculpture, and when considering art from the late nineteenth century, praised the work of artists like [[Abbott Thayer]] and [[George de Forest Brush]], who came to epitomize everything Modernism would reject. He was an admirer of [[Tonalism]] and the realism of [[Gari Melchers]].\n\nCaffin's interest in pictorial photography led to the most important and productive friendship of his life with [[Alfred Stieglitz]]. Stieglitz enlisted Caffin as a writer for his journal [[Camera Work]], for which he wrote appreciations of Stieglitz's photographs as well as those of [[Edward Steichen]], [[Frank Eugene]], [[Joseph Keiley]], and [[Gertrude Kasebier]], among others. ''Camera Work,'' which was founded in 1902, continued publication until 1917 and, in the words of Stieglitz's biographer, Caffin was \"the only major critic sympathetic to [Stieglitz's] goals to last the full life of the magazine.\"<ref>Sue Davidson Lowe, ''Stieglitz: A Memoir/Biography'' (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1983), p. 122.</ref>  The relationship with Stieglitz also led to more exposure to new art.  Reviewing exhibitions at Stieglitz's gallery, \"291,\" Caffin had the opportunity to assess challenging artists as different as [[Abraham Walkowitz]], [[Alfred Maurer]], [[John Marin]], [[Arthur Dove]], and [[Marsden Hartley]]. Some of the new art he saw (e.g., [[Cubism]] and [[Synchromism]]) was confusing and disorienting to him, but much of it was a revelation which he was pleased to discuss in his newspaper and magazine columns. \n\nThough he was always more comfortable writing about the Old Masters or painters from his youth like [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], he acquired a reputation as a writer with an open mind. He could also acknowledge that his own perspective had changed over time. Examining a portrait by [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]] at a 1916 exhibition at the Knoedler gallery, Caffin wrote, \"It is with curious reflection that one studies its dead harmonies of color, its inert vibrations...and recalls that they once seemed to awaken a response in one's imagination...Poor old fin-de-si\u00e8cle exquistiveness, how completely everybody but the artist has grown beyond you!\"<ref>''New York American,'' March 13, 1916, p. 12.</ref>\n\nCaffin had his enemies in the modernist camp who could not forgive him his more conservative tastes. [[Willard Huntington Wright]], an early advocate of abstract painting, found Caffin's growing interest in advanced art suspicious and suggested that hypnotism must be responsible for his conversion to a broader view, as \"the headmaster in the kindergarten of painting\" was not clever enough to see the light on his own.<ref>Willard Huntington Wright, \"The Aesthetic Struggle in America,\" ''Forum'' (February 1916), pp. 205 and 209.</ref> Another writer in the Stieglitz circle, Temple Scott, wrote an \"histoire \u00e0 clef\" that offered a particularly unflattering portrait of Caffin, thinly disguised as \"Charles Cockayne,\" a critic of complacent self-assurance.<ref>Temple Scott, \"Fifth Avenue and the Boulevard Saint-Michel,\" ''Forum'' (December 1910), pp. 665-685.</ref>\n\nIn the years between the 1913 [[Armory Show]], which he found impressive but dangerously sensationalistic, and his death in 1918, Caffin energetically covered the changing New York art world and urged his readers to give the difficult new painters a chance. He made a case to skeptical viewers for the work of European modernists like [[Henri Matisse]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], and [[Francis Picabia]]. Yet he also shared his own doubts. While he could see the innovative qualities of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] and [[Georges Braque]], he dismissed the \"pinhead humor\" of [[Marcel Duchamp]]<ref>''New York American,'' April 10, 1916, p. 7.</ref> and found the Coney Island paintings of [[Joseph Stella]] aggressively vulgar.<ref>''New York American,'' February 9, 1914, p. 7.</ref> Writing about a 1915 Picasso exhibition, he admitted that all artists must follow \"the inevitable call of their own genius\" but that Picasso \"has reached a point of intentional abstraction which I, for one, cannot follow.\"<ref>''New York American,'' March 15, 1915, p. 9.</ref>\n\nCharles Caffin was neither a reactionary opposed to Modernism nor an unabashed avant-garde supporter. Sharing his enthusiasm and his skepticism, he provided a forum for reasoned debate and applauded the testing of aesthetic boundaries and standards. He understood that he lived in changing times.\n\n==Published works==\n*''Handbook of the New Library of Congress, compiled by Herbert Small; with Essays on the Architecture, Sculpture and Painting by Charles Caffin'' (1897)\n* ''Photography as a Fine Art'' (1901)\n* ''American Masters of Painting'' (1902)\n* ''American Masters of Sculpture'' (1903)\n* ''How to Study Pictures by Means of a Series of Comparisons of Paintings and Painters'' (1905)\n* ''Story of American Painting'' (1907)\n*''A Child's Guide to Pictures'' (1908)\n*''The Appreciation of the Drama (1908)\n*''The Art of Dwight W.

Examining a portrait by [[Thomas Wilmer Dewing]] at a 1916 exhibition at the Knoedler gallery, Caffin wrote, \"It is with curious reflection that one studies its dead harmonies of color, its inert vibrations...and recalls that they once seemed to awaken a response in one's imagination...Poor old fin-de-si\u00e8cle exquistiveness, how completely everybody but the artist has grown beyond you!\"<ref>''New York American,'' March 13, 1916, p. 12.</ref>\n\nCaffin had his enemies in the modernist camp who could not forgive him his more conservative tastes. [[Willard Huntington Wright]], an early advocate of abstract painting, found Caffin's growing interest in advanced art suspicious and suggested that hypnotism must be responsible for his conversion to a broader view, as \"the headmaster in the kindergarten of painting\" was not clever enough to see the light on his own.<ref>Willard Huntington Wright, \"The Aesthetic Struggle in America,\" ''Forum'' (February 1916), pp. 205 and 209.</ref> Another writer in the Stieglitz circle, Temple Scott, wrote an \"histoire \u00e0 clef\" that offered a particularly unflattering portrait of Caffin, thinly disguised as \"Charles Cockayne,\" a critic of complacent self-assurance.<ref>Temple Scott, \"Fifth Avenue and the Boulevard Saint-Michel,\" ''Forum'' (December 1910), pp. 665-685.</ref>\n\nIn the years between the 1913 [[Armory Show]], which he found impressive but dangerously sensationalistic, and his death in 1918, Caffin energetically covered the changing New York art world and urged his readers to give the difficult new painters a chance. He made a case to skeptical viewers for the work of European modernists like [[Henri Matisse]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], and [[Francis Picabia]]. Yet he also shared his own doubts. While he could see the innovative qualities of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] and [[Georges Braque]], he dismissed the \"pinhead humor\" of [[Marcel Duchamp]]<ref>''New York American,'' April 10, 1916, p. 7.</ref> and found the Coney Island paintings of [[Joseph Stella]] aggressively vulgar.<ref>''New York American,'' February 9, 1914, p. 7.</ref> Writing about a 1915 Picasso exhibition, he admitted that all artists must follow \"the inevitable call of their own genius\" but that Picasso \"has reached a point of intentional abstraction which I, for one, cannot follow.\"<ref>''New York American,'' March 15, 1915, p. 9.</ref>\n\nCharles Caffin was neither a reactionary opposed to Modernism nor an unabashed avant-garde supporter. Sharing his enthusiasm and his skepticism, he provided a forum for reasoned debate and applauded the testing of aesthetic boundaries and standards. He understood that he lived in changing times.\n\n==Published works==\n*''Handbook of the New Library of Congress, compiled by Herbert Small; with Essays on the Architecture, Sculpture and Painting by Charles Caffin'' (1897)\n* ''Photography as a Fine Art'' (1901)\n* ''American Masters of Painting'' (1902)\n* ''American Masters of Sculpture'' (1903)\n* ''How to Study Pictures by Means of a Series of Comparisons of Paintings and Painters'' (1905)\n* ''Story of American Painting'' (1907)\n*''A Child's Guide to Pictures'' (1908)\n*''The Appreciation of the Drama (1908)\n*''The Art of Dwight W.

He played in the [[Premier League]] and [[the Football League]] for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and managed in the Football League with Notts County and [[York City F.C.|York City]].\n\nMills, who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] and as a [[midfielder]], started his career with [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club Nottingham Forest. He became the club's youngest league player after making his first-team debut at the age of 16 in 1978. He played in the victorious [[1980 European Cup Final]], which made him the youngest finalist in [[European Cup]] history. He joined the [[Seattle Sounders (1974\u201383)|Seattle Sounders]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] in 1982 and played for them for one season, which culminated in a loss to the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]] in [[Soccer Bowl '82]]. While with them Mills had a [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Derby County, making 23 appearances for the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club. He returned to Forest in 1983, and made 168 appearances over two spells at the club. He left for their rivals, Notts County of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], in 1987. Mills then joined Leicester City in 1989, and after two unsuccessful forays into the [[EFL Championship play-offs|First Division play-offs]] he helped them win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League in 1994. He soon returned to County, by this time playing in the First Division, after 232 appearances for Leicester. Here Mills earned the last honour of his playing career, winning the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] in 1995. He retired from professional football in 1996 due to an injury, having made 159 appearances for County over two spells.\n\nHe started his managerial career as [[Player-coach#Player-managers in association football|player-manager]] with [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]] in 1996. He left the club after leading them to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Midland Division title in his second season. He then served as player-manager at Southern League Premier Division club [[King's Lynn F.C.|King's Lynn]] from 1998 to 2000, which was brought to an end after he resigned. He was appointed player-manager of Southern League Premier Division club [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] in 2001, before leaving to join the coaching staff at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 2002. Mills was handed his first managerial role in [[English Football League|the Football League]] with Notts County in 2004, but was dismissed several months after the club was relegated to [[EFL League Two|League Two]]. He managed [[Alfreton Town F.C.|Alfreton Town]] of the [[Conference North]] from 2005 to 2007 when he returned to Tamworth. The club was relegated from the [[Conference National]] before Mills led them to the Conference North title in 2009. He left Tamworth in 2010 to become manager of their [[Conference Premier]] rivals York City. Mills oversaw York's victories in the [[FA Trophy]] and Conference Premier play-offs in 2012, the latter resulting in promotion to League Two. He was dismissed by York in 2013 before taking over at [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]], and after leading them to the Conference Premier play-offs in 2014 he was named the Non-League Manager of the Year. Mills took over as manager of their National League rivals [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in 2015, but was dismissed the following year.\n\n==Club career==\n===Nottingham Forest===\nBorn in [[Northampton]], Northamptonshire, Mills played for a local village team before being spotted by a [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] scout at the age of 11.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jonathan

He played in the [[Premier League]] and [[the Football League]] for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and managed in the Football League with Notts County and [[York City F.C.|York City]].\n\nMills, who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] and as a [[midfielder]], started his career with [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club Nottingham Forest. He became the club's youngest league player after making his first-team debut at the age of 16 in 1978. He played in the victorious [[1980 European Cup Final]], which made him the youngest finalist in [[European Cup]] history. He joined the [[Seattle Sounders (1974\u201383)|Seattle Sounders]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] in 1982 and played for them for one season, which culminated in a loss to the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]] in [[Soccer Bowl '82]]. While with them Mills had a [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Derby County, making 23 appearances for the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club. He returned to Forest in 1983, and made 168 appearances over two spells at the club. He left for their rivals, Notts County of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], in 1987. Mills then joined Leicester City in 1989, and after two unsuccessful forays into the [[EFL Championship play-offs|First Division play-offs]] he helped them win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League in 1994. He soon returned to County, by this time playing in the First Division, after 232 appearances for Leicester. Here Mills earned the last honour of his playing career, winning the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] in 1995. He retired from professional football in 1996 due to an injury, having made 159 appearances for County over two spells.\n\nHe started his managerial career as [[Player-coach#Player-managers in association football|player-manager]] with [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]] in 1996. He left the club after leading them to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Midland Division title in his second season. He then served as player-manager at Southern League Premier Division club [[King's Lynn F.C.|King's Lynn]] from 1998 to 2000, which was brought to an end after he resigned. He was appointed player-manager of Southern League Premier Division club [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] in 2001, before leaving to join the coaching staff at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 2002. Mills was handed his first managerial role in [[English Football League|the Football League]] with Notts County in 2004, but was dismissed several months after the club was relegated to [[EFL League Two|League Two]]. He managed [[Alfreton Town F.C.|Alfreton Town]] of the [[Conference North]] from 2005 to 2007 when he returned to Tamworth. The club was relegated from the [[Conference National]] before Mills led them to the Conference North title in 2009. He left Tamworth in 2010 to become manager of their [[Conference Premier]] rivals York City. Mills oversaw York's victories in the [[FA Trophy]] and Conference Premier play-offs in 2012, the latter resulting in promotion to League Two. He was dismissed by York in 2013 before taking over at [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]], and after leading them to the Conference Premier play-offs in 2014 he was named the Non-League Manager of the Year. Mills took over as manager of their National League rivals [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in 2015, but was dismissed the following year.\n\n==Club career==\n===Nottingham Forest===\nBorn in

It is also the [[List of cities in Burkina Faso#10 largest cities|country's largest city]], with a population of 2,200,000 in 2015. The city's name is often shortened to ''Ouaga''. The inhabitants are called ''ouagalais''. The spelling of the name ''Ouagadougou'' is derived from the [[French orthography]] common in former [[French African colonies]].\n\nOuagadougou's primary industries are food processing and textiles. It is served by an [[Ouagadougou Airport|international airport]] and is linked by rail to [[Abidjan]] in the [[Ivory Coast]] and, for freight only, to [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]]. There are several highways linking the city to [[Niamey]], [[Niger]], south to Ghana, and southwest to [[Ivory Coast]]. Ouagadougou has one of West Africa's largest markets, which burned down in 2003 and has since reopened with better facilities and improved fire-prevention measures. Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso, the Moro-Naba Palace (site of the [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]]), the [[National Museum of Music (Burkina Faso)|National Museum of Music]], and several craft markets.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ouagadougou}}\n[[File:NE 1200ad.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Europe, Africa and the Near East in 1200, showing the [[Mossi Kingdoms|Kingdom of Wagadugu]] (in West Africa, just to the right of the area labeled '25') and its neighbors.]]\nThe name ''Ouagadougou'' dates back to the 15th century when the Ninsi tribes inhabited the area.<ref> Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Ouagadougou Ouagadougou], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> They were in constant conflict until 1441 when Wubri, a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in [[Burkina Faso]]'s history, led his tribe to victory.

Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin, Kamsaoghin, Koulouba, Moemmin, Niogsin, Paspanga, Peuloghin, Bilbalogho, and Tiendpalogo. Seventeen villages comprise the Ouagadougou metropolitan area, which is about {{convert|219.3|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe population of this area is estimated at 1,475,000, 48% of whom are men and 52% women. The rural population is about 5% and the urban population about 95% of the total, and the density is 6,727 inhabitants per square kilometre, according to the 2006 census.\n\nOuagadougou's communes have invested in huge city-management projects. This is largely because Ouagadougou constitutes a 'cultural centre' by merit of holding the [[SIAO]] (International Arts and Crafts fair) and the [[FESPACO]] (Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou).

It is also the [[List of cities in Burkina Faso#10 largest cities|country's largest city]], with a population of 2,200,000 in 2015. The city's name is often shortened to ''Ouaga''. The inhabitants are called ''ouagalais''. The spelling of the name ''Ouagadougou'' is derived from the [[French orthography]] common in former [[French African colonies]].\n\nOuagadougou's primary industries are food processing and textiles. It is served by an [[Ouagadougou Airport|international airport]] and is linked by rail to [[Abidjan]] in the [[Ivory Coast]] and, for freight only, to [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]]. There are several highways linking the city to [[Niamey]], [[Niger]], south to Ghana, and southwest to [[Ivory Coast]]. Ouagadougou has one of West Africa's largest markets, which burned down in 2003 and has since reopened with better facilities and improved fire-prevention measures. Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso, the Moro-Naba Palace (site of the [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]]), the [[National Museum of Music (Burkina Faso)|National Museum of Music]], and several craft markets.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ouagadougou}}\n[[File:NE 1200ad.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Europe, Africa and the Near East in 1200, showing the [[Mossi Kingdoms|Kingdom of Wagadugu]] (in West Africa, just to the right of the area labeled '25') and its neighbors.]]\nThe name ''Ouagadougou'' dates back to the 15th century when the Ninsi tribes inhabited the area.<ref> Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Ouagadougou Ouagadougou], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> They were in constant conflict until 1441 when Wubri, a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in [[Burkina Faso]]'s history, led his tribe to victory. He then renamed the area from \"Kumbee-Tenga\", as the Ninsi had called it, to \"Wage sabre soba koumbem tenga\", meaning \"head war chief's village\". ''Ouagadougou'' is a [[Francophone]] spelling of the name.\n[[File:Memorial ouaga2000 crop.jpg|thumb| Monument des H\u00e9ros Nationaux]]\nThe city became the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Mossi Empire]] in 1441 and became the permanent residence of the Mossi emperors (Moro-Naba) in 1681.<ref name=\"wikifr\">[[:fr:Ouagadougou]]</ref> The [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]] is still performed every Friday by the Moro-Naba and his court. In 1919 the French made Ouagadougou the capital of the [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] territory (basically the same area as contemporary Burkina Faso). In 1954 the railroad line from [[Ivory Coast]] reached the city. Ouagadougou's population doubled from 1954 to 1960 and has been doubling about every ten years since.<ref name=\"wikifr\"/>\n\nOn 15 January 2016, gunmen armed with heavy weapons [[2016 Ouagadougou attacks|attacked central Ouagadougou]] at the Cappuccino restaurant and the Splendid Hotel. 28 people were killed,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35330169|title=Ouagadougou blasts: Burkina Faso capital hit by gunfire|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"France24\">{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20160115-shots-explosions-heard-hotel-burkina-faso-capital-ouagadougou|title=Gunmen attack hotel, take hostages in Burkina Faso capital|date=15 January 2015}}</ref> and at least 56 wounded; after a government counterattack, a total of 176 hostages were released<ref>{{Cite web|title=Burkina Faso: Security forces raid besieged hotel, free hostages|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/africa/burkina-faso-hotel-terrorist-attack/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref> the morning after the initial attack. Three of the perpetrators were also killed.\n\n\nOn July 5th 2019, the city won the [[2019 Drakesfield\u2019s]]award for the most interesting city name.\n\n==Geography==\nOuagadougou, situated on the central plateau ({{coord|12.4|N|1.5|W}}), grew around the imperial palace of the [[Mogho Naaba]]. An administrative centre of colonial rule, it became an important urban centre in the post-colonial era. First the capital of the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] and later of Upper Volta and Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou became a veritable communal centre in 1995.\n\n==Climate==\n{{see also|Burkina Faso#Geography and climate}}\nOuagadougou's climate is [[hot semi-arid climate|hot semi-arid]] (''BSh'') under [[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification]], and closely borders with [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]] (''Aw'').

The maximum temperature during the hot season, which runs from March to May, can reach {{convert|43|\u00b0C|0}}. The [[harmattan]] (a dry wind) and the [[monsoon]] are the two main factors that determine Ouagadougou's climate.

Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin, Kamsaoghin, Koulouba, Moemmin, Niogsin, Paspanga, Peuloghin, Bilbalogho, and Tiendpalogo. Seventeen villages comprise the Ouagadougou metropolitan area, which is about {{convert|219.3|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe population of this area is estimated at 1,475,000, 48% of whom are men and 52% women. The rural population is about 5% and the urban population about 95% of the total, and the density is 6,727 inhabitants per square kilometre, according to the 2006 census.\n\nOuagadougou's communes have invested in huge city-management projects. This is largely because Ouagadougou constitutes a 'cultural centre' by merit of holding the [[SIAO]] (International Arts and Crafts fair) and the [[FESPACO]] (Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou). Moreover, the villages' growing affluence allows for such investment, and the population's rapid growth necessitates it.<ref name=\"Com\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ The Arrondissements of Ouagadougou\n|-\n!
