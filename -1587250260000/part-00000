In the cars/motorcycle ring the lanes are banked at such a degree that a driver in the outer most lane doesn't need to turn the wheel while driving at speeds of up to {{Convert|240|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. In essence, at the so-called neutral speed which is different for the four lanes, one can drive as if in a straight lane. However extremely fast cars still require the steering wheel to be turned when going faster than the maximum neutral speed. For example the [[Koenigsegg CCR]] which set a speed record for a production car at the Nard\u00f2 Ring did so with the steering wheel at a 30\u00b0 angle. This speed record has since been beaten by the [[Bugatti Veyron]] at Volkswagen Group's private  [[Ehra-Lessien]] straight line test track in Germany, and hence the CCR only holds the speed record for the Nard\u00f2 Ring. In the process of fighting a turn as needed when going faster than the neutral speed quite a bit of potential top speed is lost and hence a fast car will go faster in a straight line than what is possible on the Nard\u00f3 Ring. Even at the neutral speed, in a banked turn a car runs a bit heavier than it would in a straight line, since the downforce created by the banking increases the rolling resistance on the tires.

Brock [https://archive.org/stream/TheBibleInTheSyriacTradition/BrockTheBibleInTheSyriacTradition#page/n7/mode/2up The Bible in the Syriac Tradition] St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute, 1988. Quote Page 13: \"The Peshitta Old Testament was translated directly from the original Hebrew text, and the Peshitta New Testament directly from the original Greek\"</ref> This New Testament, originally excluding certain [[Antilegomena|disputed books]] ([[2 Peter]], [[2 John]], [[3 John]], [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]], [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]), had become a standard by the early 5th century. The five excluded books were added in the [[Harklean Version]] (616 AD) of [[Thomas of Harqel]].<ref>Geoffrey W. Bromiley The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z 1995\u2013 Page 976 \"Printed editions of the Peshitta frequently contain these books in order to fill the gaps. D. Harklean Version. The Harklean version is connected with the labors of Thomas of Harqel. When thousands were fleeing Khosrou's invading armies, ...\"</ref> However, the 1905 United Bible Society Peshitta used new editions prepared by the Irish Syriacist [[John Gwynn (Syriacist)|John Gwynn]] for the missing books.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name 'Peshitta' is derived from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''mappaqt\u00e2 p\u0161\u00ee\u1e6dt\u00e2'' (\u0721\u0726\u0729\u072c\u0710 \u0726\u072b\u071d\u071b\u072c\u0710), literally meaning 'simple version'. However, it is also possible to translate ''p\u0161\u00ee\u1e6dt\u00e2'' as 'common' (that is, for all people), or 'straight', as well as the usual translation as 'simple'. Syriac is a dialect, or group of dialects, of Eastern [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], originating around [[Edessa]]. It is written in the [[Syriac alphabet]], and is transliterated into the [[Latin script]] in a number of ways, generating different spellings of the name: Peshitta, Peshitt\u00e2, Pshitta, P\u0161itt\u00e2, Pshitto, Fshitto. All of these are acceptable, but 'Peshitta' is the most conventional spelling in English.\n\n== Brief history of the Peshitta ==\nThe Peshitta had from the 5th century onward a wide circulation in the East, and was accepted and honored by the whole diversity of sects of Syriac Christianity. It had a great missionary influence: the Armenian and Georgian versions, as well as the Arabic and the Persian, owe not a little to the Syriac. The famous [[Nestorian Stele|Nestorian tablet]] of [[Chang'an]] witnesses to the presence of the Syriac scriptures in the heart of China in the 8th century. The Peshitta was first brought to the West by [[Moses of Mardin|Moses of Mindin]], a noted Syrian ecclesiastic who unsuccessfully sought a patron for the work of printing it in Rome and Venice. However, he was successful in finding such a patron in the [[Chancellor of Austria#Habsburg Monarchy|Imperial Chancellor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at Vienna in 1555\u2014Albert Widmanstadt. He undertook the printing of the New Testament, and the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] bore the cost of the special types which had to be cast for its issue in Syriac. [[Immanuel Tremellius]], the converted Jew whose scholarship was so valuable to the English reformers and divines, made use of it, and in 1569 issued a Syriac New Testament in Hebrew letters. In 1645, the ''editio princeps'' of the Old Testament was prepared by [[Gabriel Sionita]] for the Paris Polyglot, and in 1657 the whole Peshitta found a place in Walton's ''[[London Polyglot]]''. For long the best edition of the Peshitta was that of John Leusden and Karl Schaaf, and it is still quoted under the symbol \"Syrschaaf\", or \"SyrSch\".\n\n== New Testament Peshitta ==\n\nWhen the earliest extant New Testament Peshitta text, the [[Khabouris Codex]] was found, the news article \"US Library gets an Ancient Bible\" appeared in the New York Times on March 26, 1955 reporting on the oldest known New Testament Bible written in \"the language used by Christ,\" which would be a neat trick since the manuscript in question wasn't obtained until 1966. The article noted that it was taken to the White House where President Eisenhower viewed it. The Codex was said to be insured for \"an hour and a half\" in the amount of $1,500,000 US dollars.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/03/26/archives/u-s-library-gets-an-ancient-bible-oldest-known-copy-of-new.html |title = U. S.

Meanwhile, in 137 instances it differs from both, usually with the support of the Old Syriac and the Old Latin, and in 31 instances it stands alone.<ref name = Metzger>[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations'' (Oxford University Press 1977), p. 50.</ref>\n\nTo this end, and in reference to the originality of the Peshitta, the words of Patriarch [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] are summarized as follows:\n:''\"With reference to....the originality of the Peshitta text, as the Patriarch and Head of the Holy Apostolic and Catholic Church of the East, we wish to state, that the Church of the East received the scriptures from the hands of the blessed Apostles themselves in the Aramaic original, the language spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and that the Peshitta is the text of the Church of the East which has come down from the Biblical times without any change or revision.\"''<ref>His Holiness Mar Eshai Shimun, Catholicos Patriarch of the Holy Apostolic Catholic Church of the East. April 5, 1957</ref>\n\nIn the first century CE, [[Josephus]], the Jewish historian, testified that Aramaic was widely spoken and understood accurately by [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Babylonians]], the remotest Arabians, and those of his nation beyond Euphrates with Adiabeni. He says:\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have proposed to myself, for the sake of such as live under the government of the Romans, '''to translate those books into the Greek tongue, which I formerly composed in the language of our country, and sent to the Upper Barbarians'''. Joseph, the son of Matthias, by birth a Hebrew, a priest also, and one who at first fought against the Romans myself, and was forced to be present at what was done afterwards, [am the author of this work],\"</p>\n<p>Jewish Wars (Book 1, Preface, Paragraph 1)(1:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\nand continuing,\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I thought it therefore an absurd thing to see the truth falsified in affairs of such great consequence, and to take no notice of it; but to suffer those Greeks and Romans that were not in the wars to be ignorant of these things, and to read either flatteries or fictions, '''while the Parthians, and the Babylonians, and the remotest Arabians, and those of our nation beyond Euphrates, with the Adiabeni, by my means, knew accurately both whence the war begun, what miseries it brought upon us, and after what manner it ended'''.\"</p>\n<p>Jewish Wars (Book 1 Preface, Paragraph 2) (1:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\nYigael Yadin, an archeologist working on the [[Qumran]] find, also agrees with Josephus' testimony, pointing out that Aramaic was the ''lingua franca'' of this time period.<ref>\"Bar Kokhba: The rediscovery of the legendary hero of the last Jewish Revolt Against Imperial Rome\", 234</ref> Josephus' testimony on Aramaic is also supported by the gospel accounts of the New Testament (specifically in Matthew 4:24-25, Mark 3:7-8, and Luke 6:17), in which people from Galilee, Judaea, Jerusalem, Idumaea, Tyre, Sidon, Syria, Decapolis, and \"from beyond Jordan\" came to see Jesus for healing and to hear his discourse.\n\nA statement by [[Eusebius]] that [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] \"made some quotations from the Gospel according to the Hebrews and from the Syriac Gospel,\" means we should have a reference to a Syriac New Testament as early as 160\u2013180 AD, the time of that Hebrew Christian writer. The translation of the New Testament is careful, faithful and literal, and the simplicity, directness and transparency of the style are admired by all Syriac scholars and have earned it the title of \"Queen of the versions.\"<ref name=\"bible-researcher1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/syriac-isbe.html|title=Syriac Versions of the Bible, by Thomas Nicol|website=www.bible-researcher.com|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\n==Critical Edition of the New Testament==\n\nThe standard [[United Bible Societies]] 1905 edition of the New Testament of the Peshitta was based on editions prepared by Syriacists [[Philip E.

The project was founded by Philip E. Pusey who started the collation work in 1872. However, he could not see it to completion since he died in 1880. Gwilliam,</ref> These editions comprised Gwilliam & Pusey's 1901 critical edition of the gospels, Gwilliam's critical edition of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], Gwilliam & Pinkerton's critical edition of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's Epistles]] and John Gwynn's critical edition of the General Epistles and later Revelation. This critical Peshitta text is based on a collation of more than seventy Peshitta and a few other Aramaic manuscripts. All 27 books of the common Western [[Canon of the New Testament]] are included in this British & Foreign Bible Society's 1905 Peshitta edition, as is the [[adultery pericope]] (John 7:53\u20138:11).

universal, is that the [[Old Testament]] of the Peshitta was translated into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] from [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]], probably in the 2nd century AD, and that the [[New Testament]] of the Peshitta was translated from the Greek.<ref>Sebastian P. Brock [https://archive.org/stream/TheBibleInTheSyriacTradition/BrockTheBibleInTheSyriacTradition#page/n7/mode/2up The Bible in the Syriac Tradition] St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute, 1988. Quote Page 13: \"The Peshitta Old Testament was translated directly from the original Hebrew text, and the Peshitta New Testament directly from the original Greek\"</ref> This New Testament, originally excluding certain [[Antilegomena|disputed books]] ([[2 Peter]], [[2 John]], [[3 John]], [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]], [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]), had become a standard by the early 5th century. The five excluded books were added in the [[Harklean Version]] (616 AD) of [[Thomas of Harqel]].<ref>Geoffrey W. Bromiley The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z 1995\u2013 Page 976 \"Printed editions of the Peshitta frequently contain these books in order to fill the gaps. D. Harklean Version. The Harklean version is connected with the labors of Thomas of Harqel. When thousands were fleeing Khosrou's invading armies, ...\"</ref> However, the 1905 United Bible Society Peshitta used new editions prepared by the Irish Syriacist [[John Gwynn (Syriacist)|John Gwynn]] for the missing books.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name 'Peshitta' is derived from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''mappaqt\u00e2 p\u0161\u00ee\u1e6dt\u00e2'' (\u0721\u0726\u0729\u072c\u0710 \u0726\u072b\u071d\u071b\u072c\u0710), literally meaning 'simple version'. However, it is also possible to translate ''p\u0161\u00ee\u1e6dt\u00e2'' as 'common' (that is, for all people), or 'straight', as well as the usual translation as 'simple'. Syriac is a dialect, or group of dialects, of Eastern [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], originating around [[Edessa]]. It is written in the [[Syriac alphabet]], and is transliterated into the [[Latin script]] in a number of ways, generating different spellings of the name: Peshitta, Peshitt\u00e2, Pshitta, P\u0161itt\u00e2, Pshitto, Fshitto. All of these are acceptable, but 'Peshitta' is the most conventional spelling in English.\n\n== Brief history of the Peshitta ==\nThe Peshitta had from the 5th century onward a wide circulation in the East, and was accepted and honored by the whole diversity of sects of Syriac Christianity. It had a great missionary influence: the Armenian and Georgian versions, as well as the Arabic and the Persian, owe not a little to the Syriac. The famous [[Nestorian Stele|Nestorian tablet]] of [[Chang'an]] witnesses to the presence of the Syriac scriptures in the heart of China in the 8th century. The Peshitta was first brought to the West by [[Moses of Mardin|Moses of Mindin]], a noted Syrian ecclesiastic who unsuccessfully sought a patron for the work of printing it in Rome and Venice. However, he was successful in finding such a patron in the [[Chancellor of Austria#Habsburg Monarchy|Imperial Chancellor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at Vienna in 1555\u2014Albert Widmanstadt. He undertook the printing of the New Testament, and the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] bore the cost of the special types which had to be cast for its issue in Syriac. [[Immanuel Tremellius]], the converted Jew whose scholarship was so valuable to the English reformers and divines, made use of it, and in 1569 issued a Syriac New Testament in Hebrew letters. In 1645, the ''editio princeps'' of the Old Testament was prepared by [[Gabriel Sionita]] for the Paris Polyglot, and in 1657 the whole Peshitta found a place in Walton's ''[[London Polyglot]]''. For long the best edition of the Peshitta was that of John Leusden and Karl Schaaf, and it is still quoted under the symbol \"Syrschaaf\", or \"SyrSch\".\n\n== New Testament Peshitta ==\n\nWhen the earliest extant New Testament Peshitta text, the [[Khabouris Codex]] was found, the news article \"US Library gets an Ancient Bible\" appeared in the New York Times on March 26, 1955 reporting on the oldest known New Testament Bible written in \"the language used by Christ.\" The article noted that it was taken to the White House where President Eisenhower viewed it. The Codex was said to be insured for \"an hour and a half\" in the amount of $1,500,000 US dollars.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/03/26/archives/u-s-library-gets-an-ancient-bible-oldest-known-copy-of-new.html |title = U. S. LIBRARY GETS AN ANCIENT BIBLE; Oldest Known Copy of New Testament to Go on View in Washington April 5|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1955-03-26}}</ref> This discovery challenges the long held idea that the Peshitta (Aramaic New Testament Scriptures) were written after the Greek and Hebrew texts, and lending credence to the minority viewpoint held by the Church of the East which itself states to be in possession of the New Testament Scriptures as handed down by the Apostles themselves.\n\nIn a detailed examination of Matthew 1\u201314, Gwilliam found that the Peshitta agrees with the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' only 108 times and with ''[[Codex Vaticanus]]'' 65 times. Meanwhile, in 137 instances it differs from both, usually with the support of the Old Syriac and the Old Latin, and in 31 instances it stands alone.<ref name = Metzger>[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations'' (Oxford University Press 1977), p. 50.</ref>\n\nTo this end, and in reference to the originality of the Peshitta, the words of Patriarch [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] are summarized as follows:\n:''\"With reference to....the originality of the Peshitta text, as the Patriarch and Head of the Holy Apostolic and Catholic Church of the East, we wish to state, that the Church of the East received the scriptures from the hands of the blessed Apostles themselves in the Aramaic original, the language spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and that the Peshitta is the text of the Church of the East which has come down from the Biblical times without any change or revision.\"''<ref>His Holiness Mar Eshai Shimun, Catholicos Patriarch of the Holy Apostolic Catholic Church of the East. April 5, 1957</ref>\n\nIn the first century CE, [[Josephus]], the Jewish historian, testified that Aramaic was widely spoken and understood accurately by [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Babylonians]], the remotest Arabians, and those of his nation beyond Euphrates with Adiabeni. He says:\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have proposed to myself, for the sake of such as live under the government of the Romans, '''to translate those books into the Greek tongue, which I formerly composed in the language of our country, and sent to the Upper Barbarians'''. Joseph, the son of Matthias, by birth a Hebrew, a priest also, and one who at first fought against the Romans myself, and was forced to be present at what was done afterwards, [am the author of this work],\"</p>\n<p>Jewish Wars (Book 1, Preface, Paragraph 1)(1:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\nand continuing,\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I thought it therefore an absurd thing to see the truth falsified in affairs of such great consequence, and to take no notice of it; but to suffer those Greeks and Romans that were not in the wars to be ignorant of these things, and to read either flatteries or fictions, '''while the Parthians, and the Babylonians, and the remotest Arabians, and those of our nation beyond Euphrates, with the Adiabeni, by my means, knew accurately both whence the war begun, what miseries it brought upon us, and after what manner it ended'''.\"</p>\n<p>Jewish Wars (Book 1 Preface, Paragraph 2) (1:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\nYigael Yadin, an archeologist working on the [[Qumran]] find, also agrees with Josephus' testimony, pointing out that Aramaic was the ''lingua franca'' of this time period.<ref>\"Bar Kokhba: The rediscovery of the legendary hero of the last Jewish Revolt Against Imperial Rome\", 234</ref> Josephus' testimony on Aramaic is also supported by the gospel accounts of the New Testament (specifically in Matthew 4:24-25, Mark 3:7-8, and Luke 6:17), in which people from Galilee, Judaea, Jerusalem, Idumaea, Tyre, Sidon, Syria, Decapolis, and \"from beyond Jordan\" came to see Jesus for healing and to hear his discourse.\n\nA statement by [[Eusebius]] that [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] \"made some quotations from the Gospel according to the Hebrews and from the Syriac Gospel,\" means we should have a reference to a Syriac New Testament as early as 160\u2013180 AD, the time of that Hebrew Christian writer. The translation of the New Testament is careful, faithful and literal, and the simplicity, directness and transparency of the style are admired by all Syriac scholars and have earned it the title of \"Queen of the versions.\"<ref name=\"bible-researcher1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/syriac-isbe.html|title=Syriac Versions of the Bible, by Thomas Nicol|website=www.bible-researcher.com|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\n==Critical Edition of the New Testament==\n\nThe standard [[United Bible Societies]] 1905 edition of the New Testament of the Peshitta was based on editions prepared by Syriacists [[Philip E. Pusey]] (d.1880), [[George Gwilliam]] (d.1914) and [[John Gwynn (professor)|John Gwyn]].<ref>''Corpus scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium: Subsidia'' Catholic University of America, 1987 \"37 ff. The project was founded by Philip E. Pusey who started the collation work in 1872. However, he could not see it to completion since he died in 1880. Gwilliam,</ref> These editions comprised Gwilliam & Pusey's 1901 critical edition of the gospels, Gwilliam's critical edition of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], Gwilliam & Pinkerton's critical edition of [[Pauline epistles|Paul's Epistles]] and John Gwynn's critical edition of the General Epistles and later Revelation. This critical Peshitta text is based on a collation of more than seventy Peshitta and a few other Aramaic manuscripts. All 27 books of the common Western [[Canon of the New Testament]] are included in this British & Foreign Bible Society's 1905 Peshitta edition, as is the [[adultery pericope]] (John 7:53\u20138:11). The 1979 Syriac Bible, United Bible Society, uses the same text for its New Testament. The [[Online Bible]] reproduces the 1905 Syriac Peshitta NT in Hebrew characters.\n\n== Peshitta Translations ==\n* James Murdock - ''The New Testament, Or, The Book of the Holy Gospel of Our Lord and God, Jesus the Messiah'' (1851).\n* [[John Wesley Etheridge]] - ''A Literal Translation of the Four Gospels From the Peschito, or Ancient Syriac and The Apostolical Acts and Epistles From the Peschito, or Ancient Syriac: To Which Are Added, the Remaining Epistles and The Book of Revelation, After a Later Syriac Text'' (1849).\n* [[George M.

The series was produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]], directed and written by [[Sayo Yamamoto]] with original scripts by [[Mitsur\u014d Kubo]] under the chief direction of Jun Shishido. Character designs were handled by Tadashi Hiramatsu, and its music was composed by Taro Umebayashi and Taku Matsushiba. The figure skating was choreographed by [[Kenji Miyamoto (figure skater)|Kenji Miyamoto]], who also performed routines himself which were recorded and used as skating sound effects. The series premiered on October 6, 2016 and ended on December 22, with a total of 12 episodes. A ''Yuri on Ice'' feature film, ''Ice Adolescence'', was originally planned for release in 2019, but has been delayed to a later date. The series revolves around the relationships between Japanese figure skater [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Yuri Katsuki|Yuri Katsuki]]; his idol, Russian figure-skating champion [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Victor Nikiforov|Victor Nikiforov]], and up-and-coming Russian skater [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Yuri Plisetsky|Yuri Plisetsky]]; as Yuri K. and Yuri P. take part in the [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Figure Skating Grand Prix]], with Victor acting as coach to Yuri K. YES WE WERE BORN TO SHIP VICTURI!!</onlyinclude>\n\n''Yuri on Ice'' has been well received in Japan. It won three awards at the [[Tokyo Anime Award Festival]], a Japan Character Award, seven awards in [[Crunchyroll]]'s inaugural [[Crunchyroll#The Anime Awards|Anime Awards]], and in 2019 was named by the website's editorial team as one of the top 25 anime of the 2010s. In Japan, the series was released in six parts on Blu-ray and DVD, with all the releases coming No. 1 on the [[Oricon]] Animation Blu-ray disc and Animation DVD disc rankings respectively. It was the eighth-most successful media franchise in Japan for 2017, had the second-highest combined Blu-ray and DVD sales of any anime in Japan for 2017, and had the highest combined sales for a TV anime that year. It was popular on social media outlets such as [[Tumblr]], [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Twitter]], where it received over a million more tweets than the next most-talked about anime series in the season it was broadcast. It also attracted praise from professional figure skaters, with some skaters in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] performing to music from the show.\n\n''Yuri on Ice'' has raised discussion concerning its depiction of a same-sex relationship between its protagonists, with some critics praising it for covering homosexuality in a way that differs from most anime and manga such as the [[yaoi]] genre, and for dealing with homosexuality in a country and sport that has present-day issues with homophobia. Others criticized its depiction for being unrealistic, and of visual censorship that arguably makes it ambiguous to some viewers. The series has also been praised for its depiction of [[anxiety]], and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating-based title to be released in the United States in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Yuri on Ice characters|List of Yuri on Ice episodes}} \nAfter a crushing defeat in the [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] and other competition losses, 23-year-old Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki develops mixed feelings about skating and puts his career on hold; returning to his hometown of Hasetsu in [[Kyushu]]. Yuri visits his childhood friend, Yuko, at an ice rink (Ice Castle Hasetsu) and perfectly mimics an advanced skating routine performed by his idol: Russian figure skating champion Victor Nikiforov. When secretly recorded footage of Yuri's performance is uploaded to the internet, it catches Victor's attention, and he travels to Kyushu with an offer to coach Yuri and revive his figure-skating career.{{efn|name=Episode 1|{{cite episode|title=Nan no Piroshiki!!

Victor had promised he would choreograph a routine specifically for Yuri P. if he won the Junior World Championships, which Yuri P. presumably did. Victor, having forgotten about his promise to Yuri P., makes the two Yuris compete against each other to decide who he will coach. He chooses two songs for the skaters, both with the same melody but with a different meaning. The first song, \"[[Agape]]\", was about unconditional love, and is given to Yuri P.

Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if ''Yuri on Ice'' will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps.<ref name=\"Geekiary\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition.{{efn|name=Episode 12}}<ref name=\"Anime UK News 2\"/> Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning [[LGBT rights]].<ref name=\"Anime UK News 1\"/>\n\n''Yuri on Ice'' differs from other anime covering same-sex relationships, such as [[yaoi]] and [[yuri (genre)|yuri]]. Carli Velocci of ''[[Geek.com]]'' wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Their relationship exists somewhere beyond any sexuality, meaning it doesn't fall into the same traps that a lot of yuri and yaoi relationships do ... While this isn't the first anime with a same-sex couple at the forefront, it's one of the first to present a story that isn't strictly sexual and is mutual. Yuri and Victor complement each other, but both also admit that they've grown as people because of the presence of the other. The equality in their relationship is revolutionary, even if it wasn't the first to depict one. You can assign the [[Yaoi#Seme and uke|\"seme\" or \"uke\"]] label to Victor and Yuri, but when it comes to their psychological bond, it's more equal ... Yuri and Victor aren't just another gay anime couple. They're almost real.<ref>{{cite web|last=Velocci |first=Carli |url=https://www.geek.com/television/yuri-on-ice-is-a-non-traditional-gay-anime-romance-1683540/ |title='Yuri on Ice' is a Non-Traditional Gay Anime Romance |publisher=Geek.com |date=December 27, 2016 |accessdate=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228140621/http://www.geek.com/television/yuri-on-ice-is-a-non-traditional-gay-anime-romance-1683540/ |archivedate=December 28, 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA review in ''[[Otaku USA]]'' has argued that the skaters take on an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] appearance when they are performing, saying:\n\n<blockquote>While on ice in the series proper, the main performers often take on an androgynous appearance to feed the show's substance. Yuri's evolution in terms of confidence and capabilities is at the core of the plot, but the heart lies in Yuri's exploration of his feminine side via emotional expression. ... Gender roles are further addressed via Viktor's {{sic}} lines of encouragement to Yuri that, at least as translated, imply both skating direction and romantic suggestion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ink|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Yuri-on-Ice-is-chockfull-of-memorable-characters-a-8626.aspx|title=Yuri!!! on Ice is chockfull of memorable characters and masterful choreography.|publisher=Otaku USA|date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Criticism====\nThe relationship has also been criticized as unrealistic, with Yuri K. and Victor not receiving the homophobic abuse they would experience in real life.<ref name=\"Episode 10\"/> Others have remarked that some viewers might refuse to acknowledge the relationship because the homosexuality was not explicit. Although the \"kiss\" is obscured by Victor's arm, it is implicit.{{efn|name=Episode 7}} Cecilia D'Anastasio of ''[[Kotaku]]'' wondered why the \"kiss\" was blocked when other anime, such as ''[[From the New World (novel)|From the New World]]'', had depicted gay kisses.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/>\n\nWolf of ''Anime UK News'' originally said of the scene that: \"I'm 99.999% sure the kiss did occur, but that 0.001% is horribly getting to me. I don't want to go by what everyone else sees \u2013 I want to see what is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters at the same time as them\".<ref name=\"Anime UK News 1\"/> However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted:\n\n<blockquote>If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than [[subtext]] \u2013 but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off.<ref name=\"Anime UK News 2\"/></blockquote>\n\n==''Love on Ice'' controversy==\nIn January 2017 the [[Hallmark Channel]] announced the release of a TV movie, ''Love on Ice'', about the relationship between a female figure skater in a career slump and her new male coach. It was seen by some fans of ''Yuri on Ice'' as [[plagiarism]] due to plot similarities, and Hallmark was accused of trying to \"straightwash\" the relationship between Yuri Katsuki and Victor Nikiforov. Fans of ''Yuri on Ice'' responded to ''Love on Ice'' by posting a [[Change.org]] petition demanding an explanation of the similarities between the two stories and hijacking ''Love on Ice''{{'s}} [[IMDb]] page to contain the plot summary of ''Yuri on Ice''. The similarity between the stories is apparently coincidental, since ''Love on Ice'' began filming in early November 2016 (about a month after ''Yuri on Ice'' began broadcasting).<ref name=\"Love on Ice\">{{cite web|last=Baker-Whitelaw |first=Gavia |url=http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/yuri-love-on-ice-hallmark-channel-movie/ |title=Anime fans accuse Hallmark Channel of copying 'Yuri on Ice' |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=January 3, 2017 |accessdate=January 3, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104144619/http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/yuri-love-on-ice-hallmark-channel-movie/ |archivedate=January 4, 2017 }}</ref> According to Hallmark, no one involved in the making of ''Love on Ice'' had heard of ''Yuri on Ice''.

The series was produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]], directed and written by [[Sayo Yamamoto]] with original scripts by [[Mitsur\u014d Kubo]] under the chief direction of Jun Shishido. Character designs were handled by Tadashi Hiramatsu, and its music was composed by Taro Umebayashi and Taku Matsushiba. The figure skating was choreographed by [[Kenji Miyamoto (figure skater)|Kenji Miyamoto]], who also performed routines himself which were recorded and used as skating sound effects. The series premiered on October 6, 2016 and ended on December 22, with a total of 12 episodes. A ''Yuri on Ice'' feature film, ''Ice Adolescence'', was originally planned for release in 2019, but has been delayed to a later date. The series revolves around the relationships between Japanese figure skater [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Yuri Katsuki|Yuri Katsuki]]; his idol, Russian figure-skating champion [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Victor Nikiforov|Victor Nikiforov]], and up-and-coming Russian skater [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Yuri Plisetsky|Yuri Plisetsky]]; as Yuri K. and Yuri P. take part in the [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Figure Skating Grand Prix]], with Victor acting as coach to Yuri K.</onlyinclude>\n\n''Yuri on Ice'' has been well received in Japan. It won three awards at the [[Tokyo Anime Award Festival]], a Japan Character Award, seven awards in [[Crunchyroll]]'s inaugural [[Crunchyroll#The Anime Awards|Anime Awards]], and in 2019 was named by the website's editorial team as one of the top 25 anime of the 2010s. In Japan, the series was released in six parts on Blu-ray and DVD, with all the releases coming No. 1 on the [[Oricon]] Animation Blu-ray disc and Animation DVD disc rankings respectively. It was the eighth-most successful media franchise in Japan for 2017, had the second-highest combined Blu-ray and DVD sales of any anime in Japan for 2017, and had the highest combined sales for a TV anime that year. It was popular on social media outlets such as [[Tumblr]], [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Twitter]], where it received over a million more tweets than the next most-talked about anime series in the season it was broadcast. It also attracted praise from professional figure skaters, with some skaters in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] performing to music from the show.\n\n''Yuri on Ice'' has raised discussion concerning its depiction of a same-sex relationship between its protagonists, with some critics praising it for covering homosexuality in a way that differs from most anime and manga such as the [[yaoi]] genre, and for dealing with homosexuality in a country and sport that has present-day issues with homophobia. Others criticized its depiction for being unrealistic, and of visual censorship that arguably makes it ambiguous to some viewers. The series has also been praised for its depiction of [[anxiety]], and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating-based title to be released in the United States in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Yuri on Ice characters|List of Yuri on Ice episodes}} \nAfter a crushing defeat in the [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] and other competition losses, 23-year-old Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki develops mixed feelings about skating and puts his career on hold; returning to his hometown of Hasetsu in [[Kyushu]]. Yuri visits his childhood friend, Yuko, at an ice rink (Ice Castle Hasetsu) and perfectly mimics an advanced skating routine performed by his idol: Russian figure skating champion Victor Nikiforov. When secretly recorded footage of Yuri's performance is uploaded to the internet, it catches Victor's attention, and he travels to Kyushu with an offer to coach Yuri and revive his figure-skating career.{{efn|name=Episode 1|{{cite episode|title=Nan no Piroshiki!!

Victor had promised he would choreograph a routine specifically for Yuri P. if he won the Junior World Championships, which Yuri P. presumably did. Victor, having forgotten about his promise to Yuri P., makes the two Yuris compete against each other to decide who he will coach. He chooses two songs for the skaters, both with the same melody but with a different meaning. The first song, \"[[Agape]]\", was about unconditional love, and is given to Yuri P. The second song, \"Eros,\" is about sexual love, and is given to Yuri K.{{efn|name=Episode 2|{{cite episode|title=Futari no Y\u016bri! ?

Carli Velocci of ''[[Geek.com]]'' wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Their relationship exists somewhere beyond any sexuality, meaning it doesn't fall into the same traps that a lot of yuri and yaoi relationships do ... While this isn't the first anime with a same-sex couple at the forefront, it's one of the first to present a story that isn't strictly sexual and is mutual. Yuri and Victor complement each other, but both also admit that they've grown as people because of the presence of the other. The equality in their relationship is revolutionary, even if it wasn't the first to depict one. You can assign the [[Yaoi#Seme and uke|\"seme\" or \"uke\"]] label to Victor and Yuri, but when it comes to their psychological bond, it's more equal ... Yuri and Victor aren't just another gay anime couple. They're almost real.<ref>{{cite web|last=Velocci |first=Carli |url=https://www.geek.com/television/yuri-on-ice-is-a-non-traditional-gay-anime-romance-1683540/ |title='Yuri on Ice' is a Non-Traditional Gay Anime Romance |publisher=Geek.com |date=December 27, 2016 |accessdate=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228140621/http://www.geek.com/television/yuri-on-ice-is-a-non-traditional-gay-anime-romance-1683540/ |archivedate=December 28, 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA review in ''[[Otaku USA]]'' has argued that the skaters take on an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] appearance when they are performing, saying:\n\n<blockquote>While on ice in the series proper, the main performers often take on an androgynous appearance to feed the show's substance. Yuri's evolution in terms of confidence and capabilities is at the core of the plot, but the heart lies in Yuri's exploration of his feminine side via emotional expression. ... Gender roles are further addressed via Viktor's {{sic}} lines of encouragement to Yuri that, at least as translated, imply both skating direction and romantic suggestion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ink|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Yuri-on-Ice-is-chockfull-of-memorable-characters-a-8626.aspx|title=Yuri!!! on Ice is chockfull of memorable characters and masterful choreography.|publisher=Otaku USA|date=February 4, 2017|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Criticism====\nThe relationship has also been criticized as unrealistic, with Yuri K. and Victor not receiving the homophobic abuse they would experience in real life.<ref name=\"Episode 10\"/> Others have remarked that some viewers might refuse to acknowledge the relationship because the homosexuality was not explicit. Although the \"kiss\" is obscured by Victor's arm, it is implicit.{{efn|name=Episode 7}} Cecilia D'Anastasio of ''[[Kotaku]]'' wondered why the \"kiss\" was blocked when other anime, such as ''[[From the New World (novel)|From the New World]]'', had depicted gay kisses.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/>\n\nWolf of ''Anime UK News'' originally said of the scene that: \"I'm 99.999% sure the kiss did occur, but that 0.001% is horribly getting to me. I don't want to go by what everyone else sees \u2013 I want to see what is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters at the same time as them\".<ref name=\"Anime UK News 1\"/> However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted:\n\n<blockquote>If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than [[subtext]] \u2013 but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off.<ref name=\"Anime UK News 2\"/></blockquote>\n\n==''Love on Ice'' controversy==\nIn January 2017 the [[Hallmark Channel]] announced the release of a TV movie, ''Love on Ice'', about the relationship between a female figure skater in a career slump and her new male coach. It was seen by some fans of ''Yuri on Ice'' as [[plagiarism]] due to plot similarities, and Hallmark was accused of trying to \"straightwash\" the relationship between Yuri Katsuki and Victor Nikiforov. Fans of ''Yuri on Ice'' responded to ''Love on Ice'' by posting a [[Change.org]] petition demanding an explanation of the similarities between the two stories and hijacking ''Love on Ice''{{'s}} [[IMDb]] page to contain the plot summary of ''Yuri on Ice''. The similarity between the stories is apparently coincidental, since ''Love on Ice'' began filming in early November 2016 (about a month after ''Yuri on Ice'' began broadcasting).<ref name=\"Love on Ice\">{{cite web|last=Baker-Whitelaw |first=Gavia |url=http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/yuri-love-on-ice-hallmark-channel-movie/ |title=Anime fans accuse Hallmark Channel of copying 'Yuri on Ice' |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=January 3, 2017 |accessdate=January 3, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104144619/http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/yuri-love-on-ice-hallmark-channel-movie/ |archivedate=January 4, 2017 }}</ref> According to Hallmark, no one involved in the making of ''Love on Ice'' had heard of ''Yuri on Ice''.

Dubbed the \"[[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] of the West\"  by some authors (a term described as one that \"serves the novelist better than the historian\")<ref>Edrington, p. 4</ref>, it was intended as the decisive blow by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces to break the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] possession of the West along the base of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was fought at [[Glorieta Pass]] in the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] in what is now [[New Mexico]], and was an important event in the history of the [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War]].\n\nThere was a skirmish on March 26 between advance elements from each army, with the main battle occurring on March 28. Although the Confederates were able to push the Union force back through the pass, they had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses and mules killed or driven off. Eventually the Confederates had to withdraw entirely from the territory back into [[Confederate Arizona]] and then [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]]. Glorieta Pass thus represented the climax of the campaign.\n\n==New Mexico Campaign==\n{{Main|New Mexico Campaign}}\nThe lower portion of the New Mexico Territory had been largely neglected by both the federal government and the territorial government in Santa Fe. As a result, Confederate sympathy was strong, in hopes of receiving better treatment by the new government. Following [[Secession in the United States|secession]] moves by residents, Confederate forces seized Mesilla and captured the federal troops there, who made a halfhearted attempt to retreat to Santa Fe. In early 1862 the Confederacy established the [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Confederate Arizona Territory]], which included the southern halves of both modern [[Arizona]] and New Mexico. The territorial capital was at [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]], some {{convert|45|mi}} from El Paso and near today's major city of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. The strategic goals were to gain access to the gold and silver mines of California and the [[Colorado Territory]] and the seaports in [[Southern California]], and thus evade the Union naval blockade.<ref>Frazier, p. 75</ref><ref>Whitlock, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe commanders of the New Mexico Campaign were Confederate [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]] and  Union [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Canby]]. Sibley attempted to capture [[Fort Craig]], completely outmaneuvering Canby at the [[Battle of Valverde]] in February and driving him back into his fort, but failed to force Canby's surrender. Sibley then bypassed the fort and advanced north through the [[Rio Grande]] Valley, occupying [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. Canby remained at Fort Craig, hoping to cut Sibley's logistical support from Texas and awaiting reinforcements before he dared to take the offensive. Sibley made his headquarters at the abandoned Union storehouse at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].\n\nIn March Sibley sent a Confederate force of 200-300 [[Texas|Texans]] under the command of [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] [[Charles L. Pyron]] on an advance expedition over the [[Glorieta Pass]], a strategic location on the [[Santa Fe Trail]] at the southern tip of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] southeast of Santa Fe.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and make an assault on [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], a Union stronghold on the route northward over [[Raton Pass]]. Sibley sent six companies under the command of Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.<ref>Frazier, p. 199</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union (North)===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Union Army|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Confederate Army|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:glorietapass.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Glorieta Pass: actions on March 28\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}]]\n\nThe Confederates were led by<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfg02|title=GLORIETA, BATTLE OF &#124; The Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)|publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-18}}</ref> Charles L. Pyron and [[William Read Scurry]]. During the battle on March 26, Pyron had his battalion of the [[2nd Texas Mounted Rifles]],<ref>This battalion also included companies of Arizona Confederates.</ref> four companies of the [[5th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons. Scurry's force included nine companies of the [[4th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the [[7th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three additional cannons.\n\nThe Union forces were led by Col. [[John P. Slough]] of the [[1st Colorado Infantry]], with units under the command of Maj. [[John M. Chivington]]. In the action on March 26, Chivington had three infantry companies and one mounted company of the 1st Colorado and a detachment of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st]] and [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd]] U.S. Cavalry regiments.<ref>Whitlock, p. 171</ref> During the main battle on the 28th, Slough commanded, in person, nine companies of the 1st Colorado, a detachment from the 1st, [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd]] and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments and two artillery batteries.<ref>Frazier, pp. 205, 215</ref> Chivington commanded five companies of the 5th U.S. Infantry, one company from the 1st Colorado, [[James Hobart Ford]]'s independent company from the 2nd Colorado and some New Mexico militiamen.<ref>Whitlock, p. 188</ref>\n\nPrior to the battle Union forces performed a forced march from [[Denver]], over [[Raton Pass]], to Fort Union and then to Glorieta Pass, covering the distance of {{convert|400|mi|-2}} in 14 days. Combat commenced shortly after their arrival at the battlefield, leaving them little time to recuperate.<ref>Hudnall, p. 291</ref>\n\n===Apache Canyon===\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Action at Apache Canyon.jpg|thumb|Action at Apache Canyon.]]\nPyron's force of 300 camped at Apache Canyon, at one end of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 soldiers to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington's men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their [[Field artillery in the American Civil War|artillery]] fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two sides of the pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about {{convert|1.5|mi}} to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington's men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron's men again and punished them with [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at [[Kozlowski's Ranch]] to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.<ref>Josephy, pp. 79\u201381.</ref><ref>Frazier, pp. 208\u2013210</ref>\n\nNo fighting occurred the next day, as reinforcements arrived for both sides. Scurry's troops arrived at 3:00&nbsp;am on March 27, swelling the Confederate force to about 1,100 men and five cannons; as senior officer present, he took command of the entire Confederate force. Thinking that Slough would attack again and expecting Green to arrive in the Union rear at any time, Scurry chose to remain in place for the day, digging rifle pits.<ref>Frazier, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> Slough arrived early in the morning of March 28 with about 900 more men, bringing the Union strength to 1,300.\n\n===Glorieta Pass===\n[[File:GP Battlefield.jpg|left|thumb|Glorieta Pass battlefield. This photograph was taken in 1990 from Sharpshooter's Ridge, just north of Pigeon's Ranch. It was the location of the Union right flank during the last day's battle.]]\nBoth Scurry and Slough decided to attack on March 28 and set out early to do so. Expecting the Confederates to remain in Apache Canyon, Slough sent Chivington with two infantry battalions, under Lewis and Wynkoop, out in a circling movement with orders to go hide out at Glorieta Pass and hit the Texans in the flank once Slough's main force had engaged their front.<ref>Frazier, p. 214</ref> Chivington did as ordered and his men waited above the pass for Slough and the enemy to arrive. However, instead of remaining at Apache Canyon as Slough had expected, Scurry advanced down the canyon more rapidly than Slough had anticipated. Scurry believed the Union force was retreating to Fort Union. He intended to attack them until Green could arrive. One cannon and a small guard was left at [[Johnson's Ranch]], while the rest of the Confederate force\u2014more than 1000 men\u2014marched eastwards along the Santa Fe Trail.<ref>Frazier, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nWhen Slough found the Texans so far forward he launched an attack, hitting them about 11:00&nbsp;am some {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} from Pigeon's Ranch. A provisional battalion of four companies from the 1st Colorado, supported by both batteries, was commanded by Lt. Col. Samuel Tappan, who deployed his men across the trail.<ref>Whitlock, p. 190</ref> The Confederates dismounted and formed a line across the canyon, but the terrain caused some companies to become intermingled.<ref>Frazier, p. 216</ref> Tappan was initially successful and held his ground for a half-hour, but the Confederates' numerical superiority enabled them to outflank Tappan's line by noon. The Union troops were thrown back in confusion but managed to take up position around the adobe ranch buildings.<ref>[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1073/] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Slough reformed his men several hundred yards closer to [[Pigeon's Ranch]], with the four companies under Tappan and an artillery battery on a hill to the left, the other battery supported by two companies in the center across the road and the remaining two companies on the ridge to the right.<ref>Whitlock, p. 200.</ref>\n\nScurry then launched a three-pronged attack. Pyron and Raguet were ordered to attack the Union right, Shropshire the Union left, with the remainder led by Scurry against the Union center, and the artillery firing in support.<ref>Frazier, p. 219.</ref> The attack on the Union left was beaten back, with Shropshire killed. The attack on the center stalled, while the artillery was forced to withdraw after one cannon was disabled and a limber destroyed. The attack itself then stalled, with the Confederates fighting by squads \"with a desperation unequaled by any engagement of the war.\"<ref>Whitlock, p. 201</ref> At around 3:00&nbsp;pm the Confederates outflanked the Union right, but Raguet was mortally wounded. From the ridge (thereafter known as \"Sharpshooters Ridge\"), Confederate riflemen started picking off the artillerymen and infantry below them. Scurry again pressed the Union center, and the Union position became untenable. Slough reluctantly ordered a retreat, and Tappan formed the companies on the left into a rear guard. Slough reformed his line a half-mile east of Pigeon's Ranch, where skirmishing continued until dusk. The Union men finally retreated to Kozlowski's Ranch, leaving the Confederates in possession of the battlefield.\n\n====Johnson's Ranch====\nWith the sounds of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. [[Manuel Antonio Chaves|Manuel Chaves]] of the [[2nd New Mexico Infantry]], commander of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side.<ref>Three Confederates were killed and several wounded, including the regimental chaplain; two officers and 15 men were captured. The only Union casualty was one man injured by flying debris from the exploding ammunition wagons. Whitlock pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch.<ref>Frazier, p. 226</ref> With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to [[San Antonio]], Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was the turning point of the war in the [[New Mexico Territory]].\n\nOne of Chaves' scouts was Anastasio Duran. He was stationed with the Union Army at Fort Union and was a resident of Chaperito (or Chaparito), New Mexico. He was considered a \"[[Comanchero]]\" by U.S. Army officers and was renowned for his hunting skills. He was intimately familiar with the terrain. Duran was the lead scout who led Chivington's forces to attack behind Confederate lines at the Battle of Glorieta Pass.<ref>This information is compiled from the oral history of the Duran family of New Mexico, recorded in 1976 by L J Bonney, Esq. and from documents of the era in possession of the Duran family. One such document was the Fort Union commander's written commendation thanking Duran for his service in the battle and naming him the most proficient scout for the Union Army in the New Mexico.\n*Note 1: Duran's family stated that he also voluntarily chose to join the war on the Union side because it included a war against Texas. Texas was considered enemy territory at this time by many native New Mexicans (Indio-Hispano and American Indian).\n*Note 2: Much native New Mexican history before 1900, both Indio-Hispano and American Indian, not related to Anglo events, is of an oral nature.</ref>\n\nParts of the battlefield are preserved in [[Pecos National Historical Park]].\n\n==Controversy==\nMany New Mexicans disputed the view that Chivington was the hero of Johnson's Ranch. Many Santa Fe residents credited James L. Collins, a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] official, who had suggested the roundabout attack on the supply train. Chivington had actually been sent out in hopes of making a flank attack, and the discovery of the supply train was a lucky accident. He was also accused of almost letting the opportunity slip by him. On January 23, 1864, the New Mexico Territorial Legislature adopted a resolution that did not mention Chivington and instead asked [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] to promote William H. Lewis and Asa B. Carey, both regular army officers, for \"distinguished service\" in the battle. On March 8 the ''Rio Abajo Press'' of Albuquerque complained about \"Col. Chivington's strutting about in plumage stolen from Captain William H. Lewis\" (it did not mention Carey). According to the newspaper editor, \"Some one of the party\" suggested the attack, which Chivington only agreed to after \"two hours persuasion.\" Furthermore, Lewis had led the attack, while Chivington was \"viewing the scene from afar\".<ref>Keleher, pp. 180\u2013182.</ref>\n\nA more serious charge made against Chivington was that if he had hurried to reinforce Slough as soon as he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon's Ranch, his 400 men might have been enough to win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry's flank as he had been ordered.<ref>One reason Chivington failed to come was due to an acoustic shadow that prevented him from hearing sounds from the battle. Whitlock, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Glorieta Pass.png|thumb|right|Battle of Glorieta Pass marker at the Cuerno Verde Rest Area, Colorado.]]\nIn the end, the Battle of Glorieta Pass was consequential. First, despite the fact that the Confederates took the field, they were forced to retreat to Santa Fe due to the destruction of their supplies and eventually abandon New Mexico Territory.<ref>Frazier, p. 230.</ref> Second, the battle at Glorieta foiled Sibley's plan to obtain his key objective: the capture of the major federal base at Fort Union. That would have broken federal resistance in New Mexico and compelled Union forces to retire north of Raton Pass and back into Colorado Territory.<ref>Josephy, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn any case, the dream of a Confederate stronghold in the Southwest was impractical; New Mexico could not provide enough sustenance for any prolonged Confederate occupation.<ref>Whitlock, pp. 240\u2013241</ref> Furthermore, the approach of the Federal \"[[California Column]]\" eastward through the New Mexico Territory during the summer of 1862 would have seriously jeopardized Confederate control of the region.\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n{{Main|Glorieta Pass Battlefield}}\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Battlefield.jpg|thumb|right|The battlefield in 2012.]]\n\nIn 1987 two Confederate burial sites were discovered at Pigeon's Ranch. One was the solitary grave of Maj. John Samuel Shropshire, the other was a mass grave of 30 Confederates. Only Shropshire and five others could be positively identified<ref>[http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082935/http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf |date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> On August 5, 1990, Maj.

The Battle of Glorieta Pass received the highest rating from the commission, priority I (class A). Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having a direct impact on the course of the war. With this rating the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being not only one of the most important, but also one of the most highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only ten other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.<ref>''Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields''. Washington, DC: The National Park Service, 1993.</ref>\n\nSince 1993 portions of the [[Glorieta Pass Battlefield]] have become a unit of the National Park Service. The Glorieta Pass unit (Pigeon's Ranch) comprises roughly 20% of the total battlefield. The remaining 80% is in private ownership.

Dubbed the \"[[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] of the West\"  by some authors (a term described as one that \"serves the novelist better than the historian\")<ref>Edrington, p. 4</ref>, it was intended as the decisive blow by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces to break the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] possession of the West along the base of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It was fought at [[Glorieta Pass]] in the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] in what is now [[New Mexico]], and was an important event in the history of the [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War]].\n\nThere was a skirmish on March 26 between advance elements from each army, with the main battle occurring on March 28. Although the Confederates were able to push the Union force back through the pass, they had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses and mules killed or driven off. Eventually the Confederates had to withdraw entirely from the territory back into [[Confederate Arizona]] and then [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]]. Glorieta Pass thus represented the climax of the campaign.\n\n==New Mexico Campaign==\n{{Main|New Mexico Campaign}}\nThe lower portion of the New Mexico Territory had been largely neglected by both the federal government and the territorial government in Santa Fe. As a result, Confederate sympathy was strong, in hopes of receiving better treatment by the new government. Following [[Secession in the United States|secession]] moves by residents, Confederate forces seized Mesilla and captured the federal troops there, who made a halfhearted attempt to retreat to Santa Fe. In early 1862 the Confederacy established the [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Confederate Arizona Territory]], which included the southern halves of both modern [[Arizona]] and New Mexico. The territorial capital was at [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]], some {{convert|45|mi}} from El Paso and near today's major city of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. The strategic goals were to gain access to the gold and silver mines of California and the [[Colorado Territory]] and the seaports in [[Southern California]], and thus evade the Union naval blockade.<ref>Frazier, p. 75</ref><ref>Whitlock, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe commanders of the New Mexico Campaign were Confederate [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]] and  Union [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Canby]]. Sibley attempted to capture [[Fort Craig]], completely outmaneuvering Canby at the [[Battle of Valverde]] in February and driving him back into his fort, but failed to force Canby's surrender. Sibley then bypassed the fort and advanced north through the [[Rio Grande]] Valley, occupying [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. Canby remained at Fort Craig, hoping to cut Sibley's logistical support from Texas and awaiting reinforcements before he dared to take the offensive. Sibley made his headquarters at the abandoned Union storehouse at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].\n\nIn March Sibley sent a Confederate force of 200-300 [[Texas|Texans]] under the command of [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] [[Charles L. Pyron]] on an advance expedition over the [[Glorieta Pass]], a strategic location on the [[Santa Fe Trail]] at the southern tip of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] southeast of Santa Fe.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and make an assault on [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]], a Union stronghold on the route northward over [[Raton Pass]]. Sibley sent six companies under the command of Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.<ref>Frazier, p. 199</ref>\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union (North)===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Union Army|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{Further|Glorieta Pass order of battle#Confederate Army|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:glorietapass.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Glorieta Pass: actions on March 28\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}]]\n\nThe Confederates were led by<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfg02|title=GLORIETA, BATTLE OF &#124; The Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)|publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-18}}</ref> Charles L. Pyron and [[William Read Scurry]]. During the battle on March 26, Pyron had his battalion of the [[2nd Texas Mounted Rifles]],<ref>This battalion also included companies of Arizona Confederates.</ref> four companies of the [[5th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons. Scurry's force included nine companies of the [[4th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the [[7th Texas Mounted Rifles]] under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three additional cannons.\n\nThe Union forces were led by Col. [[John P. Slough]] of the [[1st Colorado Infantry]], with units under the command of Maj. [[John M. Chivington]]. In the action on March 26, Chivington had three infantry companies and one mounted company of the 1st Colorado and a detachment of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st]] and [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd]] U.S. Cavalry regiments.<ref>Whitlock, p. 171</ref> During the main battle on the 28th, Slough commanded, in person, nine companies of the 1st Colorado, a detachment from the 1st, [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd]] and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments and two artillery batteries.<ref>Frazier, pp. 205, 215</ref> Chivington commanded five companies of the 5th U.S. Infantry, one company from the 1st Colorado, [[James Hobart Ford]]'s independent company from the 2nd Colorado and some New Mexico militiamen.<ref>Whitlock, p. 188</ref>\n\nPrior to the battle Union forces performed a forced march from [[Denver]], over [[Raton Pass]], to Fort Union and then to Glorieta Pass, covering the distance of {{convert|400|mi|-2}} in 14 days. Combat commenced shortly after their arrival at the battlefield, leaving them little time to recuperate.<ref>Hudnall, p. 291</ref>\n\n===Apache Canyon===\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Action at Apache Canyon.jpg|thumb|Action at Apache Canyon.]]\nPyron's force of 300 camped at Apache Canyon, at one end of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 soldiers to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington's men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their [[Field artillery in the American Civil War|artillery]] fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two sides of the pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about {{convert|1.5|mi}} to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington's men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron's men again and punished them with [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at [[Kozlowski's Ranch]] to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.<ref>Josephy, pp. 79\u201381.</ref><ref>Frazier, pp. 208\u2013210</ref>\n\nNo fighting occurred the next day, as reinforcements arrived for both sides. Scurry's troops arrived at 3:00&nbsp;am on March 27, swelling the Confederate force to about 1,100 men and five cannons; as senior officer present, he took command of the entire Confederate force. Thinking that Slough would attack again and expecting Green to arrive in the Union rear at any time, Scurry chose to remain in place for the day, digging rifle pits.<ref>Frazier, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> Slough arrived early in the morning of March 28 with about 900 more men, bringing the Union strength to 1,300.\n\n===Glorieta Pass===\n[[File:GP Battlefield.jpg|left|thumb|Glorieta Pass battlefield. This photograph was taken in 1990 from Sharpshooter's Ridge, just north of Pigeon's Ranch. It was the location of the Union right flank during the last day's battle.]]\nBoth Scurry and Slough decided to attack on March 28 and set out early to do so. Expecting the Confederates to remain in Apache Canyon, Slough sent Chivington with two infantry battalions, under Lewis and Wynkoop, out in a circling movement with orders to go hide out at Glorieta Pass and hit the Texans in the flank once Slough's main force had engaged their front.<ref>Frazier, p. 214</ref> Chivington did as ordered and his men waited above the pass for Slough and the enemy to arrive. However, instead of remaining at Apache Canyon as Slough had expected, Scurry advanced down the canyon more rapidly than Slough had anticipated. Scurry believed the Union force was retreating to Fort Union. He intended to attack them until Green could arrive. One cannon and a small guard was left at [[Johnson's Ranch]], while the rest of the Confederate force\u2014more than 1000 men\u2014marched eastwards along the Santa Fe Trail.<ref>Frazier, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nWhen Slough found the Texans so far forward he launched an attack, hitting them about 11:00&nbsp;am some {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} from Pigeon's Ranch. A provisional battalion of four companies from the 1st Colorado, supported by both batteries, was commanded by Lt. Col. Samuel Tappan, who deployed his men across the trail.<ref>Whitlock, p. 190</ref> The Confederates dismounted and formed a line across the canyon, but the terrain caused some companies to become intermingled.<ref>Frazier, p. 216</ref> Tappan was initially successful and held his ground for a half-hour, but the Confederates' numerical superiority enabled them to outflank Tappan's line by noon. The Union troops were thrown back in confusion but managed to take up position around the adobe ranch buildings.<ref>[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1073/] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Slough reformed his men several hundred yards closer to [[Pigeon's Ranch]], with the four companies under Tappan and an artillery battery on a hill to the left, the other battery supported by two companies in the center across the road and the remaining two companies on the ridge to the right.<ref>Whitlock, p. 200.</ref>\n\nScurry then launched a three-pronged attack. Pyron and Raguet were ordered to attack the Union right, Shropshire the Union left, with the remainder led by Scurry against the Union center, and the artillery firing in support.<ref>Frazier, p. 219.</ref> The attack on the Union left was beaten back, with Shropshire killed. The attack on the center stalled, while the artillery was forced to withdraw after one cannon was disabled and a limber destroyed. The attack itself then stalled, with the Confederates fighting by squads \"with a desperation unequaled by any engagement of the war.\"<ref>Whitlock, p. 201</ref> At around 3:00&nbsp;pm the Confederates outflanked the Union right, but Raguet was mortally wounded. From the ridge (thereafter known as \"Sharpshooters Ridge\"), Confederate riflemen started picking off the artillerymen and infantry below them. Scurry again pressed the Union center, and the Union position became untenable. Slough reluctantly ordered a retreat, and Tappan formed the companies on the left into a rear guard. Slough reformed his line a half-mile east of Pigeon's Ranch, where skirmishing continued until dusk. The Union men finally retreated to Kozlowski's Ranch, leaving the Confederates in possession of the battlefield.\n\n====Johnson's Ranch====\nWith the sounds of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. [[Manuel Antonio Chaves|Manuel Chaves]] of the [[2nd New Mexico Infantry]], commander of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side.<ref>Three Confederates were killed and several wounded, including the regimental chaplain; two officers and 15 men were captured. The only Union casualty was one man injured by flying debris from the exploding ammunition wagons. Whitlock pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch.<ref>Frazier, p. 226</ref> With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to [[San Antonio]], Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was the turning point of the war in the [[New Mexico Territory]].\n\nOne of Chaves' scouts was Anastasio Duran. He was stationed with the Union Army at Fort Union and was a resident of Chaperito (or Chaparito), New Mexico. He was considered a \"[[Comanchero]]\" by U.S. Army officers and was renowned for his hunting skills. He was intimately familiar with the terrain. Duran was the lead scout who led Chivington's forces to attack behind Confederate lines at the Battle of Glorieta Pass.<ref>This information is compiled from the oral history of the Duran family of New Mexico, recorded in 1976 by L J Bonney, Esq. and from documents of the era in possession of the Duran family. One such document was the Fort Union commander's written commendation thanking Duran for his service in the battle and naming him the most proficient scout for the Union Army in the New Mexico.\n*Note 1: Duran's family stated that he also voluntarily chose to join the war on the Union side because it included a war against Texas. Texas was considered enemy territory at this time by many native New Mexicans (Indio-Hispano and American Indian).\n*Note 2: Much native New Mexican history before 1900, both Indio-Hispano and American Indian, not related to Anglo events, is of an oral nature.</ref>\n\nParts of the battlefield are preserved in [[Pecos National Historical Park]].\n\n==Controversy==\nMany New Mexicans disputed the view that Chivington was the hero of Johnson's Ranch. Many Santa Fe residents credited James L. Collins, a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] official, who had suggested the roundabout attack on the supply train. Chivington had actually been sent out in hopes of making a flank attack, and the discovery of the supply train was a lucky accident. He was also accused of almost letting the opportunity slip by him. On January 23, 1864, the New Mexico Territorial Legislature adopted a resolution that did not mention Chivington and instead asked [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] to promote William H. Lewis and Asa B. Carey, both regular army officers, for \"distinguished service\" in the battle. On March 8 the ''Rio Abajo Press'' of Albuquerque complained about \"Col. Chivington's strutting about in plumage stolen from Captain William H. Lewis\" (it did not mention Carey). According to the newspaper editor, \"Some one of the party\" suggested the attack, which Chivington only agreed to after \"two hours persuasion.\" Furthermore, Lewis had led the attack, while Chivington was \"viewing the scene from afar\".<ref>Keleher, pp. 180\u2013182.</ref>\n\nA more serious charge made against Chivington was that if he had hurried to reinforce Slough as soon as he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon's Ranch, his 400 men might have been enough to win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry's flank as he had been ordered.<ref>One reason Chivington failed to come was due to an acoustic shadow that prevented him from hearing sounds from the battle. Whitlock, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Glorieta Pass.png|thumb|right|Battle of Glorieta Pass marker at the Cuerno Verde Rest Area, Colorado.]]\nIn the end, the Battle of Glorieta Pass was consequential. First, despite the fact that the Confederates took the field, they were forced to retreat to Santa Fe due to the destruction of their supplies and eventually abandon New Mexico Territory.<ref>Frazier, p. 230.</ref> Second, the battle at Glorieta foiled Sibley's plan to obtain his key objective: the capture of the major federal base at Fort Union. That would have broken federal resistance in New Mexico and compelled Union forces to retire north of Raton Pass and back into Colorado Territory.<ref>Josephy, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn any case, the dream of a Confederate stronghold in the Southwest was impractical; New Mexico could not provide enough sustenance for any prolonged Confederate occupation.<ref>Whitlock, pp. 240\u2013241</ref> Furthermore, the approach of the Federal \"[[California Column]]\" eastward through the New Mexico Territory during the summer of 1862 would have seriously jeopardized Confederate control of the region.\n\n==Battlefield preservation==\n{{Main|Glorieta Pass Battlefield}}\n[[File:Battle of Glorieta Pass Battlefield.jpg|thumb|right|The battlefield in 2012.]]\n\nIn 1987 two Confederate burial sites were discovered at Pigeon's Ranch. One was the solitary grave of Maj. John Samuel Shropshire, the other was a mass grave of 30 Confederates. Only Shropshire and five others could be positively identified<ref>[http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082935/http://www.lasvegasmuseum.org/pdf/Glorieta.pdf |date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> On August 5, 1990, Maj.

The Battle of Glorieta Pass received the highest rating from the commission, priority I (class A). Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having a direct impact on the course of the war. With this rating the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]]. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being not only one of the most important, but also one of the most highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only ten other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.<ref>''Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields''.
