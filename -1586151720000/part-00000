The Congress expressed hope that [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] would grant tolerance and protection to their minorities, which ultimately they disregarded, engaging in organized discrimination.\n\nThe 1856 [[Congress of Paris]] paid special attention to the status of Jews and [[Christians]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In Britain, [[William Gladstone]] made the massacres of [[Bulgarians]] by the Ottoman Empire a major campaign issue and demanded international attention. The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 dealt with the status of Jews in [[United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia|Romania]], especially, and also [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].\n\nOn the whole, the 19th century congresses failed to impose significant reforms. Russia was especially active in protecting Orthodox Christians and Slavic peoples under the control of the Ottoman Empire.  Persecution or discrimination against specific minorities was increasingly the subject of media attention, and the Jews began to organize to protest the [[pogrom]]s in Russia. However, there was little international outrage regarding treatment of other minorities, such as black people in the [[southern United States]].\n\nThe first minority rights were proclaimed and enacted by the revolutionary Parliament of Hungary in July 1849.<ref>Laszlo Peter, Martyn C.

All the new successor states were compelled to sign minority rights treaties as a precondition of diplomatic recognition. It was agreed that although the new states had been recognized, they had not been 'created' before the signatures of the final peace treaties. The issue of German and Polish rights was a point of dispute as Polish rights in Germany remained unprotected, unlike the German minority in [[Poland]]. Like other principles adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations; like the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure, they remained the basis of international law. After [[World War II]], the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.\n\n===International law===\n{{LGBT rights sidebar}}\n\nMinority rights, as applying to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities and indigenous peoples, are an integral part of [[international human rights law]]. Like [[children's rights]], [[women's rights]] and [[refugee]] rights, minority rights are a legal framework designed to ensure that a specific group which is in a [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]], disadvantaged or [[social exclusion|marginalized]] position in society, is able to achieve equality and is protected from persecution. The first postwar international treaty to protect minorities, designed to protect them from the greatest threat to their existence, was the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].\n\nSubsequent human rights standards that codify minority rights include the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Article 27), the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]], two [[Council of Europe]] treaties (the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]), and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) Copenhagen Document of 1990.\n\nMinority rights cover protection of existence, protection from discrimination and persecution, protection and promotion of identity, and participation in political life. For the rights of [[LGBT]] people, the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] have been approved by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. For the rights of persons with [[disability|disabilities]], the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] has been adopted by [[United Nations General Assembly]].\n\nTo protect minority rights, many countries have specific laws and/or commissions or [[ombudsman]] institutions (for example the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for National and Ethnic Minorities Rights).<ref>[http://www.obh.hu/nekh/en/index.htm Homepage of the Parliamentary Commissioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223215718/http://www.obh.hu/nekh/en/index.htm |date=23 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\nWhile initially, the United Nations treated [[indigenous peoples]] as a sub-category of minorities, there is an expanding body of international law specifically devoted to them, in particular [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Convention 169]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] and the UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (adopted 14 September 2007).\n\nIn 2008, a declaration on LGBT rights was presented in the [[UN General Assembly]], and in 2011, a LGBT rights resolution was passed in the United Nations Human Rights Council (''See [[LGBT rights at the United Nations]]'').\n\nThere are many political bodies which also feature minority group rights, which might be seen in [[affirmative action]] quotas or in guaranteed minority representation in a [[consociational state]].\n\n== National minorities in the law of the EC/EU ==\nThe direct role of the [[European Union]] (and also the law of the EU/EC) in the area of protection of national minorities  is still very limited (likewise the general protection of [[human rights]]). The EU has relied on general [[international law]] and a European regional system of international law (based on the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], etc.) and in a case of necessity accepted their norms. But the \u201cde-economisation of European integration\u201d, which started in the 1990s, is changing this situation. The political relevance of national minorities' protection is very high.\n\nNow (2009), although protection of the national minorities has not become a generally accepted legally binding principle of the EU, in  several legal acts issues of national minorities are mentioned. In external relations protection of national minorities became one of the main criteria for cooperation with the EU or  accession.<ref>[[Daniel \u0160mihula]] (2008).

At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the [[Consulship]] of [[Nero|Nero]] and [[Cossus Cornelius Lentulus (consul AD 60)|Lentulus]]''' (or, less frequently, '''year 813 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination AD 60 for this year has been used since the early [[medieval period]], when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n\nThe year 60 is the first identifiable year for which a date is cited complete with [[day of the week]], i.e. 6 February 60, identified as a \"[[Sunday]]\" (as ''viii idus Februarius dies solis'' \"eighth day before the ides of February, day of the Sun\") in a Pompeiian graffito. According to the currently-used Julian calendar, 6 February 60 was a [[Wednesday]] (''dies Mercurii'', \"day of [[Planets in astrology#Mercury|Mercury]]\").  This is explained by the existence of two conventions of naming days of the weeks based on the [[planetary hours]] system, 6 February was a \"Sunday\" based on the sunset naming convention, and a \"Wednesday\" based on the sunrise naming convention.<ref>''Nerone Caesare Augusto Cosso Lentuol Cossil fil.
