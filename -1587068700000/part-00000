They are famed for their native-bred ''Kam Sweet Rice'' ({{zh|c=\u9999\u79be\u7cef}}), [[carpentry]] skills, and unique architecture, in particular a form of [[covered bridge]] known as the \"wind and rain bridge\" ({{zh|c=\u98ce\u96e8\u6865}}). The Kam people live mostly in eastern [[Guizhou]], western [[Hunan]], and northern [[Guangxi]] in China.

(London / New York, RoutledgeCurzon 2003). {{ISBN|0-7007-1501-0}}.</ref> Kam legends generally maintain that the ancestors of the Kam migrated from the east. According to the migration legends of the Southern Kam people, their ancestors came from [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Wuzhou]], [[Guangxi]]. The Northern Kam maintain that their ancestors fled [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]] because of [[locust swarm]]s. Some scholars (mainly Chinese) also believe that the Kam were a branch of the Bai Yue from the first century CE. The Bai Yue inhabited the Yangze Riber basin after the collapse of the Yue Kingdom around the first century CE which led to the establishment of many small chiefdoms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first explicit mention of the Kam (or Dong) people come from Ming Dynasty sources. Many Kam rebellions took place during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties, but none were successful in the long run. The Qing developed extensive irrigation systems in the area and rice harvests increased significantly but this mostly benefited the local landlords. The Kam were further exploited after the first Opium War of 1840-1842 by western forces, capitalists, landlords, usurers, and Qing officials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a consequence of these events, many Kam helped or joined the Chinese Communists soon after its founding in 1921. They supplied food and resources to the Red Army as it passed through Gunagxi during the Long March. Some Kam also allied with the People's Liberation Army through establishing guerilla units against the forces of Chiang Kai-Shek. After 1949, infrastructure was quickly developed in Kam areas. Schools, roads, small factories and more were built. Many Kam also became government officials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough the Kam and [[Han Chinese]] peoples generally get along well today, the history of [[Guizhou]] is marked by innumerable tensions and conflicts between the Han Chinese and non-Han minority groups. Today, many Kam are assimilating into mainstream Chinese society as rural Kam move into urban areas, resulting in intermarriage with the Han Chinese and the loss of the [[Kam language]]. However, various attempts to preserve Kam culture and language have been very successful, and improving living conditions in rural Guizhou may entice local Kam villagers to stay rather than move to major urban areas.\n\n==Language==\nThe [[Kam language]] ([[Endonym|autonym]]: {{varserif|lix Gaeml}}) is a [[Tai\u2013Kadai languages|Tai\u2013Kadai]] (Chinese: ''Zhuang\u2013Dong'') language. [http://www.ethnologue.org/show_family.asp?subid=90182] [[Ethnologue]] distinguishes between two Kam languages, with the codes {{ethnolink|kmc}} for Southern Kam (Southern Dong) and {{ethnolink|doc}} for Northern Kam (Northern Dong). [[Sui language|Sui]], [[Maonan language|Maonan]], and [[Mulam language|Mulao]] are the languages most closely related to Kam. Historically,  Northern Kam has been influenced by Chinese much more than has Southern Kam.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Kam language has no traditional script of its own. The Kam people sometimes use [[Chinese character]]s to represent the sounds of Kam words. A [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] was developed in 1958, but it is not much in use due to a lack of printed material and trained teachers.\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:1 zhaoxing 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zhaoxing, Guizhou|Zhaoxing]], the largest Dong village in China]]\n\n===By province===\n\n===By county===\n;County-level distribution of the Kam\n\n(Only includes counties or county-equivalents containing >1% of county population.)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible sortabe\"\n|-\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''county/city'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''% Kam'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''   Kam'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''Total'''\n|-\n| Guizhou province||4.62||1,628,568||35,247,695\n|-\n| Tongren prefecture||11.41||376,862||3,302,625\n|-\n| Tongren city||33.72||104,051||308,583\n|-\n| Jiangkou county||8.99||17,011||189,288\n|-\n| Yuping Dong autonomous county||78.09||98,757||126,462\n|-\n| Shiqian county||30.49||101,990||334,508\n|-\n| Songtao Miao autonomous county||2.56||14,025||547,488\n|-\n| Wanshante district||73.40||40,130||54,674\n|-\n| Qiandongnan Miao Dong autonomous prefecture ||31.40||1,207,197||3,844,697\n|-\n| Kaili city||5.10||22,099||433,236\n|-\n| Shibing county||2.53||3,464||137,171\n|-\n| Sanhui county||48.89||83193||170,167\n|-\n| Zhenyuan county||32.23||71,800||222,766\n|-\n| Cengong county||32.50||61,006||187,734\n|-\n| Tianzhu county||67.54||235,241||348,302\n|-\n| Jinping county||49.64||94,537||190,429\n|-\n| Jianhe county||34.47||65,170||189,085\n|-\n| Liping county||70.85||324,867||458,533\n|-\n| Rongjiang county||38.38||115,295||300,369\n|-\n| Congjiang county||40.88||123,270||301,513\n|-\n| Leishan county||2.08||2,752||132,004\n|-\n| Danzhai county||1.07||1,452||135,400\n|-\n| Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region||0.69||303,139||43,854,538\n|-\n| Guilin city||1.04||48,166||4,614,670\n|-\n| Longshenggezu autonomous county||26.57||42,718||160,796\n|-\n| Liuzhou prefecture||6.51||229,162||3,522,322\n|-\n| Rong'an county||2.93||8,303||283,029\n|-\n| Sanjiang Dong autonomous county||55.98||170,248||304,149\n|-\n| Rongshui Miao autonomous county||11.28||48,020||425,608\n|-\n| Hubei province||0.12||69,947||59,508,870\n|-\n| Enshi Tujia Miao autonomous prefecture||1.79||67,440||3,775,190\n|-\n| Enshi city||2.27||17,187||755,725\n|-\n| Xuan'en county||13.93||46,817||335,984\n|-\n| Hu'nan province||1.33||842,123||63,274,173\n|-\n| Suining county||4.12||13,973||339,235\n|-\n| Xinning county||0.05||283||557,120\n|-\n| Chengbu Miao autonomous county||1.45||3,498||241,517\n|-\n| Huaihua city||17.42||808,155||4,639,738\n|-\n| Hecheng district||2.99||10,370||346,522\n|-\n| Huitong county||52.49||173,947||331,392\n|-\n| Xinhuang Dong autonomous county||80.13||193,678||241,690\n|-\n| Zhijiang Dong autonomous county||52.37||175,030||334,229\n|-\n| Jingzhou Miao Dong autonomous county||26.06||63,962||245,444\n\n|-\n| Tongdao Dong autonomous county||75.96||156,719||206,327\n|-\n| Hongjiang city||5.43||26,360||485,061\n|}\n\n==Culture==<!--[[Kgal Laox]] and [[Kam Grand Choir]] redirect directly here.-->\nThe Kam people are internationally renowned for their polyphonic choir singing, called ''Kgal Laox'' in the Kam language ({{zh|c=\u4f97\u65cf\u5927\u6b4c}}), which can be literally translated as ''Kam Grand Choir'' or ''Grand song'' in English. The Kam Grand Choir has been [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists#row-Dong song|listed]] by [[UNESCO]] as a world-class [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage]] since 2009. Kam choral songs include nature songs, narratives, and children's songs.\n\nOne-part songs (as opposed to [[polyphonic]], or many-part, songs) can be sung by one or many people.<ref name=Geary /> They include:\n*''Duo Ye'' songs\n*Love songs - accompanied by the [[pipa]] or niutuiqin\n*Drinking songs\n*Bride's songs\n*Mourning songs\n*[[Pipa]] songs\n\n[[Opera]]s are highly popular among the Kam and are performed by local troupes.<ref name=Geary /> Two famous Kam playwrights are Wu Wencai (1798\u20131845), author of ''Mei Liangyu'', and Zhang Honggan (1779\u20131839).\n\nKam oral literature contains a rich array of legends and folk tales. Many of these popular tales are about the leaders of past uprisings (Geary 2003:218). Celebrated leaders include:\n*'''Xing Ni''' - An ancient figure, whose legend dates possibly from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907).<ref name=Geary /> \n*'''Wu Mian''' - Leader of a 1378 rebellion during the [[Ming Dynasty]] due to drought and famine.\n*'''Lin Kuan''' - Led a 1397 rebellion but was later executed. Popular among the Northern Kam and is commemorated by an ancient tree.\n*'''Wu Jinyin''' - Wu revolted in the 1740 to resist grain taxes, but was killed in 1741.\n\nPopular folk tales are listed below. They can be found in ''The Kam People of China'' by D. Norman Geary.<ref name=Geary />\n*The two orphan brothers\n*The unfriendly eldest brother\n*Ding Lang and the dragon princess\n*Zhu Lang and Niang Mei\n*Shan Lang and E Mei\n*Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai\n*Suo Lao\n*Mei Dao\n*The frog and the swallow (rice agriculture tale)\n*The dog (rice agriculture tale)\n*The singing tree (origin of singing tale)\n*Liang Niangni (origin of singing tale)\n*Lou Niang (drum tower tale)\n\n==Society==\nKam clans are known as ''dou'' and are further divided into ''ji'', ''gong'', and households (known as \"kitchens\"), respectively from largest to smallest in size.<ref name=Geary /> Village elders were traditionally the village leaders, although the government replaced these elders with village heads from 1911 to 1949. Kam society was also traditionally matriarchal, as can be evidenced by the cult of the goddess Sa Sui (Geary 2003:88). Before the advent of the Han Chinese, the Kam had no surnames, instead distinguishing each other by their fathers' names.\n\nKam common law is known as ''kuan'' and is practiced at four levels.<ref name=Geary />\n#Single village\n#Several villages\n#Single township / entire local rural area\n#Multiple townships / large portion of the Kam population\n\n===Courtship and marriage===\nTraditional courtship consists of three phases:\n#'''Early meeting phase''' where men and women sing songs and recite poems to one another.\n#'''Deepening love phase''' where the courtship is one-to-one and the songs are more spontaneous.\n#'''Exchanging a token phase''' where a man gives a woman a gift, with the woman expected to make excuses to test her suitor. The token is usually a minor gift without much monetary value. However, it is highly important symbolically, as it is the equivalent of an engagement ring in Western cultures.<ref name=Geary />\n\nWeddings last three days and are first held at the bride's family's home. The bride is later sent to the groom's home, where an afternoon reception and all-night feast then ensue. The next day there is a \"blocking the horse\" ceremony where the hosts block the guests while singing songs. The bride typically resides at her parents' house for a few months or even years. Silver jewellery is passed onto the bride by her mother.\n\n===Birth===\nThe birth of a child is complemented by the following events:<ref name=Geary />\n#The \"stepping-over-the-threshold person,\" the first person to enter the home where the child was born, will influence the child's future personality and success.\n#Several fir trees are planted at the birth which are gifted at age 18 for marriage and new home.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20150429-a-bullet-train-to-nowhere | title=A bullet train to nowhere}}</ref> \n#Neighbors are invited and bring food and gifts.\n#Announcing the birth to the mother's family.\n#Visit from the female relatives on the third day or so; gifts are brought.\n#Homage expressed to the land god for the birth of a male child (practiced by the Northern Kam).\n#Building a \"bridge\" - Three wooden planks are lined up side by side to express goodwill to passing people.\n#Wrapping the hands - The child's hands are wrapped to help prevent him or her from stealing things later on in life.\n#First haircut at the age of one month.\n#First eating of fermented rice at the age of about one month.\n#First eating of meat dipped in wine at six months old - considered a major milestone.\n\n===Funerals===\nLike those of the [[Miao people]], Kam funerals are highly elaborate. People who died from unnatural causes (e.g., accidents) are [[cremation|cremated]], while those who died from natural causes are buried.<ref name=Geary /> Burial consists of the following phases:<ref name=Geary />\n#Receiving the breath - listening for last words and the person's the last breath.\n#Drinking clear tea - Three spoonfuls of \"clear tea\" and a small pieces of silver are placed into the recently deceased person's mouth.\n#Buying water for washing the corpse.\n#\"Washing\" the corpse - The corpse is covered with wet money paper.\n#Putting on the graveclothes - Old clothes are taken off.\n#Arranging the \"dream bed\" - The [[suona]] is played during the vigil.\n#Starting on the road - A red cock is killed, and the corpse is removed from the dream bed and placed into a coffin. White headcloths are worn by the mourners (also practiced by the Han Chinese).\n#Digging the \"well\" (grave).\n#Holding the memorial ceremony - Presents are distributed.\n#Going up the mountain - Coffins are usually placed high up on a mountainside.\n#Placing the coffin into the \"well\" - A chicken is killed and prayers are said. The chicken is then lowered into the grave and pulled back out again for later consumption.\n#Holding the funeral receptions - Lunch and dinner are held.\n#Returning to the mountain - The sons return to the grave to build a grave-mound. The dead person is called to \"go back home\" to live at the altar to the family's ancestors.\n#\"Transferring the sons\" (if the dead is female) - This is a ceremony in which the duties of [[filial piety]] are transferred from the deceased mother to her eldest brother or the eldest brother's representative.\n\n==Environment==\nAn average-size Kam village has 200&ndash;300 homes, although the smallest ones have only 10&ndash;20 and the largest ones have more than 1,000.<ref name=Geary /> Kam villages typically have:\n\n*''Ganlan''-style wooden houses (stilt houses)\n*Ancient and sacred trees\n*Covered (\"wind-and-rain\") bridges\n*Wayside pavilions with wooden or stone benches\n*Bullfighting arenas, which are fields\n*Wells surrounded by stone rims and usually dug near trees\n*Fish-ponds, traditionally communally owned\n*Racks for drying grain and granaries\n*Village entrances - to protect against intruders, and also are where \"blocking the way\" ceremonies are held\n*Drum towers - usually found only in southern Kam areas today. Drum towers may be village towers or extended-family towers (Geary 2003:47).\n*Altars to Sa Sui, the main deity of the Kam pantheon\n\nPopular scenic spots in Kam-speaking territories are the Jiudong region, Liudong region, [[Chengyang, Guangxi|Chengyang village]], Pingdeng region, and [[Yuping Dong Autonomous County|Yuping region]].\n\n==Agriculture and Economy==\nThe Kam people cultivate dozens of varieties of glutinous rice (known locally as \"Kam\" or \"good\" rice). The Han Chinese cultivate non-glutinous rice, which is called \"Han (Chinese) rice\" by the Kam.<ref name=Geary /> Supplementary foods inclusive [[maize]], [[millet]], vegetables, plums, peaches, pears, mushrooms, [[mandarin orange]]s, [[pomelo]]s, and [[watermelon]]s. [[Cotton]] is cultivated for textile production. Generally the Kam occupy lower-lying land than the [[Miao people|Miao]] and are thus wealthier.\n\nAnimals frequently raised by the Kam people include:<ref name=Geary />\n\n*Water buffalo: 1&ndash;3 per household\n*Pigs: 1&ndash;3 per household\n*Chickens: 2&ndash;20 per household. Hens raised by the Kam generally lay around 100 eggs per year.\n*Ducks: 2&ndash;4 per household (about half of all households). Ducks tend to destroy rice seedlings and are thus less preferable than chickens.\n*Geese: 2&ndash;4 per household (about one-tenth of all households). They are recent introductions from the Han Chinese.\n*Fish: raised in fish-ponds and sometimes hunted\n\nThe \"four pillars\" of Kam cuisine are [[glutinous rice]], sour (pickled) food, hot pepper, and [[rice wine]].<ref name=Geary /> Other popular local dishes and condiments include barbecued fish, intestines sauce, purple blood pork, chicken-blood sauce, oil tea, ''gongguo'' (glutinous rice snack sweetened with liana) and ''bianmi'' (another glutinous rice snack). The giant salamander is a rare local specialty. Two hot meals (breakfast and dinner) and one cold meal (lunch) are served every day.\n\nThe Kam-speaking area is famous for its fir wood. Fir from the Kam area was used to build the ships of 15th-century explorer [[Zheng He]] and the [[Great Hall of the People]]. Major economic activities include carpentry and the manufacture of silverwork and wickerwork. Baskets and other wickerwork are usually made by men. Baskets can be made from five types of plant materials, namely [[glutinous rice]] straw, [[cogongrass]], [[Guangxi]] grass, [[bamboo]], and [[rattan]].<ref name=Geary />\n\nIn recent years, tourism has become a major source of income for the Kam people.<ref name=Geary />\n\n==Festivals==\nBelow is a list of traditional Kam festivals.<ref name=Geary />\n\nTwo new year festivals:\n*Kam New Year\n*[[Chinese New Year]]\n\nOne-day work-related festivals, where chicken, fish, and [[glutinous rice]] are eaten.\n*Sowing seeds\n*Planting cotton\n*Washing water buffaloes\n*Eating new rice\n\nThere are four harvest festivals which last 1\u20133 days.\n*[[Mid-Autumn Festival]]\n*Pumpkin Day\n*[[Lusheng]] Day\n*Cultivating new land\n\nSinging festivals:\n*Commemoration of lovers killed by lightning\n*Gaoba Singing Festival\n\nRemembrance festivals:\n*Girls' Day\n*King Lin's Day - commemorates Lin Kuan, a northern-Kam hero of the 14th century\n*A Dianlong Day\n*Jiaxu Day\n*Best Weather Day - Jiang Yingfang, the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" of the Kam people who led a rebellion in the 19th century, is celebrated on this day.\n\nMiscellaneous festivals:\n*Tidying the graves ([[Qingming Festival]] or \"tomb sweeping\")\n*Sweet rice cakes festival\n*Fireworks Day\n*[[Duanwu Festival|Dragon Boat Festival]]\n*Zongba Festival (''Zongba'' is a type of [[dumpling]] made from [[glutinous rice]], similar to [[zongzi]].)\n*Bull intestines eating festival\n\n[[Bullfighting]] is also historically popular among the Kam people.<ref name=Geary />\n\n==Religion==\nThe Kam people are traditionally polytheistic with many elements of [[animism]].<ref name=Geary /> Totems include turtles, snakes, and dragons, and worshiped ancestors include the mythical figures of Song Sang, Song En, Zhang Liang, and Zhang Mei.<ref name=Geary /> However, the Kam have been influenced by Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism through historical contacts with the Han. This influence is mainly seen in regards to ancestor worship, funeral rites, and certain festivals like the Spring and Dragon Boat Festivals.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Kam also use rice grains, bamboo roots, snails, and chicken bone, eyes, blood, and eggs for divination. Today, [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and to a lesser extent [[Christianity]] are practiced by the Kam.\n\n===Spirits and deities===\nSome deities and sacred natural phenomena are also listed below.<ref name=Geary />\n\n*Sa Ma Qing Sui, or Sa Sui, is the most important deity in Kam mythology. Sa Sui is a female deity who may have originally been a land goddess.\n*Village entrance goddess\n*Bridge goddess\n*Land gods and goddesses\n*Three family prosperity gods\n*A love deity actually consisting of five male gods\n*Banishing-evil god\n*Spirit of the sky and earth\n*Sun and moon worship (derived from Chinese religion)\n*Thunder and lightning\n*Mountains\n*Rivers and streams\n*Wells\n*Two fire spirits: one good and one evil\n*Large stones and boulders\n*\"Wind-and-water trees\" (i.e., trees with magic qualities) and ancient evergreen trees\n*Water buffalo spirits\n*Rice seedling spirits\n*Fruit tree spirits\n\nSnakes are highly revered and are often thought to have been the progenitors of the ancient [[Baiyue]] peoples, which included the Kam.<ref name=Geary /> The legendary founders of the Kam people, Zhang Liang and Zhang Mei, are often called upon to help with illnesses and disasters.\n\n===Taboos and superstitions===\nTraditional Kam religion uses many taboos, omens, and fetishes. The fetishes are usually plant parts such as tree branches, reeds, leaves, and roots. Some of the taboos and superstitions are listed below.<ref name=Geary />\n\n*Not marrying in the Chinese [[Tiger (zodiac)|Year of the Tiger]], since they must wait around nine years before giving birth to their first infants.\n*Pregnant women cannot participate in marriage ceremonies or arrangements, visit sick acquaintances, or sacrifice to gods.\n*Women cannot give birth in their mothers' home. There are many other childbirth-related taboos and superstitions.\n*Children cannot have haircuts before the age of one month old. The locks of hair from the first haircut must be stored and not be disposed of.\n*Coffins cannot have any metal objects inside them, since departed souls fear metal objects, especially copper.\n*Corpses should not be placed inside coffins during rainy weather. \n*Names are not to be called out when a corpse is being carried to its grave.\n*Chopsticks should not be tapped on bowls, as this is reminiscent of beggars' behavior.\n*The meat of crows or dead wild animals with unknown causes of death bring bad luck and should not be eaten.\n*Unmarried men should not eat pig feet, since pigs have split hooves.\n*New houses should not be built if a neighbor has recently died.\n*Pregnant women should not watch new houses being built.\n*Wood struck by lightning cannot be used for building houses.\n*Main entrances of two houses should not directly face each other as this will cause severe quarreling.\n*It is best to move into new houses at night when the village is already asleep.\n*Nothing should be bought on the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]], as this might cause materials to diminish for the new year. On this day, floors should not be swept, rubbish should not be thrown out, friends should not be visited, arguments should be avoided, and knives should not be used to cut food.\n*The [[lusheng]] should not be played between the sowing and transplanting of rice seedlings, since it could attract plagues of insects.\n*Meeting a pregnant woman while hunting is considered bad luck.\n*While hunting, the names of animals should not be shouted so that the mountain god is not aroused to protect them.\n*Fish swimming upstream are protected by the gods, and catching one will result in bad luck.\n*Leaving home on the 7th, 17th, or 27th day of the month is unlucky. (This custom is also practiced by the Chinese.)\n*A recently deceased person will rise up if a cat jumps over them. Therefore, all domesticated animals must be kept away from them.\n\n===Magic and shamanism===\nRituals involving supernatural elements include dragon dances, spring buffalo dances, and fire prevention ceremonies where ash is placed in boats and sent downstream.\n\nSorcery can be performed in private. There are many purposes of sorcery, such as repelling evil spirits, recovering the soul of a disturbed child, exacting revenge on enemies, and inducing love. Voodoo dolls, borrowed from the Chinese, are made so that pins can be stuck onto them, with the person's name and birth date written on them. The doll is then buried underground after being inserted into a clay pot.<ref name=Geary /> White cocks can be used for revenge sorcery.\n\n[[Shamanism]] is practiced by the Kam and bears many parallels with [[Miao people|Miao]] (Hmong) shamanism. One major duty of shamans is to recover the souls of sick people.<ref name=Geary />\n\n==Notable Dongs==\n<!-- chronological by earliest known date -->\n* [[Su Yu]] (\u7c9f\u88d5) (1907-1984), the first four-star general of the People's Liberation Army\n* Wu Hongfei (\u5434\u8679\u98de) (1975-), singer for the [[Chinese rock]] band [[Happy Avenue]] (\u5e78\u798f\u5927\u8857)\n* Sen Fluke (\u88d5\u8679\u8679) (1945-), Pastor for the Golden Singers (\u5e78\u798f\u5927\u8857)\n* [[Li Ting (diver)|Li Ting]] (\u674e\u5a77) (1987-), gold medalist in the 10 meter synchronized platform [[Diving (sport)|diving]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] at [[Athens]], [[Greece]]\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|lines=1\n|width=225\n|File:ZhaoxingDrumTower.jpg|Drum tower in [[Zhaoxing, Guizhou|Zhaoxing]], [[Guizhou]]\n|File:Automn festival, Chengyangqiao, Guangxi, China.jpg|Autumn festival in Chengyangqiao, [[Guangxi]], China\n|File:Chengyangqiao, Guangxi, China.jpg|Kam covered bridge in [[Guangxi]], China\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*D.

They are famed for their native-bred ''Kam Sweet Rice'' ({{zh|c=\u9999\u79be\u7cef}}), [[carpentry]] skills, and unique architecture, in particular a form of [[covered bridge]] known as the \"wind and rain bridge\" ({{zh|c=\u98ce\u96e8\u6865}}). The Kam people live mostly in eastern [[Guizhou]], western [[Hunan]], and northern [[Guangxi]] in China.

According to the migration legends of the Southern Kam people, their ancestors came from [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Wuzhou]], [[Guangxi]]. The Northern Kam maintain that their ancestors fled [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]] because of [[locust swarm]]s. Some scholars (mainly Chinese) also believe that the Kam were a branch of the Bai Yue from the first century CE. The Bai Yue inhabited the Yangze Riber basin after the collapse of the Yue Kingdom around the first century CE which led to the establishment of many small cheifdoms.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe first explicit mention of the Kam (or Dong) people come from Ming Dynasty sources. Many Kam rebellions took place during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties, but none were successful in the long run. The Qing developed extensive irrigation systems in the area and rice harvests increased significantly but this mostly benefited the local landlords. The Kam were further exploited after the first Opium War of 1840-1842 by western forces, capitalists, landlords, usurers, and Qing officials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a conequence of these events, many Kam helped or joined the Chinese Communists soon after its founding in 1921. They supplied food and resources to the Red Army as it passed through Gunagxi during the Long March. Some Kam also allied with the People's Liberation Army through establishing guerilla units against the forces of Chiang Kai-Shek. After 1949, infrastructure was quickly developed in Kam areas. Schools, roads, small factories and more were bulit. Many Kam also became government officials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough the Kam and [[Han Chinese]] peoples generally get along well today, the history of [[Guizhou]] is marked by innumerable tensions and conflicts between the Han Chinese and non-Han minority groups. Today, many Kam are assimilating into mainstream Chinese society as rural Kam move into urban areas, resulting in intermarriage with the Han Chinese and the loss of the [[Kam language]]. However, various attempts to preserve Kam culture and language have been very successful, and improving living conditions in rural Guizhou may entice local Kam villagers to stay rather than move to major urban areas.\n\n==Language==\nThe [[Kam language]] ([[Endonym|autonym]]: {{varserif|lix Gaeml}}) is a [[Tai\u2013Kadai languages|Tai\u2013Kadai]] (Chinese: ''Zhuang\u2013Dong'') language. [http://www.ethnologue.org/show_family.asp?subid=90182] [[Ethnologue]] distinguishes between two Kam languages, with the codes {{ethnolink|kmc}} for Southern Kam (Southern Dong) and {{ethnolink|doc}} for Northern Kam (Northern Dong). [[Sui language|Sui]], [[Maonan language|Maonan]], and [[Mulam language|Mulao]] are the languages most closely related to Kam. Historically,  Northern Kam has been influenced by Chinese much more than has Southern Kam.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Kam language has no traditional script of its own. The Kam people sometimes use [[Chinese character]]s to represent the sounds of Kam words. A [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] was developed in 1958, but it is not much in use due to a lack of printed material and trained teachers.\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:1 zhaoxing 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zhaoxing, Guizhou|Zhaoxing]], the largest Dong village in China]]\n\n===By province===\n\n===By county===\n;County-level distribution of the Kam\n\n(Only includes counties or county-equivalents containing >1% of county population.)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible sortabe\"\n|-\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''county/city'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''% Kam'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''   Kam'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" |'''Total'''\n|-\n| Guizhou province||4.62||1,628,568||35,247,695\n|-\n| Tongren prefecture||11.41||376,862||3,302,625\n|-\n| Tongren city||33.72||104,051||308,583\n|-\n| Jiangkou county||8.99||17,011||189,288\n|-\n| Yuping Dong autonomous county||78.09||98,757||126,462\n|-\n| Shiqian county||30.49||101,990||334,508\n|-\n| Songtao Miao autonomous county||2.56||14,025||547,488\n|-\n| Wanshante district||73.40||40,130||54,674\n|-\n| Qiandongnan Miao Dong autonomous prefecture ||31.40||1,207,197||3,844,697\n|-\n| Kaili city||5.10||22,099||433,236\n|-\n| Shibing county||2.53||3,464||137,171\n|-\n| Sanhui county||48.89||83193||170,167\n|-\n| Zhenyuan county||32.23||71,800||222,766\n|-\n| Cengong county||32.50||61,006||187,734\n|-\n| Tianzhu county||67.54||235,241||348,302\n|-\n| Jinping county||49.64||94,537||190,429\n|-\n| Jianhe county||34.47||65,170||189,085\n|-\n| Liping county||70.85||324,867||458,533\n|-\n| Rongjiang county||38.38||115,295||300,369\n|-\n| Congjiang county||40.88||123,270||301,513\n|-\n| Leishan county||2.08||2,752||132,004\n|-\n| Danzhai county||1.07||1,452||135,400\n|-\n| Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region||0.69||303,139||43,854,538\n|-\n| Guilin city||1.04||48,166||4,614,670\n|-\n| Longshenggezu autonomous county||26.57||42,718||160,796\n|-\n| Liuzhou prefecture||6.51||229,162||3,522,322\n|-\n| Rong'an county||2.93||8,303||283,029\n|-\n| Sanjiang Dong autonomous county||55.98||170,248||304,149\n|-\n| Rongshui Miao autonomous county||11.28||48,020||425,608\n|-\n| Hubei province||0.12||69,947||59,508,870\n|-\n| Enshi Tujia Miao autonomous prefecture||1.79||67,440||3,775,190\n|-\n| Enshi city||2.27||17,187||755,725\n|-\n| Xuan'en county||13.93||46,817||335,984\n|-\n| Hu'nan province||1.33||842,123||63,274,173\n|-\n| Suining county||4.12||13,973||339,235\n|-\n| Xinning county||0.05||283||557,120\n|-\n| Chengbu Miao autonomous county||1.45||3,498||241,517\n|-\n| Huaihua city||17.42||808,155||4,639,738\n|-\n| Hecheng district||2.99||10,370||346,522\n|-\n| Huitong county||52.49||173,947||331,392\n|-\n| Xinhuang Dong autonomous county||80.13||193,678||241,690\n|-\n| Zhijiang Dong autonomous county||52.37||175,030||334,229\n|-\n| Jingzhou Miao Dong autonomous county||26.06||63,962||245,444\n|-\n| Tongdao Dong autonomous county||75.96||156,719||206,327\n|-\n| Hongjiang city||5.43||26,360||485,061\n|}\n\n==Culture==<!--[[Kgal Laox]] and [[Kam Grand Choir]] redirect directly here.-->\nThe Kam people are internationally renowned for their polyphonic choir singing, called ''Kgal Laox'' in the Kam language ({{zh|c=\u4f97\u65cf\u5927\u6b4c}}), which can be literally translated as ''Kam Grand Choir'' or ''Grand song'' in English.

Celebrated leaders include:\n*'''Xing Ni''' - An ancient figure, whose legend dates possibly from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907).<ref name=Geary /> \n*'''Wu Mian''' - Leader of a 1378 rebellion during the [[Ming Dynasty]] due to drought and famine.\n*'''Lin Kuan''' - Led a 1397 rebellion but was later executed. Popular among the Northern Kam and is commemorated by an ancient tree.\n*'''Wu Jinyin''' - Wu revolted in the 1740 to resist grain taxes, but was killed in 1741.\n\nPopular folk tales are listed below. They can be found in ''The Kam People of China'' by D. Norman Geary.<ref name=Geary />\n*The two orphan brothers\n*The unfriendly eldest brother\n*Ding Lang and the dragon princess\n*Zhu Lang and Niang Mei\n*Shan Lang and E Mei\n*Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai\n*Suo Lao\n*Mei Dao\n*The frog and the swallow (rice agriculture tale)\n*The dog (rice agriculture tale)\n*The singing tree (origin of singing tale)\n*Liang Niangni (origin of singing tale)\n*Lou Niang (drum tower tale)\n\n==Society==\nKam clans are known as ''dou'' and are further divided into ''ji'', ''gong'', and households (known as \"kitchens\"), respectively from largest to smallest in size.<ref name=Geary /> Village elders were traditionally the village leaders, although the government replaced these elders with village heads from 1911 to 1949. Kam society was also traditionally matriarchal, as can be evidenced by the cult of the goddess Sa Sui (Geary 2003:88). Before the advent of the Han Chinese, the Kam had no surnames, instead distinguishing each other by their fathers' names.\n\nKam common law is known as ''kuan'' and is practiced at four levels.<ref name=Geary />\n#Single village\n#Several villages\n#Single township / entire local rural area\n#Multiple townships / large portion of the Kam population\n\n===Courtship and marriage===\nTraditional courtship consists of three phases:\n#'''Early meeting phase''' where men and women sing songs and recite poems to one another.\n#'''Deepening love phase''' where the courtship is one-to-one and the songs are more spontaneous.\n#'''Exchanging a token phase''' where a man gives a woman a gift, with the woman expected to make excuses to test her suitor. The token is usually a minor gift without much monetary value. However, it is highly important symbolically, as it is the equivalent of an engagement ring in Western cultures.<ref name=Geary />\n\nWeddings last three days and are first held at the bride's family's home. The bride is later sent to the groom's home, where an afternoon reception and all-night feast then ensue. The next day there is a \"blocking the horse\" ceremony where the hosts block the guests while singing songs. The bride typically resides at her parents' house for a few months or even years. Silver jewellery is passed onto the bride by her mother.\n\n===Birth===\nThe birth of a child is complemented by the following events:<ref name=Geary />\n#The \"stepping-over-the-threshold person,\" the first person to enter the home where the child was born, will influence the child's future personality and success.\n#Several fir trees are planted at the birth which are gifted at age 18 for marriage and new home.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20150429-a-bullet-train-to-nowhere | title=A bullet train to nowhere}}</ref> \n#Neighbors are invited and bring food and gifts.\n#Announcing the birth to the mother's family.\n#Visit from the female relatives on the third day or so; gifts are brought.\n#Homage expressed to the land god for the birth of a male child (practiced by the Northern Kam).\n#Building a \"bridge\" - Three wooden planks are lined up side-by-side to express goodwill to passing people.\n#Wrapping the hands - The child's hands are wrapped to help prevent him or her from stealing things later on in life.\n#First haircut at the age of one month.\n#First eating of fermented rice at the age of about one month.\n#First eating of meat dipped in wine at six months old - considered a major milestone.\n\n===Funerals===\nLike those of the [[Miao people]], Kam funerals are highly elaborate. People who died from unnatural causes (e.g., accidents) are [[cremation|cremated]], while those who died from natural causes are buried.<ref name=Geary /> Burial consists of the following phases:<ref name=Geary />\n#Receiving the breath - listening for last words and the person's the last breath.\n#Drinking clear tea - Three spoonfuls of \"clear tea\" and a small pieces of silver are placed into the recently deceased person's mouth.\n#Buying water for washing the corpse.\n#\"Washing\" the corpse - The corpse is covered with wet money paper.\n#Putting on the graveclothes - Old clothes are taken off.\n#Arranging the \"dream bed\" - The [[suona]] is played during the vigil.\n#Starting on the road - A red cock is killed, and the corpse is removed from the dream bed and placed into a coffin. White headcloths are worn by the mourners (also practiced by the Han Chinese).\n#Digging the \"well\" (grave).\n#Holding the memorial ceremony - Presents are distributed.\n#Going up the mountain - Coffins are usually placed high up on a mountainside.\n#Placing the coffin into the \"well\" - A chicken is killed and prayers are said. The chicken is then lowered into the grave and pulled back out again for later consumption.\n#Holding the funeral receptions - Lunch and dinner are held.\n#Returning to the mountain - The sons return to the grave to build a grave-mound. The dead person is called to \"go back home\" to live at the altar to the family's ancestors.\n#\"Transferring the sons\" (if the dead is female) - This is a ceremony in which the duties of [[filial piety]] are transferred from the deceased mother to her eldest brother or the eldest brother's representative.\n\n==Environment==\nAn average-size Kam village has 200&ndash;300 homes, although the smallest ones have only 10&ndash;20 and the largest ones have more than 1,000.<ref name=Geary /> Kam villages typically have:\n\n*''Ganlan''-style wooden houses (stilt houses)\n*Ancient and sacred trees\n*Covered (\"wind-and-rain\") bridges\n*Wayside pavilions with wooden or stone benches\n*Bullfighting arenas, which are fields\n*Wells surrounded by stone rims and usually dug near trees\n*Fish-ponds, traditionally communally owned\n*Racks for drying grain and granaries\n*Village entrances - to protect against intruders, and also are where \"blocking the way\" ceremonies are held\n*Drum towers - usually found only in southern Kam areas today. Drum towers may be village towers or extended-family towers (Geary 2003:47).\n*Altars to Sa Sui, the main deity of the Kam pantheon\n\nPopular scenic spots in Kam-speaking territories are the Jiudong region, Liudong region, [[Chengyang, Guangxi|Chengyang village]], Pingdeng region, and [[Yuping Dong Autonomous County|Yuping region]].\n\n==Agriculture and Economy==\nThe Kam people cultivate dozens of varieties of glutinous rice (known locally as \"Kam\" or \"good\" rice). The Han Chinese cultivate non-glutinous rice, which is called \"Han (Chinese) rice\" by the Kam.<ref name=Geary /> Supplementary foods inclusive [[maize]], [[millet]], vegetables, plums, peaches, pears, mushrooms, [[mandarin orange]]s, [[pomelo]]s, and [[watermelon]]s. [[Cotton]] is cultivated for textile production. Generally the Kam occupy lower-lying land than the [[Miao people|Miao]] and are thus wealthier.\n\nAnimals frequently raised by the Kam people include:<ref name=Geary />\n\n*Water buffalo: 1&ndash;3 per household\n*Pigs: 1&ndash;3 per household\n*Chickens: 2&ndash;20 per household. Hens raised by the Kam generally lay around 100 eggs per year.\n*Ducks: 2&ndash;4 per household (about half of all households). Ducks tend to destroy rice seedlings and are thus less preferable than chickens.\n*Geese: 2&ndash;4 per household (about one-tenth of all households). They are recent introductions from the Han Chinese.\n*Fish: raised in fish-ponds and sometimes hunted\n\nThe \"four pillars\" of Kam cuisine are [[glutinous rice]], sour (pickled) food, hot pepper, and [[rice wine]].<ref name=Geary /> Other popular local dishes and condiments include barbecued fish, intestines sauce, purple blood pork, chicken-blood sauce, oil tea, ''gongguo'' (glutinous rice snack sweetened with liana) and ''bianmi'' (another glutinous rice snack). The giant salamander is a rare local specialty. Two hot meals (breakfast and dinner) and one cold meal (lunch) are served every day.\n\nThe Kam-speaking area is famous for its fir wood. Fir from the Kam area was used to build the ships of 15th-century explorer [[Zheng He]] and the [[Great Hall of the People]]. Major economic activities include carpentry and the manufacture of silverwork and wickerwork. Baskets and other wickerwork are usually made by men. Baskets can be made from five types of plant materials, namely [[glutinous rice]] straw, [[cogongrass]], [[Guangxi]] grass, [[bamboo]], and [[rattan]].<ref name=Geary />\n\nIn recent years, tourism has become a major source of income for the Kam people.<ref name=Geary />\n\n==Festivals==\nBelow is a list of traditional Kam festivals.<ref name=Geary />\n\nTwo new year festivals:\n*Kam New Year\n*[[Chinese New Year]]\n\nOne-day work-related festivals, where chicken, fish, and [[glutinous rice]] are eaten.\n*Sowing seeds\n*Planting cotton\n*Washing water buffaloes\n*Eating new rice\n\nThere are four harvest festivals which last 1\u20133 days.\n*[[Mid-Autumn Festival]]\n*Pumpkin Day\n*[[Lusheng]] Day\n*Cultivating new land\n\nSinging festivals:\n*Commemoration of lovers killed by lightning\n*Gaoba Singing Festival\n\nRemembrance festivals:\n*Girls' Day\n*King Lin's Day - commemorates Lin Kuan, a northern-Kam hero of the 14th century\n*A Dianlong Day\n*Jiaxu Day\n*Best Weather Day - Jiang Yingfang, the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" of the Kam people who led a rebellion in the 19th century, is celebrated on this day.\n\nMiscellaneous festivals:\n*Tidying the graves ([[Qingming Festival]] or \"tomb sweeping\")\n*Sweet rice cakes festival\n*Fireworks Day\n*[[Duanwu Festival|Dragon Boat Festival]]\n*Zongba Festival (''Zongba'' is a type of [[dumpling]] made from [[glutinous rice]], similar to [[zongzi]].)\n*Bull intestines eating festival\n\n[[Bullfighting]] is also historically popular among the Kam people.<ref name=Geary />\n\n==Religion==\nThe Kam people are traditionally polytheistic with many elements of [[animism]].<ref name=Geary /> Totems include turtles, snakes, and dragons, and worshiped ancestors include the mythical figures of Song Sang, Song En, Zhang Liang, and Zhang Mei.<ref name=Geary /> However, the Kam have been influenced by Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism through historical contacts with the Han. This influence is mainly seen in regards to ancestor worship, funeral rites, and certain festivals like the Spring and Dragon Boat Festivals.<ref name=\":0\" />The Kam also use rice grains, bamboo roots, snails, and chicken bone, eyes, blood, and eggs for divination. Today, [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and to a lesser extent [[Christianity]] are practiced by the Kam.\n\n===Spirits and deities===\nSome deities and sacred natural phenomena are also listed below.<ref name=Geary />\n\n*Sa Ma Qing Sui, or Sa Sui, is the most important deity in Kam mythology. Sa Sui is a female deity who may have originally been a land goddess.\n*Village entrance goddess\n*Bridge goddess\n*Land gods and goddesses\n*Three family prosperity gods\n*A love deity actually consisting of five male gods\n*Banishing-evil god\n*Spirit of the sky and earth\n*Sun and moon worship (derived from Chinese religion)\n*Thunder and lightning\n*Mountains\n*Rivers and streams\n*Wells\n*Two fire spirits: one good and one evil\n*Large stones and boulders\n*\"Wind-and-water trees\" (i.e., trees with magic qualities) and ancient evergreen trees\n*Water buffalo spirits\n*Rice seedling spirits\n*Fruit tree spirits\n\nSnakes are highly revered and are often thought to have been the progenitors of the ancient [[Baiyue]] peoples, which included the Kam.<ref name=Geary /> The legendary founders of the Kam people, Zhang Liang and Zhang Mei, are often called upon to help with illnesses and disasters.\n\n===Taboos and superstitions===\nTraditional Kam religion uses many taboos, omens, and fetishes. The fetishes are usually plant parts such as tree branches, reeds, leaves, and roots. Some of the taboos and superstitions are listed below.<ref name=Geary />\n\n*Not marrying in the Chinese [[Tiger (zodiac)|Year of the Tiger]], since they must wait around nine years before giving birth to their first infants.\n*Pregnant women cannot participate in marriage ceremonies or arrangements, visit sick acquaintances, or sacrifice to gods.\n*Women cannot give birth in their mothers' home. There are many other childbirth-related taboos and superstitions.\n*Children cannot have haircuts before the age of one month old. The locks of hair from the first haircut must be stored and not be disposed of.\n*Coffins cannot have any metal objects inside them, since departed souls fear metal objects, especially copper.\n*Corpses should not be placed inside coffins during rainy weather. \n*Names are not to be called out when a corpse is being carried to its grave.\n*Chopsticks should not be tapped on bowls, as this is reminiscent of beggars' behavior.\n*The meat of crows or dead wild animals with unknown causes of death bring bad luck and should not be eaten.\n*Unmarried men should not eat pig feet, since pigs have split hooves.\n*New houses should not be built if a neighbor has recently died.\n*Pregnant women should not watch new houses being built.\n*Wood struck by lightning cannot be used for building houses.\n*Main entrances of two houses should not directly face each other as this will cause severe quarreling.\n*It is best to move into new houses at night when the village is already asleep.\n*Nothing should be bought on the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]], as this might cause materials to diminish for the new year. On this day, floors should not be swept, rubbish should not be thrown out, friends should not be visited, arguments should be avoided, and knives should not be used to cut food.\n*The [[lusheng]] should not be played between the sowing and transplanting of rice seedlings, since it could attract plagues of insects.\n*Meeting a pregnant woman while hunting is considered bad luck.\n*While hunting, the names of animals should not be shouted so that the mountain god is not aroused to protect them.\n*Fish swimming upstream are protected by the gods, and catching one will result in bad luck.\n*Leaving home on the 7th, 17th, or 27th day of the month is unlucky. (This custom is also practiced by the Chinese.)\n*A recently deceased person will rise up if a cat jumps over them. Therefore, all domesticated animals must be kept away from them.\n\n===Magic and shamanism===\nRituals involving supernatural elements include dragon dances, spring buffalo dances, and fire prevention ceremonies where ash is placed in boats and sent downstream.\n\nSorcery can be performed in private. There are many purposes of sorcery, such as repelling evil spirits, recovering the soul of a disturbed child, exacting revenge on enemies, and inducing love. Voodoo dolls, borrowed from the Chinese, are made so that pins can be stuck onto them, with the person's name and birth date written on them. The doll is then buried underground after being inserted into a clay pot.<ref name=Geary /> White cocks can be used for revenge sorcery.\n\n[[Shamanism]] is practiced by the Kam and bears many parallels with [[Miao people|Miao]] (Hmong) shamanism. One major duty of shamans is to recover the souls of sick people.<ref name=Geary />\n\n==Notable Dongs==\n<!-- chronological by earliest known date -->\n* [[Su Yu]] (\u7c9f\u88d5) (1907-1984), the first four-star general of the People's Liberation Army\n* Wu Hongfei (\u5434\u8679\u98de) (1975-), singer for the [[Chinese rock]] band [[Happy Avenue]] (\u5e78\u798f\u5927\u8857)\n* Sen Fluke (\u88d5\u8679\u8679) (1945-), Pastor for the Golden Singers (\u5e78\u798f\u5927\u8857)\n* [[Li Ting (diver)|Li Ting]] (\u674e\u5a77) (1987-), gold medalist in the 10 meter synchronized platform [[Diving (sport)|diving]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] at [[Athens]], [[Greece]]\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery\n|lines=1\n|width=225\n|File:ZhaoxingDrumTower.jpg|Drum tower in [[Zhaoxing, Guizhou|Zhaoxing]], [[Guizhou]]\n|File:Automn festival, Chengyangqiao, Guangxi, China.jpg|Autumn festival in Chengyangqiao, [[Guangxi]], China\n|File:Chengyangqiao, Guangxi, China.jpg|Kam covered bridge in [[Guangxi]], China\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*D.

Central vacuum systems are designed to remove dirt and debris from homes and buildings, sending dirt particles through tubing installed inside the walls to a collection container in a remote utility space. The power unit is a permanent fixture, usually installed in a basement, garage, or storage room, along with the collection container.  Inlets are installed in walls throughout the building that attach to power hoses and other central vacuum accessories to remove dust, particles, and small debris from interior rooms.  Most power hoses usually have a power switch located on the handle.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Petit Salon, Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne 48.jpg|thumb|This elegant wall conceals an antique central vacuum inlet (small dark circle in baseboard next to doorway, c.1918)]] \n[[File:Conduit d'aspirateur - Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Antique central vacuum inlet located in a dining room at [[Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne]] ([[Canadian Register of Historic Places]], c. 1918)]]\n\n===19th century===\nThe first introduction of a system similar to a central vacuum cleaner was in the late 19th century.  A ducted machine that featured copper tubes connected from a [[bellows]] chamber, typically located in the basement, and extended to several locations throughout a building, was used in a select few homes at this time.  Because of the machine\u2019s cost and weak dust-removal capabilities, only a few of these units were ever sold in the United States.\n\nIn 1869 Ives McGaffey patented the first portable vacuum cleaner, or \u201csweeping machine\u201d.<ref>{{US patent|91145}}</ref>  The portable [[vacuum cleaner]] is the parent product to the modern central vacuum system.\n\n===20th century===\nIn the 1930s, the development of small, powerful [[electric motors]] increased the popularity and availability of the portable vacuum cleaner, and further diverted consumers from purchasing central cleaners.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the invention of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) thinwall vacuum tubing made the central vacuum system more affordable in the United States.  Previously, more-expensive metal tubing was used exclusively, and it may still be used for part or all of an installation, if required by building [[fire code]] regulations.\n\nIn the 1990s, central vacuum systems gained popularity among [[real estate agent]]s and [[home improvement|home remodeler]]s for the value they added to homes at resale.  Allergists also played an important role in the growing popularity of central vacuum systems in the 1990s.\n\n==Health benefits==\nWith central vacuum systems that exhaust completely out of the home, no dust or allergens can be recirculated through the interior air,  as is the case with a traditional vacuum.<ref name=DIY-Vent>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=How to Vent a Central Vacuum System to the Outside|url=https://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-vent-a-central-vacuum-system-to-the-outside|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA 2001 study at [[University of California at Davis]] showed improvements in multiple aspects of health in 25 individuals with a documented history of type I [[hypersensitivity]] to [[house dust]]. Each of these individuals used either a Beam Central Vacuum System or their own conventional vacuum for a period of 3 months. At the end of this period, the individual switched over to the opposite limb of the study for 3 additional months. Interestingly, in all seven domains of the evaluation, including activity, sleep, non-nasal symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotions, use of the central vacuum proved to be superior.<ref name=\"Naguwa\">{{cite journal|last=Naguwa|first=Stanley|author2=Gershwin, M.

The other end of the hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door.<ref name=Klein>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Allison|title=How Central Vacuum Systems Work|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/central-vacuum1.htm|work=How Stuff Works|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>   In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on.  Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via [[radio control|wireless]] signaling.\n[[File:Central Vacuum Inlet.jpg|thumb|When a hose is inserted into an inlet, or the switch on a hose is turned on, two low-voltage electrical contacts (highlighted in red) are bridged, signalling the power unit to turn on]]\nVacuuming is performed in the same manner as with a portable machine.  Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate [[sheer fabric]] curtain). Excess vacuum is \"bled off\" by partially opening a bleed port or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool.  The bleed port is usually located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.\n\nWhen cleaning is complete, the vacuum hose is removed from the wall inlet (which snaps shut and shuts down the vacuum motor).  The hose is coiled up and hung on a storage rack, and any cleaning accessories are stowed away.\n\n==Dirt separation==\n[[File:Centraldammsugare.jpg|thumb|upright|Central vacuum power unit, with gray utility inlet valve visible at upper right (Sweden)]]\nCyclonic and filtered central vacuum systems are the two main types of central vacuums, differentiated by the method used to separate dirt and dust from the incoming airstream.<ref name=\"Klein\" />\n \nTrue [[cyclonic separation|cyclonic]] cleaners do not use filtration bags, instead separating the dirt and dust into a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin.  Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction [[tangent]]ial to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning [[vortex]].  Roughly speaking, the dust particles and other debris spiral outward to the wall of the vessel by [[centrifugal force]], where they fall due to [[gravity]] into the bottom of the collection bin.  For a more complete technical description of this process, see the article on \"[[Cyclonic separation]]\".\n\nIn fixed-installation central vacuum cleaners, the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration.  A well-designed cyclonic separation system does not lose [[suction power]] due to airflow restriction, until the collection vessel is almost full.  This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which gradually lose suction as pores in the filter become clogged by collected dirt and dust.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nFiltered systems use a wide variety of different bags or filters that must be cleaned (permanent cloth bags) or replaced (disposable paper bags) on a regular basis.  Filters can be made from screening, foam, paper, or cloth, and are usually proprietary designs that may not be widely available.  Over time, repeated purchase of filters and bags can become significant ongoing expenses.\n\nBag breakage is an issue that arises with filtered central vacuums.  In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room.  Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance.  By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator.  In fact, the only perceivable change may be an ''increase'' in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed.  If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely [[friction|seizes up]] due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings.  Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.\n\nFilterless central vacuums are completely immune to such failures.  In addition, the best designs in either system incorporate so-called \"bypass cooling\", using a completely separate source of ambient air to cool the motor, rather than the design expedient of using just-filtered dirty airflow for this vital function.\n\nHybrid cyclonic filtered systems have been made, which use a rudimentary cyclonic motion to separate out larger dirt particles, but rely on conventional filter bags to trap remaining finer particles. True cyclonic systems are very effective in removing all but the finest particles, which are then exhausted directly outside, completely eliminating the need for replaceable filters and their consequent airflow restrictions.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  The exhaust from a good quality true cyclonic system does not contain any visible large particles, and contains far less debris than a typical [[clothes dryer]] exhaust.\n\n==Tools and accessories==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Zentralstaubsaugerrohr.jpg|thumb|Central vacuum cleaning tools and hose (partially covered by a protective gray \"hose sock\")]]\n[[File:\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e7 \u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6\u05d9- \u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 \"\u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd\" \u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d1\u05d7.jpg|thumb|Baseboard-level vacuum dustpan inlet (Israel)]]\nCentral vacuums can be equipped with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or [[turbine]]) systems are frequently less expensive since they do not require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet.  Turbine-driven brushes tend to be louder than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable in the absence of the \"vacuum whine\" produced by a portable vacuum. Many users find that the high suction of central vacuums is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.\n\nThe average standard central vacuum system is equipped with a 30&nbsp;foot (9&nbsp;m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners.  For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around a wire rack mounted on a closet wall, or on the back of a door.\n\nAn alternative for storing vacuum hose is the \"Hide-A-Hose\" system, which uses suction to draw the hose into the vacuum tubing in the wall for storage.  Hose lengths used are typically 30/40/50&nbsp;ft (9/12/15&nbsp;m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage.<ref name=HideHose>{{cite web|title=Hide-A-Hose System|url=http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|work=Vacuflo.com|publisher=H-P Products, Inc.|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820234114/http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|archivedate=2011-08-20}}</ref> A scaled-down 10-foot (3&nbsp;m) version (such as \"Spot by Vroom\") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms.  The original \"Vroom\" system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet-mounted hose reel with a 24&nbsp;ft (7.3&nbsp;m) hose, rather than storing the hose within the wall tubing.\n\nA modular vacuum hose called \"QuickClick\" is available in 10/15/20&nbsp;foot (3/4.5/6&nbsp;m) lengths, allowing a custom-length hose to be quickly set up or taken apart by an end user. In addition, a promotional article in a trade magazine{{which|date=March 2013}} says that [[arthritis|arthritic]] testers were able to connect and disconnect the hose in spite of their disability.\n\nAutomatic dustpans (e.g. \"Vacpan\" or \"KickSweep\") can be installed in the [[Kick space |kickspace]] under a kitchen, bathroom, or workroom countertop, enabling a person to use a standard [[broom]] to sweep debris directly into a vacuum inlet located there.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=DIY-Vacpan>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=Central Vacuum Automatic Dustpan|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/central-vacuum-automatic-dustpan#.UVnFzr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=VacPan>{{cite web|title=VacPan, VacPan II, and VacuSweep|url=http://builtinvacuum.com/vacpan.html|work=builtinvacuum.com [website]|publisher=M.D. Manufacturing, Inc.|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Alternatively, a \"DrawerVac\" inlet which pulls out like a drawer from the underside of a table or counter can be used to dispose of debris from a shop or kitchen work surface.\n \nThe \"VacnSeal\" is an accessory intended to be installed on the underside of a [[kitchen cabinet]], over a countertop used for food preparation.

This ability may depend on the ability of the filter bag to resist clogging or breakage; filterless models are capable of removing the widest range of materials. \"Wet vacuum interceptor\" accessories are available for some systems; these operate by separating liquids from the dirty airstream prior to passage into the in-wall tubing and central unit. These \"wet vac\" units are subject to the same limitations as \"wet-or-dry [[Shop vac|shop vacuums]]\", and must be washed out and dried after use to prevent unpleasant odors and [[mold]] growth. However, toxic materials, such as [[asbestos]] should never be cleaned up with anything but specialized equipment made expressly for the purpose.\n* Complete removal of [[allergen]]s and noxious [[odor]]s \u2014 Central vacuums generally do not recirculate exhaust air back into the space being cleaned.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" />  This contrasts with the well-known acrid \"vacuum smell\" of [[fine dust]] and hot air exhausted from a portable vacuum.  Instead, central vacuums exhaust spent air into a utility space, or directly outdoors.  An external exhaust outlet can be easily concealed under a porch or behind shrubbery, but in any case is less obtrusive than a standard [[clothes dryer]] appliance vent.\n* Low [[acoustic noise]] \u2014 Well-designed central vacuums are very quiet at the point of use, since the powerful motor is located remotely in a utility space.  This is a benefit to the person vacuuming, as well as anybody else occupying the space being cleaned, who otherwise might be woken up or driven out by the loud whine of a portable machine.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=Donovan>{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Dave|title=The Many Benefits of Central Vacuum Systems|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac#.UVnEOr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209000107/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac|archivedate=9 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* Convenient cleaning \u2014  Setup, use, and storage of a vacuum hose and cleaning tool can be quick and efficient.  Cleaning stairways is much easier without having to balance a heavy, hot appliance on each step, and coping with both an electrical cord and a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n* Infrequent emptying \u2014 Central vacuums can usually accumulate up to 10&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;pounds) or more of dirt and dust before requiring disposal.  This is an unavoidable dirty process that must be performed for any vacuum cleaner, but can be done much less frequently, perhaps a few times per year.  Disposable filter bag systems are easy to empty, though care must be taken to refit the replacement bag to allow maximum airflow without leaks. Emptying the dust canister of a cyclonic vacuum is best done outdoors on a breezy day because of the fine dust cloud that can be released.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n* Low consumables cost \u2014 For filterless systems, there are no ongoing costs, other than occasionally replacing a worn-out motor brush or vacuum hose.\n* Compatible with standard tools and accessories \u2014 Most central vacuum hoses are compatible with a wide range of industry standard brushes and tools used with ordinary portable vacuum cleaners.  In the United States, the [[de facto standard]] size is 1-1/4&nbsp;inch (3.175&nbsp;cm) inside diameter for tools.  For some accessories, it may actually be necessary to \"bleed off\" excessive suction, usually by partially opening a small bleed port on the side of the vacuum hose handle, provided for that purpose.\n* Reduced damage and wear to furniture and walls \u2014 There is no heavy or awkward canister or other motorized unit to carry from room to room when vacuuming.  Only a lightweight vacuum hose and the cleaning tool being used need to be carried.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />  To further reduce wear to furniture feet and projecting baseboard corners, a soft woven \"hose sock\" can be installed over the corrugated vacuum hose.\n* Durable equipment \u2014 Good-quality central vacuum systems can last indefinitely, perhaps requiring replacement of the motor brushes once per decade of use.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /> Besides using heavy-duty components, central vacuums avoid the damage caused by accidental dropping or collisions of portable equipment with fixed objects.  Many manufacturers give a \"Lifetime Limited Warranty\" on all permanently installed components of a central vacuum system.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nThe chief disadvantage of central vacuums is higher initial cost.  In the United States, the average central vacuum system has an installed cost of around $1,000.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> This initial expense must be weighed against the long-term benefits of a central vacuum, including the typical longer service life of the equipment, and negligible consumables cost if a filterless system is chosen.\n\nA central vacuum system is generally considered by building owners a permanent [[fixture (property law)|fixture]] of the building where it is installed, similar to plumbing and electrical fixtures. A short-term renter would most likely lose any investment made in improving the property, unless a prior agreement was made with the property owner. Installation of a quality central vacuum increases the [[property value]] of a residence or commercial property.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n\n==Maintenance==\n[[File:ZentralStaubsaugAnlage.jpg|thumb|In-wall vacuum inlet valve; Central power unit; Bagless dirt collection canister and auxiliary filter (click on photo to enlarge)]]\nCentral vacuum systems require periodic emptying of the dirt canister or replacing the filter bag, typically 2\u20134 times per year.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> In some models, it is also important that the filters be changed frequently, especially for designs where the just-filtered air passes through the motor for cooling.  For filtered systems, the bag may need to be replaced long before it is filled to its nominal capacity, because of reduced suction due to clogging with dirt or fine dust.\n\nFilterless cyclonic separation systems only require emptying the dirt collection container before the suction drops off as an almost-full condition is reached.  Many cyclonic vacuum systems now feature [[translucent]] dirt collection canisters, allowing quick inspection without removing the canister.\n\nRegardless of which dirt separation system is used, the electric motor may require lubrication of its [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, or replacement of [[carbon brushes]] on an infrequent basis, usually measured in years.<ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRarely, a central vacuum system may become clogged, especially if the tubing was improperly installed, or if the system is abused by vacuuming sticky substances (such as paint or glue or wet foodstuffs).<ref name=DIY-Maint>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=General Central Vacuum Maintenance|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance#.UVnMw7-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622025813/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance|archivedate=22 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A homeowner can usually use simple tools and techniques to locate and remove the obstruction,<ref name=DIY-Unclog>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=How to Unclog a Central Vacuum System|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-unclog-a-central-vacuum-system#.UVnH7L-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> or can hire a professional vacuum installer to do repairs.

The most important safeguard is at the vacuum inlets, which are intentionally designed with a tighter [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] than any other bends in the system.  This is done to ensure that if any vacuumed debris becomes stuck, it will jam right at the inlet, where it is easiest to discover and to remove.  Well-designed central vacuum tubing rarely or never clogs unless severely abused (e.g. vacuuming wet plaster, wet flour, or other sticky substances).\n\nThe wall inlets are connected to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air [[duct (HVAC)|return ducts]] (if permitted by [[building code]]).  In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a \"rough-in\" phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, [[HVAC]], electrical, etc.), and just before [[drywall]], paneling, or other surface finishes are installed.  Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed ''before'' cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing.  In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.\n\nVacuum tubing systems may be installed by [[electrician]]s, [[plumber]]s, specialized contractors, or even [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] (DIY) homeowners.<ref name=Guertin>{{cite journal|last=Guertin|first=Mike|title=You Can Install a Central Vac|journal=Fine Homebuilding|date=November 2011|issue=222|pages=64\u201367|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT|issn=1096-360X}}</ref><ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRetrofitting of vacuum tubing in existing structures can be surprisingly straight forward or more difficult, depending on the anatomy of the building.  A home remodeling project can generate large amounts of irritating plaster dust and other demolition and construction dirt.  Installing a central vacuum early in the project makes ongoing cleanup much easier, especially if it is a filterless true cyclonic unit, which can inhale even abrasive or sharp construction debris without concerns about bag clogging or breakage.\n[[File:Central Vacuum Floor Inlet.jpg|thumb|[[Metal]] floor inlets are used in locations in existing structures where it would be impossible or impractical to install standard wall inlets]]\n\nA typical house requires 2\u20134 inlets per floor, although many users find the central vacuum so convenient that they later install additional inlets in the basement, attic, garage, and even on the back porch (for vacuuming car interiors, storage sheds, etc.). A rough rule of thumb is one inlet per {{convert|600|sqft|m2}} of floor area.<ref name=\"Klein\" />  Inlets should be placed in convenient locations unlikely to be blocked by open doors or furniture, such as in central hallways. A non-stretchable cord of appropriate length (or a thin wire on an [[Architectural drawing|architectural scale drawing]]) can be used to check for adequate reach of a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nRouting and design of vacuum tubing layout is very similar to [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) plumbing, with the exception that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required.  Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages.  Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal \"running start\". In some jurisdictions, [[fire code]] regulations require that an [[firestop|intumescent firestop collar]] be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a [[Firewall (construction)|firewall]].  If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external [[pipe insulation]] to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.<ref name=BeamMan>{{cite web|title=Do-It-Yourself Installation Manual|url=http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|work=Beam Central Vacuum Systems|publisher=Electrolux Home Care Products|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017134705/http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|archivedate=2011-10-17}}</ref>\n\nTwo different diameters of thinwall (typically 20 gauge or \"[[Schedule 20]]\") plastic tubing have traditionally been used in the US.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  For years, HP Vacuflo advocated the slightly smaller {{convert|1+13/16|in|cm|adj=on}} tubing size (outside diameter), claiming that their studies showed that it was less likely to clog.  However, that manufacturer has also switched to the [[de facto standard|de facto industry standard]] size of {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on}} outside diameter tubing and corresponding fittings.  In most cases, the end user need not be aware of the tubing size in a central vacuum system, but the tubing size must be considered when extending, modifying, or repairing a system.  Size adapters have been made to allow interconnection of the two sizes when necessary.\n\nAnother tubing option, which is becoming popular in commercial applications and with DIYer's, is \"[[Schedule 40]]\" standard 2-inch plumbing pipe. The main advantage of plumbing pipe is widespread availability, slightly larger diameter, and thicker walls. The thicker material increases durability and ruggedness in installations where pipe runs are exposed to mechanical damage or abuse (although this has rarely been reported as a problem with thinwall tubing). The primary disadvantage is that the thicker material makes pipe less flexible, heavier, and somewhat more difficult to work with. The thicker pipe walls increase the outside diameter of the pipe to {{convert|2+3/8|in|cm}}, requiring fittings designed for this.  To use plumbing pipe for central vacuum installation, special adapters (available from many central vacuum retailers) are required to connect the plumbing pipe to the central vacuum inlets and power unit.\n\nOccasionally, the owner of a new house under construction may choose to preinstall vacuum tubing and control wiring in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes. The short-term cost savings of deferring full system completion should be weighed against the great convenience of having a functional vacuum system, especially during the commissioning and move-in period, which generate more than the usual amount of debris to be cleaned up.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Central vacuum cleaners}}\n{{portal|Technology}}\n* [[List of vacuum cleaners]]\n* [[Pneumatic refuse conveying system]] \u2014 larger central vacuum systems used to dispose of industrial or municipal rubbish\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Home appliances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Central Vacuum Cleaner}}\n[[Category:Vacuum cleaners]]\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Cana-Vac 250-E Central Vacuum.jpg|thumb|Central vacuum power unit retrofitted in a 1929 [[Canadian]] house]]\n[[File:Central vacuum system.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical central vacuum cleaner power unit for residential use (North America)]]\n\nA '''central vacuum cleaner''' (also known as '''built-in''' or '''ducted''') is a type of [[vacuum cleaner]] appliance, installed into a building as a semi-permanent fixture. Central vacuum systems are designed to remove dirt and debris from homes and buildings, sending dirt particles through tubing installed inside the walls to a collection container in a remote utility space. The power unit is a permanent fixture, usually installed in a basement, garage, or storage room, along with the collection container.  Inlets are installed in walls throughout the building that attach to power hoses and other central vacuum accessories to remove dust, particles, and small debris from interior rooms.  Most power hoses usually have a power switch located on the handle.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Petit Salon, Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne 48.jpg|thumb|This elegant wall conceals an antique central vacuum inlet (small dark circle in baseboard next to doorway, c.1918)]] \n[[File:Conduit d'aspirateur - Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Antique central vacuum inlet located in a dining room at [[Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne]] ([[Canadian Register of Historic Places]], c. 1918)]]\n\n===19th century===\nThe first introduction of a system similar to a central vacuum cleaner was in the late 19th century.  A ducted machine that featured copper tubes connected from a [[bellows]] chamber, typically located in the basement, and extended to several locations throughout a building, was used in a select few homes at this time.  Because of the machine\u2019s cost and weak dust-removal capabilities, only a few of these units were ever sold in the United States.\n\nIn 1869 Ives McGaffey patented the first portable vacuum cleaner, or \u201csweeping machine\u201d.<ref>{{US patent|91145}}</ref>  The portable [[vacuum cleaner]] is the parent product to the modern central vacuum system.\n\n===20th century===\nIn the 1930s, the development of small, powerful [[electric motors]] increased the popularity and availability of the portable vacuum cleaner, and further diverted consumers from purchasing central cleaners.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the invention of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) thinwall vacuum tubing made the central vacuum system more affordable in the United States.  Previously, more-expensive metal tubing was used exclusively, and it may still be used for part or all of an installation, if required by building [[fire code]] regulations.\n\nIn the 1990s, central vacuum systems gained popularity among [[real estate agent]]s and [[home improvement|home remodeler]]s for the value they added to homes at resale.

Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate [[sheer fabric]] curtain). Excess vacuum is \"bled off\" by partially opening a bleed port or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool.  The bleed port is usually located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.\n\nWhen cleaning is complete, the vacuum hose is removed from the wall inlet (which snaps shut and shuts down the vacuum motor).  The hose is coiled up and hung on a storage rack, and any cleaning accessories are stowed away.\n\n==Dirt separation==\n[[File:Centraldammsugare.jpg|thumb|upright|Central vacuum power unit, with gray utility inlet valve visible at upper right (Sweden)]]\nCyclonic and filtered central vacuum systems are the two main types of central vacuums, differentiated by the method used to separate dirt and dust from the incoming airstream.<ref name=\"Klein\" />\n \nTrue [[cyclonic separation|cyclonic]] cleaners do not use filtration bags, instead separating the dirt and dust into a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin.  Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction [[tangent]]ial to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning [[vortex]].  Roughly speaking, the dust particles and other debris spiral outward to the wall of the vessel by [[centrifugal force]], where they fall due to [[gravity]] into the bottom of the collection bin.  For a more complete technical description of this process, see the article on \"[[Cyclonic separation]]\".\n\nIn fixed-installation central vacuum cleaners, the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration.  A well-designed cyclonic separation system does not lose [[suction power]] due to airflow restriction, until the collection vessel is almost full.  This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which gradually lose suction as pores in the filter become clogged by collected dirt and dust.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nFiltered systems use a wide variety of different bags or filters that must be cleaned (permanent cloth bags) or replaced (disposable paper bags) on a regular basis.  Filters can be made from screening, foam, paper, or cloth, and are usually proprietary designs that may not be widely available.  Over time, repeated purchase of filters and bags can become significant ongoing expenses.\n\nBag breakage is an issue that arises with filtered central vacuums.  In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room.  Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance.  By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator.  In fact, the only perceivable change may be an ''increase'' in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed.  If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely [[friction|seizes up]] due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings.  Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.\n\nFilterless central vacuums are completely immune to such failures.  In addition, the best designs in either system incorporate so-called \"bypass cooling\", using a completely separate source of ambient air to cool the motor, rather than the design expedient of using just-filtered dirty airflow for this vital function.\n\nHybrid cyclonic filtered systems have been made, which use a rudimentary cyclonic motion to separate out larger dirt particles, but rely on conventional filter bags to trap remaining finer particles. True cyclonic systems are very effective in removing all but the finest particles, which are then exhausted directly outside, completely eliminating the need for replaceable filters and their consequent airflow restrictions.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  The exhaust from a good quality true cyclonic system does not contain any visible large particles, and contains far less debris than a typical [[clothes dryer]] exhaust.\n\n==Tools and accessories==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Zentralstaubsaugerrohr.jpg|thumb|Central vacuum cleaning tools and hose (partially covered by a protective gray \"hose sock\")]]\n[[File:\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e7 \u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6\u05d9- \u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 \"\u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd\" \u05dc\u05de\u05d8\u05d1\u05d7.jpg|thumb|Baseboard-level vacuum dustpan inlet (Israel)]]\nCentral vacuums can be equipped with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or [[turbine]]) systems are frequently less expensive since they do not require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet.  Turbine-driven brushes tend to be louder than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable in the absence of the \"vacuum whine\" produced by a portable vacuum. Many users find that the high suction of central vacuums is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.\n\nThe average standard central vacuum system is equipped with a 30&nbsp;foot (9&nbsp;m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners.  For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around a wire rack mounted on a closet wall, or on the back of a door.\n\nAn alternative for storing vacuum hose is the \"Hide-A-Hose\" system, which uses suction to draw the hose into the vacuum tubing in the wall for storage.  Hose lengths used are typically 30/40/50&nbsp;ft (9/12/15&nbsp;m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage.<ref name=HideHose>{{cite web|title=Hide-A-Hose System|url=http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|work=Vacuflo.com|publisher=H-P Products, Inc.|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820234114/http://www.vacuflo.com/hide-a-hose-central-vacuum-hose|archivedate=2011-08-20}}</ref> A scaled-down 10-foot (3&nbsp;m) version (such as \"Spot by Vroom\") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms.  The original \"Vroom\" system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet-mounted hose reel with a 24&nbsp;ft (7.3&nbsp;m) hose, rather than storing the hose within the wall tubing.\n\nA modular vacuum hose called \"QuickClick\" is available in 10/15/20&nbsp;foot (3/4.5/6&nbsp;m) lengths, allowing a custom-length hose to be quickly set up or taken apart by an end user. In addition, a promotional article in a trade magazine{{which|date=March 2013}} says that [[arthritis|arthritic]] testers were able to connect and disconnect the hose in spite of their disability.\n\nAutomatic dustpans (e.g. \"Vacpan\" or \"KickSweep\") can be installed in the [[Kick space |kickspace]] under a kitchen, bathroom, or workroom countertop, enabling a person to use a standard [[broom]] to sweep debris directly into a vacuum inlet located there.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=DIY-Vacpan>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=Central Vacuum Automatic Dustpan|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/central-vacuum-automatic-dustpan#.UVnFzr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=VacPan>{{cite web|title=VacPan, VacPan II, and VacuSweep|url=http://builtinvacuum.com/vacpan.html|work=builtinvacuum.com [website]|publisher=M.D. Manufacturing, Inc.|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Alternatively, a \"DrawerVac\" inlet which pulls out like a drawer from the underside of a table or counter can be used to dispose of debris from a shop or kitchen work surface.\n \nThe \"VacnSeal\" is an accessory intended to be installed on the underside of a [[kitchen cabinet]], over a countertop used for food preparation.

This ability may depend on the ability of the filter bag to resist clogging or breakage; filterless models are capable of removing the widest range of materials. \"Wet vacuum interceptor\" accessories are available for some systems; these operate by separating liquids from the dirty airstream prior to passage into the in-wall tubing and central unit. These \"wet vac\" units are subject to the same limitations as \"wet-or-dry [[Shop vac|shop vacuums]]\", and must be washed out and dried after use to prevent unpleasant odors and [[mold]] growth. However, toxic materials, such as [[asbestos]] should never be cleaned up with anything but specialized equipment made expressly for the purpose.\n* Complete removal of [[allergen]]s and noxious [[odor]]s \u2014 Central vacuums generally do not recirculate exhaust air back into the space being cleaned.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" />  This contrasts with the well-known acrid \"vacuum smell\" of [[fine dust]] and hot air exhausted from a portable vacuum.  Instead, central vacuums exhaust spent air into a utility space, or directly outdoors.  An external exhaust outlet can be easily concealed under a porch or behind shrubbery, but in any case is less obtrusive than a standard [[clothes dryer]] appliance vent.\n* Low [[acoustic noise]] \u2014 Well-designed central vacuums are very quiet at the point of use, since the powerful motor is located remotely in a utility space.  This is a benefit to the person vacuuming, as well as anybody else occupying the space being cleaned, who otherwise might be woken up or driven out by the loud whine of a portable machine.<ref name=\"Guertin\" /><ref name=Donovan>{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Dave|title=The Many Benefits of Central Vacuum Systems|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac#.UVnEOr-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209000107/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/benefitscentralvac|archivedate=9 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* Convenient cleaning \u2014  Setup, use, and storage of a vacuum hose and cleaning tool can be quick and efficient.  Cleaning stairways is much easier without having to balance a heavy, hot appliance on each step, and coping with both an electrical cord and a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n* Infrequent emptying \u2014 Central vacuums can usually accumulate up to 10&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;pounds) or more of dirt and dust before requiring disposal.  This is an unavoidable dirty process that must be performed for any vacuum cleaner, but can be done much less frequently, perhaps a few times per year.  Disposable filter bag systems are easy to empty, though care must be taken to refit the replacement bag to allow maximum airflow without leaks. Emptying the dust canister of a cyclonic vacuum is best done outdoors on a breezy day because of the fine dust cloud that can be released.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n* Low consumables cost \u2014 For filterless systems, there are no ongoing costs, other than occasionally replacing a worn-out motor brush or vacuum hose.\n* Compatible with standard tools and accessories \u2014 Most central vacuum hoses are compatible with a wide range of industry standard brushes and tools used with ordinary portable vacuum cleaners.  In the United States, the [[de facto standard]] size is 1-1/4&nbsp;inch (3.175&nbsp;cm) inside diameter for tools.  For some accessories, it may actually be necessary to \"bleed off\" excessive suction, usually by partially opening a small bleed port on the side of the vacuum hose handle, provided for that purpose.\n* Reduced damage and wear to furniture and walls \u2014 There is no heavy or awkward canister or other motorized unit to carry from room to room when vacuuming.  Only a lightweight vacuum hose and the cleaning tool being used need to be carried.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />  To further reduce wear to furniture feet and projecting baseboard corners, a soft woven \"hose sock\" can be installed over the corrugated vacuum hose.\n* Durable equipment \u2014 Good-quality central vacuum systems can last indefinitely, perhaps requiring replacement of the motor brushes once per decade of use.<ref name=\"Clarke\" /> Besides using heavy-duty components, central vacuums avoid the damage caused by accidental dropping or collisions of portable equipment with fixed objects.  Many manufacturers give a \"Lifetime Limited Warranty\" on all permanently installed components of a central vacuum system.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nThe chief disadvantage of central vacuums is higher initial cost.  In the United States, the average central vacuum system has an installed cost of around $1,000.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> This initial expense must be weighed against the long-term benefits of a central vacuum, including the typical longer service life of the equipment, and negligible consumables cost if a filterless system is chosen.\n\nA central vacuum system is generally considered by building owners a permanent [[fixture (property law)|fixture]] of the building where it is installed, similar to plumbing and electrical fixtures. A short-term renter would most likely lose any investment made in improving the property, unless a prior agreement was made with the property owner. Installation of a quality central vacuum increases the [[property value]] of a residence or commercial property.<ref name=\"Castle\" /><ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /><ref name=\"Donovan\" />\n\n==Maintenance==\n[[File:ZentralStaubsaugAnlage.jpg|thumb|In-wall vacuum inlet valve; Central power unit; Bagless dirt collection canister and auxiliary filter (click on photo to enlarge)]]\nCentral vacuum systems require periodic emptying of the dirt canister or replacing the filter bag, typically 2\u20134 times per year.<ref name=\"Klein\" /><ref name=\"Clarke\" /> In some models, it is also important that the filters be changed frequently, especially for designs where the just-filtered air passes through the motor for cooling.  For filtered systems, the bag may need to be replaced long before it is filled to its nominal capacity, because of reduced suction due to clogging with dirt or fine dust.\n\nFilterless cyclonic separation systems only require emptying the dirt collection container before the suction drops off as an almost-full condition is reached.  Many cyclonic vacuum systems now feature [[translucent]] dirt collection canisters, allowing quick inspection without removing the canister.\n\nRegardless of which dirt separation system is used, the electric motor may require lubrication of its [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, or replacement of [[carbon brushes]] on an infrequent basis, usually measured in years.<ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRarely, a central vacuum system may become clogged, especially if the tubing was improperly installed, or if the system is abused by vacuuming sticky substances (such as paint or glue or wet foodstuffs).<ref name=DIY-Maint>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=General Central Vacuum Maintenance|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance#.UVnMw7-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622025813/http://www.doityourself.com/stry/general-central-vacuum-maintenance|archivedate=22 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A homeowner can usually use simple tools and techniques to locate and remove the obstruction,<ref name=DIY-Unclog>{{cite web|last=DoItYourself Staff|title=How to Unclog a Central Vacuum System|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-unclog-a-central-vacuum-system#.UVnH7L-UonU|work=DoItYourself|publisher=DoItYourself.com|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> or can hire a professional vacuum installer to do repairs.

The most important safeguard is at the vacuum inlets, which are intentionally designed with a tighter [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] than any other bends in the system.  This is done to ensure that if any vacuumed debris becomes stuck, it will jam right at the inlet, where it is easiest to discover and to remove.  Well-designed central vacuum tubing rarely or never clogs unless severely abused (e.g. vacuuming wet plaster, wet flour, or other sticky substances).\n\nThe wall inlets are connected to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air [[duct (HVAC)|return ducts]] (if permitted by [[building code]]).  In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a \"rough-in\" phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, [[HVAC]], electrical, etc.), and just before [[drywall]], paneling, or other surface finishes are installed.  Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed ''before'' cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing.  In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.\n\nVacuum tubing systems may be installed by [[electrician]]s, [[plumber]]s, specialized contractors, or even [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] (DIY) homeowners.<ref name=Guertin>{{cite journal|last=Guertin|first=Mike|title=You Can Install a Central Vac|journal=Fine Homebuilding|date=November 2011|issue=222|pages=64\u201367|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT|issn=1096-360X}}</ref><ref name=\"Clarke\" />\n\nRetrofitting of vacuum tubing in existing structures can be surprisingly straight forward or more difficult, depending on the anatomy of the building.  A home remodeling project can generate large amounts of irritating plaster dust and other demolition and construction dirt.  Installing a central vacuum early in the project makes ongoing cleanup much easier, especially if it is a filterless true cyclonic unit, which can inhale even abrasive or sharp construction debris without concerns about bag clogging or breakage.\n[[File:Central Vacuum Floor Inlet.jpg|thumb|[[Metal]] floor inlets are used in locations in existing structures where it would be impossible or impractical to install standard wall inlets]]\n\nA typical house requires 2\u20134 inlets per floor, although many users find the central vacuum so convenient that they later install additional inlets in the basement, attic, garage, and even on the back porch (for vacuuming car interiors, storage sheds, etc.). A rough rule of thumb is one inlet per {{convert|600|sqft|m2}} of floor area.<ref name=\"Klein\" />  Inlets should be placed in convenient locations unlikely to be blocked by open doors or furniture, such as in central hallways. A non-stretchable cord of appropriate length (or a thin wire on an [[Architectural drawing|architectural scale drawing]]) can be used to check for adequate reach of a vacuum hose.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />\n\nRouting and design of vacuum tubing layout is very similar to [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) plumbing, with the exception that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required.  Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages.  Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal \"running start\". In some jurisdictions, [[fire code]] regulations require that an [[firestop|intumescent firestop collar]] be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a [[Firewall (construction)|firewall]].  If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external [[pipe insulation]] to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.<ref name=BeamMan>{{cite web|title=Do-It-Yourself Installation Manual|url=http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|work=Beam Central Vacuum Systems|publisher=Electrolux Home Care Products|accessdate=2011-07-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017134705/http://www.beamvac.com/usa/installation/install_manual.aspx|archivedate=2011-10-17}}</ref>\n\nTwo different diameters of thinwall (typically 20 gauge or \"[[Schedule 20]]\") plastic tubing have traditionally been used in the US.<ref name=\"Guertin\" />  For years, HP Vacuflo advocated the slightly smaller {{convert|1+13/16|in|cm|adj=on}} tubing size (outside diameter), claiming that their studies showed that it was less likely to clog.  However, that manufacturer has also switched to the [[de facto standard|de facto industry standard]] size of {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on}} outside diameter tubing and corresponding fittings.  In most cases, the end user need not be aware of the tubing size in a central vacuum system, but the tubing size must be considered when extending, modifying, or repairing a system.  Size adapters have been made to allow interconnection of the two sizes when necessary.\n\nAnother tubing option, which is becoming popular in commercial applications and with DIYer's, is \"[[Schedule 40]]\" standard 2-inch plumbing pipe. The main advantage of plumbing pipe is widespread availability, slightly larger diameter, and thicker walls. The thicker material increases durability and ruggedness in installations where pipe runs are exposed to mechanical damage or abuse (although this has rarely been reported as a problem with thinwall tubing). The primary disadvantage is that the thicker material makes pipe less flexible, heavier, and somewhat more difficult to work with. The thicker pipe walls increase the outside diameter of the pipe to {{convert|2+3/8|in|cm}}, requiring fittings designed for this.  To use plumbing pipe for central vacuum installation, special adapters (available from many central vacuum retailers) are required to connect the plumbing pipe to the central vacuum inlets and power unit.\n\nOccasionally, the owner of a new house under construction may choose to preinstall vacuum tubing and control wiring in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes.
