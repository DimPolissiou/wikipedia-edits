[[Separatism]] often refers to full political [[secession]],<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/separatism | title = Free Dictionary | contribution = Separatism}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | contribution = Separatism | contribution-url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separatism | last1 = Merriam | last2 = Webster | title = Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | contribution = Separatism | publisher = Encyclopedia | contribution-url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-separatist.html | title = The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English | year = 2008}}</ref> though separatist movements may seek nothing more than greater [[autonomy]] or to be recognised as a [[national minority]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Harris| first = Jerry| title = The Nation in the Global Era Conflict and Transformation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UQQujqyOJJIC&pg=PA320 | year = 2009| publisher = Brill | isbn = 978-90-04-17690-4 | page = 320}}</ref>\n\nWhat is and is not considered an [[Autonomism|autonomist]] or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:\n# They are active movements with active members;\n# They are seeking greater autonomy or [[self-determination]] for a geographic region (as opposed to [[National personal autonomy|personal autonomy]]);\n# They are citizens/peoples of the conflict area and do not come from another country.\n\nUnder each region listed is one or more of the following:\n* ''De facto'' state (de facto entity): for [[Diplomatic recognition|unrecognized]] regions with de facto autonomy;\n* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding sovereign state;\n* Proposed autonomous area: for movements towards greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession;\n** De facto autonomous government: for governments with de facto autonomous control over a region;\n** Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control;\n** Political party (or parties): for political parties involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession;\n** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations;\n** Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]];\n** [[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s).\n\nVarious ethnic groups in Europe are seeking greater autonomy or independence. In the [[European Union]] (EU), several of these groups are members of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA). In some cases, the group seeks to unify into a different state \u2013 in cases where this does not involve the creation of a new state entity, this is considered to be [[irredentism]]. Analogous irredentist movements are included in the [[list of active irredentist movements]].\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Azerbaijan==\n[[File:Location Nagorno-Karabakh en.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Location of

In 1930 he enrolled in the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|University of Washington Program in Architecture]], graduating in 1935 with a Bachelor of Architecture ([[B.Arch.]]).  In this period he also worked in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].  After apprenticing in a number of private Seattle firms and serving in the military during [[World War II]], he joined the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|Faculty of Architecture at the University of Washington]] in 1946.  He also initiated his own practice and, over the next two decades, designed a series of regional-modernist residences, built with indigenous materials suited to the climate.\n\nSteinbrueck's focus on the character of Seattle's architecture and urban places dates from the early 1950s when he authored ''A Guide to Seattle Architecture'', published for  [[American Institute of Architects]] national convention held in Seattle in 1953.  Steinbrueck went on to publish several other books promoting awareness of the unique character of [[Seattle]]:  ''Seattle Cityscape'' (1962; published to coincide with [[Century 21 Exposition|Century 21]], the Seattle World's Fair)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ochsner|first=Jeffrey Karl|date=2008|title=Victor Steinbrueck Finds His Voice: From the \"Argus to Seattle Cityscape\"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40492217|journal=The Pacific Northwest Quarterly|volume=99|issue=3|pages=122\u2013133|issn=0030-8803}}</ref>, ''Market Sketchbook'' (1968), and ''Seattle Cityscape #2'' (1973).\n\nIn the 1960s Steinbruck became active in [[historic preservation]], and, with others, successfully fought developers' plans to obliterate Seattle's most significant historic district.

In 1930 he enrolled in the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|University of Washington Program in Architecture]], graduating in 1935 with a Bachelor of Architecture ([[B.Arch.]]).  In this period he also worked in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].  After apprenticing in a number of private Seattle firms and serving in the military during [[World War II]], he joined the [[University of Washington College of Architecture and Urban Planning|Faculty of Architecture at the University of Washington]] in 1946.  He also initiated his own practice and, over the next two decades, designed a series of regional-modernist residences, built with indigenous materials suited to the climate.\n\nSteinbrueck's focus on the character of Seattle's architecture and urban places dates from the early 1950s when he authored ''A Guide to Seattle Architecture'', published for  [[American Institute of Architects]] national convention held in Seattle in 1953.  Steinbrueck went on to publish several other books promoting awareness of the unique character of [[Seattle]]:  ''Seattle Cityscape'' (1962; published to coincide with [[Century 21 Exposition|Century 21]], the Seattle World's Fair), ''Market Sketchbook'' (1968), and ''Seattle Cityscape #2'' (1973).\n\nIn the 1960s Steinbruck became active in [[historic preservation]], and, with others, successfully fought developers' plans to obliterate Seattle's most significant historic district.  He was instrumental in the creation of Seattle's first two historic districts, [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]] (1970) and [[Pike Place Market]] (1971).

This collaboration was formalized on [[July 1973|July 1, 1973]], with the goal of coordinating the related research activities of the [[Harvard College Observatory]] (HCO) and the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) under the leadership of a single [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/do/ Director], and housed within the same [https://goo.gl/maps/GdnGb2H9sJCeF6WK9 complex of buildings] on the [[Harvard University|Harvard campus]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The CfA's own history is therefore much shorter than the two fully independent organizations that comprise it.

The Astrophysical Observatory's initial, primary purpose was to \"''record the amount and character of the Sun's heat''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=DeVorkin|first=David H.|title=\"Fred Whipple's Empire: The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 1955-1973\"|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\". [[Charles Greeley Abbot]] was named SAO's first director, and the observatory operated [[Solar telescope|solar telescopes]] to take daily measurements of the [[Sun]]'s intensity in different regions of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|optical electromagnetic spectrum]]. In doing so, the observatory enabled Abbot to make critical refinements to the [[Solar constant]], as well as to serendipitously discover [[Solar cycle|Solar variability]].    \n\nIn 1955, the scientific headquarters of SAO moved from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to affiliate with the [[Harvard College Observatory]] (HCO)<ref name=\":0\" />. [[Fred Lawrence Whipple]], then the chairman of the Harvard Astronomy Department, was named the new director of SAO. The strong collaborative relationship and unified Directorship across SAO and HCO therefore predates the creation of the CfA by 17 years. SAO's move to Harvard's campus also resulted in a rapid expansion of its research program. Following the launch of ''[[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]]'' (the world's first human-made satellite) in 1957, SAO accepted a national challenge<ref>{{Citation|last=Spiller|first=James|title=Rising to the Sputnik Challenge|date=2015|url=https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137507877_2|work=Frontiers for the American Century: Outer Space, Antarctica, and Cold War Nationalism|pages=21\u201364|editor-last=Spiller|editor-first=James|series=Palgrave Studies in the History of Science and Technology|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137507877_2|isbn=978-1-137-50787-7|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> to create a worldwide satellite-tracking network, collaborating with the [[United States Air Force]] on [[Project Space Track (1957-1961)|Project Space Track]].    \n\nWith the creation of [[NASA]] the following year and throughout the [[Space Race|space race]], SAO led major efforts in the development of [[Space telescope|orbiting observatories]] and large [[Ground-based telescope|ground-based telescopes]], laboratory and [[theoretical astrophysics]], as well as the [[Computer|application of computers]] to astrophysical problems.   \n\n=== History of Harvard College Observatory (HCO) ===\n{{Main|Harvard College Observatory}}\n\n[[File:Harvard-Observatory-1899.jpg|thumb|420px|The [[Harvard College Observatory]], circa 1899. [[Harvard Square]] and the City of [[Boston]] are in the distant background. Most of the telescope domes in the foreground are no longer standing, but the largest dome in the top right of the photo, housing the 1847 \"Great Refractor\", still remains. The Great Refractor was the largest telescope in the United States until 1867. It was the first telescope to take a photographic image of the [[Moon]].]]\n\nIn [[1839]], the [[Harvard Corporation]] voted to appoint [[William Cranch Bond]], a prominent [[Boston]] clockmaker, as \"Astronomical Observer to the University\" (at no salary). This marked the founding of the Harvard College Observatory. HCO's first telescope, the 15-inch Great Refractor, was installed in 1847. That telescope was the largest in the United States from installation until 1867.\n\nBetween 1847 and 1852 Bond and pioneer photographer [[John Adams Whipple]] used the Great Refractor telescope to produce images of the moon that are remarkable in their clarity of detail and aesthetic power.

This collaboration was formalized on [[July 1973|July 1, 1973]], with the goal of coordinating the related research activities of the [[Harvard College Observatory]] (HCO) and the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) under the leadership of a single [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/do/ Director], and housed within the same [https://goo.gl/maps/GdnGb2H9sJCeF6WK9 complex of buildings] on the [[Harvard University|Harvard campus]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The CfA's own history is therefore much shorter than the two fully independent organizations that comprise it.

In 1973, SAO moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and unified with the [[Harvard College Observatory]] to form the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  ]]\n\n[[Samuel Pierpont Langley]], the third [[Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution|Secretary of the Smithsonian]], founded what was to become the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory on the south yard of the [[Smithsonian Institution Building|Smithsonian Castle]] (on the U.S. [[National Mall]]) on March 1,[[1890s|1890]]. The Astrophysical Observatory's initial, primary purpose was to \"''record the amount and character of the Sun's heat''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=DeVorkin|first=David H.|title=\"Fred Whipple's Empire: The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 1955-1973\"|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\". [[Charles Greeley Abbot]] was named SAO's first director, and the observatory operated [[Solar telescope|solar telescopes]] to take daily measurements of the [[Sun]]'s intensity in different regions of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|optical electromagnetic spectrum]]. In doing so, the observatory enabled Abbot to make critical refinements to the [[Solar constant]], as well as to serendipitously discover [[Solar cycle|Solar variability]].    \n\nIn 1955, the scientific headquarters of SAO moved from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to affiliate with the [[Harvard College Observatory]] (HCO)<ref name=\":0\" />. [[Fred Lawrence Whipple]], then the chairman of the Harvard Astronomy Department, was named the new director of SAO. The strong collaborative relationship and unified Directorship across SAO and HCO therefore predates the creation of the CfA by 17 years. SAO's move to Harvard's campus also resulted in a rapid expansion of its research program. Following the launch of ''[[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]]'' (the world's first human-made satellite) in 1957, SAO accepted a national challenge<ref>{{Citation|last=Spiller|first=James|title=Rising to the Sputnik Challenge|date=2015|url=https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137507877_2|work=Frontiers for the American Century: Outer Space, Antarctica, and Cold War Nationalism|pages=21\u201364|editor-last=Spiller|editor-first=James|series=Palgrave Studies in the History of Science and Technology|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137507877_2|isbn=978-1-137-50787-7|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> to create a worldwide satellite-tracking network, collaborating with the [[United States Air Force]] on [[Project Space Track (1957-1961)|Project Space Track]].    \n\nWith the the creation of [[NASA]] the following year and throughout the [[Space Race|space race]], SAO led major efforts in the development of [[Space telescope|orbiting observatories]] and large [[Ground-based telescope|ground-based telescopes]], laboratory and [[theoretical astrophysics]], as well as the [[Computer|application of computers]] to astrophysical problems.   \n\n=== History of Harvard College Observatory (HCO) ===\n{{Main|Harvard College Observatory}}\n\n[[File:Harvard-Observatory-1899.jpg|thumb|420px|The [[Harvard College Observatory]], circa 1899.

The Great Refractor was the largest telescope in the United States until 1867. It was the first telescope to take a photographic image of the [[Moon]].]]\n\nIn [[1839]], the [[Harvard Corporation]] voted to appoint [[William Cranch Bond]], a prominent [[Boston]] clockmaker, as \"Astronomical Observer to the University\" (at no salary). This marked the founding of the Harvard College Observatory. HCO's first telescope, the 15-inch Great Refractor, was installed in 1847. That telescope was the largest in the United States from installation until 1867.\n\nBetween 1847 and 1852 Bond and pioneer photographer [[John Adams Whipple]] used the Great Refractor telescope to produce images of the moon that are remarkable in their clarity of detail and aesthetic power. This was the largest telescope in North America at that time, and their images of the moon took the prize for technical excellence in photography at the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]]. On the night of July 16\u201317, 1850, Whipple and Bond made the first [[daguerreotype]] of a star ([[Vega]]).\n\nHarvard College Observatory is historically important to astronomy, as many women including [[Annie Jump Cannon]], [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]], [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]], and [[Williamina Fleming]] performed pivotal [[stellar classification]] research.

In 2011 acquired the UTV music TV channel.\n\n[[Digi 24]] TV news channel was launched on 1 March 2012. Following disagreements with [[Discovery Inc.|Discovery]], the company launched 3 thematic channels in October 2012: Digi World, Digi Life and Digi Animal World. On 10 December 2018 was launched Digi 4K.\n\n=== Energy supplier === \n\nIn April 2015, Digi launched the energy supply service. The company had in 2017 the most subscribers on the competitive market from the companies that do not have the distribution infrastructure. In 2019, it increased tariffs by 30% due to a tax added by the government and then by 20%. The company announced that it is gradually giving up the supply service due to the unusual volatility of the electricity price.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://energyreport.ro/index.php/2013-electricitate/2013-stiri-electricitate/2013-energie-electrica/5020-digi-retrage-furnizarea-de-energie-din-grila-de-programe-a-companiei |title=Digi retrage furnizarea de energie din grila de programe a companiei |publisher=energyreport.ro |date=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Digi brand ==\n\nRCS & RDS introduced the Digi TV brand for satellite television services in December 2004 in Romania and in 2006 in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Serbia.

He also played football at [[Northern Michigan University]] in the early 1960s, and is a former [[NASCAR]] driver and owner, and sportscaster. He served as head coach of the [[Houston Oilers]] from 1986 to 1990 and the [[Atlanta Falcons]] from 1990 to 1994, compiling a career [[National Football League|NFL]] record of 63&ndash;73. From 2007 to 2009, he was the Head Football Coach at [[Portland State University]], tallying a mark of 9&ndash;24. Glanville has worked as an analyst on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', [[CBS Sports|CBS]]'s ''[[The NFL Today]]''/''[[NFL on CBS]]'' and [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox]]'s coverage of the [[NFL on Fox|NFL]]. He has also raced on the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] circuit. Glanville also briefly served as a consultant and liaison for the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] in 2011.\n\nWhile head coach of the Houston Oilers, Glanville coined the now-famous phrase \"NFL means 'not for long'\", while admonishing a game official for making what Glanville felt were bad calls. The exact quote is \"This is N-F-L, which stands for 'not for long' when you make them fuckin' calls.\" The \"NFL\" line was in reference to the fact that the official Glanville was criticizing was in his first year in the league, having previously worked in college football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/09000d5d8213b6cb/Pick-Six-Glanville-NFL-means-Not-For-Long|title=Pick Six: Glanville: 'NFL means 'Not For Long'|work=[[National Football League]]|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nGlanville played college football as a middle linebacker at [[Northern Michigan University]], graduating in 1964 with a bachelor's degree. He also holds a master's degree from [[Western Kentucky University]], where he worked as an assistant football coach on campus and roomed with fellow former NFL coach [[Joe Bugel]]. The two were known for drawing football plays on pizza boxes.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===National Football League===\nDuring Glanville's time in the [[National Football League]] he was the special teams/defensive assistant for the [[Detroit Lions]] from 1974&ndash;1976, the secondary coach for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] from 1977&ndash;1978 and the Falcons defensive coordinator from 1979\u20131982, the secondary coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]] in 1983, the defensive coordinator of the then [[Houston Oilers]] from 1984\u20131985 and then as head coach from 1985\u20131989 (initially being the interim coach after the firing of [[Hugh Campbell]], and then being the permanent replacement starting in 1986), and head coach of the [[Atlanta Falcons]] from 1990\u20131993.\n\nAs an NFL head coach, Glanville led the Houston Oilers (1985\u20131989) during the era known as the \"House of Pain.\" He was famous for often leaving tickets at will-call for [[Elvis Presley]] (who by that point had been dead for over a decade), wearing all black to be easily recognized by his players, and driving replicas of vehicles driven by actor [[James Dean]]. The Oilers were often chastised for being a dirty, cheap-shot style team, and Glanville often feuded with AFC Central Division rival head coaches [[Sam Wyche]] and [[Marty Schottenheimer]]. He received a highly publicized post-game dressing down from [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] Head Coach [[Chuck Noll]] during the customary postgame handshake after the Oilers defeated the Steelers in the Houston Astrodome during the 1987 season.\n\nGlanville turned the Oilers, a team that had struggled through most of the 1980s, into an aggressive, hard-hitting group that preached a \"hit the beach\" mentality and he made players, such as future Hall of Fame QB [[Warren Moon]], into household names. The Oilers made three playoff appearances during Glanville's tenure (which happened to be during the last three seasons of his tenure), twice playing in the AFC divisional round.  However, his final game with the Oilers was the 1989 AFC Wild Card game, played on December 31, 1989.  Glanville's 1989 squad finished its season with consecutive losses against the Bengals in Cincinnati (61\u20137), at home against the Cleveland Browns in the final seconds in a game that decided the AFC Central title (24\u201320), and at home in the playoffs against the Steelers (26\u201323 in overtime). Had the Oilers defeated Pittsburgh, Glanville would have spent January 6, 1990, preparing the team to play at Denver and, possibly, play for its first AFC Championship Game berth in a decade. Instead, Glanville was fired that day.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1990/01/07/suspense-over-glanville-fired/18a388a3-19be-417d-8db4-7daec9ce760d/</ref> To replace him, Oilers owner K.

The brash Glanville, as well as fan favorites such as cornerback-return specialist Deion Sanders, generated a great deal of excitement in Atlanta.  A perfect preseason in 1990 raised expectations prior to the first game of the season.  The host Falcons withstood a furious rally and scored on a late pick-six by Sanders.  Atlanta defeated Glanville's former team, the Oilers, 47\u201327.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1990-09-11-1990254072-story.html|title=Falcons' opening win gets Glanville talking Rips Oilers coach Pardee, general manager Holovak, NFL|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|date=|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGlanville claimed with Atlanta he inherited a \"flat-tire\" but would take the team to the NFC divisional round in the 1991 season. Season highlights included a season sweep of the 49ers, which cost San Francisco a playoff spot despite both teams finishing 10-6; and the team's first playoff victory since 1978 and only the second playoff win in the franchise's 26-year history.  During his time with the Falcons, the team would pitch a \"Back in Black\" motto with new uniforms and the same aggressive type play on defense, an offensive system known as the \"Red Gun\" that would implement most of the principles associated with the Run-N-Shoot offense, and an emphasis on special teams as he had done in Houston. The Falcons featured talented players such as future Hall of Famer CB \"Prime Time\" [[Deion Sanders]] and were known for unorthodox antics. Expectations were high after the success of the 1991 season and after the Falcons vacated Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for the Georgia Dome, but the team's consecutive 6\u201310 records for the 1992 and 1993 led the Falcons to dismiss Glanville in 1994. He was out of football until he became the University of Hawaii's defensive coordinator over a decade later. His career record as an NFL head coach is 63\u201373.\n\nWhen Atlanta Falcons general manager Ken Herock selected [[Brett Favre]] in the second round of the [[1991 NFL Draft]], Glanville did not approve of the pick because of Favre's personal issues with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and the party lifestyle. He said it would take a plane crash for him to put Favre into a game. Glanville also was known to place $100 bets (with Favre and others) on whether or not Favre could throw a football into the third deck of stadiums before games. Glanville claimed the trade in the off-season of 1992 was a wake-up call for Favre who was known for even being late to the team picture during his rookie season with the Falcons.<ref name=\"JSAtlanta\">{{cite web| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=358097 | title=Trading places | last=D'Amato | first=Gary| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| date=October 24, 2005| access-date=February 8, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070603144334/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=358097 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 3, 2007}}</ref> Favre only threw four passes during his one season with Atlanta then was traded to the [[Green Bay Packers]] for a first round pick. Favre went on to play 19 seasons, starting every game from September 20, 1992 to December 5, 2010 and becoming the first NFL player to win three AP MVP awards, as well as the first player to throw for 70,000 passing yards and 500 touchdowns.

The exact quote is \"This is N-F-L, which stands for 'not for long' when you make them fuckin' calls.\" The \"NFL\" line was in reference to the fact that the official Glanville was criticizing was in his first year in the league, having previously worked in college football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/09000d5d8213b6cb/Pick-Six-Glanville-NFL-means-Not-For-Long|title=Pick Six: Glanville: 'NFL means 'Not For Long'|work=[[National Football League]]|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nGlanville played college football as a middle linebacker at [[Northern Michigan University]], graduating in 1964 with a bachelor's degree. He also holds a master's degree from [[Western Kentucky University]], where he worked as an assistant football coach on campus and roomed with fellow former NFL coach [[Joe Bugel]]. The two were known for drawing football plays on pizza boxes.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===National Football League===\nDuring Glanville's time in the [[National Football League]] he was the special teams/defensive assistant for the [[Detroit Lions]] from 1974&ndash;1976, the secondary coach for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] from 1977&ndash;1978 and the Falcons defensive coordinator from 1979\u20131982, the secondary coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]] in 1983, the defensive coordinator of the then [[Houston Oilers]] from 1984\u20131985 and then as head coach from 1985\u20131989 (initially being the interim coach after the firing of [[Hugh Campbell]], and then being the permanent replacement starting in 1986), and head coach of the [[Atlanta Falcons]] from 1990\u20131993.\n\nAs an NFL head coach, Glanville led the Houston Oilers (1985\u20131989) during the era known as the \"House of Pain.\" He was famous for often leaving tickets at will-call for [[Elvis Presley]] (who by that point had been dead for over a decade), wearing all black to be easily recognized by his players, and driving replicas of vehicles driven by actor [[James Dean]]. The Oilers were often chastised for being a dirty, cheap-shot style team, and Glanville often feuded with AFC Central Division rival head coaches [[Sam Wyche]] and [[Marty Schottenheimer]]. He received a highly publicized post-game dressing down from [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] Head Coach [[Chuck Noll]] during the customary postgame handshake after the Oilers defeated the Steelers in the Houston Astrodome during the 1987 season.\n\nGlanville turned the Oilers, a team that had struggled through most of the 1980s, into an aggressive, hard-hitting group that preached a \"hit the beach\" mentality and he made players, such as future Hall of Fame QB [[Warren Moon]], into household names. The Oilers made three playoff appearances during Glanville's tenure (which happened to be during the last three seasons of his tenure), twice playing in the AFC divisional round.  However, his final game with the Oilers was the 1989 AFC Wild Card game, played on December 31, 1989.  Glanville's 1989 squad finished its season with consecutive losses against the Bengals in Cincinnati (61\u20137), at home against the Cleveland Browns in the final seconds in a game that decided the AFC Central title (24\u201320), and at home in the playoffs against the Steelers (26\u201323 in overtime). Had the Oilers defeated Pittsburgh, Glanville would have spent January 6, 1990, preparing the team to play at Denver and, possibly, play for its first AFC Championship Game berth in a decade. Instead, Glanville was fired that day.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1990/01/07/suspense-over-glanville-fired/18a388a3-19be-417d-8db4-7daec9ce760d/</ref> To replace him, Oilers owner K.

The brash Glanville, as well as fan favorites such as cornerback-return specialist Deion Sanders, generated a great deal of excitement in Atlanta.  A perfect preseason in 1990 raised expectations prior to the first game of the season.  The host Falcons withstood a furious rally and scored on a late pick-six by Sanders.  Atlanta defeated Glanville's former team, the Oilers, 47\u201327.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1990-09-11-1990254072-story.html|title=Falcons' opening win gets Glanville talking Rips Oilers coach Pardee, general manager Holovak, NFL|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|date=|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGlanville claimed with Atlanta he inherited a \"flat-tire\" but would take the team to the NFC divisional round in the 1991 season. Season highlights included a season sweep of the 49ers, which cost San Francisco a playoff spot despite both teams finishing 10-6; and the team's first playoff victory since 1978 and only the second playoff win in the franchise's 26-year history.  During his time with the Falcons, the team would pitch a \"Back in Black\" motto with new uniforms and the same aggressive type play on defense, an offensive system known as the \"Red Gun\" that would implement most of the principles associated with the Run-N-Shoot offense, and an emphasis on special teams as he had done in Houston. The Falcons featured talented players such as future Hall of Famer CB \"Prime Time\" [[Deion Sanders]] and were known for unorthodox antics. Expectations were high after the success of the 1991 season and after the Falcons vacated Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for the Georgia Dome, but the team's consecutive 6\u201310 records for the 1992 and 1993 led the Falcons to dismiss Glanville in 1994. He was out of football until he became the University of Hawaii's defensive coordinator over a decade later. His career record as an NFL head coach is 63\u201373.\n\nWhen Atlanta Falcons general manager Ken Herock selected [[Brett Favre]] in the second round of the [[1991 NFL Draft]], Glanville did not approve of the pick because of Favre's personal issues with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and the party lifestyle. He said it would take a plane crash for him to put Favre into a game. Glanville also was known to place $100 bets (with Favre and others) on whether or not Favre could throw a football into the third deck of stadiums before games. Glanville claimed the trade in the off-season of 1992 was a wake-up call for Favre who was known for even being late to the team picture during his rookie season with the Falcons.<ref name=\"JSAtlanta\">{{cite web| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=358097 | title=Trading places | last=D'Amato | first=Gary| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| date=October 24, 2005| access-date=February 8, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070603144334/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=358097 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 3, 2007}}</ref> Favre only threw four passes during his one season with Atlanta then was traded to the [[Green Bay Packers]] for a first round pick. Favre went on to play 19 seasons, starting every game from September 20, 1992 to December 5, 2010 and becoming the first NFL player to win three AP MVP awards, as well as the first player to throw for 70,000 passing yards and 500 touchdowns. He would also appear in two Super Bowls, winning [[Super Bowl XXXI]].\n\n===United Football League===\nOn March 21, 2011, the [[Hartford Colonials]] of the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] announced that Glanville would serve as the team's head coach and general manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufl-football.com/news/jerry-glanville-named-hartford-colonials-head-coach-and-general-manager|title=Jerry Glanville Named Hartford Colonials Head Coach and General Manager|work=United Football League|first=Jerry|last=Glanville|date=March 21, 2011|access-date=March 21, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322183003/http://www.ufl-football.com/news/jerry-glanville-named-hartford-colonials-head-coach-and-general-manager|archive-date=March 22, 2011}}</ref> The Colonials suspended operations in August of that year; Glanville would remain with the league as a consultant, color commentator for the league's television broadcasts, and liaison for potential expansion markets.

He served as the Acting President of Kenya between 5 and 8 October 2014 when President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] was at the Hague. He previously served in various ministerial positions, including the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Higher Education Science and Technology. He was Secretary General of [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]], the former ruling political party, and the MP for [[Eldoret North Constituency]] between December 1997 and January 2013. He won the seat in the [[1997 Kenyan general election|1997 Kenyan election]] after defeating Reuben Chesire. He was appointed to the position of Assistant Minister in the Office of the President by President [[Daniel arap Moi]] in 1998. He was promoted to be Minister for Home Affairs in August 2002. Ruto also previously served as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Constitutional Reform in the 9th Parliament.\n\nOn 4 March 2013, he became the first Deputy President of Kenya, when he and Uhuru Kenyatta were declared winners of the [[2013 Kenyan general election]]. The duo ran on a [[Jubilee Alliance]] ticket. The [[Jubilee Alliance]] was a coalition of his [[United Republican Party]] (URP) and Kenyatta's [[The National Alliance]]. \n\nRuto was among the list of people who were indicted to stand trial at the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) for their involvement in Kenya's 2007\u201308 political violence. However, the ICC case was faced with challenges especially concerning withdrawal of key prosecution witnesses. In April 2016, the International Criminal Court dropped the charges against Ruto.<ref name=\"theguardian1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/international-criminal-court-william-ruto-kenya-deputy-president-election-violence|title=International criminal court abandons case against William Ruto|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=6 April 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nIn the August [[2017 Kenyan general election]], Uhuru and Ruto were declared victors of the election with 54%. However, the [[Supreme Court of Kenya]] nullified the election and a fresh [[October 2017 Kenyan presidential election|election]] was held in October 2017. The opposition boycotted the fresh election and Uhuru and Ruto were re-elected with 98% of the vote. The Supreme Court upheld the results of this second election. <ref>https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-repeat-presidential-vote.html</ref>. In December 2018, Ruto graduated from the University of Nairobi with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in [[Plant ecology|Plant Ecology]].

His strong support in 2002 for Moi's preferred successor [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] saw him get an appointment as assistant minister in the Home Affairs (Interior) ministry docket.

He was appointed to the position of Assistant Minister in the Office of the President by President [[Daniel arap Moi]] in 1998. He was promoted to be Minister for Home Affairs in August 2002. Ruto also previously served as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Constitutional Reform in the 9th Parliament.\n\nOn 4 March 2013, he became the first Deputy President of Kenya, when he and Uhuru Kenyatta were declared winners of the [[2013 Kenyan general election]].

Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.<ref name=\"lindsays\">Jervise, A.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present.

Smokies are made from [[haddock]] using traditional methods dating back to the late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid.

The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.<ref name=\"Dowlatshahi\"/>\n\nThe problem of film decay is not limited to films made on [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced [[Technicolor]]) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original [[film production]]s or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. [[Cellulose acetate film]], which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from \"[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the \"vinegar syndrome\"|vinegar syndrome]]\".<ref name=\"Dowlatshahi\"/>  Polyester film base, which replaced acetate, also suffers from fading colors.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nStorage at carefully controlled low temperatures and low humidity can inhibit both color fading and the onset of vinegar syndrome. However, once degradation begins to occur, the chemical reactions involved will promote further deterioration. \"There is no indication that we will ever find a way to arrest decomposition once it has started. All we can do is inhibit it\" according to the director of the AMIA ([[Association of Moving Image Archivists]]) board, Leo Enticknap.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=Emma |title=Re-record, not fade away |journal=Chemistry World |date=28 November 2011 |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/re-record-not-fade-away/3004766.article |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Film decay as an art form===\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDa-mmSldDg [[Decasia]] movie trailer], Icarus Films}}\n\nIn 2002, filmmaker [[Bill Morrison (director)|Bill Morrison]] produced ''[[Decasia]]'', a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film.

It is therefore particularly important to keep camera negatives or digital masters under safe storage conditions.<ref name=\"Curr\u00f2\"/>\n\nThe [[original camera negative]] is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.\nRestorers sometimes create a composite negative (or composite dupe) by recombining duplicated sections of the best remaining material, sometimes on \"a shot-to-shot, frame-by-frame basis\" to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film's release cycle.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Kroon\">{{cite book |last1=Kroon |first1=Richard W. |title=A/V A to Z An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and Other Audiovisual Terms |date=2010 |page=165}}</ref>\n\nIn traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a [[fine grain master positive]].<ref name=\"Enticknap2013\">{{cite book |last1=Enticknap |first1=L. |title=Film Restoration: The Culture and Science of Audiovisual Heritage |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |pages=94-97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRlEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA94 |accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>\nPreservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.<ref name=\"Enticknap2013\"/>\n\n==Film as archival medium==\n\nFilm preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.com/2012/09/jason-gorbers-cineruminations-70mm-4k-and-the-master-split-personality.html |title=twitchfilm.com.

From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be ''all'' of them.  In 1986, when [[Ted Turner]] acquired MGM's library (which by then had included [[Warner Bros.]]' pre-1950,<ref>{{cite book|last=Schickel|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Schickel|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros.

[[Time Warner]], the current owner of [[Turner Entertainment]], continues this work today.\n\nThe cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated\u2014a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  His film, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' included a key scene in which many of film pioneer [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as \"a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd| authorlink =Todd McCarthy|title=Hugo: Film Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hugo/review/263209|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nScorsese's concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create [[The Film Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation's board of directors\u2014[[Woody Allen]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[George Lucas]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. In 2006, [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Curtis Hanson]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Ang Lee]], and [[Alexander Payne]] were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the [[Directors Guild of America]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nBy working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised\u2014or [[censorship|censored]] by the [[Production Code]] in the U.S.\u2014from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through ''The Story of Movies'', an educational program claimed to be \"used by over 100,000 educators nationwide\".<ref>[http://www.storyofmovies.org/common/11041/aboutFoundation.cfm?clientID=11041 About the Foundation] at storyofmovies.org</ref>\n\nIn the age of [[digital television]], [[high definition television]] and [[DVD]], film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats.  Meanwhile, the dominance of [[home video]] and ever-present need for [[television broadcasting]] content, especially on [[specialty channel]]s, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.\n\n==Video Aids to Film Preservation==\nThe group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.\n\nThe VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS) grant to the [[Folkstreams]] project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] with video demonstrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Aids to Film Preservation|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/#content|work=Folkstreams|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref> The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the [[Creative Commons]] license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution\u2014in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.\n\n==Obstacles in restoration==\n{{or-section|date=March 2019}}\nRegardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly. Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.) all significantly raise the difficulty and the cost of preservation processes.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/> Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.\n\nCost is another obstacle.<ref name=\"Dowlatshahi\"/> In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at \"several hundred thousand dollars.\"<ref>[http://www.film-foundation.org film-foundation.org FAQ http://www.film-foundation.org/faq]</ref> The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer \"commercially\" viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.<ref name=\"Distillations\">{{cite journal |last1=Greco |first1= JoAnn |title=  Saving Old Movies |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/saving-old-movies |journal=Distillations |publisher= [[Science History Institute]] |date= November 12, 2018|volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=36-39 |accessdate=April 23, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nDemand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Digital restoration steps==\n\nOnce a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via [[telecine]] or a [[motion picture film scanner]] to a [[magnetic tape data storage|digital tape]] or [[hard disk drive|disk]], and the audio is synced to create a new [[audio mastering|master]].\n\nThe main defects needing restoration:\n* Dirt/dust\n* Scratches, tears/[[movie projector#Light source|burned frames]]\n* Color fade, color change\n* Excessive [[film grain]] (a copy of an existing film has all of the film grain from the original as well as the film grain in the copy)\n* Missing scenes and sound (censored or edited out for re-release)\n* Shrinkage<ref group=\"nb\">Linear and \"across the web\" (width), as well as localized puckering around large (1 to 2) perforation film cement splices, most common in silent and very early sound films. Highly shrunken film (1.5% or higher), must be copied on modified equipment or the film will most likely be damaged. In the case of flammable nitrate film, this could prove to be dangerous, as the film can jam in the duplicator and become idle. Some methods of duplication have illumination sources with enough heat to ignite the film if exposed to the light source for a long period of time.</ref>\nModern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:\n<ol type+\"1\">\n<li>Expertly clean the film of dirt and dust.</li>\n<li>Repair all film tears with clear polyester tape or splicing cement.</li>\n<li>Scan each frame into a digital file.</li>\n<li>Restore the film frame by frame by comparing each frame to adjacent frames. This can be done somewhat by computer algorithms with human checking of the result.</li>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Fix frame alignment (\"jitter\" and \"weave\"), or the misalignment of adjacent film frames due to movement of film within the sprockets. This corrects the issue where the holes on each side of a frame are distorted over time. This causes frames to slightly be off center.\n<li>Fix color and lighting changes. This corrects flickering and slight color changes from one frame to another due to aging of the film.\n<li>Restore areas blocked by dirt and dust by using parts of images in other frames.</li>\n<li>Restore scratches by using parts of images in other frames.</li>\n<li>Enhance frames by reducing film grain noise. Film foreground/background detail about the same size as the film grain or smaller is blurred or lost in making the film. Comparing a frame with adjacent frames allows detail information to be reconstructed since a given small detail may be split between more film grains from one frame to another.\n</ol>\n</ol>\n\n== Photochemical restoration steps ==\n\nModern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:\n# Extensive research is done to determine what version of the film can be restored from the existing material. Often, extensive efforts are taken to search out alternative material in film archives located around the world.\n# A comprehensive restoration plan is mapped that allows preservationists to designate elements as \"key\" elements upon which to base the polarity map for the ensuing photochemical work. Since many alternative elements are actually salvaged from release prints and duplication masters (foreign and domestic). Care must be taken to plot the course at which negative, master positive and release print elements arrive back at a common polarity (i.e., negative or positive) for assembly and subsequent printing.\n# Test prints are struck from existing elements to evaluate contrast, resolution, color (if color) and sound quality (if audio element exists).\n# Elements are duplicated using the shortest possible duplication path to minimize analog [[generation loss|duplication artifacts]], such as the build-up of contrast, grain and loss of resolution.\n# All sources are assembled into a single master restoration element (most often a duplicate negative).\n# From this master restoration element, duplication masters, such as composite fine grain masters, are generated to be used to generate additional printing negatives from which actual release prints can be struck for festival screenings and DVD mastering.\n<!-- (This paragraph is practically commentary, please reword to meet Wikipedia standards or remove altogether.)\nAnother important issue presented is that films of the nineteenth century are deteriorating. Negating internal processes, external factors such as wars and floods could destroy these collections permanently. The argument presented is that if films can be restored and made accessible for public consumption, then active efforts to take advantage of this extraordinary invention should continue. The fact is that at the risk of sounding technology determinist, there will be a solution to the preservation of film and digital format. Cyberspace is developing exponentially one must place it in the context where it is constant to changes in society. For every different medium there has been an exposure of meeting the demands of the audience. If the demands of the audience are to be met then surely a backup of this success is needed and will be sought i.e. an appropriate storage medium. In the next century, film archives may not exist.-->\n\n==Education==\n\nThe practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.<ref>Lukow, Gregory.

The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.<ref name=\"Dowlatshahi\"/>\n\nThe problem of film decay is not limited to films made on [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced [[Technicolor]]) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original [[film production]]s or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. [[Cellulose acetate film]], which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from \"[[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the \"vinegar syndrome\"|vinegar syndrome]]\".<ref name=\"Dowlatshahi\"/>  Polyester film base, which replaced acetate, also suffers from fading colors.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nStorage at carefully controlled low temperatures and low humidity can inhibit both color fading and the onset of vinegar syndrome. However, once degradation begins to occur, the chemical reactions involved will promote further deterioration. \"There is no indication that we will ever find a way to arrest decomposition once it has started. All we can do is inhibit it\" according to the director of the AMIA ([[Association of Moving Image Archivists]]) board, Leo Enticknap.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=Emma |title=Re-record, not fade away |journal=Chemistry World |date=28 November 2011 |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/re-record-not-fade-away/3004766.article |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Film decay as an art form===\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDa-mmSldDg [[Decasia]] movie trailer], Icarus Films}}\n\nIn 2002, filmmaker [[Bill Morrison (director)|Bill Morrison]] produced ''[[Decasia]]'', a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film.

From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be ''all'' of them.  In 1986, when [[Ted Turner]] acquired MGM's library (which by then had included [[Warner Bros.]]' pre-1950,<ref>{{cite book|last=Schickel|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Schickel|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros.

[[Time Warner]], the current owner of [[Turner Entertainment]], continues this work today.\n\nThe cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated\u2014a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  His film, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' included a key scene in which many of film pioneer [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as \"a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd| authorlink =Todd McCarthy|title=Hugo: Film Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hugo/review/263209|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nScorsese's concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create [[The Film Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation's board of directors\u2014[[Woody Allen]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[George Lucas]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. In 2006, [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Curtis Hanson]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Ang Lee]], and [[Alexander Payne]] were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the [[Directors Guild of America]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nBy working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised\u2014or [[censorship|censored]] by the [[Production Code]] in the U.S.\u2014from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through ''The Story of Movies'', an educational program claimed to be \"used by over 100,000 educators nationwide\".<ref>[http://www.storyofmovies.org/common/11041/aboutFoundation.cfm?clientID=11041 About the Foundation] at storyofmovies.org</ref>\n\nIn the age of [[digital television]], [[high definition television]] and [[DVD]], film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats.  Meanwhile, the dominance of [[home video]] and ever-present need for [[television broadcasting]] content, especially on [[specialty channel]]s, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.\n\n==Video Aids to Film Preservation==\nThe group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.\n\nThe VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (IMLS) grant to the [[Folkstreams]] project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] with video demonstrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Aids to Film Preservation|url=http://www.folkstreams.net/vafp/#content|work=Folkstreams|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref> The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the [[Creative Commons]] license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution\u2014in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.\n\n==Obstacles in restoration==\n{{or-section|date=March 2019}}\nRegardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly. Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.) all significantly raise the difficulty and the cost of preservation processes.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/> Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.\n\nCost is another obstacle.<ref name=\"Dowlatshahi\"/> In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at \"several hundred thousand dollars.\"<ref>[http://www.film-foundation.org film-foundation.org FAQ http://www.film-foundation.org/faq]</ref> The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer \"commercially\" viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.<ref name=\"Distillations\">{{cite journal |last1=Greco |first1= JoAnn |title=  Saving Old Movies |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/saving-old-movies |journal=Distillations |publisher= [[Science History Institute]] |date= November 12, 2018|volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=36-39 |accessdate=April 23, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nDemand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Digital restoration steps==\n\nOnce a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via [[telecine]] or a [[motion picture film scanner]] to a [[magnetic tape data storage|digital tape]] or [[hard disk drive|disk]], and the audio is synced to create a new [[audio mastering|master]].\n\nThe main defects needing restoration:\n* Dirt/dust\n* Scratches, tears/[[movie projector#Light source|burned frames]]\n* Color fade, color change\n* Excessive [[film grain]] (a copy of an existing film has all of the film grain from the original as well as the film grain in the copy)\n* Missing scenes and sound (censored or edited out for re-release)\n* Shrinkage<ref group=\"nb\">Linear and \"across the web\" (width), as well as localized puckering around large (1 to 2) perforation film cement splices, most common in silent and very early sound films. Highly shrunken film (1.5% or higher), must be copied on modified equipment or the film will most likely be damaged. In the case of flammable nitrate film, this could prove to be dangerous, as the film can jam in the duplicator and become idle. Some methods of duplication have illumination sources with enough heat to ignite the film if exposed to the light source for a long period of time.</ref>\nModern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:\n<ol type+\"1\">\n<li>Expertly clean the film of dirt and dust.</li>\n<li>Repair all film tears with clear polyester tape or splicing cement.</li>\n<li>Scan each frame into a digital file.</li>\n<li>Restore the film frame by frame by comparing each frame to adjacent frames. This can be done somewhat by computer algorithms with human checking of the result.</li>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Fix frame alignment (\"jitter\" and \"weave\"), or the misalignment of adjacent film frames due to movement of film within the sprockets. This corrects the issue where the holes on each side of a frame are distorted over time. This causes frames to slightly be off center.\n<li>Fix color and lighting changes. This corrects flickering and slight color changes from one frame to another due to aging of the film.\n<li>Restore areas blocked by dirt and dust by using parts of images in other frames.</li>\n<li>Restore scratches by using parts of images in other frames.</li>\n<li>Enhance frames by reducing film grain noise. Film foreground/background detail about the same size as the film grain or smaller is blurred or lost in making the film. Comparing a frame with adjacent frames allows detail information to be reconstructed since a given small detail may be split between more film grains from one frame to another.\n</ol>\n</ol>\n\n== Photochemical restoration steps ==\n\nModern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:\n# Extensive research is done to determine what version of the film can be restored from the existing material. Often, extensive efforts are taken to search out alternative material in film archives located around the world.\n# A comprehensive restoration plan is mapped that allows preservationists to designate elements as \"key\" elements upon which to base the polarity map for the ensuing photochemical work. Since many alternative elements are actually salvaged from release prints and duplication masters (foreign and domestic). Care must be taken to plot the course at which negative, master positive and release print elements arrive back at a common polarity (i.e., negative or positive) for assembly and subsequent printing.\n# Test prints are struck from existing elements to evaluate contrast, resolution, color (if color) and sound quality (if audio element exists).\n# Elements are duplicated using the shortest possible duplication path to minimize analog [[generation loss|duplication artifacts]], such as the build-up of contrast, grain and loss of resolution.\n# All sources are assembled into a single master restoration element (most often a duplicate negative).\n# From this master restoration element, duplication masters, such as composite fine grain masters, are generated to be used to generate additional printing negatives from which actual release prints can be struck for festival screenings and DVD mastering.\n<!-- (This paragraph is practically commentary, please reword to meet Wikipedia standards or remove altogether.)\nAnother important issue presented is that films of the nineteenth century are deteriorating. Negating internal processes, external factors such as wars and floods could destroy these collections permanently. The argument presented is that if films can be restored and made accessible for public consumption, then active efforts to take advantage of this extraordinary invention should continue. The fact is that at the risk of sounding technology determinist, there will be a solution to the preservation of film and digital format. Cyberspace is developing exponentially one must place it in the context where it is constant to changes in society. For every different medium there has been an exposure of meeting the demands of the audience. If the demands of the audience are to be met then surely a backup of this success is needed and will be sought i.e. an appropriate storage medium. In the next century, film archives may not exist.-->\n\n==Education==\n\nThe practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.<ref>Lukow, Gregory.

Studies of modern grey wolves have identified distinct sub-populations that live in close proximity to each other.<ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=schweizer2016a/> This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to differences in habitat \u2013 precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization \u2013 which affect cranio-dental plasticity.<ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThe archaeological and paleontological records show grey wolf continuous presence for at least the last 300,000 years.<ref name=sotnikova2010/> This continuous presence contrasts with genomic analyses, which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago.<ref name=freedman2014/> These analyses indicate a [[population bottleneck]], followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original wolf populations were out-competed by a new type of wolf which replaced them. However, the geographic origin of this radiation is not known.\n\n==Fossil record==\n{{further|Canis#Taxonomy|label1=Evolution of Canis|Canidae#Phylogenetic relationships|label2=Canid relationships}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|''Canis etruscus'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum.]]\n\nThe fossil record for ancient vertebrates is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/>\n\nThere is general agreement on the most ancient record, which shows that [[Feliformia|feliform]]s and [[Caniformia|caniform]]s emerged within the super-family [[Carnivoramorpha]] 43 million [[years before present]] (YBP).<ref name=flynn2005/> The caniforms included the fox-like genus ''[[Leptocyon]]'' whose various species existed from 34 million YBP before branching 11.9 million YBP into ''[[Vulpes]]'' (foxes) and [[Canis|Canini]] (canines). The jackal-sized ''[[Eucyon]]'' existed in North America from 10 million YBP and by the [[Early Pliocene]] about 6\u20135 million YBP the coyote-like ''[[Eucyon#Eucyon davisi|Eucyon davisi]]''<ref name=fossilworks5/> invaded Eurasia. In North America it gave rise to early ''Canis'' which first appeared in the [[Miocene]] (6 million YBP) in south-western US and Mexico. By 5 million YBP the larger ''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' appeared in the same region.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p58}}\n\nThe canids that had immigrated from North America to Eurasia \u2013 ''[[Eucyon]]'', ''[[Vulpes]]'', and ''[[Nyctereutes]]'' \u2013 were small to medium-sized predators during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene but they were not the top predators. The position of the canids would change with the arrival of ''Canis'' to become a dominant predator across the [[Holarctic]]. The wolf-sized ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis chihliensis|C. chihliensis]]'' appeared in northern China in the Mid-Pliocene around 4\u20133 million YBP.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p148}} The large wolf-sized ''Canis'' appeared in the Middle [[Pliocene]] about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, [[Shanxi]] Province, China. By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in [[Yangyuan County]], [[Hebei]], China and Kuruksay, Tadzhikistan.<ref name=vislobokova2003/> This was followed by an explosion of ''Canis'' evolution across Eurasia in the Early Pleistocene around 1.8 million YBP in what is commonly referred to as the ''wolf event''. It is associated with the formation of the [[mammoth steppe]] and continental glaciation. ''Canis'' spread to Europe in the forms of ''[[Canis arnensis|C. arnensis]]'', ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'', and ''[[Canis falconeri|C. falconeri]]''.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p148}}\n\nThe fossil record is incomplete but it is likely that wolves arose from a population of small, early canids.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p241}} Morphological evidence<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p239}}<ref name=nowak1979/> and genetic evidence<ref name=wayne1995/> both suggest that wolves evolved during the [[Pliocene]] and Early [[Pleistocene]] eras from the same lineage that also led to the coyote,<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p239}} with fossil specimens indicating that the coyote and the wolf diverged from a common ancestor 1.5 million years ago.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}}<ref name=nowak1979/> The ancestor of the jackal and the other extant members of the genus ''Canis'' had split from the lineage before this time.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}}\n\nAfter this separation from a common ancestor the species that were believed to be involved in the further evolution of the wolf and coyote \u2013 and the beliefs of some [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] \u2013 diverged.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}} A number of researchers believed that the lines of ''[[Canis edwardii|C. priscolatrans]]'', ''C. etruscus'', ''[[Canis rufus|C. rufus]]'' and ''[[Canis lupus|C. lupus]]'' were components involved in some way that lead to the modern wolf and coyote.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}}<ref name=hoffmeister1954/><ref name=lawrence1967/><ref name=lawrence1975/><ref name=martin1974/><ref name=webb1974/><ref name=wayne1991/>\n\n{{Cladogram|title=Wolf evolution|caption=Proposed evolution and branching of genus ''Canis'' towards the wolf.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}} \n|cladogram={{clade |style=font-size:75%; line-height:65%;width:450px;\n |label1=\u2020''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' \n |1={{clade\n  |label1=''[[Canis latrans]]'' (Coyote)\n  |1={{clade\n   |1=[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).jpg|50 px]]\n  }}  \n  |label2=\u2020''Canis priscolatrans''\n  |2={{clade\n   |1=extinct taxa\n   |label2=\u2020[[Canis ambrusteri]]  \n   |2={{clade \n    |label1=\u2020''[[Canis dirus]]'' (Dire wolf)\n    |1=[[File:The American Museum journal (c1900-(1918)) (Canis dirus).jpg|80 px]]\n    |label2=\u2020''[[Canis nehringi]]'' \n    |2=[[File:Large sized canid icon.jpg|50 px]]\n    |label3=\u2020''[[Canis nehringi#Canis gezi|Canis gezi]]'' \n    |3={{clade\n     |1=[[File:Large sized canid icon.jpg|50 px]]\n     }}  \n    }}\n   }}\n  |label3=\u2020''Canis etruscus'' \n  |3={{clade\n   |1=\u2020[[Canis variabilis]][[File:Canis lupus variabilis.jpg|50 px]]\n   |label2=\u2020[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|Canis mosbachensis]]''\n   |2={{clade \n    |label1=''[[Canis rufus]]'' (red wolf)\n    |1=[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate V) C. l. rufus mod.jpg|50 px]]\n    |label2=''[[Canis lupus]]'' (gray wolf)\n    |2=[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).jpg|50 px]]\n    |label3=''[[Canis familiaris]]'' (dog)\n    |3={{clade\n     |1=[[File:Tibetan mastiff (white background).jpg|50 px]]\n     }}\n    }}\n   }}\n  }}\n }}\n}}\n\n===''Canis lepophagus''===\n''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' lived in the early Pliocene in North America.<ref name=wang2008/> [[Bj\u00f6rn Kurt\u00e9n|Kurten]] proposed that the [[Blancan]] ''C. lepophagus''<ref name=fossilworks1/> derived from smaller [[Miocene]] ''Canis'' species in North America.

Moreover, domestic dogs occupy a range of novel shapes outside the domain of wild carnivorans.\"<ref name=drake2010/>\n\nThe domestic dog compared to the wolf shows the greatest variation in the size and shape of the skull (Evans 1979) that range from 7 to 28&nbsp;cm in length (McGreevy 2004). Wolves are [[dolichocephaly|dolichocephalic]] (long skulled) but not as extreme as some breeds of such as greyhounds and Russian wolfhounds (McGreevy 2004). Canine [[brachycephaly]] (short-skulledness) is found only in domestic dogs and is related to [[paedomorphosis]] (Goodwin 1997). Puppies are born with short snouts, with the longer skull of dolichocephalic dogs emerging in later development (Coppinger 1995). Other differences in head shape between brachycephalic and dolichocephalic dogs include changes in the craniofacial angle (angle between the [[Basilar plexus|basilar axis]] and [[hard palate]]) (Regod\u00f3n 1993), morphology of the [[temporomandibular joint]] (Dickie 2001), and radiographic anatomy of the [[cribriform plate]] (Schwarz 2000).<ref name=roberts2010/>\n\nNowak indicated that orbital angle of the eye socket is an important characteristic defining the difference between the dog and the wolf, with the wolf having the lower angle. Nowak compared the orbital angles of four North American [[Canis|canines]] (including the Indian dog) and produced the following values in degrees: coyote-42.8, wolf-42.8, dog-52.9 dire wolf-53.1. The orbital angle of the eye socket was clearly larger in the dog than in the coyote and the wolf; why it was almost the same as that of the dire wolf was not commented on.<ref name=nowak1979/>\n\nMany authors have concluded that compared to the adult extant wolf, the adult domestic dog has a relatively reduced rostrum (front part of the skull), an elevated [[frontal bone]], a wider [[palate]], a broader [[cranium]], and smaller teeth (Hildebrand1954; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hills 1976; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986; Hemmer 1990; Morey 1990). Other authors have disagreed and have stated that these traits can overlap and vary within the two (Crockford 1999; Harrison 1973). Wolf cubs have similar relative skull proportions as adult dogs and this was proposed as evidence that the domestic dog is a [[Neoteny|neotenic wolf]]. This was proposed to be due to either  human selection for juvenile appearance or due to a [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effect as a result of selection for juvenile behavior (Clutton-Brock 1977; Belyaev 1979; Wayne 1986; Coppinger and Schneider 1995). Wayne (1986) concluded that his dog samples did not have significant relative shortening of the rostrum compared to wolves, calling this identification feature into question.<ref name=koler2002/> A 2004 study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves.<ref name=drake2004>Drake, Abby Grace, \"Evolution and development of the skull morphology of canids: An investigation of morphological integration and heterochrony\" (January 1, 2004).

However, Kieser and Groeneveld (1992) compared the mandibulo-dental measurements of jackals (''C. adustus, C. mesomelas'') and Cape foxes (''Vulpes chama'') to equivalent-sized dogs and found that the canines of these other canids tended to be slightly smaller and their second molars larger compared to dogs, otherwise the proportions were essentially the same in all species. They concluded that \"...the teeth of canids appear to have evolved in concert with one another and relatively independently of differences in dimorphism, size or functional demands\". This calls into question the assumption that dog teeth are relatively small due to recent selection, suggesting that dog dentition is plesiomorphic from an ancestor that was smaller than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe reduced body size of the early dog compared to a wolf is thought due to niche selection (Olsen 1985; Morey 1992; Coppinger &\nCoppinger 2001). Morey (1992:199) states that \"Results...are consistent with a hypothesis that early domestic dogs are evolutionary paedomorphs, products of strong selection for ontogenetically channeled size reduction and alterations of reproductive timing associated with the new domestic way of life.\"<ref name=koler2002/> However, in an domestication experiment the domesticated foxes remained the same size as unselected foxes (Trutt 1999:167).<ref name=morey2015/>\n\nWayne (1986) concluded that the dog is closer in skull morphology to ''C. latrans, C. aureus, C. adustus, C. mesomelas, Cuon alpinus'' and ''Lycaon pictus'' than to the wolf. Dahr (1942) concluded that the shape of the dog brain case is closer to that of the coyote than to that of the wolf. Manwell and Baker (1983) reviewed Dahr's work with the addition of dental data for canids and concluded that the dog ancestor was probably within the range of 13.6\u201320.5&nbsp;kg, which is smaller than the range 27\u201354&nbsp;kg for extant wolves (Mech 1970) and is comparable with the [[Dingo]].<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe auditory [[Tympanic part of the temporal bone|bulla]] of the dog is relatively smaller and flatter than that of the wolf (Harrison 1973; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hill 1976; Nowak 1979; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986), which is proposed to be due to relaxed selection under domestication as the dog no longer required the acute hearing of the wolf. However, bulla shape has been shown to facilitate increased sensitivity to specific frequencies but shape and size may not be correlated with acuity (Ewer 1973). Therefore, the observed difference could be that the dog bulla has retained its ancestral shape.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe ventral edge of the dog's horizontal [[ramus of the mandible]] has a convex curve that does not exist in the wolf (Olsen 1985; Clutton-Brock 1995), and no discussion of this difference could be found in the literature. However, Biknevicius and Van Valkenburgh (1997) noticed that the horizontal ramus of bone-processing predators is thicker dorso-ventrally at the point [[Anatomical terms of location#caudal|caudal]] to the site of bone processing. This thickening may have been a function for niche adaptation by the dog's ancestor.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nA description of the superficial brain morphology of jackals (''C. mesomelas, C. aureus''), coyotes (''C. latrans''), wolves (''C. lupus, C. rufus''), and dogs indicated that the [[cerebellum]] of the dog closely approximates that of the coyote, which is closely aligned with the jackals, and that the wolves show numerous brain traits distinct from the other species (Atkins and Dillon 1971). Wolves also have serological and biochemical traits distinct from dogs (Leone and Wiens 1956; Lauer, Kuyt & Baker 1969).<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/> One author has proposed that the most likely explanation for the different morphological characteristics of the dog compared to the wolf is that the dog's ancestor was adapted to a different niche than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\n==Genetic record==\n\n===DNA sequences===\nThe [[mitochondria]] within each [[Cell (biology)|cell]] contain many copies of a small circular [[DNA genome]] and in mammals it is 16,000\u201318,000 [[base pairs]] in length.

By phenotype, the dhole (genus ''Cuon'') and the African hunting dog (genus ''Lycaon'') are not  classified as members of the genus ''Canis'', but by genotype they are closer to dogs, wolves and coyotes than are the two genus ''Canis'' jackals \u2013 the Side-striped jackal (''C. adustus'') and the Black-backed jackal (''C. mesomelas'').\n\nIn 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and nuclear genome sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids had colonized Africa from Eurasia at least 5 times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of the African canid diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions.<ref name=koepfli2015/>\n\n\n'''[[Phylogenetic tree]] of the extant wolf-like canids,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=mtdna_seq_desc|[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetic relationships]] and time of [[genetic divergence]] for the extant [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]] based on DNA of the entire [[cell nucleus]].<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/> Exception 1: Side-striped jackal and Black-backed jackal added based on segments of DNA taken from the [[cell nucleus]]<ref name=lindblad2005/><ref name=koepfli2015/> with proposed divergence times in millions of years.<ref name=koepfli2015/> Exception 2: The position of the Himalayan wolf is based on segments of [[mitochondrial DNA]]<ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=ersmark2016/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> and segments from the cell nucleus.<ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> Exception 3: The position of the Indian plains wolf is based on mDNA.<ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=sharma2004/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=miklosi2015/> and its timing 120,000 years ago.<ref name=Loog2018/> Exception 4: [[Late Pleistocene]] wolf included for time-line purposes only - the [[most recent common ancestor]] for all other ''Canis lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct but excluding the Indian plains wolf and the Himalayan wolf \u2013 was 80,000 years before present.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> Exception 5: Gray wolf and dog timing 25,000 years ago.<ref name=Loog2018/><ref name=Werhahn2018/><ref name=Schweizer2020/>}} with the pink shading representing the species ''Canis lupus''.'''\n\n{{cladeN    |style=background-color:#ccccff;font-size:85%;\n            |length=50px    |sublabelstyle1=border-left:1px solid black;

There is evidence of gene flow between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackals]], and gray wolves. The study suggests that the African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% grey [[wolf]] and 28% [[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry, and that the Ethiopian wolf once had a wider range in Africa. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and Eurasian continents in canid evolution. There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. The study proposes that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American gray wolves. The study indicates that the common ancestor of the [[coyote]] and gray wolf has genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid.  The canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and has evolved after the divergence of the African hunting dog from the other canid species. The [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unknown canid.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nA genomic study on the wolves of China included museum specimens of wolves from southern China that were collected between 1963-1988. The wolves in the study formed 3 clades: [[Himalayan wolf]], north Asian wolves that incuded those from northern China and eastern Russia, and a unique population from southern China. One specimen from [[Zhejiang]] province in eastern China shared gene flow with the wolves from southern China, however its genome was 12-14 percent admixed with a canid that may be the dhole or an unknown canid that predates the genetic divergence of the dhole. The wolf population from southern China is believed to be still existing in that region.<ref name=Wang2019/>\n\n===Two wolf haplogroups===\n{{See also|Beringian wolf|Megafaunal wolf}}\n\nA [[haplotype]] ([[haploid]] [[genotype]]) is a group of [[genes]] in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent.<ref name=cox2016/><ref name=editorial2012/> A [[haplogroup]] is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (a [[mutation]]).<ref name=arora2015/><ref name=ISGS2015/> Mitochondrial DNA passes along a maternal lineage that can date back thousands of years.<ref name=arora2015/>\n\nIn 2010, a study compared [[DNA sequences]] that were 230 [[base pairs]] in length from the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] of 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000\u20131,200 YBP with those of modern gray wolves. Most of the sequences could be represented on a [[phylogenetic tree]]. However, the haplotypes of the [[Himalayan wolf]] and the [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]] could not because they were 8 mutations apart from the other wolves,<ref name=pilot2010/> indicating distinct lineages which had previously been found in other studies.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=sharma2004/> The study found that there were 75 different gray wolf [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] haplotypes that include 23 in Europe, 30 in Asia, 18 in North America, 3 in both Europe and Asia, and 1 in both Europe and North America.<ref name=pilot2010/> These haplotypes could be allocated into two haplogroups<ref name=miklosi2015/><ref name=pilot2010/> that were separated from each other by 5 [[mutations]]. Haplogroup 1 formed a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]] (indicating that they all carried the same mutation inherited from a single female ancestor). All other haplotypes were basal in the tree, and these formed 2\u20133 smaller clades that were assigned to haplogroup 2 that was not monophyletic.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/>\n\nHaplogroups 1 and 2 could be found spread across Eurasia but only haplogroup 1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup 2 indicating a haplogroup 2 predominance in this region for over 40,000 years before and after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicated that in Europe haplogroup 2 became outnumbered by haplogroup 1 over the past several thousand years<ref name=miklosi2015/> but in North America haplogroup 2 became extinct and was replaced by haplogroup 1 after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/> Access into North America was available between 20,000\u201311,000 years ago after the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] had retreated but before the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] became inundated by the sea.<ref name=tamm2007/> Therefore, haplogroup 1 was able to enter into North America during this period.\n\nStable [[isotope analysis]] conducted on the bone of a specimen allows researchers to form conclusions about the diet, and therefore the ecology, of extinct wolf populations. This analysis suggests that the Pleistocene wolves from haplogroup 2 found in [[Beringia]] and Belgium preyed mainly on Pleistocene megafauna,<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which became rare at the beginning of the Holocene 12,000 years ago.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2010/> One study found the Beringian wolf to be [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to all other gray wolves except for the extant [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the extant [[Himalayan wolf]].<ref name=leonard2007/> The Pleistocene Eurasian wolves have been found to be morphologically and genetically comparable to the Pleistocene eastern-[[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]],<ref name=germonpre2013/> with some of the ancient European and Beringian wolves sharing a common haplotype (a17),<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which makes ecological similarity likely.<ref name=pilot2010/> Two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated around 30,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|\"Altai dog\"]] had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves, and another from the Czech Republic dated 44,000 YBP had the same sequence as two Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/>\n\nIt has been proposed that the Pleistocene wolves across northern Eurasia and northern North America represented a continuous and almost [[Panmixia|panmictic]] population that was genetically and probably also ecologically distinct from the wolves living in this area today.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/> The specialized Pleistocene wolves did not contribute to the genetic diversity of modern wolves, and the modern wolf populations across the Holarctic are likely to be the descendants of wolves from populations that came from more southern refuges.<ref name=hofreiter2007/> Extant haplogroup 2 wolves can be found in Italy, the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains but rare elsewhere in Europe. In Asia, only four haplotypes have been identified as belonging to this haplogroup, and two of them occur in the Middle East.<ref name=pilot2014/> Haplogroup 2 did not become extinct in Europe, and if before the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] haplogroup 2 was exclusively associated with the wolf ecomorph specialized in preying on megafauna, it would mean that in Europe it was capable of adapting to changing prey.<ref name=pilot2010/>\n\nIn 2013, a mitochondrial DNA sequencing of ancient wolf-like canids revealed another separate lineage of 3 haplotypes (forming a haplogroup) that was found in 3 Late Pleistocene specimens from Belgium; however, it has not been detected in extant wolves.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=pilot2014/> One of these was the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|\"Goyet dog\"]].<ref name=thalmann2013/>\n\n====Dissenting view====\n[[File:Phylogenetic tree for wolves.jpg|thumb|mDNA [[phylogenetic tree]] for wolves.

[[Beringian wolf]] (Alaska 28,000 YBP) haplotype found in the modern clade XVI from China.]]\nIn 2016, a study was undertaken due to concerns that previous mDNA studies may have been conducted with insufficient genetic resolution or limited geographical coverage and had not included sufficient specimens from Russia, China, and the Middle East. The study compared a 582 [[base pair]] [[DNA sequences|sequence]] of the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] which gave twice the phylogenetic resolution of the 2010 study.<ref name=pilot2010/> The study compared the sequences of both modern wolves and ancient wolf specimens, including specimens from the remote areas of North America, Russia and China. The study included the [[#Taimyr wolf|Taimyr wolves]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|Goyet \"dog\"]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|Altai \"dog\"]], Beringian wolves, and other ancient specimens.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe study found 114 different wolf haplotypes among 314 sequences, with the new haplotypes being found in Siberia and China. The phylogenetic tree resolved into 19 clades that included both modern and ancient wolves, which showed that the most basal clades included the [[Indian wolf#Canis Indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the [[Himalayan wolf]], with a subclade of wolves from China and Mongolia falling within the Himalayan wolf clade. The two most basal North American haplotypes included the [[Mexican wolf]] and the [[Vancouver Island wolf]], however the Vancouver Island wolf showed the same haplotype as a dog which indicates admixture,<ref name=ersmark2016/> with the dog lineage basal to all extant North American subspecies.<ref name=fan2016/> In Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the [[Iberian wolf]] and separately the [[Italian wolf]] that was positioned close to the ancient wolves. The [[Greenland wolf|Greenland wolves]] all belonged to one haplotype that had been previously found among North American wolves and which indicates their origin from North America. The Eastern wolf was confirmed as a coyote/wolf hybrid. Wolves found in the regions of the [[Chukotka Peninsula]], the North Korean border, [[Amur Oblast]] and [[Khakassia]] showed the greatest genetic diversity and with close links to all other wolves found across the holarctic. One ancient haplotype that had been found in Alaska (Eastern Beringia 28,000 YBP) and Russia (Medvezya \"Bear\" Cave, [[Pechora]] area, Northern [[Urals]] 18,000 YBP) was shared with some modern wolves found in China and Mongolia.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe previous finding of two wolf haplogroups<ref name=pilot2010/> was not clearly delineated in this study but it agreed that the genetic diversity of past wolves has been lost at the beginning of the Holocene in Alaska, Siberia, and Europe with limited overlap with modern wolves. For the ancient wolves of North America, instead of an extinction/replacement model suggested by a previous study,<ref name=leonard2007/> this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck in North America in which the ancient wolf diversity was almost lost around the beginning of the Holocene (no further elaboration in the study). In Eurasia, the loss of ancient lineages could not be simply explained and appears to have been slow across time with the reasons unclear.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\n===Into America and Japan===\n{{See also|Japanese wolf|Ezo Wolf}}\n[[File:Beringia land bridge-noaagov.gif|right|320px|Shrinking of the Bering land bridge]]\n[[File:Japan glaciation.gif|thumb|right|Japanese archipelago 20,000 years ago with Hokkaido island bridged to the mainland, thin black line indicates present-day shoreline]]\n\nIn 2016, a study built on the work of another major study<ref name=thalmann2013/> and analyzed the sequences of 12 genes that are located on the [[heavy strand]] of the mitochondrial genome of extinct and modern ''C. lupus''. The study excluded the sequences of the divergent [[Himalayan wolf]] and the [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]]. The ancient specimens were [[radiocarbon dated]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratagraphically]] dated, and together with the sequences generated a time-based phylogenetic tree. From the tree, the study was able to infer the most recent common ancestor for all other ''C. lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 YBP and this date concurred with the earlier study.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The study could find no evidence of a population bottleneck for wolves until a few thousand years ago.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe phylogenetic tree showed the [[polyphyly]] of American wolves, the Mexican wolf was divergent from other North American wolves, and these other North American wolves formed two closely related clades. A scenario consistent with the phylogenetic, ice sheet and sea-level data was that during the Ice Age when sea levels were at their lowest, there was a single wave of wolf colonization into North America starting with the opening of the [[Bering land bridge]] 70,000 YBP and closing during the [[Late Glacial Maximum]] of the Yukon corridor that ran through the division between the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] and the [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet]] 23,000 YBP. Mexican wolves were part of the single wave and either diverged from the other wolves before entering North America or once in North America due to the change in its environment.\n\nAs wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but modern wolves could trace their ancestry back  only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through admixture.<ref name=koblmuller2016/> The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one supported the findings of earlier studies.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> There possibly existed a panmictic wolf population with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America until the closing of the ice sheets.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> Once the sheets closed, the southern wolves were isolated and north of the sheets only the [[Beringian wolf]] existed. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000 YBP, the sheets receded 12,000\u20136,000 YBP, the Beringian wolf went extinct and the southern wolves expanded to recolonize the rest of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nStudies using [[mitochondrial DNA]] have indicated that the wolves of coastal south-east Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] after the ice had melted at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=weckworth2005/><ref name=weckworth2010/><ref name=weckworth2011/> A [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study indicated that all North American wolves were [[monophyletic]] and therefore are the descendants of a common ancestor.<ref name=vonholdt2016/>\n\nDuring the same period, the [[Soya Strait]] between [[Hokkaido]] and [[Sakhalin Island]] was dry for 75,000 years and it was proposed that the extinct [[Ezo Wolf|Ezo wolf]] (''C. l. hattai'') arrived on Hokkaido from Sakhalin.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=abe1999/> However, the sequences indicated that it arrived in Hokkaido less than 10,000 YBP. The Ezo wolf was closely related to one of the North American clades,<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=ishiguro2010/> but different to the more southerly [[Japanese wolf]] (''C. l. hodophilax'') that was basal to modern wolves.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The Japanese wolf inhabited Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu islands<ref name=walker2008/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> but not Hokkaido Island.<ref name=ishiguro2009/> This indicates that its ancestor may have migrated from the Asian continent through the Korean Peninsula into Japan.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> The past sea levels of the [[Korean Strait]] together with the timing of the Japanese wolf sequences indicated that it arrived to the southern islands less than 20,000 YBP.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe dog was a very successful invader of North America and had established a widespread [[ecological niche]] by the Early\u2013Middle Holocene. There was no overlap in niche between the dog and the wolf in comparison to the dog and other North American canids. By the Late Holocene, the dog's niche area was less in size than researchers had expected to find, indicating that it was limited by [[Biotic component|biotic factors]]. These regions include the northeast and northwest of the United States that correlate with the greatest densities of early human occupation, indicating that the dog had \"defected\" from the wolf niche to the human niche and explains why the dog's niche area was not as large as expected. The separation between dog and wolf may reflect the rapid rate in which domestication occurred,<ref name=pardi2016/> including the possibility of a second domestication event occurring in North America.<ref name=witt2015/><ref name=pardi2016/> Packs of wolves and hunter-gatherers hunt similar prey in a similar way within a similar group social structure that may have facilitated wolf domestication.<ref name=hall1978/><ref name=olsen1985/>\n\nThe wolf was exterminated in the southern part of their historic geographical range in North America by the middle of the 20th century. An mDNA study of 34 wolf remains from North America dated between 1856 and 1915 found their genetic diversity to be twice that of modern wolves in these regions, and two thirds of the haplotypes identified were unique. These results indicate that a historic population of several hundred thousand wolves once existed in Mexico and the western US.<ref name=leonard2004/><ref name=miklosi2015/>\n\n===Beringia===\nGrey wolves suffered a species-wide [[population bottleneck]] (reduction) approximately 25,000 YBP during the Last Glacial Maximum. This was followed by a single population of modern wolves expanding out of a [[Beringia#Beringian refugium|Beringia refuge]] to repopulate the wolf's former range, replacing the remaining Late Pleistocene wolf populations across Eurasia and North America as they did so.<ref name=Loog2018/><ref name=Werhahn2018/><ref name=Schweizer2020/> This source population probably did not give rise to dogs, but admixed with dogs which allowed them to gain coat colour genes that are also related to immunity, and provided dogs with genes which allowed them to adapt to high-altitude environments (e.g. Tibet). This suggests that the genetic divergence of European and East Asian dogs could be based on admixture with different sub-populations of wolves.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\nThere is little genetic information available on the ancient wolves that existed prior to the bottleneck. However, studies show that one or more of these ancient populations is more directly ancestral to dogs than are modern wolves, and conceivably these were more prone to domestication by the first humans to invade Eurasia.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\n===Divergence with the coyote===\nIn 1993, a study proposed that the wolves of North America display skull traits more similar towards the coyote than those wolves from  Eurasia.<ref name=goulet1993/> In 2016, a [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000\u2013117,000 years ago. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the [[red wolf]] and [[eastern wolf]] are highly [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000\u2013117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present. Other tests and modelling showed various divergence ranges and the conclusion was a range of less than 6,000 and 117,000 years before present.<ref name=vonholdt2016/><ref name=virginia2016/> This finding conflicts with the fossil record that indicates a coyote-like specimen dated to 1 million years before present.<ref name=wang2008/>\n\nThe modern gray wolf expanded out of Beringia 25,000 years ago. This implies that if the coyote and red wolf were derived from this invasion, their histories date only tens of thousands and not hundreds of thousands of years ago, which is consistent with other studies.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\n{{further|Pleistocene coyote}}\n\n===Domestic dog===\n{{further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n\nThe domestic dog (''Canis lupus familiaris'') is the most widely abundant large carnivore.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=fan2016/><ref name=vila1999/> Over the past million years, numerous wolf-like forms existed but their turnover has been high, and modern wolves are not the lineal ancestors of dogs.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=fan2016/><ref name=leonard2004/> Although research had suggested that dogs and wolves were genetically very close relatives,<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=wayne1999/><ref name=wayne1993/> later [[phylogenetic analysis]] strongly supported the hypothesis that dogs and wolves are reciprocally [[monophyly|monophylic]] [[taxa]] that form two sister [[clades]].<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> This suggests that none of the modern wolf populations are related to the wolves that were first domesticated and the wolf ancestor of dogs is therefore presumed extinct.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> Recent [[mitochondrial DNA]] analyses of ancient and modern gray wolf specimens supports a pattern of population reduction and turnover.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> An alternate proposal is that during the ecological upheavals of the Late Pleistocene all of the remaining members of a dwindling lineage joined humans.<ref name=morey2016/><ref name=morey2015/>\n\nIn 2016, a study investigated for the first time the population subdivisions, demography, and the relationships of gray wolves based on their [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome sequences]]. The study indicated that the dog was a divergent subspecies of the gray wolf and was derived from a now-extinct [[ghost population]] of Late Pleistocene wolves,<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=fan2016/> and the dog and the dingo are not separate species.<ref name=fan2016/> The genome-wide [[phylogenetic tree]] indicated a [[genetic divergence]] between New World and Old World wolves, which was then followed by a divergence between the dog and Old World wolves 27,000YBP<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> \u2013 29,000 YBP.<ref name=fan2016/> The dog forms a sister taxon with Eurasian gray wolves but not North American wolves.

Glaciation may have caused its habitat loss, genetic isolation then local adaption.<ref name=fan2016/>\n\nThe study indicated that there has been extensive [[genetic admixture]] between domestic dogs and wolves, with up to 25% of the genome of Old World wolves showing signs of dog ancestry, possibly as the result of [[gene flow]] from dogs into wolves that were ancestral to all modern wolves. There was evidence of significant gene flow between the European wolves plus the Israeli wolf with the [[basenji]] and [[Boxer (Dog)|boxer]], which suggests admixture between the lineages ancestral to these breeds and wolf populations.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=fan2016/> For the lowland Asian wolves: the Central Russian and East Russian wolves and all of the lowland Chinese wolves had significant gene flow with the Chinese indigenous dogs, the [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and the [[dingo]].

Past studies based on SNPs, genome-wide similarities with Chinese wolves, and lower [[linkage disequilibrium]] might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.<ref name=fan2016/>\n\nIn the same year, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs.

The sample provided the first draft [[genome]] of the [[cell nucleus]] for a Pleistocene [[carnivore]], and the sequence was identified as belonging to ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nUsing the Taimyr-1 specimen's radiocarbon date, its genome sequence and that of a modern wolf, a direct estimate of the genome-wide mutation rate in dogs / wolves could be made to calculate the time of divergence. The data indicated that the previously unknown Taimyr-1 lineage was a wolf population separate to modern wolves and dogs and indicated that the Taimyr-1 genotype, gray wolves and dogs diverged from a now-extinct common ancestor<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=gross2015/> before the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum, 27,000\u201340,000&nbsp;years ago. The separation of the dog and wolf did not have to coincide with selective breeding by humans.<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=nature2015/> Such an early divergence is consistent with several paleontological reports of dog-like canids dated up to 36,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]], as well as evidence that domesticated dogs most likely accompanied early colonizers into the Americas.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nComparison to the gray wolf lineage indicated that Taimyr-1 was basal to gray wolves from the Middle East, China, Europe and North America but shared a substantial amount of history with the present-day gray wolves after their divergence from the coyote. This implies that the ancestry of the majority of gray wolf populations today stems from an ancestral population that lived less than 35,000&nbsp;years ago but before the inundation of the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] with the subsequent isolation of Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nA comparison of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to [[Genetic admixture|admixture]]. The [[Saarloos wolfdog]] showed more association with the gray wolf, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes: the [[Siberian husky]] and [[Greenland dog]]<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=gross2015/> that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the [[Shar Pei]] and [[Finnish spitz]]. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This [[introgression]] could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAn attempt to explore admixture between Taimyr-1 and gray wolves produced unreliable results.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAs the Taimyr wolf had contributed to the genetic makeup of the Arctic breeds, a later study suggested that descendants of the Taimyr wolf survived until dogs were domesticated in Europe and arrived at high latitudes where they mixed with local wolves, and these both contributed to the modern Arctic breeds. Based on the most widely accepted oldest zooarchaeological dog remains, domestic dogs most likely arrived at high latitudes within the last 15,000&nbsp;years. The mutation rates calibrated from both the Taimyr wolf and the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Two domestication events|Newgrange dog]] genomes suggest that modern wolf and dog populations diverged from a common ancestor between 20,000\u201360,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]]. This indicates that either dogs were domesticated much earlier than their first appearance in the archaeological record, or they arrived in the Arctic early, or both.<ref name=machugh2016/>\n\nThe finding of a second wolf specimen from the same area (\u201c''Taimry-2''\u201d) and dated to 42,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]] has also been sequenced but yielded only mitochondrial DNA.<ref name=ersmark2016b/>\n\n===''Canis variabilis''===\nIn 2015, a study looked at the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial [[haplotype]]s, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one [[Canis lupus variabilis|''Canis c.f. variabilis'']] dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the [[Yana River]] was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that was found in the recently-extinct [[Japanese wolf]]. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'' (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP \u2013 the \"Goyet dog\"), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the [[progenitor]] (including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'') to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to ''C. variabilis'', and the genetic contribution of ''C. variabilis'' to the dog, is the subject of debate.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe [[Zhokhov Island]] (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) canid haplotypes fell within the domestic dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with \u2013 or are one mutation away from \u2013 the [[Tibetan wolf]] (''C. l. filchneri'') and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (''C. l. hodophilax''). This may indicate that these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from [[Silene stenophylla#Duvanny Yar|Duvanny Yar]] appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe authors concluded that the structure of the modern dog [[gene pool]] was contributed to from ancient Siberian wolves and possibly from ''Canis c.f. variabilis''.<ref name=lee2015/><ref name=Irizarry2018/>\n\n==Rise to dominant predator==\nIn 2015, a study looked at the paleoecology of large carnivores across the [[Mammoth steppe]] during the [[Late Pleistocene]] by using stable isotope analysis of their fossil [[collagen]] to reconstruct their diets. Based on testing in Belgium, around 40,000 YBP the [[Cave hyena]]s preyed on mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horses and reindeer, with [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lion]]s taking reindeer and young [[cave bear]]s. Wolves appear to have been out-competed by [[cave hyena]]s and had their diet restricted to chamois, giant deer and red deer. However, after the Last Glacial Maximum around 14,000 YBP, wolves had access to all prey species, the cave lion was restricted to reindeer, and the cave hyena had gone extinct.<ref name=bocherens2011/><ref name=yeakel2013/><ref name=bocherens2015/> The data suggests that the extinction of the cave hyena allowed the wolf to become the dominant predator rather than the cave lion, just before the cave lion's extinction.<ref name=bocherens2015/> Another study indicated that the wolf thrived compared to the cave hyena when there was greater snow cover.<ref name=dinnis2016/>\n\n==Wolf population differences==\n{{See also|Beringian wolf|Cave wolf|Megafaunal wolf|Paleolithic dog}}\n\nThe grey wolf ''Canis lupus'' is a highly adaptable species that is able to exist in a range of environments and which possesses a wide distribution across the [[Holarctic]].

These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different to a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.<ref name=mayr1999/> Ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].\n\nGray wolves have a wide, natural distribution across the [[Holarctic]] that includes many different habitats, which can vary from the high arctic to dense forests, open steppe and deserts. The genetic differences between different populations of gray wolves is tightly linked to the type of habitat in which they live.<ref name=leonard2014/> Differences in genetic markers among the Scandinavian wolf population has arisen in only just over a decade due to their small population size,<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=vila2003/> which indicates that these differences are not dependent on a long time spent in isolation and that larger population patterns can evolve in just a few thousand years.<ref name=leonard2014/> These differences can also include fur color and density, and body size.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=musiani2007/> The differences can also include behavior, as coastal wolves eat fish<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/> and tundra wolves migrate.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/> These differences have been observed between two wolf populations that are living in close proximity. It has been shown that mountain wolves do not interbreed with nearby coastal wolves, and the Alps of France and Switzerland have been repopulated with wolves from the mountains of nearby Italy<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=valiere2003/> and from the far away mountains of Croatia<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fabbri2014/> rather than from the nearer lowlands, which indicates that distance is not the driving force in differences between the two [[Ecomorphology|ecomorphs]].<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nIn 2013, a genetic study found that the wolf population in Europe was divided along a north\u2013south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Carpathians, and the Dinaric-Balkans. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster with wolves from the Carpathians cluster a mixture of wolves from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Ukrainian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.<ref name=stronen2013/>\n\nIn 2016, two studies compared the sequences of 42,000 [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] in North American gray wolves and found that they formed six ecotypes. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables on sequence variation.<ref name=schweizer2016a/><ref name=schweizer2016b/> These findings were in accord with previous findings that precipitation influenced morphology,<ref name=okeefe2013/> and that vegetation<ref name=geffen2004/> and habitat type<ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=carmichael2007/> influenced wolf differences. One of these studies found that the variation in 11 key genes affected wolf vision, sense of smell, hearing, coat color, metabolism, and immunity. The study identified 1,040 genes that are potentially under selection due to habitat variation, and therefore that there was evidence of local adaption of the wolf ecotypes at a molecular level. Most notable was the positive selection of genes that influence vision, coat color, metabolism and immunity in the Artic and High Arctic ecotypes, and that the British Columbia ecotype also has a unique set of adaptions.<ref name=schweizer2016b/> The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into.<ref name=schweizer2016a/>\n\nEcological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence gray wolf [[population genetics|genetic population structure]] and cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]].<ref name=hofreiter2010/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=carmichael2001/><ref name=carmichael2006/><ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/> During the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/>\n\n===Pleistocene wolves===\nThe oldest ''Canis'' remains found in Europe were from France and dated to 3.1 million YBP,<ref name=lacombat2008/> followed by ''Canis cf. etruscus'' (where [[Open nomenclature#Usage of open nomenclature|cf.]] in Latin means confer, uncertain) from Italy dated to 2.2 million YBP.<ref name=rook1996/> ''C. lupus'' first appeared in Italy during [[Marine Isotope Stage]] 9<ref name=gliozzi1997/> (337,000 YBP). In Britain, it was the only canid species present from MIS 7 (243,000 YBP), with the oldest record from [[Pontnewydd Cave]] in north Wales.<ref name=currant1984/> During the Ice Age, Britain was separated from Europe by only the [[Channel River]].\n\nA study of Pleistocene ''C. lupus'' in Britain at different time periods found that its abilities to crush, slice meat and eat bone highlighted its cranio-dental plasticity. These responses to dietary changes showed species-wide dietary shifts, and not just local ecomorphs, in response to climatic and ecological variables. The survival of ''C. lupus'' during the Pleistocene can be attributed largely to its plastic cranio-dental morphology.<ref name=flower2014/>\n[[File:Unnatural selection, 2 heads, one species.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''Canis lupus'' cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] \u2013 grey wolf and chihuahua skulls.]]\n[[File:Wolf_mandible_diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Wolf mandible diagram showing the names and positions of the teeth.]]\n[[File:Scandinavian grey wolf Canis lupus.jpg|thumb|right|Scandinavian wolf in forest habitat]]\n[[File:Beringian wolf reconstruction.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Artist's impression of a [[Beringian wolf]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of ''Canis lupus'' variation in Britain from 243,000 YBP (MIS refers to [[Marine isotope stage]])\n! scope=\"col\" | Time YBP\n! scope=\"col\" | Variables\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 243,000 [[Marine isotope stage|MIS]] 7\n| Paleoenvironment was open grasslands with summer temperatures between 16&nbsp;\u00b0C and 23&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperatures between \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C and \u22126&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by steppe mammoth and horse. Competitors included the lion, brown bear, and rarely the spotted hyena. The wolves of MIS 7 were slightly smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today. These wolves were out-competed by the larger competitors, leading to a more omnivorous diet with increased crushing ability in an open environment that supported more types of prey and more non-meat foods than the MIS 5 period. They had shallower and narrower jaws than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today, which indicated that they could take only small to medium-sized prey. They exhibited a lower percentage of tooth breakage comparable with MIS-3 wolves. However, they had the highest percentage of moderately worn teeth.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 82,000 MIS 5A\n| Paleoenvironment was cold, open tundra with summer temperatures between 7&nbsp;\u00b0C and 11&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperatures between \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C and \u221230&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by reindeer and bison. A large form of brown bear was top predator, with no hyena at this time. The wolves of MIS 5 were larger in body size than those found in Sweden today. These wolves suffered from a severe climate, low prey availability and dietary stress leading to a more carnivorous diet, with increased scavenging of frozen carcasses and bone consumption. They developed strong jaws and the highest flesh-slicing ability compared to the other wolves, with shallower jaws than the modern wolf but broader and deeper jaws than MIS 7 and MIS 5 wolves. They exhibited the longest and narrowest upper P4 that suggests improved slicing ability, and longest upper M1 and M2 but with reduced width and therefore reduced crushing ability, indicating a hypercarnivore. They exhibited a higher percentage of tooth breakage and severely worn teeth compared to the other wolves, and may have been using their upper P4 and lower m1 to crush bone rather than their molars, leading to a higher frequency of damage.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57,000 MIS 3\n| Paleoenvironment of open grasslands with summer temperature of around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperature around \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, and giant deer. Competitors included the lion, brown bear, and the spotted hyena as the top carnivore. The wolves of MIS 3 were smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today. These wolves were out-competed by the lion and hyena, leading to a more omnivorous diet with increased crushing ability in an open environment that supported more types of prey and more non-meat foods than the MIS 5 period. They had shallower and narrower jaws than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today, which indicated that they could take only small to medium-sized prey.

The prey species includes elk, reindeer, roe deer, boar, hares, rabbit, and beaver. Competitors include the brown bear and lynx but the wolf is top carnivore. The wolves found in Sweden today are smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves but larger than those of MIS 7 and MIS 3.  The upper M1 and M2 length is longer than for MIS 7 and MIS 3 wolves, and the jaws deeper and broader, which indicates the ability to hunt and subdue large prey. However, the large molars retained a crushing ability and to process non-meat foods. These wolves live in boreal forests where small to medium game is hard to detect and labour-intensive to subdue, leading to an adaption for hunting larger game with higher reward. They are hypercarnivores similar to MIS 5 wolves but not with the same slicing ability.<ref name=flower2014/> \n|-\n|}\n\nDuring the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] 20,000 YBP, the [[Mammoth steppe|Pleistocene steppe]] stretched across northern and central Eurasia and through [[Beringia]] into North America. The Pleistocene [[Beringian wolf|wolves of Beringia]], and perhaps those across the steppe, were adapted to this habitat. Their tooth and skull morphology indicates that they specialized in preying on now-extinct [[Pleistocene megafauna]], and their tooth wear indicates that their behavior was different to modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fox2008/><ref name=baryshnikov2009/> This highlights the success of ''C. lupus'' as a species in adapting to different environmental conditions.<ref name=flower2014/> This gray wolf ecomorph became extinct at the end of the glaciation, along with the horse and other species on which it depended, and was replaced by wolves from southern North America. This indicates that specialized wolf ecomorphs can become extinct when their environment changes even though the habitat may still support other wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/> Wolves went through a [[population bottleneck]] 20,000 YBP that coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=pilot2014/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/> which indicates that many wolf populations may have gone extinct at the same time as the Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThere are a small number of ''Canis'' remains that have been found at Goyet Cave, Belgium (36,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2009/> Razboinichya Cave, Russia (33,500 YBP)<ref name=ovodov2011/>  Kostenki 8, Russia (33,500\u201326,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2015/> Predmosti, Czech Republic (31,000 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2012/> and Eliseevichi 1, Russia (17,000 YBP).<ref name=sablin2002/> Based on cranial morphometric study of the characteristics thought to be associated with the domestication process, these have been proposed as early Paleolithic dogs.<ref name=germonpre2015/> These characteristics of shortened rostrum, tooth crowding, and absence or rotation of premolars have been documented in both ancient and modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=boudadi2010/><ref name=dimitrijevic2015/><ref name=crockford2012/> Rather than representing early dogs, these specimens may represent \"a morphologically distinct local, now extinct, population of wolves\".<ref name=perri2016/><ref name=larson2012/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=abe1999>{{cite book|last=Abe|first=H.|year=1999|chapter=Diversity and conservation of mammals of Japan|editor-last=Yokohata|editor-first=Y.|editor2-last=Nakamura|editor2-first=S.|title=Recent Advances in the Biology of Japanese Insectivore|publisher=Hiba Society of Natural History|location=[[Sh\u014dbara, Hiroshima|Sh\u014dbara]]|pages=89\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=aggarwal2007>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aggarwal | first1 = R.

Studies of modern grey wolves have identified distinct sub-populations that live in close proximity to each other.<ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=schweizer2016a/> This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to differences in habitat \u2013 precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization \u2013 which affect cranio-dental plasticity.<ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThe archaeological and paleontological records show grey wolf continuous presence for at least the last 300,000 years.<ref name=sotnikova2010/> This continuous presence contrasts with genomic analyses, which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago.<ref name=freedman2014/> These analyses indicate a [[population bottleneck]], followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original wolf populations were out-competed by a new type of wolf which replaced them. However, the geographic origin of this radiation is not known.\n\n==Fossil record==\n{{further|Canis#Taxonomy|label1=Evolution of Canis|Canidae#Phylogenetic relationships|label2=Canid relationships}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|''Canis etruscus'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum.]]\n\nThe fossil record for ancient vertebrates is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/>\n\nThere is general agreement on the most ancient record, which shows that [[Feliformia|feliform]]s and [[Caniformia|caniform]]s emerged within the super-family [[Carnivoramorpha]] 43 million [[years before present]] (YBP).<ref name=flynn2005/> The caniforms included the fox-like genus ''[[Leptocyon]]'' whose various species existed from 34 million YBP before branching 11.9 million YBP into ''[[Vulpes]]'' (foxes) and [[Canis|Canini]] (canines). The jackal-sized ''[[Eucyon]]'' existed in North America from 10 million YBP and by the [[Early Pliocene]] about 6\u20135 million YBP the coyote-like ''[[Eucyon#Eucyon davisi|Eucyon davisi]]''<ref name=fossilworks5/> invaded Eurasia. In North America it gave rise to early ''Canis'' which first appeared in the [[Miocene]] (6 million YBP) in south-western US and Mexico. By 5 million YBP the larger ''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' appeared in the same region.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p58}}\n\nThe canids that had immigrated from North America to Eurasia \u2013 ''[[Eucyon]]'', ''[[Vulpes]]'', and ''[[Nyctereutes]]'' \u2013 were small to medium-sized predators during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene but they were not the top predators. The position of the canids would change with the arrival of ''Canis'' to become a dominant predator across the [[Holarctic]]. The wolf-sized ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis chihliensis|C. chihliensis]]'' appeared in northern China in the Mid-Pliocene around 4\u20133 million YBP.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p148}} The large wolf-sized ''Canis'' appeared in the Middle [[Pliocene]] about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, [[Shanxi]] Province, China.

Other differences in head shape between brachycephalic and dolichocephalic dogs include changes in the craniofacial angle (angle between the [[Basilar plexus|basilar axis]] and [[hard palate]]) (Regod\u00f3n 1993), morphology of the [[temporomandibular joint]] (Dickie 2001), and radiographic anatomy of the [[cribriform plate]] (Schwarz 2000).<ref name=roberts2010/>\n\nNowak indicated that orbital angle of the eye socket is an important characteristic defining the difference between the dog and the wolf, with the wolf having the lower angle. Nowak compared the orbital angles of four North American [[Canis|canines]] (including the Indian dog) and produced the following values in degrees: coyote-42.8, wolf-42.8, dog-52.9 dire wolf-53.1. The orbital angle of the eye socket was clearly larger in the dog than in the coyote and the wolf; why it was almost the same as that of the dire wolf was not commented on.<ref name=nowak1979/>\n\nMany authors have concluded that compared to the adult extant wolf, the adult domestic dog has a relatively reduced rostrum (front part of the skull), an elevated [[frontal bone]], a wider [[palate]], a broader [[cranium]], and smaller teeth (Hildebrand1954; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hills 1976; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986; Hemmer 1990; Morey 1990). Other authors have disagreed and have stated that these traits can overlap and vary within the two (Crockford 1999; Harrison 1973). Wolf cubs have similar relative skull proportions as adult dogs and this was proposed as evidence that the domestic dog is a [[Neoteny|neotenic wolf]]. This was proposed to be due to either  human selection for juvenile appearance or due to a [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effect as a result of selection for juvenile behavior (Clutton-Brock 1977; Belyaev 1979; Wayne 1986; Coppinger and Schneider 1995). Wayne (1986) concluded that his dog samples did not have significant relative shortening of the rostrum compared to wolves, calling this identification feature into question.<ref name=koler2002/> A 2004 study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves.<ref name=drake2004>Drake, Abby Grace, \"Evolution and development of the skull morphology of canids: An investigation of morphological integration and heterochrony\" (January 1, 2004).

However, Kieser and Groeneveld (1992) compared the mandibulo-dental measurements of jackals (''C. adustus, C. mesomelas'') and Cape foxes (''Vulpes chama'') to equivalent-sized dogs and found that the canines of these other canids tended to be slightly smaller and their second molars larger compared to dogs, otherwise the proportions were essentially the same in all species. They concluded that \"...the teeth of canids appear to have evolved in concert with one another and relatively independently of differences in dimorphism, size or functional demands\". This calls into question the assumption that dog teeth are relatively small due to recent selection, suggesting that dog dentition is plesiomorphic from an ancestor that was smaller than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe reduced body size of the early dog compared to a wolf is thought due to niche selection (Olsen 1985; Morey 1992; Coppinger &\nCoppinger 2001). Morey (1992:199) states that \"Results...are consistent with a hypothesis that early domestic dogs are evolutionary paedomorphs, products of strong selection for ontogenetically channeled size reduction and alterations of reproductive timing associated with the new domestic way of life.\"<ref name=koler2002/> However, in an domestication experiment the domesticated foxes remained the same size as unselected foxes (Trutt 1999:167).<ref name=morey2015/>\n\nWayne (1986) concluded that the dog is closer in skull morphology to ''C. latrans, C. aureus, C. adustus, C. mesomelas, Cuon alpinus'' and ''Lycaon pictus'' than to the wolf. Dahr (1942) concluded that the shape of the dog brain case is closer to that of the coyote than to that of the wolf. Manwell and Baker (1983) reviewed Dahr's work with the addition of dental data for canids and concluded that the dog ancestor was probably within the range of 13.6\u201320.5&nbsp;kg, which is smaller than the range 27\u201354&nbsp;kg for extant wolves (Mech 1970) and is comparable with the [[Dingo]].<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe auditory [[Tympanic part of the temporal bone|bulla]] of the dog is relatively smaller and flatter than that of the wolf (Harrison 1973; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hill 1976; Nowak 1979; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986), which is proposed to be due to relaxed selection under domestication as the dog no longer required the acute hearing of the wolf. However, bulla shape has been shown to facilitate increased sensitivity to specific frequencies but shape and size may not be correlated with acuity (Ewer 1973). Therefore, the observed difference could be that the dog bulla has retained its ancestral shape.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe ventral edge of the dog's horizontal [[ramus of the mandible]] has a convex curve that does not exist in the wolf (Olsen 1985; Clutton-Brock 1995), and no discussion of this difference could be found in the literature. However, Biknevicius and Van Valkenburgh (1997) noticed that the horizontal ramus of bone-processing predators is thicker dorso-ventrally at the point [[Anatomical terms of location#caudal|caudal]] to the site of bone processing. This thickening may have been a function for niche adaptation by the dog's ancestor.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nA description of the superficial brain morphology of jackals (''C. mesomelas, C. aureus''), coyotes (''C. latrans''), wolves (''C. lupus, C. rufus''), and dogs indicated that the [[cerebellum]] of the dog closely approximates that of the coyote, which is closely aligned with the jackals, and that the wolves show numerous brain traits distinct from the other species (Atkins and Dillon 1971). Wolves also have serological and biochemical traits distinct from dogs (Leone and Wiens 1956; Lauer, Kuyt & Baker 1969).<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/> One author has proposed that the most likely explanation for the different morphological characteristics of the dog compared to the wolf is that the dog's ancestor was adapted to a different niche than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\n==Genetic record==\n\n===DNA sequences===\nThe [[mitochondria]] within each [[Cell (biology)|cell]] contain many copies of a small circular [[DNA genome]] and in mammals it is 16,000\u201318,000 [[base pairs]] in length. A cell contains hundreds or thousands of mitochondria and therefore the [[genes]] contained within those mitochondria are more abundant than the genes that occur in the nucleus of the cell.<ref name=rand2001/><ref name=wayne2006/> The abundance of [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mDNA) is useful for the genetic analysis of ancient remains where the DNA has degraded.<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=hofreiter2001/>\n\nMitochondrial [[DNA sequences]] have a higher [[mutation rate]] than the mutation rate of nuclear genes and for mammals this rate is 5\u201310 times faster.<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=li1997/><ref name=persole1999/> The mitochondrial protein-coding genes evolve much faster and are powerful markers for inferring evolution history at category levels such as families, genera, and species. However, they have evolved at a faster rate than other DNA markers and there is a timing difference in its molecular clock that needs to be validated against other sources. The taxonomic status of uncertain species is better resolved through using [[nuclear DNA]] from the nucleus of the cell, which is more suitable for analyzing the recent history.<ref name=wan2003/> In most cases, mDNA is inherited from the maternal ancestor.<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=birky2001/> Therefore, [[phylogenetic analysis]] of mDNA sequences within species provides a history of maternal lineages that can be represented as a [[phylogenetic tree]].<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=avice1994/><ref name=avice2000/>\n\n{{Gallery|title=From specimen to phylogenetic tree\n|width=130 | height=220|align=left\n|File:Razboinichya canid.tif\n|The 33,500 year old skull of the [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|\"Altai dog\"]]\n|File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg\n|Location of [[nuclear DNA]] within the [[chromosomes]] of a [[cell nucleus]]\n|File:DNA animation.gif\n|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]\n|File:Radioactive Fluorescent Seq.jpg \n|The results of [[DNA sequencing]] listing the DNA molecule's [[nucleobases]] (coded as [[Guanine|G]], [[Cytosine|C]], [[Adenine|A]] or [[Thymine|T]]) \n|File:dna-SNP.svg\n|DNA molecule 1 differs from DNA molecule 2 at a single [[base pair]] location, called a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (a SNP [[mutation]])\n|File:Phylogenetic tree for wolves.jpg\n|[[Phylogenetic tree]] of wolves under study\n}}\n\n<div style=\"clear:left; margin-left: 5px; width: 900px; border: #C0C0C0 solid 4px; padding: 5px; overflow-x:auto;max-width:100%;box-sizing:border-box;\">\n{{Cladogram|align=right|title=Phylogenetic tree|caption=Phylogenetic relationship between four canids.<ref name=lindblad2005/><ref name=koepfli2015/>\n|cladogram={{clade | style = font-size: 85%;line-height:85%;width:325px;\n  |label1=common ancestor\n\n     |1={{clade\n        |1=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).jpg|50 px]]\n        |2={{clade\n           |1=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).jpg|50 px]]\n           |2={{clade\n              |1=[[Gray wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).jpg|50 px]]\n              |2=[[Dog]] [[File:Tibetan mastiff (white background).jpg|50 px]]\n              }}\n           }}\n        }}\n     }}\n  \n}}\nThe mutations that are different in these 4 [[Sequence alignment|sequences]] have been numbered and bolded.

The techniques used to [[DNA extraction|extract]], [[DNA sequencing|locate]] and [[DNA analysis|compare]] genetic sequences can be applied using advances in technology, which allows researchers to observe longer lengths of [[Base pair#Length measurements|base pairs]] that provide more data to give better [[phylogenetic]] resolution.<ref name=pang2009/> [[Phylogenetic trees]] compiled using different [[genetic markers]] have given conflicting results on the relationship between the wolf, dog and coyote. One study based on [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]]<ref name=cronin2014/> (a single [[mutation]]), and another based on [[nuclear gene]] sequences<ref name=bardeleben2005/> (taken from the [[cell nucleus]]), showed dogs clustering with coyotes and separate from wolves.

The time between generations for wolves is assumed to be three years based on the extant gray wolf, and two years for the dog based on the extant dog.<ref name=lindblad2005/> One recent major study assumed a generation time of 2 years for the dog for as far back as 10,000 years ago, and then assumed a generation time of 3 years (the same as the wolf) before that to calculate a proposed divergence time between the two.<ref name=freedman2014/> In 2017, the wolf research scientist [[L. David Mech]] queried why evolutionary biologists were calculating the approximate time of the dog diverging from the wolf through using a wolf generation time of three years when published works using large data sets demonstrate a figure of 4.2\u20134.7 years. They were encouraged to recalculate their divergence dates accordingly.<ref name=mech2017/>\n\nDNA studies are conducted but with \"the mutation rate as the dominant source of uncertainty.\"<ref name=freedman2014/> In 2005, Lindblad-Toh sequenced the first draft genome of the extant dog, and calculated a proposed mutation rate of 1x10<sup>\u22128</sup> mutations per generation.<ref name=lindblad2005/> In 2015, Skoglund was able to sequence the first draft genome of the 35,000 YBP [[Evolution of the wolf#Taimyr wolf|Taimyr wolf]] and used its radio-carbon date to validate a proposed genetic mutation rate of 0.4x10<sup>\u22128</sup> mutations per generation.<ref name=skoglund2015/> The difference is a timing factor of 2.5, however another study stated that because only one Pleistocene wolf specimen has so far been sequenced, then the result should be treated with caution, with that study then providing both estimates to calculate the proposed divergence times between the wolf and dog.<ref name=fan2016/> However, in 2016 the mutation rate of the 4,800 YBP [[Origin of the domestic dog#Newgrange dog \u2013 two domestication events|Newgrange dog]] matched that of the Taimyr wolf.<ref name=frantz2016/>\n\n===Wolf-like canids===\n{{Further|Canidae#Phylogenetic relationships}}\n\nThe wolf-like canids (the canid subfamily [[Caninae]]) are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their [[chromosome]]s number 78. The group includes genus ''Canis'', ''Cuon'' and ''Lycaon''. The members are the [[dog]] ''(C. lupus familiaris)'', [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus''),  [[coyote]] (''C. latrans''), [[golden jackal]] (''C. aureus''), [[Ethiopian wolf]] (''C. simensis''), [[black-backed jackal]] (''C. mesomelas''), [[side-striped jackal]] (''C. adustus''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), and [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'').<ref name=wayne1993/><ref name=wayne1989/><ref name=vila2012/> Newly proposed members include the [[red wolf]] (''Canis rufus''), [[eastern wolf]] (''Canis lycaon''), and [[African golden wolf]] (''C. anthus''). As they possess 78 chromosomes, all members of the genus ''Canis'' (coyotes, wolves, jackals) are [[Karyology|karyologically]] indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the African hunting dog.<ref name=wayne2006/>{{rp|p279}}<ref name=wurster1982/> The members of ''Canis'' can potentially [[hybrid (biology)|interbreed]]<ref name=wayne1999/> and there is evidence that the Ethiopian wolf has hybridized with dogs.<ref name=gottelli1994/> According to zoologist [[Reginald Innes Pocock|Reginald Pocock]], a dhole interbred with a golden jackal.<ref name=pocock1941/> The African hunting dog is large, highly mobile, known to disperse over large distances and are rare throughout much of their geographical range,<ref name=girman2001/> making opportunities for hybridization difficult. A study of the maternal [[mitochondrial DNA]] of the black-backed jackal could find no evidence of [[genotypes]] from the most likely mates \u2013 the side-striped jackal nor the golden jackal \u2013 indicating that male black-backed jackals had not bred with these.<ref name=wayne1990/> A search of the scientific literature could not find evidence of hybridization for the rare side-striped jackal.\n\nA DNA sequence alignment for the wolf-like canids gave a phylogenetic tree with the gray wolf and dog being the most closely related, followed by a close affiliation with the coyote, golden jackal and Ethiopian wolf, and the dog can hybridize in the wild with these three species. Next closest to this group are the dhole and African wild dog that both have unique meat-slicing teeth, suggesting that this adaptation was later lost by the other members.<ref name=lindblad2005/> The two African jackals are shown as the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] members of this clade, which means that this tree is indicating an African origin for the clade.<ref name=lindblad2005/><ref name=kaminski2014/> The tree illustrates the [[genotype-phenotype distinction]], where a [[genotype]] is an organism's full [[hereditary]] information and a [[phenotype]] is an organism's actual observed properties, such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[Developmental biology|development]], or [[behavior]]. By phenotype, the dhole (genus ''Cuon'') and the African hunting dog (genus ''Lycaon'') are not  classified as members of the genus ''Canis'', but by genotype they are closer to dogs, wolves and coyotes than are the two genus ''Canis'' jackals \u2013 the Side-striped jackal (''C. adustus'') and the Black-backed jackal (''C. mesomelas'').\n\nIn 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and nuclear genome sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids had colonized Africa from Eurasia at least 5 times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of the African canid diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions.<ref name=koepfli2015/>\n\n\n'''[[Phylogenetic tree]] of the extant wolf-like canids,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=mtdna_seq_desc|[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetic relationships]] and time of [[genetic divergence]] for the extant [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]] based on DNA of the entire [[cell nucleus]].<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/> Exception 1: Side-striped jackal and Black-backed jackal added based on segments of DNA taken from the [[cell nucleus]]<ref name=lindblad2005/><ref name=koepfli2015/> with proposed divergence times in millions of years.<ref name=koepfli2015/> Exception 2: The position of the Himalayan wolf is based on segments of [[mitochondrial DNA]]<ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=ersmark2016/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> and segments from the cell nucleus.<ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> Exception 3: The position of the Indian plains wolf is based on mDNA.<ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=sharma2004/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=miklosi2015/> and its timing 120,000 years ago.<ref name=Loog2018/> Exception 4: [[Late Pleistocene]] wolf included for time-line purposes only - the [[most recent common ancestor]] for all other ''Canis lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct but excluding the Indian plains wolf and the Himalayan wolf \u2013 was 80,000 years before present.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> Exception 5: Gray wolf and dog timing 25,000 years ago.<ref name=Loog2018/><ref name=Werhahn2018/><ref name=Schweizer2020/>}} with the pink shading representing the species ''Canis lupus''.'''\n\n{{cladeN    |style=background-color:#ccccff;font-size:85%;\n            |length=50px    |sublabelstyle1=border-left:1px solid black;

There is evidence of gene flow between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackals]], and gray wolves. The study suggests that the African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% grey [[wolf]] and 28% [[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry, and that the Ethiopian wolf once had a wider range in Africa. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and Eurasian continents in canid evolution. There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. The study proposes that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American gray wolves. The study indicates that the common ancestor of the [[coyote]] and gray wolf has genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid.  The canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and has evolved after the divergence of the African hunting dog from the other canid species. The [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unknown canid.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nA genomic study on the wolves of China included museum specimens of wolves from southern China that were collected between 1963-1988. The wolves in the study formed 3 clades: [[Himalayan wolf]], north Asian wolves that incuded those from northern China and eastern Russia, and a unique population from southern China. One specimen from [[Zhejiang]] province in eastern China shared gene flow with the the wolves from southern China, however its genome was 12-14 percent admixed with a canid that may be the dhole or an unknown canid that predates the genetic divergence of the dhole. The wolf population from southern China is believed to be still existing in that region.<ref name=Wang2019/>\n\n===Two wolf haplogroups===\n{{See also|Beringian wolf|Megafaunal wolf}}\n\nA [[haplotype]] ([[haploid]] [[genotype]]) is a group of [[genes]] in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent.<ref name=cox2016/><ref name=editorial2012/> A [[haplogroup]] is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (a [[mutation]]).<ref name=arora2015/><ref name=ISGS2015/> Mitochondrial DNA passes along a maternal lineage that can date back thousands of years.<ref name=arora2015/>\n\nIn 2010, a study compared [[DNA sequences]] that were 230 [[base pairs]] in length from the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] of 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000\u20131,200 YBP with those of modern gray wolves. Most of the sequences could be represented on a [[phylogenetic tree]]. However, the haplotypes of the [[Himalayan wolf]] and the [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]] could not because they were 8 mutations apart from the other wolves,<ref name=pilot2010/> indicating distinct lineages which had previously been found in other studies.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=sharma2004/> The study found that there were 75 different gray wolf [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] haplotypes that include 23 in Europe, 30 in Asia, 18 in North America, 3 in both Europe and Asia, and 1 in both Europe and North America.<ref name=pilot2010/> These haplotypes could be allocated into two haplogroups<ref name=miklosi2015/><ref name=pilot2010/> that were separated from each other by 5 [[mutations]]. Haplogroup 1 formed a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]] (indicating that they all carried the same mutation inherited from a single female ancestor). All other haplotypes were basal in the tree, and these formed 2\u20133 smaller clades that were assigned to haplogroup 2 that was not monophyletic.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/>\n\nHaplogroups 1 and 2 could be found spread across Eurasia but only haplogroup 1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup 2 indicating a haplogroup 2 predominance in this region for over 40,000 years before and after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicated that in Europe haplogroup 2 became outnumbered by haplogroup 1 over the past several thousand years<ref name=miklosi2015/> but in North America haplogroup 2 became extinct and was replaced by haplogroup 1 after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/> Access into North America was available between 20,000\u201311,000 years ago after the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] had retreated but before the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] became inundated by the sea.<ref name=tamm2007/> Therefore, haplogroup 1 was able to enter into North America during this period.\n\nStable [[isotope analysis]] conducted on the bone of a specimen allows researchers to form conclusions about the diet, and therefore the ecology, of extinct wolf populations. This analysis suggests that the Pleistocene wolves from haplogroup 2 found in [[Beringia]] and Belgium preyed mainly on Pleistocene megafauna,<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which became rare at the beginning of the Holocene 12,000 years ago.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2010/> One study found the Beringian wolf to be [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to all other gray wolves except for the extant [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the extant [[Himalayan wolf]].<ref name=leonard2007/> The Pleistocene Eurasian wolves have been found to be morphologically and genetically comparable to the Pleistocene eastern-[[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]],<ref name=germonpre2013/> with some of the ancient European and Beringian wolves sharing a common haplotype (a17),<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which makes ecological similarity likely.<ref name=pilot2010/> Two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated around 30,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|\"Altai dog\"]] had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves, and another from the Czech Republic dated 44,000 YBP had the same sequence as two Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/>\n\nIt has been proposed that the Pleistocene wolves across northern Eurasia and northern North America represented a continuous and almost [[Panmixia|panmictic]] population that was genetically and probably also ecologically distinct from the wolves living in this area today.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/> The specialized Pleistocene wolves did not contribute to the genetic diversity of modern wolves, and the modern wolf populations across the Holarctic are likely to be the descendants of wolves from populations that came from more southern refuges.<ref name=hofreiter2007/> Extant haplogroup 2 wolves can be found in Italy, the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains but rare elsewhere in Europe. In Asia, only four haplotypes have been identified as belonging to this haplogroup, and two of them occur in the Middle East.<ref name=pilot2014/> Haplogroup 2 did not become extinct in Europe, and if before the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] haplogroup 2 was exclusively associated with the wolf ecomorph specialized in preying on megafauna, it would mean that in Europe it was capable of adapting to changing prey.<ref name=pilot2010/>\n\nIn 2013, a mitochondrial DNA sequencing of ancient wolf-like canids revealed another separate lineage of 3 haplotypes (forming a haplogroup) that was found in 3 Late Pleistocene specimens from Belgium; however, it has not been detected in extant wolves.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=pilot2014/> One of these was the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|\"Goyet dog\"]].<ref name=thalmann2013/>\n\n====Dissenting view====\n[[File:Phylogenetic tree for wolves.jpg|thumb|mDNA [[phylogenetic tree]] for wolves.

[[Beringian wolf]] (Alaska 28,000 YBP) haplotype found in the modern clade XVI from China.]]\nIn 2016, a study was undertaken due to concerns that previous mDNA studies may have been conducted with insufficient genetic resolution or limited geographical coverage and had not included sufficient specimens from Russia, China, and the Middle East. The study compared a 582 [[base pair]] [[DNA sequences|sequence]] of the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] which gave twice the phylogenetic resolution of the 2010 study.<ref name=pilot2010/> The study compared the sequences of both modern wolves and ancient wolf specimens, including specimens from the remote areas of North America, Russia and China. The study included the [[#Taimyr wolf|Taimyr wolves]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|Goyet \"dog\"]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|Altai \"dog\"]], Beringian wolves, and other ancient specimens.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe study found 114 different wolf haplotypes among 314 sequences, with the new haplotypes being found in Siberia and China. The phylogenetic tree resolved into 19 clades that included both modern and ancient wolves, which showed that the most basal clades included the [[Indian wolf#Canis Indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the [[Himalayan wolf]], with a subclade of wolves from China and Mongolia falling within the Himalayan wolf clade. The two most basal North American haplotypes included the [[Mexican wolf]] and the [[Vancouver Island wolf]], however the Vancouver Island wolf showed the same haplotype as a dog which indicates admixture,<ref name=ersmark2016/> with the dog lineage basal to all extant North American subspecies.<ref name=fan2016/> In Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the [[Iberian wolf]] and separately the [[Italian wolf]] that was positioned close to the ancient wolves. The [[Greenland wolf|Greenland wolves]] all belonged to one haplotype that had been previously found among North American wolves and which indicates their origin from North America. The Eastern wolf was confirmed as a coyote/wolf hybrid. Wolves found in the regions of the [[Chukotka Peninsula]], the North Korean border, [[Amur Oblast]] and [[Khakassia]] showed the greatest genetic diversity and with close links to all other wolves found across the holarctic. One ancient haplotype that had been found in Alaska (Eastern Beringia 28,000 YBP) and Russia (Medvezya \"Bear\" Cave, [[Pechora]] area, Northern [[Urals]] 18,000 YBP) was shared with some modern wolves found in China and Mongolia.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe previous finding of two wolf haplogroups<ref name=pilot2010/> was not clearly delineated in this study but it agreed that the genetic diversity of past wolves has been lost at the beginning of the Holocene in Alaska, Siberia, and Europe with limited overlap with modern wolves. For the ancient wolves of North America, instead of an extinction/replacement model suggested by a previous study,<ref name=leonard2007/> this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck in North America in which the ancient wolf diversity was almost lost around the beginning of the Holocene (no further elaboration in the study). In Eurasia, the loss of ancient lineages could not be simply explained and appears to have been slow across time with the reasons unclear.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\n===Into America and Japan===\n{{See also|Japanese wolf|Ezo Wolf}}\n[[File:Beringia land bridge-noaagov.gif|right|320px|Shrinking of the Bering land bridge]]\n[[File:Japan glaciation.gif|thumb|right|Japanese archipelago 20,000 years ago with Hokkaido island bridged to the mainland, thin black line indicates present-day shoreline]]\n\nIn 2016, a study built on the work of another major study<ref name=thalmann2013/> and analyzed the sequences of 12 genes that are located on the [[heavy strand]] of the mitochondrial genome of extinct and modern ''C. lupus''. The study excluded the sequences of the divergent [[Himalayan wolf]] and the [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]]. The ancient specimens were [[radiocarbon dated]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratagraphically]] dated, and together with the sequences generated a time-based phylogenetic tree. From the tree, the study was able to infer the most recent common ancestor for all other ''C. lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 YBP and this date concurred with the earlier study.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The study could find no evidence of a population bottleneck for wolves until a few thousand years ago.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe phylogenetic tree showed the [[polyphyly]] of American wolves, the Mexican wolf was divergent from other North American wolves, and these other North American wolves formed two closely related clades. A scenario consistent with the phylogenetic, ice sheet and sea-level data was that during the Ice Age when sea levels were at their lowest, there was a single wave of wolf colonization into North America starting with the opening of the [[Bering land bridge]] 70,000 YBP and closing during the [[Late Glacial Maximum]] of the Yukon corridor that ran through the division between the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] and the [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet]] 23,000 YBP. Mexican wolves were part of the single wave and either diverged from the other wolves before entering North America or once in North America due to the change in its environment.\n\nAs wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but modern wolves could trace their ancestry back  only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through admixture.<ref name=koblmuller2016/> The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one supported the findings of earlier studies.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> There possibly existed a panmictic wolf population with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America until the closing of the ice sheets.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> Once the sheets closed, the southern wolves were isolated and north of the sheets only the [[Beringian wolf]] existed. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000 YBP, the sheets receded 12,000\u20136,000 YBP, the Beringian wolf went extinct and the southern wolves expanded to recolonize the rest of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nStudies using [[mitochondrial DNA]] have indicated that the wolves of coastal south-east Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] after the ice had melted at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=weckworth2005/><ref name=weckworth2010/><ref name=weckworth2011/> A [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study indicated that all North American wolves were [[monophyletic]] and therefore are the descendants of a common ancestor.<ref name=vonholdt2016/>\n\nDuring the same period, the [[Soya Strait]] between [[Hokkaido]] and [[Sakhalin Island]] was dry for 75,000 years and it was proposed that the extinct [[Ezo Wolf|Ezo wolf]] (''C. l. hattai'') arrived on Hokkaido from Sakhalin.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=abe1999/> However, the sequences indicated that it arrived in Hokkaido less than 10,000 YBP. The Ezo wolf was closely related to one of the North American clades,<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=ishiguro2010/> but different to the more southerly [[Japanese wolf]] (''C. l. hodophilax'') that was basal to modern wolves.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The Japanese wolf inhabited Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu islands<ref name=walker2008/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> but not Hokkaido Island.<ref name=ishiguro2009/> This indicates that its ancestor may have migrated from the Asian continent through the Korean Peninsula into Japan.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> The past sea levels of the [[Korean Strait]] together with the timing of the Japanese wolf sequences indicated that it arrived to the southern islands less than 20,000 YBP.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe dog was a very successful invader of North America and had established a widespread [[ecological niche]] by the Early\u2013Middle Holocene. There was no overlap in niche between the dog and the wolf in comparison to the dog and other North American canids. By the Late Holocene, the dog's niche area was less in size than researchers had expected to find, indicating that it was limited by [[Biotic component|biotic factors]]. These regions include the northeast and northwest of the United States that correlate with the greatest densities of early human occupation, indicating that the dog had \"defected\" from the wolf niche to the human niche and explains why the dog's niche area was not as large as expected. The separation between dog and wolf may reflect the rapid rate in which domestication occurred,<ref name=pardi2016/> including the possibility of a second domestication event occurring in North America.<ref name=witt2015/><ref name=pardi2016/> Packs of wolves and hunter-gatherers hunt similar prey in a similar way within a similar group social structure that may have facilitated wolf domestication.<ref name=hall1978/><ref name=olsen1985/>\n\nThe wolf was exterminated in the southern part of their historic geographical range in North America by the middle of the 20th century. An mDNA study of 34 wolf remains from North America dated between 1856 and 1915 found their genetic diversity to be twice that of modern wolves in these regions, and two thirds of the haplotypes identified were unique. These results indicate that a historic population of several hundred thousand wolves once existed in Mexico and the western US.<ref name=leonard2004/><ref name=miklosi2015/>\n\n===Beringia===\nGrey wolves suffered a species-wide [[population bottleneck]] (reduction) approximately 25,000 YBP during the Last Glacial Maximum. This was followed by a single population of modern wolves expanding out of a [[Beringia#Beringian refugium|Beringia refuge]] to repopulate the wolf's former range, replacing the remaining Late Pleistocene wolf populations across Eurasia and North America as they did so.<ref name=Loog2018/><ref name=Werhahn2018/><ref name=Schweizer2020/> This source population probably did not give rise to dogs, but admixed with dogs which allowed them to gain coat colour genes that are also related to immunity, and provided dogs with genes which allowed them to adapt to high-altitude environments (e.g. Tibet). This suggests that the genetic divergence of European and East Asian dogs could be based on admixture with different sub-populations of wolves.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\nThere is little genetic information available on the ancient wolves that existed prior to the bottleneck. However, studies show that one or more of these ancient populations is more directly ancestral to dogs than are modern wolves, and conceivably these were more prone to domestication by the first humans to invade Eurasia.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\n===Divergence with the coyote===\nIn 1993, a study proposed that the wolves of North America display skull traits more similar towards the coyote than those wolves from  Eurasia.<ref name=goulet1993/> In 2016, a [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000\u2013117,000 years ago. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the [[red wolf]] and [[eastern wolf]] are highly [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000\u2013117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present.

The sample provided the first draft [[genome]] of the [[cell nucleus]] for a Pleistocene [[carnivore]], and the sequence was identified as belonging to ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nUsing the Taimyr-1 specimen's radiocarbon date, its genome sequence and that of a modern wolf, a direct estimate of the genome-wide mutation rate in dogs / wolves could be made to calculate the time of divergence. The data indicated that the previously unknown Taimyr-1 lineage was a wolf population separate to modern wolves and dogs and indicated that the Taimyr-1 genotype, gray wolves and dogs diverged from a now-extinct common ancestor<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=gross2015/> before the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum, 27,000\u201340,000&nbsp;years ago. The separation of the dog and wolf did not have to coincide with selective breeding by humans.<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=nature2015/> Such an early divergence is consistent with several paleontological reports of dog-like canids dated up to 36,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]], as well as evidence that domesticated dogs most likely accompanied early colonizers into the Americas.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nComparison to the gray wolf lineage indicated that Taimyr-1 was basal to gray wolves from the Middle East, China, Europe and North America but shared a substantial amount of history with the present-day gray wolves after their divergence from the coyote. This implies that the ancestry of the majority of gray wolf populations today stems from an ancestral population that lived less than 35,000&nbsp;years ago but before the inundation of the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] with the subsequent isolation of Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nA comparison of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to [[Genetic admixture|admixture]]. The [[Saarloos wolfdog]] showed more association with the gray wolf, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes: the [[Siberian husky]] and [[Greenland dog]]<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=gross2015/> that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the [[Shar Pei]] and [[Finnish spitz]]. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This [[introgression]] could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAn attempt to explore admixture between Taimyr-1 and gray wolves produced unreliable results.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAs the Taimyr wolf had contributed to the genetic makeup of the Arctic breeds, a later study suggested that descendants of the Taimyr wolf survived until dogs were domesticated in Europe and arrived at high latitudes where they mixed with local wolves, and these both contributed to the modern Arctic breeds. Based on the most widely accepted oldest zooarchaeological dog remains, domestic dogs most likely arrived at high latitudes within the last 15,000&nbsp;years. The mutation rates calibrated from both the Taimyr wolf and the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Two domestication events|Newgrange dog]] genomes suggest that modern wolf and dog populations diverged from a common ancestor between 20,000\u201360,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]]. This indicates that either dogs were domesticated much earlier than their first appearance in the archaeological record, or they arrived in the Arctic early, or both.<ref name=machugh2016/>\n\nThe finding of a second wolf specimen from the same area (\u201c''Taimry-2''\u201d) and dated to 42,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]] has also been sequenced but yielded only mitochondrial DNA.<ref name=ersmark2016b/>\n\n===''Canis variabilis''===\nIn 2015, a study looked at the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial [[haplotype]]s, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one [[Canis lupus variabilis|''Canis c.f. variabilis'']] dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the [[Yana River]] was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that was found in the recently-extinct [[Japanese wolf]]. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'' (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP \u2013 the \"Goyet dog\"), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the [[progenitor]] (including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'') to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to ''C. variabilis'', and the genetic contribution of ''C. variabilis'' to the dog, is the subject of debate.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe [[Zhokhov Island]] (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) canid haplotypes fell within the domestic dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with \u2013 or are one mutation away from \u2013 the [[Tibetan wolf]] (''C. l. filchneri'') and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (''C. l. hodophilax''). This may indicate that these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from [[Silene stenophylla#Duvanny Yar|Duvanny Yar]] appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe authors concluded that the structure of the modern dog [[gene pool]] was contributed to from ancient Siberian wolves and possibly from ''Canis c.f. variabilis''.<ref name=lee2015/><ref name=Irizarry2018/>\n\n==Rise to dominant predator==\nIn 2015, a study looked at the paleoecology of large carnivores across the [[Mammoth steppe]] during the [[Late Pleistocene]] by using stable isotope analysis of their fossil [[collagen]] to reconstruct their diets. Based on testing in Belgium, around 40,000 YBP the [[Cave hyena]]s preyed on mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horses and reindeer, with [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lion]]s taking reindeer and young [[cave bear]]s. Wolves appear to have been out-competed by [[cave hyena]]s and had their diet restricted to chamois, giant deer and red deer. However, after the Last Glacial Maximum around 14,000 YBP, wolves had access to all prey species, the cave lion was restricted to reindeer, and the cave hyena had gone extinct.<ref name=bocherens2011/><ref name=yeakel2013/><ref name=bocherens2015/> The data suggests that the extinction of the cave hyena allowed the wolf to become the dominant predator rather than the cave lion, just before the cave lion's extinction.<ref name=bocherens2015/> Another study indicated that the wolf thrived compared to the cave hyena when there was greater snow cover.<ref name=dinnis2016/>\n\n==Wolf population differences==\n{{See also|Beringian wolf|Cave wolf|Megafaunal wolf|Paleolithic dog}}\n\nThe grey wolf ''Canis lupus'' is a highly adaptable species that is able to exist in a range of environments and which possesses a wide distribution across the [[Holarctic]]. Studies of modern grey wolves have identified distinct sub-populations that live in close proximity to each other.<ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=schweizer2016a/> This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to differences in habitat \u2013 precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization \u2013 which affect cranio-dental plasticity.<ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/> The archaeological and paleontological records show their continuous presence for at least the last 300,000 years.<ref name=sotnikova2010/> This continuous wolf presence contrasts with [[Genome|genomic]] studies, which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago.<ref name=freedman2014/> These studies indicate that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original wolf populations were out-competed by a new type of wolf which replaced them.<ref name=koblmuller2016/> However, the geographic origin of this radiation is not known.\n\nApart from domestication, humans have harmed the wolf by restricting its habitat through persecution. This has caused a dramatic decrease in its population size over the last two centuries.<ref name=boitani2003/><ref name=leonard2005/> The shrinking of its habitats that overlap with those of close-relatives such as dogs and coyotes have led to numerous occurrences of hybridization.<ref name=vonholdt2011/><ref name=vonholdt2013/> These events, in addition to recent turnovers (extinctions and repopulations by other geneotypes), has made the unravelling of the [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic]] history of the wolf difficult.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\n===Ecotypes===\n\nAn [[ecotype]] is a variant in which the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different to a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.<ref name=mayr1999/> Ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].\n\nGray wolves have a wide, natural distribution across the [[Holarctic]] that includes many different habitats, which can vary from the high arctic to dense forests, open steppe and deserts. The genetic differences between different populations of gray wolves is tightly linked to the type of habitat in which they live.<ref name=leonard2014/> Differences in genetic markers among the Scandinavian wolf population has arisen in only just over a decade due to their small population size,<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=vila2003/> which indicates that these differences are not dependent on a long time spent in isolation and that larger population patterns can evolve in just a few thousand years.<ref name=leonard2014/> These differences can also include fur color and density, and body size.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=musiani2007/> The differences can also include behavior, as coastal wolves eat fish<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/> and tundra wolves migrate.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/> These differences have been observed between two wolf populations that are living in close proximity. It has been shown that mountain wolves do not interbreed with nearby coastal wolves, and the Alps of France and Switzerland have been repopulated with wolves from the mountains of nearby Italy<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=valiere2003/> and from the far away mountains of Croatia<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fabbri2014/> rather than from the nearer lowlands, which indicates that distance is not the driving force in differences between the two [[Ecomorphology|ecomorphs]].<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nIn 2013, a genetic study found that the wolf population in Europe was divided along a north\u2013south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Carpathians, and the Dinaric-Balkans. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster with wolves from the Carpathians cluster a mixture of wolves from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Ukrainian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.<ref name=stronen2013/>\n\nIn 2016, two studies compared the sequences of 42,000 [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] in North American gray wolves and found that they formed six ecotypes. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables on sequence variation.<ref name=schweizer2016a/><ref name=schweizer2016b/> These findings were in accord with previous findings that precipitation influenced morphology,<ref name=okeefe2013/> and that vegetation<ref name=geffen2004/> and habitat type<ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=carmichael2007/> influenced wolf differences. One of these studies found that the variation in 11 key genes affected wolf vision, sense of smell, hearing, coat color, metabolism, and immunity. The study identified 1,040 genes that are potentially under selection due to habitat variation, and therefore that there was evidence of local adaption of the wolf ecotypes at a molecular level. Most notable was the positive selection of genes that influence vision, coat color, metabolism and immunity in the Artic and High Arctic ecotypes, and that the British Columbia ecotype also has a unique set of adaptions.<ref name=schweizer2016b/> The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into.<ref name=schweizer2016a/>\n\nEcological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence gray wolf [[population genetics|genetic population structure]] and cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]].<ref name=hofreiter2010/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=carmichael2001/><ref name=carmichael2006/><ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/> During the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/>\n\n===Pleistocene wolves===\nThe oldest ''Canis'' remains found in Europe were from France and dated to 3.1 million YBP,<ref name=lacombat2008/> followed by ''Canis cf. etruscus'' (where [[Open nomenclature#Usage of open nomenclature|cf.]] in Latin means confer, uncertain) from Italy dated to 2.2 million YBP.<ref name=rook1996/> ''C. lupus'' first appeared in Italy during [[Marine Isotope Stage]] 9<ref name=gliozzi1997/> (337,000 YBP).

These wolves were out-competed by the larger competitors, leading to a more omnivorous diet with increased crushing ability in an open environment that supported more types of prey and more non-meat foods than the MIS 5 period. They had shallower and narrower jaws than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today, which indicated that they could take only small to medium-sized prey. They exhibited a lower percentage of tooth breakage comparable with MIS-3 wolves. However, they had the highest percentage of moderately worn teeth.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 82,000 MIS 5A\n| Paleoenvironment was cold, open tundra with summer temperatures between 7&nbsp;\u00b0C and 11&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperatures between \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C and \u221230&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by reindeer and bison. A large form of brown bear was top predator, with no hyena at this time. The wolves of MIS 5 were larger in body size than those found in Sweden today. These wolves suffered from a severe climate, low prey availability and dietary stress leading to a more carnivorous diet, with increased scavenging of frozen carcasses and bone consumption. They developed strong jaws and the highest flesh-slicing ability compared to the other wolves, with shallower jaws than the modern wolf but broader and deeper jaws than MIS 7 and MIS 5 wolves. They exhibited the longest and narrowest upper P4 that suggests improved slicing ability, and longest upper M1 and M2 but with reduced width and therefore reduced crushing ability, indicating a hypercarnivore. They exhibited a higher percentage of tooth breakage and severely worn teeth compared to the other wolves, and may have been using their upper P4 and lower m1 to crush bone rather than their molars, leading to a higher frequency of damage.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57,000 MIS 3\n| Paleoenvironment of open grasslands with summer temperature of around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperature around \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, and giant deer. Competitors included the lion, brown bear, and the spotted hyena as the top carnivore. The wolves of MIS 3 were smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today. These wolves were out-competed by the lion and hyena, leading to a more omnivorous diet with increased crushing ability in an open environment that supported more types of prey and more non-meat foods than the MIS 5 period. They had shallower and narrower jaws than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today, which indicated that they could take only small to medium-sized prey. They exhibited a lower percentage of tooth breakage comparable with MIS-7 wolves with moderate tooth wear.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Today (Sweden)\n| Wolves have been extirpated in Britain but not in Sweden, where the temperatures are similar to those of Britain during the MIS 7 period. Environment of [[boreal forest]] with summer temperatures between 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and 18&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperatures between 1&nbsp;\u00b0C and \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C. The prey species includes elk, reindeer, roe deer, boar, hares, rabbit, and beaver. Competitors include the brown bear and lynx but the wolf is top carnivore. The wolves found in Sweden today are smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves but larger than those of MIS 7 and MIS 3.  The upper M1 and M2 length is longer than for MIS 7 and MIS 3 wolves, and the jaws deeper and broader, which indicates the ability to hunt and subdue large prey. However, the large molars retained a crushing ability and to process non-meat foods. These wolves live in boreal forests where small to medium game is hard to detect and labour-intensive to subdue, leading to an adaption for hunting larger game with higher reward. They are hypercarnivores similar to MIS 5 wolves but not with the same slicing ability.<ref name=flower2014/> \n|-\n|}\n\nDuring the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] 20,000 YBP, the [[Mammoth steppe|Pleistocene steppe]] stretched across northern and central Eurasia and through [[Beringia]] into North America. The Pleistocene [[Beringian wolf|wolves of Beringia]], and perhaps those across the steppe, were adapted to this habitat. Their tooth and skull morphology indicates that they specialized in preying on now-extinct [[Pleistocene megafauna]], and their tooth wear indicates that their behavior was different to modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fox2008/><ref name=baryshnikov2009/> This highlights the success of ''C. lupus'' as a species in adapting to different environmental conditions.<ref name=flower2014/> This gray wolf ecomorph became extinct at the end of the glaciation, along with the horse and other species on which it depended, and was replaced by wolves from southern North America. This indicates that specialized wolf ecomorphs can become extinct when their environment changes even though the habitat may still support other wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/> Wolves went through a [[population bottleneck]] 20,000 YBP that coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=pilot2014/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/> which indicates that many wolf populations may have gone extinct at the same time as the Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThere are a small number of ''Canis'' remains that have been found at Goyet Cave, Belgium (36,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2009/> Razboinichya Cave, Russia (33,500 YBP)<ref name=ovodov2011/>  Kostenki 8, Russia (33,500\u201326,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2015/> Predmosti, Czech Republic (31,000 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2012/> and Eliseevichi 1, Russia (17,000 YBP).<ref name=sablin2002/> Based on cranial morphometric study of the characteristics thought to be associated with the domestication process, these have been proposed as early Paleolithic dogs.<ref name=germonpre2015/> These characteristics of shortened rostrum, tooth crowding, and absence or rotation of premolars have been documented in both ancient and modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=boudadi2010/><ref name=dimitrijevic2015/><ref name=crockford2012/> Rather than representing early dogs, these specimens may represent \"a morphologically distinct local, now extinct, population of wolves\".<ref name=perri2016/><ref name=larson2012/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=abe1999>{{cite book|last=Abe|first=H.|year=1999|chapter=Diversity and conservation of mammals of Japan|editor-last=Yokohata|editor-first=Y.|editor2-last=Nakamura|editor2-first=S.|title=Recent Advances in the Biology of Japanese Insectivore|publisher=Hiba Society of Natural History|location=[[Sh\u014dbara, Hiroshima|Sh\u014dbara]]|pages=89\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=aggarwal2007>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aggarwal | first1 = R.
