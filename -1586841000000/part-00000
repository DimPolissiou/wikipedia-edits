[[Historians]] believe the entire area around Sedalia was long occupied by the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] (among historical [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes). When the land was first settled by European Americans, bands of [[Shawnee]], who had migrated from east of the Mississippi River, lived in the vicinity of Sedalia.<ref>Ihrig, et al., the mayor of sedalia is sir jeremiah miller he area that became the European-American city of Sedalia was founded by General [[George Rappeen Smith]] (1804\u20131879), who also founded nearby [[Smithton, Missouri]]. He filed plans for the official record on November 30, 1857, and gave the area the name '''Sedville'''.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.8.</ref>  The original plat included the land from today's [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] south to Third Street.\n\nThe version jointly filed by General Smith and [[David W. Bouldin]] on October 16, 1860, displayed the city extending from Clay Street to the north and to Smith Street (today's Third Street) in the south, and from Missouri Street in the west to Washington Street in the east; and, although Smith and Bouldin predicted that the city would grow to the north, it grew in a southern direction.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, pp.2, 8.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the U.S. Army had an installation in the area, adding to its boomtown atmosphere of accelerated development as merchants and traders attracted to the military business came to the area. In the post-Civil War period, two railroads were constructed connecting it to other locations, and Sedalia grew at a rapid pace, with a rough energy of its travelers and cowboys. From 1866 to 1874, it was a railhead terminus for [[cattle drives]], and stockyards occupied a large area. At the same time, the town established schools (racially segregated for white and black children), churches, and other civic amenities.<ref name=\"sed\">{{cite book |title= Ladies of the Evening: Prostitution and Class in a 19th-century Railroad Town |first1= LeeAnn |last1= Whites |first2= Mary |last2= Neth |first3= Gary R. |last3= Kremer |work= Women in Missouri History: In Search of Power and Influence |location= Columbia, Missouri |publisher= University of Missouri |date= June 14, 2004 |page= [https://archive.org/details/womeninmissourih00unse/page/152 152] |isbn= 0-8262-1526-2 |url= https://archive.org/details/womeninmissourih00unse/page/152 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, Sedalia was well known as a center of vice, especially prostitution, which accompanied its large floating class of railroad workers and commercial travelers. In 1877 the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' called Sedalia the \"[[Sodom and Gomorrah]] of the nineteenth century.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Middle-class businessmen made money off illegal prostitution as building owners and lessees; others did business with people in the industry, who banked, used lawyers, etc., in town. Residents were reluctant to raise taxes and services were provided from the [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s charged to prostitutes.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the 1870s brothels were distributed throughout the city, but in the 1890s, they became more concentrated above businesses on West Main Street, as the middle class tried to isolate less desirable elements in town.<ref>Whites (2004), \"Ladies of the Evening,\" pp. 155-157</ref> These establishments also employed musicians, particularly piano players, contributing to a thriving musical culture. It fostered the development of many artists, including the renowned ragtime composer [[Scott Joplin]].\n\nWhile the city attracted many commercial travelers and railroad workers, its population of married couples and families also grew. By 1900 its population of more than 15,000 made it the fifth-largest city in the state. The [[entrepreneur]]ial [[middle class]] created more formal separations between its residential areas and those of [[working class]] whites and [[African Americans]].<ref name=\"sed\" />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the military built Sedalia Glider Base in [[Johnson County, Missouri|Johnson County]] to the west. After the war, this facility was transferred to the [[Strategic Air Command]]. It was converted to a bomber base, the [[Whiteman Air Force Base]], named after 2nd Lt. George A. Whiteman, an Army Air Corps pilot who was killed during the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After a massive construction program, the base became the center of 150 [[ICBM]] silos and administrative offices. These were decommissioned in the 1990s.\n\nSedalia is home to the nation's first [[sheltered workshop]], which opened in 1965.\n\n===Name===\nUntil the city was incorporated in 1860 as Sedalia, it had existed only \"on paper\" from November 30, 1857 to October 16, 1860. According to local lore, the town council changed the name from ''Sedville'' to '''Sedalia''' in part because \"towns that end in -ville don't amount to anything.\" (Lawrence Ditton Sr.).  Here is another account:\n{{quotation|In 1856 General Smith bought the land upon which Sedalia now stands, and founded the city.  He named it after his daughter Sarah, familiarly known as \"Sed\". Smith remarked that he had previously named a flatboat for her elder sister Martha.  He first chose the name Sedville but changed it to Sedalia,<ref>Also christening the city \"The Queen of the Prairies\" (Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.9).</ref> following the suggestion of a friend, Josiah Dent, of St. Louis. Dent suggested the change for the sake of ''euphony.''<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~mopettis/bio/SmithGR.html \"GEORGE R. SMITH\"], Rootsweb, accessed 10 February 2008.  Website states content was \"excerpted\" from Conard, H.L. (ed), ''Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri (in Six Volumes)'', The Southern History Company, (New York), 1901; the volume and page numbers were not cited.</ref>}}\n\n===Railhead===\nFollowing a victory for those proposing the \"ridge route\" for the railway over those advocating the \"river route\", the railway reached Sedalia in January 1861.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.7.</ref> Sedalia's early prosperity was directly related to the railroad industry. Many jobs were associated with men maintaining tracks and operating large and varied machine shops run by both the [[Missouri Pacific]] and the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad]] lines. The Missouri-Kansas & Texas Railroad was widely known as the \"KATY,\" from its \"K-T\" stock exchange code.\n\nSedalia was an important [[railhead]] for the massive [[Cattle drives in the United States#Texas roots|Texas cattle drive of 1866]]. It maintained stockyards to receive cattle from drives and shipping through much of the 19th century.\n\n{{quotation|[[Chicago]] [[slaughterhouse]]s were willing to pay almost any price [for beef]\u2014[[Texas longhorn (cattle)|longhorns]] were worth three to four dollars each on the ''[[Llano Estacado]]'' while in [[Chicago]] a steer was worth ten times that amount.  It cost about a dollar per head to drive a herd northward to a railroad, and thus with these simple economics, the long drive and the cattle bonanza got its start.<br />\nDuring the spring and summer of 1866, some 260,000 head followed the trail to Sedalia, Missouri, the terminus of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]].\" (McComb, 1989, p.84).}}\n\nFor nearly a century, Sedalia's economy was tied to the railroads. By the end of the 19th century, the MK&T had numerous buildings and a wide variety of workers in the city: the MK&T shops, [[Feedlot|stockyards]], [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], and the [[hospital]] for employees working in the Sedalia Division were among the Katy's properties in Sedalia.\n\nAfter the KATY reduced its operations in the 20th century, its railroad right-of-way through much of Missouri was converted to a 240-mile multi-use trail. The [[Katy Trail State Park|KATY Trail]] is used by bikers, walkers and horseback riders. This has been the largest new trail developed in the nation among the late 20th-century federal and state \"[[Rails to Trails]]\" projects.\n\n===Civil War===\n{{further|Missouri in the American Civil War}}\n\n{{quotation|Sedalia was made a military post early in the war and remained such until its close in 1865. For this reason it was an active theater of operations for military supplies and an objective point for capture by \"the boys in gray.\" [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] raids into [[Pettis County, Missouri|Pettis County]], and the offensive and defensive activities of [[Union Army|Union]] troops against them, kept the inhabitants of Sedalia in [a] high state of excitement.  The progress of the city was retarded [during that time]. Sentiment in the county was about evenly divided.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.10.</ref>}}\n\nDuring the Civil War, despite the presence of the Union soldiers guarding the railroad, Sedalia was almost taken by the Confederate forces of Major General [[Sterling Price]]. Some 1,500 of [[Joseph O. Shelby|General Joseph O. Shelby's]] [[Iron Brigade]] cavalry associated with [[Price's Missouri Expedition]] surrounded Sedalia, overpowered the Union militia under command of Colonel John D. Crawford and Lieutenant Colonel John [?D.] Parker, and began to loot and sack the town on October 15, 1864.<ref>[http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/index.cgi?noframes;read=11798 \"From Sedalia: It's Late Defence and Capture\" (''Missouri Democrat,'' October ?, 1864)] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130521102157/http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/index.cgi?noframes;read=11798 |date=2013-05-21 }}, History Sites</ref>  Once Confederate General [[M. Jeff Thompson]] arrived in Sedalia, he ordered his men to stop the destruction and moved them on, leaving Sedalia in Union hands.<ref>Mueller, (2007), pp.85\u201386</ref>\n\nWhile the Civil War delayed development of the town in some respects, Sedalia was the terminus of the railroad for three years. Once the war was over, many of the thousands of Union soldiers who had been stationed more or less permanently at Sedalia and recognized its potential, made the choice to migrate there from their former homes in other areas. The population grew rapidly.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.13.</ref>\n\n=== The Salvation Army ===\nWhen [[the Salvation Army]] was established in Sedalia (in 1886), the Army's founder, [[William Booth]], traveled from London to attend the event. When Captain [[George Parks (Salvationist)|George Parks]] was asked by ''The Sedalia Democrat'' why William Booth had purposed to locate \"his salvation army\" in Sedalia, Parks responded, \"Because Sedalia is a desperately wicked city and if souls can be won to Christ in Sedalia, they can be won to Christ anywhere.\"\n\nParks was later beaten so severely in downtown Sedalia that he traveled home to Chicago where he died nearly a year later from his wounds, making him the first martyr for The Salvation Army in the United States.<ref>The Salvation Army Historical Society, Chicago, Illinois.</ref>\n\n==20th century \u2013 present==\nThe expansion of the railroad and cattle drives in the late 19th century brought many male laborers to the rough town on the frontier. It sparked the related rise of a notorious \"[[red light district]],\" with numerous [[prostitute]]s who did business with the men in saloons and brothels, which also featured musical entertainments.\n\nAs more families settled in the area, they made the culture more stable, creating institutions such as schools and churches. In the late 20th century, structural changes in the railroads meant the loss of many industrial jobs, but the city has held on to a population close to its 1960 peak while developing new bases for the economy. The city is informally known as the \"Trailer Capital of the Midwest,\" due to the high number of trailer manufacturers and dealers in the area.\n\nResidents have emphasized the colorful history of the town for heritage tourism, and identified many significant historic structures for state and national recognition. Good quality retail and craft items are sold in the historic districts and buildings of the city.\n\n===Registered Historic Places===\n[[File:Bothwell Hotel Sedalia Neon Sign.jpg|right|thumb|Hotel Bothwell]]\nThe following Sedalia locations have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:<ref>[[List of Registered Historic Places in Missouri, Counties O-St.#Pettis County|\"Registered Historic Places in Pettis County, MO\"]], Wikipedia</ref>\n* [[Building at 217 West Main Street]], former brothel <ref>[http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/96001189.pdf Building at 217 West Main Street NRHP nomination]</ref>\n* [[G and G Veterinary Hospital]]<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20110422.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2011-04-22|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 4/11/11 through 4/15/11|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n* [[William H.

After securing the property on which to build, and having gained voter approval of a tax to support the library, the Board laid the cornerstone in 1900. The building was completed in July 1901.<ref>[http://www.librarytechnology.org/lwc-displaylibrary.pl?RC=20320 Sedalia Public Library - Sedalia, MO [lib-web-cats&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Dedicated in 1901, the library is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n===Museums===\nSedalia is home to the [[Daum Museum of Contemporary Art]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080218194459/http://www.daummuseum.org/index.cfm]</ref> named after its primary benefactor, Sedalia radiologist and art collector [[Harold Daum]].

It is currently open on Friday and Saturday from 1:00pm to 4:00pm, and by appointment at other times.\n\n===State Fair===\nSince 1901, the [[Missouri State Fair]] has been held in Sedalia every August, with the exception of 1943 and 1944 because of World War II. Many singers and actors make the annual trip to the fair.  [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George W. Bush]] and other presidents have given speeches on the fairgrounds, though not during the State Fair.\n\nIn 1974, the Missouri State Fairgrounds was the site of the [[Ozark Music Festival, (1974)|Ozark Music Festival]], one of the largest but least remembered major music festivals of the 1970s. While the plan was for the pop/rock/bluegrass festival's selling about 50,000 tickets, an influx of about 184,000 fans and many rock bands strained the capacity of the fairgrounds and the city. Some estimates put the crowd count at 350,000. It counts as one of the largest music events (Rock Festivals) in history. The festival, hosted by [[Wolfman Jack]], took out a full-page ad in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and attracted people from outside the region.\n\n===Film===\n{{further|History of cinema in the United States}}\n\nThe 1948 film ''[[Scudda Hoo!

At the time of the movie's release, 150 of the missiles were located in the Sedalia area in underground silos. They had been sited there since activation in early 1964 of the first Minuteman missiles under the control of the [[351st Missile Wing]] located at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]]. The release of the movie led to a significant (if belated) increase in local community concern about the missiles. Concern remained high until all the missiles were dismantled between 1992 and 1997 as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and Russia.\n[[Image:Minuteman II.jpg|thumb|right|portrait|Minuteman II missile launch]]\nSedalia was featured in two widely seen 1977 films: ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'', starring [[Henry Winkler]] and [[Harrison Ford]]; and the made-for-TV movie ''[[Scott Joplin (film)|Scott Joplin]]'', starring [[Billy Dee Williams]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076674 |title=''Scott Joplin'' (1977) |author= |date= |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2011-02-12 }}</ref>\n\nSedalia was mentioned briefly in the motion picture ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''.

[[U.S. Route 50 in Missouri|U.S. Routes 50]] and [[U.S. Route 65 (Missouri)|65]] intersect in the city.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sedalia Ruger Map 1869.jpg|right|thumb|Sedalia in 1869]]\n[[Indigenous peoples]] lived along the Missouri River and its tributaries for thousands of years before European contact. [[Historians]] believe the entire area around Sedalia was long occupied by the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] (among historical [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes). When the land was first settled by European Americans, bands of [[Shawnee]], who had migrated from east of the Mississippi River, lived in the vicinity of Sedalia.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.5.</ref>\n\nThe area that became the European-American city of Sedalia was founded by General [[George Rappeen Smith]] (1804\u20131879), who also founded nearby [[Smithton, Missouri]]. He filed plans for the official record on November 30, 1857, and gave the area the name '''Sedville'''.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.8.</ref>  The original plat included the land from today's [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] south to Third Street.\n\nThe version jointly filed by General Smith and [[David W. Bouldin]] on October 16, 1860, displayed the city extending from Clay Street to the north and to Smith Street (today's Third Street) in the south, and from Missouri Street in the west to Washington Street in the east; and, although Smith and Bouldin predicted that the city would grow to the north, it grew in a southern direction.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, pp.2, 8.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the U.S. Army had an installation in the area, adding to its boomtown atmosphere of accelerated development as merchants and traders attracted to the military business came to the area. In the post-Civil War period, two railroads were constructed connecting it to other locations, and Sedalia grew at a rapid pace, with a rough energy of its travelers and cowboys. From 1866 to 1874, it was a railhead terminus for [[cattle drives]], and stockyards occupied a large area. At the same time, the town established schools (racially segregated for white and black children), churches, and other civic amenities.<ref name=\"sed\">{{cite book |title= Ladies of the Evening: Prostitution and Class in a 19th-century Railroad Town |first1= LeeAnn |last1= Whites |first2= Mary |last2= Neth |first3= Gary R. |last3= Kremer |work= Women in Missouri History: In Search of Power and Influence |location= Columbia, Missouri |publisher= University of Missouri |date= June 14, 2004 |page= [https://archive.org/details/womeninmissourih00unse/page/152 152] |isbn= 0-8262-1526-2 |url= https://archive.org/details/womeninmissourih00unse/page/152 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, Sedalia was well known as a center of vice, especially prostitution, which accompanied its large floating class of railroad workers and commercial travelers. In 1877 the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' called Sedalia the \"[[Sodom and Gomorrah]] of the nineteenth century.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Middle-class businessmen made money off illegal prostitution as building owners and lessees; others did business with people in the industry, who banked, used lawyers, etc., in town. Residents were reluctant to raise taxes and services were provided from the [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s charged to prostitutes.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the 1870s brothels were distributed throughout the city, but in the 1890s, they became more concentrated above businesses on West Main Street, as the middle class tried to isolate less desirable elements in town.<ref>Whites (2004), \"Ladies of the Evening,\" pp. 155-157</ref> These establishments also employed musicians, particularly piano players, contributing to a thriving musical culture. It fostered the development of many artists, including the renowned ragtime composer [[Scott Joplin]].\n\nWhile the city attracted many commercial travelers and railroad workers, its population of married couples and families also grew. By 1900 its population of more than 15,000 made it the fifth-largest city in the state. The [[entrepreneur]]ial [[middle class]] created more formal separations between its residential areas and those of [[working class]] whites and [[African Americans]].<ref name=\"sed\" />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the military built Sedalia Glider Base in [[Johnson County, Missouri|Johnson County]] to the west. After the war, this facility was transferred to the [[Strategic Air Command]]. It was converted to a bomber base, the [[Whiteman Air Force Base]], named after 2nd Lt. George A. Whiteman, an Army Air Corps pilot who was killed during the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After a massive construction program, the base became the center of 150 [[ICBM]] silos and administrative offices. These were decommissioned in the 1990s.\n\nSedalia is home to the nation's first [[sheltered workshop]], which opened in 1965.\n\n===Name===\nUntil the city was incorporated in 1860 as Sedalia, it had existed only \"on paper\" from November 30, 1857 to October 16, 1860. According to local lore, the town council changed the name from ''Sedville'' to '''Sedalia''' in part because \"towns that end in -ville don't amount to anything.\" (Lawrence Ditton Sr.).  Here is another account:\n{{quotation|In 1856 General Smith bought the land upon which Sedalia now stands, and founded the city.  He named it after his daughter Sarah, familiarly known as \"Sed\". Smith remarked that he had previously named a flatboat for her elder sister Martha.  He first chose the name Sedville but changed it to Sedalia,<ref>Also christening the city \"The Queen of the Prairies\" (Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.9).</ref> following the suggestion of a friend, Josiah Dent, of St. Louis. Dent suggested the change for the sake of ''euphony.''<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~mopettis/bio/SmithGR.html \"GEORGE R. SMITH\"], Rootsweb, accessed 10 February 2008.  Website states content was \"excerpted\" from Conard, H.L. (ed), ''Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri (in Six Volumes)'', The Southern History Company, (New York), 1901; the volume and page numbers were not cited.</ref>}}\n\n===Railhead===\nFollowing a victory for those proposing the \"ridge route\" for the railway over those advocating the \"river route\", the railway reached Sedalia in January 1861.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.7.</ref> Sedalia's early prosperity was directly related to the railroad industry. Many jobs were associated with men maintaining tracks and operating large and varied machine shops run by both the [[Missouri Pacific]] and the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad]] lines. The Missouri-Kansas & Texas Railroad was widely known as the \"KATY,\" from its \"K-T\" stock exchange code.\n\nSedalia was an important [[railhead]] for the massive [[Cattle drives in the United States#Texas roots|Texas cattle drive of 1866]]. It maintained stockyards to receive cattle from drives and shipping through much of the 19th century.\n\n{{quotation|[[Chicago]] [[slaughterhouse]]s were willing to pay almost any price [for beef]\u2014[[Texas longhorn (cattle)|longhorns]] were worth three to four dollars each on the ''[[Llano Estacado]]'' while in [[Chicago]] a steer was worth ten times that amount.  It cost about a dollar per head to drive a herd northward to a railroad, and thus with these simple economics, the long drive and the cattle bonanza got its start.<br />\nDuring the spring and summer of 1866, some 260,000 head followed the trail to Sedalia, Missouri, the terminus of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]].\" (McComb, 1989, p.84).}}\n\nFor nearly a century, Sedalia's economy was tied to the railroads. By the end of the 19th century, the MK&T had numerous buildings and a wide variety of workers in the city: the MK&T shops, [[Feedlot|stockyards]], [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], and the [[hospital]] for employees working in the Sedalia Division were among the Katy's properties in Sedalia.\n\nAfter the KATY reduced its operations in the 20th century, its railroad right-of-way through much of Missouri was converted to a 240-mile multi-use trail. The [[Katy Trail State Park|KATY Trail]] is used by bikers, walkers and horseback riders. This has been the largest new trail developed in the nation among the late 20th-century federal and state \"[[Rails to Trails]]\" projects.\n\n===Civil War===\n{{further|Missouri in the American Civil War}}\n\n{{quotation|Sedalia was made a military post early in the war and remained such until its close in 1865. For this reason it was an active theater of operations for military supplies and an objective point for capture by \"the boys in gray.\" [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] raids into [[Pettis County, Missouri|Pettis County]], and the offensive and defensive activities of [[Union Army|Union]] troops against them, kept the inhabitants of Sedalia in [a] high state of excitement.  The progress of the city was retarded [during that time]. Sentiment in the county was about evenly divided.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.10.</ref>}}\n\nDuring the Civil War, despite the presence of the Union soldiers guarding the railroad, Sedalia was almost taken by the Confederate forces of Major General [[Sterling Price]]. Some 1,500 of [[Joseph O. Shelby|General Joseph O. Shelby's]] [[Iron Brigade]] cavalry associated with [[Price's Missouri Expedition]] surrounded Sedalia, overpowered the Union militia under command of Colonel John D. Crawford and Lieutenant Colonel John [?D.] Parker, and began to loot and sack the town on October 15, 1864.<ref>[http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/index.cgi?noframes;read=11798 \"From Sedalia: It's Late Defence and Capture\" (''Missouri Democrat,'' October ?, 1864)] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130521102157/http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/index.cgi?noframes;read=11798 |date=2013-05-21 }}, History Sites</ref>  Once Confederate General [[M. Jeff Thompson]] arrived in Sedalia, he ordered his men to stop the destruction and moved them on, leaving Sedalia in Union hands.<ref>Mueller, (2007), pp.85\u201386</ref>\n\nWhile the Civil War delayed development of the town in some respects, Sedalia was the terminus of the railroad for three years. Once the war was over, many of the thousands of Union soldiers who had been stationed more or less permanently at Sedalia and recognized its potential, made the choice to migrate there from their former homes in other areas. The population grew rapidly.<ref>Ihrig, et al., 1960, p.13.</ref>\n\n=== The Salvation Army ===\nWhen [[the Salvation Army]] was established in Sedalia (in 1886), the Army's founder, [[William Booth]], traveled from London to attend the event. When Captain [[George Parks (Salvationist)|George Parks]] was asked by ''The Sedalia Democrat'' why William Booth had purposed to locate \"his salvation army\" in Sedalia, Parks responded, \"Because Sedalia is a desperately wicked city and if souls can be won to Christ in Sedalia, they can be won to Christ anywhere.\"\n\nParks was later beaten so severely in downtown Sedalia that he traveled home to Chicago where he died nearly a year later from his wounds, making him the first martyr for The Salvation Army in the United States.<ref>The Salvation Army Historical Society, Chicago, Illinois.</ref>\n\n==20th century \u2013 present==\nThe expansion of the railroad and cattle drives in the late 19th century brought many male laborers to the rough town on the frontier. It sparked the related rise of a notorious \"[[red light district]],\" with numerous [[prostitute]]s who did business with the men in saloons and brothels, which also featured musical entertainments.\n\nAs more families settled in the area, they made the culture more stable, creating institutions such as schools and churches. In the late 20th century, structural changes in the railroads meant the loss of many industrial jobs, but the city has held on to a population close to its 1960 peak while developing new bases for the economy. The city is informally known as the \"Trailer Capital of the Midwest,\" due to the high number of trailer manufacturers and dealers in the area.\n\nResidents have emphasized the colorful history of the town for heritage tourism, and identified many significant historic structures for state and national recognition. Good quality retail and craft items are sold in the historic districts and buildings of the city.\n\n===Registered Historic Places===\n[[File:Bothwell Hotel Sedalia Neon Sign.jpg|right|thumb|Hotel Bothwell]]\nThe following Sedalia locations have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:<ref>[[List of Registered Historic Places in Missouri, Counties O-St.#Pettis County|\"Registered Historic Places in Pettis County, MO\"]], Wikipedia</ref>\n* [[Building at 217 West Main Street]], former brothel <ref>[http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/96001189.pdf Building at 217 West Main Street NRHP nomination]</ref>\n* [[G and G Veterinary Hospital]]<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20110422.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2011-04-22|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 4/11/11 through 4/15/11|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n* [[William H.

Many singers and actors make the annual trip to the fair.  [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George W. Bush]] and other presidents have given speeches on the fairgrounds, though not during the State Fair.\n\nIn 1974, the Missouri State Fairgrounds was the site of the [[Ozark Music Festival, (1974)|Ozark Music Festival]], one of the largest but least remembered major music festivals of the 1970s. While the plan was for the pop/rock/bluegrass festival's selling about 50,000 tickets, an influx of about 184,000 fans and many rock bands strained the capacity of the fairgrounds and the city. Some estimates put the crowd count at 350,000. It counts as one of the largest music events (Rock Festivals) in history. The festival, hosted by [[Wolfman Jack]], took out a full-page ad in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and attracted people from outside the region.\n\n===Film===\n{{further|History of cinema in the United States}}\n\nThe 1948 film ''[[Scudda Hoo!

At the time of the movie's release, 150 of the missiles were located in the Sedalia area in underground silos. They had been sited there since activation in early 1964 of the first Minuteman missiles under the control of the [[351st Missile Wing]] located at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]]. The release of the movie led to a significant (if belated) increase in local community concern about the missiles. Concern remained high until all the missiles were dismantled between 1992 and 1997 as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and Russia.\n[[Image:Minuteman II.jpg|thumb|right|portrait|Minuteman II missile launch]]\nSedalia was featured in two widely seen 1977 films: ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'', starring [[Henry Winkler]] and [[Harrison Ford]]; and the made-for-TV movie ''[[Scott Joplin (film)|Scott Joplin]]'', starring [[Billy Dee Williams]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076674 |title=''Scott Joplin'' (1977) |author= |date= |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2011-02-12 }}</ref>\n\nSedalia was mentioned briefly in the motion picture ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''.

It was the rebels in western Yunnan under the leadership of Du Wenxiu who, by gaining control of [[Dali City|Dali]] in 1856 (which they retained until its fall in 1872), became the major military and political center of opposition to the Qing government. They turned their fury on the local mandarins and ended up challenging the central government in Beijing.\n\nThe Imperial government was handicapped by a profusion of problems in various parts of the sprawling empire, the [[Taiping rebellion]] being one of them. It was a time when China was still suffering from the shocks caused by the first series of unequal treaties, such as the [[Treaty of Nanking]]. These circumstances favored the ascendancy of the Muslims in Yunnan.\n\n===The Pacified Southern Kingdom===\nThe rebels captured the city of [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]], which became the base for their operations, and they declared themselves a separate political entity from China. The rebels identified their nation as '''Pingnan Guo''' ('''Ping-nan Kuo'''; {{zh|s=\u5e73\u5357\u56fd|l=Pacified Southern State}}); their leader Sulayman ibn `Abd ar-Rahman, known as [[Du Wenxiu]] [originally Yang Xiu (\u6768\u79c0)<ref>http://www.shijiemingren.com/doc-view-27181.html, retrieved 31 Mar 2017</ref>] (died 1873) was styled ''Qa\u00b4id Jami al-Muslimin'' ('Leader of the Community of Muslims', but usually referred to in foreign sources as Sultan) and ruled 1856{{snd}}26{{nbsp}}December 1872.\nStarting from 1855 the Hui of Yunnan had risen against the oppression to which they were subjected by the mandarins. They rose against the tyranny and extortion universally practiced by this official class, from which they were excluded. The mandarins had secretly hounded mobs on to the rich Panthays, provoked anti-Hui riots and instigated destruction of their mosques.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 233\">(Anderson, 1876, 233)</ref> The revolt was not religious in nature, since the Muslims were joined by non-Muslim [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Kachin people]] and other hill tribes in the revolt.<ref name=\"fytche_300\"/> A British officer testified that the Muslims did not rebel for religious reasons and that the Chinese were tolerant of different religions and were unlikely to have caused the revolt by interfering with the practicing of Islam.<ref name=\"fytche_301\"/>  In addition, loyalist Muslim forces helped Qing crush the rebel Muslims.<ref name=\"Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa 2002 283\"/>\n\nThe rebellion started as a local uprising. It was sparked off by the Panthay laborers of the silver mines of Lin'an village in Yunnan who rose up against the Qing. The Chinese Governor of Yunnan sent an urgent appeal to the central government in Beijing. The Imperial Government was handicapped by problems that cropped up in profusion in various parts of the sprawling empire.\n\nThey repulsed the desultory attacks of the imperial troops. They wrested one important city after another from the hands of' the Imperial mandarins. The Chinese towns and villages which resisted were pillaged, and the male population massacred. All the places which yielded were spared.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 233\"/> The ancient holy city of Dali fell to the Panthays in 1857. With the capture of Dali, Muslim supremacy became an established fact in Yunnan.\n\nDu Wenxiu was originally not aiming his rebellion at Han, but was anti-Qing and wanted to destroy the Manchu government. During the revolt Hui from provinces which were not in rebellion, like Sichuan and Zhejiang, served as negotiators between rebel Hui and the Qing government. One of Du Wenxiu's banners said \"Deprive the Manchu Qing of their Mandate to Rule\" (\u9769\u547d\u6eff\u6e05), and he called on Han to assist Hui to overthrow the Manchu regime and drive them out of China.<ref name=\"Michael Dillon 1999 59\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Da2M_viEclEC&pg=PA139&dq=du+wenxiu+anti+han#v=onepage&q=du%20wenxiu%20anti%20han&f=false|title=The Chinese sultanate: Islam, ethnicity, and the Panthay Rebellion in southwest China, 1856-1873|author=David G.

Du Wenxiu refused to surrender, unlike the other rebel Muslim commander, [[Ma Rulong (Qing general)|Ma Rulong]].<ref name=\"Yunesuko Higashi Ajia Bunka Kenky\u016b Sent\u0101 Tokyo, Japan 1993 137\"/> This may have had something to do with the sects of Islam practiced among the rebels. The [[Gedimu]] Hanafi Sunni Muslims under Ma Rulong readily defected to Qing, while the [[Jahriyya]] [[Sufi]] Muslims did not surrender. Some of the Jahriyya rebels in the Panthay Rebellion like Ma Shenglin were related to the Dungan revolt Jahriyya leader [[Ma Hualong]] and maintained contact with them.\n\nThe \"Islamic Kingdom of Yunnan\" was proclaimed after the fall of Tali-fu ([[Dali City]]). Du Wenxiu, leader of the Panthays, assumed the regnal title of Sultan Suleiman and made Tali-fu his capital. In this way, the Sultanate, fashioned after those of' the Middle East, appeared in Yunnan. Panthay governorships were also created in a few important cities, such as Momein (Tengyueh), which were a few stages from the Burmese border town of Bhamo. The Panthays reached the highwater mark of their power and glory in 1860.\n\nThe eight years from 1860 to 1868 were the heyday of the Sultanate. The Panthays had either taken or destroyed forty towns and one hundred villages.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 343\">(Anderson, 1876, 343)</ref> During this period the Sultan Suleiman, on his way to Mecca as a pilgrim, visited Rangoon, presumably via the Kengtung route, and from there to Calcutta where he had a chance to see the power of the British colonists.<ref>(Anderson, 1876, 242)</ref>\n\nThe Panthay power declined after 1868. The Chinese Imperial Government had succeeded in reinvigorating itself. By 1871, it was directing a campaign for the annihilation of the obdurate Panthays of Yunnan. By degrees the Imperial Government had tightened the cordon around the Panthays. The Panthay Kingdom proved unstable as soon as the Imperial Government made a regular and determined attack on it. Town after town fell under well-organized attacks made by the imperial troops. Tali-fu itself was besieged by the imperial Chinese. Sultan Suleiman found himself caged in by the walls of his capital. He now desperately looked for outside help. He turned to the British colonists for military assistance.<ref name=\"Thaung, 1961, 481\">(Thaung, 1961, 481)</ref> He imagined that only British military intervention could have saved the Panthays.\n\nThe Sultan had reasons for his turning to the British colonists for military aid. He had seen the British might in India on his pilgrimage to Mecca some years earlier, and was impressed by it. Britain was the only western power with whom the Sultanate was on friendly terms and had contacts with. The British authorities in India and British Burma had sent a mission led by Major Sladen to Momien from May to July 1868. The Sladen mission had stayed seven weeks at Momien. The main purpose of the mission was to revive the Ambassador Route between Bhamo and Yunnan and resuscitate border trade, which had almost ceased since 1855 mainly because of the Panthay rebellion.\n\nTaking advantage of the friendly relations resulting from Sladen's visit, Sultan Suleiman now, in his fight for the survival of the Panthay Kingdom, turned to the British for the vitally, needed military assistance. In 1872 he sent his adopted son Prince Hassan, to England, with a personal letter to Queen Victoria, via Burma, requesting British military assistance. The Hassan Mission was accorded courtesy and hospitality in both British Burma and England. However, the British colonists refused to intervene militarily in Yunnan against Peking.<ref name=\"Thaung, 1961, 481\"/> The mission was a failure. While Hassan and his party were abroad, Tali-fu was captured by the Imperial troops in January 1873.\n\nThe Imperial Government had waged an all-out war against the Panthays with the help of French artillery experts.<ref name=\"Thaung, 1961, 481\"/> Their modern equipment, trained personnel and numerical superiority were no match for the ill-equipped Panthays with no allies. Thus, in less than two decades of its rise, the power of the Panthays in Yunnan fell. But the Chinese suffered the loss of more than 20,000 lives in various fights.<ref>(Anderson, 1876, 243)</ref> Seeing no escape and no mercy from his relentless foe, Sultan Suleiman tried to take his own life before the fall of' Tali-fu. But, before the poison he drank took effect fully, he was beheaded by his enemies. The Sultan's head was preserved in honey and then dispatched to the Imperial Court in Peking as a trophy and a testimony to the decisive nature of the victory of the Imperial Chinese over the Pantliays of Yunnan.<ref>(Thaung, 1961, 482)</ref>\n\nThe scattered remnants of the Panthay troops continue their resistance after the fall of Tali-fu. But when Momien was next besieged and stormed by the imperial troops in May 1873, their resistance broke completely. Governor Ta-sa-kon was captured and executed by the order of the Imperial Government.\n\nMany adherents to the Panthay cause were persecuted by the imperial mandarins.  Many Panthays thus fled with their families across the Burmese border and took refuge in the Wa State where, about 1875, they set up the exclusively Panthay town of [[Panlong Subtownship|Panglong]].<ref>(Scott, 1901, 740)</ref>\n\nFor a period of perhaps ten to fifteen years following the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion, the province's Hui minority was widely discriminated against by the victorious Qing, especially in the western frontier districts contiguous with Burma. During these years the refugee Hui settled across the frontier within Burma gradually established themselves in their traditional callings \u2013 as merchants, caravaneers, miners, restaurateurs and (for those who chose or were forced to live beyond the law) as smugglers and mercenaries.\n\nAt least 15 years after the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion, the original Panthay settlements had grown to include numbers of Shan and other hill peoples.\n\nGovernorships of the sultanate were also created in a few important cities, such as Momein ([[Tengyue]]), which were not far from the Burmese border town of [[Bhamo]]. The sultanate reached the high-water mark of its power and glory in 1860.\n\nThe eight years from 1860-68 were the heyday of the Sultanate. The Yunnanese Muslim rebels had either taken or destroyed 40 towns and 100 villages.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 343\"/>\n\nVarious rebel forces besieged the city of [[Kunming]] repeatedly: in 1857, 1861, 1863 and 1868. Ma Rulong, a Hui rebel leader from southern [[Yunnan]], besieged the city in 1862, but he defected to the central government's forces after being offered a military post. His decision to quit the siege was not accepted by his followers, who took the opportunity of his absence to kill the Governor-General (Pan Duo) and to wrest control of the city from the Qing in 1863, with the intention of handing the city over to Du Wenxiu. However, before Du's forces could arrive, Ma Rulong\u2014with the assistance of a rising Qing military officer, Cen Yuying\u2014raced back to Kunming and regained control of the provincial capital.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align  = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = Qing Suppression of the Panthay Rebellion\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer = Scroll paintings by artists of the Qing Imperial Court from the collection of the [[Palace Museum|Palace Museum, Forbidden City]]\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width  =\n | image1 = Capture of the Provincial Capital Qujing.jpg\n | width1 = 250\n | caption1  = Capture of [[Qujing]].\n | image2 = Capture of Tucheng, Yunnan.jpg\n | width2 = 250\n | caption2  = Capture of Tucheng\n| image3 = Capture of Zhengxiong, Yunnan.jpg\n | width3 = 250\n | caption3 = Capture of [[Zhenxiong]].\n | image4 = Capture of Chengjiang, Yunnan.jpg\n | width4 = 250\n | caption4  = Battle of [[Chengjiang County|Chenggjiang]]\n | image5 = Capture of the Provincial Capital Dali, Yunnan.jpg\n | width5 = 250\n | caption5  = Capture of [[Dali City, Yunnan|Dali]], the capital of the Pingnan Sultanate}}\n\n===Decline===\nThe Sultanate's power declined after 1868.

When Cen Shuying was\nin charge of military affairs in Yunnan, the Muslim troops and\ngenerals that he used included many rebels, and it was because of\nthem that the Muslim rebellion in Yunnan was pacified. These are\nexamples to show that Muslim troops can be used effectively even\nwhile Muslim uprisings are still in progress. What is more, since the\nestablishment of the Republic, Dungan have demonstrated not the\nslightest hint of errant behaviour to suggest that they may prove to\nbe unreliable.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Impact on Burma===\nThe rebellion had a significant negative impact on the Burmese [[Konbaung Dynasty]]. After losing lower Burma to the British, Burma lost access to vast tracts of rice-growing land. Not wishing to upset China, the Burmese kingdom agreed to refuse trade with the '''Pingnan Guo''' rebels in accordance with China's demands. Without the ability to import [[rice]] from China, Burma was forced to import rice from the British. In addition, the Burmese economy had relied heavily on [[cotton]] exports to China, and suddenly lost access to the vast Chinese market. Many surviving Hui refugees escaped over the border to neighboring countries, [[Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], forming the basis of a minority Chinese Hui population in those nations.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Third plague pandemic]]\n* [[Panthay]]\n* [[Islam in China]]\n* [[Islam during the Qing Dynasty]]\n* [[Yusuf Ma Dexin]], a prominent Muslim scholar in Yunnan at the time of the rebellions\n* [[Taiping Rebellion]]\n* [[Nian Rebellion]]\n* [[Miao Rebellion (1854\u201373)]]\n* [[Nepalese-Tibetan War]]\n* [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]]\n* [[Punti\u2013Hakka Clan Wars]]\n<!--==Notes==-->\n\n==References==\n*{{PD-old-text|title=Burma past and present|year=1878|author=Albert Fytche}}\n*{{PD-old-text|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia of religion and ethics, Volume 8|year=1916|author=James Hastings, John Alexander Selbie, Louis Herbert Gray}}\n{{Reflist|colwidth=24em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation |url= |last=Atwill |first=David G. |title=The Chinese Sultanate: Islam, Ethnicity and the Panthay Rebellion in Southwest China, 1856-1873 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-5159-5 }}\n* {{citation |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_09300 |last=Davenport Northrop |first=Henry |title=The flowery kingdom and the land of the Mikado, or, China, Japan and Corea |work=Making of America Project |year=1894 |publisher=J.H.Moore Co.

It was the rebels in western Yunnan under the leadership of Du Wenxiu who, by gaining control of [[Dali City|Dali]] in 1856 (which they retained until its fall in 1872), became the major military and political center of opposition to the Qing government. They turned their fury on the local mandarins and ended up challenging the central government in Beijing.\n\nThe Imperial government was handicapped by a profusion of problems in various parts of the sprawling empire, the [[Taiping rebellion]] being one of them. It was a time when China was still suffering from the shocks caused by the first series of unequal treaties, such as the [[Treaty of Nanking]]. These circumstances favored the ascendancy of the Muslims in Yunnan.\n\n===The Pacified Southern Kingdom===\nThe rebels captured the city of [[Dali, Yunnan|Dali]], which became the base for their operations, and they declared themselves a separate political entity from China. The rebels identified their nation as '''Pingnan Guo''' ('''Ping-nan Kuo'''; {{zh|s=\u5e73\u5357\u56fd|l=Pacified Southern State}}); their leader Sulayman ibn `Abd ar-Rahman, known as [[Du Wenxiu]] [originally Yang Xiu (\u6768\u79c0)<ref>http://www.shijiemingren.com/doc-view-27181.html, retrieved 31 Mar 2017</ref>] (died 1873) was styled ''Qa\u00b4id Jami al-Muslimin'' ('Leader of the Community of Muslims', but usually referred to in foreign sources as Sultan) and ruled 1856{{snd}}26{{nbsp}}December 1872.\nStarting from 1855 the Hui of Yunnan had risen against the oppression to which they were subjected by the mandarins. They rose against the tyranny and extortion universally practiced by this official class, from which they were excluded. The mandarins had secretly hounded mobs on to the rich Panthays, provoked anti-Hui riots and instigated destruction of their mosques.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 233\">(Anderson, 1876, 233)</ref> The revolt was not religious in nature, since the Muslims were joined by non-Muslim [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Kachin people]] and other hill tribes in the revolt.<ref name=\"fytche_300\"/> A British officer testified that the Muslims did not rebel for religious reasons and that the Chinese were tolerant of different religions and were unlikely to have caused the revolt by interfering with the practicing of Islam.<ref name=\"fytche_301\"/>  In addition, loyalist Muslim forces helped Qing crush the rebel Muslims.<ref name=\"Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa 2002 283\"/>\n\nThe rebellion started as a local uprising. It was sparked off by the Panthay laborers of the silver mines of Lin'an village in Yunnan who rose up against the Qing. The Chinese Governor of Yunnan sent an urgent appeal to the central government in Beijing. The Imperial Government was handicapped by problems that cropped up in profusion in various parts of the sprawling empire.\n\nThey repulsed the desultory attacks of the imperial troops. They wrested one important city after another from the hands of' the Imperial mandarins. The Chinese towns and villages which resisted were pillaged, and the male population massacred. All the places which yielded were spared.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 233\"/> The ancient holy city of Dali fell to the Panthays in 1857. With the capture of Dali, Muslim supremacy became an established fact in Yunnan.\n\nDu Wenxiu was originally not aiming his rebellion at Han, but was anti-Qing and wanted to destroy the Manchu government. During the revolt Hui from provinces which were not in rebellion, like Sichuan and Zhejiang, served as negotiators between rebel Hui and the Qing government. One of Du Wenxiu's banners said \"Deprive the Manchu Qing of their Mandate to Rule\" (\u9769\u547d\u6eff\u6e05), and he called on Han to assist Hui to overthrow the Manchu regime and drive them out of China.<ref name=\"Michael Dillon 1999 59\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Da2M_viEclEC&pg=PA139&dq=du+wenxiu+anti+han#v=onepage&q=du%20wenxiu%20anti%20han&f=false|title=The Chinese sultanate: Islam, ethnicity, and the Panthay Rebellion in southwest China, 1856-1873|author=David G.

Some of the Jahriyya rebels in the Panthay Rebellion like Ma Shenglin were related to the Dungan revolt Jahriyya leader [[Ma Hualong]] and maintained contact with them.\n\nThe \"Islamic Kingdom of Yunnan\" was proclaimed after the fall of Tali-fu ([[Dali City]]). Du Wenxiu, leader of the Panthays, assumed the regnal title of Sultan Suleiman and made Tali-fu his capital. In this way, the Sultanate, fashioned after those of' the Middle East, appeared in Yunnan. Panthay governorships were also created in a few important cities, such as Momein (Tengyueh), which were a few stages from the Burmese border town of Bhamo. The Panthays reached the highwater mark of their power and glory in 1860.\n\nThe eight years from 1860 to 1868 were the heyday of the Sultanate. The Panthays had either taken or destroyed forty towns and one hundred villages.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 343\">(Anderson, 1876, 343)</ref> During this period the Sultan Suleiman, on his way to Mecca as a pilgrim, visited Rangoon, presumably via the Kengtung route, and from there to Calcutta where he had a chance to see the power of the British colonists.<ref>(Anderson, 1876, 242)</ref>\n\nThe Panthay power declined after 1868. The Chinese Imperial Government had succeeded in reinvigorating itself. By 1871, it was directing a campaign for the annihilation of the obdurate Panthays of Yunnan. By degrees the Imperial Government had tightened the cordon around the Panthays. The Panthay Kingdom proved unstable as soon as the Imperial Government made a regular and determined attack on it. Town after town fell under well-organized attacks made by the imperial troops. Tali-fu itself was besieged by the imperial Chinese. Sultan Suleiman found himself caged in by the walls of his capital. He now desperately looked for outside help. He turned to the British colonists for military assistance.<ref name=\"Thaung, 1961, 481\">(Thaung, 1961, 481)</ref> He imagined that only British military intervention could have saved the Panthays.\n\nThe Sultan had reasons for his turning to the British colonists for military aid. He had seen the British might in India on his pilgrimage to Mecca some years earlier, and was impressed by it. Britain was the only western power with whom the Sultanate was on friendly terms and had contacts with. The British authorities in India and British Burma had sent a mission led by Major Sladen to Momien from May to July 1868. The Sladen mission had stayed seven weeks at Momien. The main purpose of the mission was to revive the Ambassador Route between Bhamo and Yunnan and resuscitate border trade, which had almost ceased since 1855 mainly because of the Panthay rebellion.\n\nTaking advantage of the friendly relations resulting from Sladen's visit, Sultan Suleiman now, in his fight for the survival of the Panthay Kingdom, turned to the British for the vitally, needed military assistance. In 1872 he sent his adopted son Prince Hassan, to England, with a personal letter to Queen Victoria, via Burma, requesting British military assistance. The Hassan Mission was accorded courtesy and hospitality in both British Burma and England. However, the British colonists refused to intervene militarily in Yunnan against Peking.<ref name=\"Thaung, 1961, 481\"/> The mission was a failure. While Hassan and his party were abroad, Tali-fu was captured by the Imperial troops in January 1873.\n\nThe Imperial Government had waged an all-out war against the Panthays with the help of French artillery experts.<ref name=\"Thaung, 1961, 481\"/> Their modern equipment, trained personnel and numerical superiority were no match for the ill-equipped Panthays with no allies. Thus, in less than two decades of its rise, the power of the Panthays in Yunnan fell. But the Chinese suffered the loss of more than 20,000 lives in various fights.<ref>(Anderson, 1876, 243)</ref> Seeing no escape and no mercy from his relentless foe, Sultan Suleiman tried to take his own life before the fall of' Tali-fu. But, before the poison he drank took effect fully, he was beheaded by his enemies. The Sultan's head was preserved in honey and then dispatched to the Imperial Court in Peking as a trophy and a testimony to the decisive nature of the victory of the Imperial Chinese over the Pantliays of Yunnan.<ref>(Thaung, 1961, 482)</ref>\n\nThe scattered remnants of the Panthay troops continue their resistance after the fall of Tali-fu. But when Momien was next besieged and stormed by the imperial troops in May 1873, their resistance broke completely. Governor Ta-sa-kon was captured and executed by the order of the Imperial Government.\n\nMany adherents to the Panthay cause were persecuted by the imperial mandarins.  Many Panthays thus fled with their families across the Burmese border and took refuge in the Wa State where, about 1875, they set up the exclusively Panthay town of [[Panlong Subtownship|Panglong]].<ref>(Scott, 1901, 740)</ref>\n\nFor a period of perhaps ten to fifteen years following the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion, the province's Hui minority was widely discriminated against by the victorious Qing, especially in the western frontier districts contiguous with Burma. During these years the refugee Hui settled across the frontier within Burma gradually established themselves in their traditional callings \u2013 as merchants, caravaneers, miners, restaurateurs and (for those who chose or were forced to live beyond the law) as smugglers and mercenaries.\n\nAt least 15 years after the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion, the original Panthay settlements had grown to include numbers of Shan and other hill peoples.\n\nGovernorships of the sultanate were also created in a few important cities, such as Momein ([[Tengyue]]), which were not far from the Burmese border town of [[Bhamo]]. The sultanate reached the high-water mark of its power and glory in 1860.\n\nThe eight years from 1860-68 were the heyday of the Sultanate. The Yunnanese Muslim rebels had either taken or destroyed 40 towns and 100 villages.<ref name=\"Anderson, 1876, 343\"/>\n\nVarious rebel forces besieged the city of [[Kunming]] repeatedly: in 1857, 1861, 1863 and 1868. Ma Rulong, a Hui rebel leader from southern [[Yunnan]], besieged the city in 1862, but he defected to the central government's forces after being offered a military post. His decision to quit the siege was not accepted by his followers, who took the opportunity of his absence to kill the Governor-General (Pan Duo) and to wrest control of the city from the Qing in 1863, with the intention of handing the city over to Du Wenxiu. However, before Du's forces could arrive, Ma Rulong\u2014with the assistance of a rising Qing military officer, Cen Yuying\u2014raced back to Kunming and regained control of the provincial capital.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align  = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = Qing Suppression of the Panthay Rebellion\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer = Scroll paintings by artists of the Qing Imperial Court from the collection of the [[Palace Museum|Palace Museum, Forbidden City]]\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width  =\n | image1 = Capture of the Provincial Capital Qujing.jpg\n | width1 = 250\n | caption1  = Capture of [[Qujing]].\n | image2 = Capture of Tucheng, Yunnan.jpg\n | width2 = 250\n | caption2  = Capture of Tucheng\n| image3 = Capture of Zhengxiong, Yunnan.jpg\n | width3 = 250\n | caption3 = Capture of [[Zhenxiong]].\n | image4 = Capture of Chengjiang, Yunnan.jpg\n | width4 = 250\n | caption4  = Battle of [[Chengjiang County|Chenggjiang]]\n | image5 = Capture of the Provincial Capital Dali, Yunnan.jpg\n | width5 = 250\n | caption5  = Capture of [[Dali City, Yunnan|Dali]], the capital of the Pingnan Sultanate}}\n\n===Decline===\nThe Sultanate's power declined after 1868.

When Cen Shuying was\nin charge of military affairs in Yunnan, the Muslim troops and\ngenerals that he used included many rebels, and it was because of\nthem that the Muslim rebellion in Yunnan was pacified. These are\nexamples to show that Muslim troops can be used effectively even\nwhile Muslim uprisings are still in progress.

After losing lower Burma to the British, Burma lost access to vast tracts of rice-growing land. Not wishing to upset China, the Burmese kingdom agreed to refuse trade with the '''Pingnan Guo''' rebels in accordance with China's demands. Without the ability to import [[rice]] from China, Burma was forced to import rice from the British. In addition, the Burmese economy had relied heavily on [[cotton]] exports to China, and suddenly lost access to the vast Chinese market. Many surviving Hui refugees escaped over the border to neighboring countries, [[Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], forming the basis of a minority Chinese Hui population in those nations.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Third plague pandemic]]\n* [[Panthay]]\n* [[Islam in China]]\n* [[Islam during the Qing Dynasty]]\n* [[Yusuf Ma Dexin]], a prominent Muslim scholar in Yunnan at the time of the rebellions\n* [[Taiping Rebellion]]\n* [[Nian Rebellion]]\n* [[Miao Rebellion (1854\u201373)]]\n* [[Nepalese-Tibetan War]]\n* [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)]]\n* [[Punti\u2013Hakka Clan Wars]]\n<!--==Notes==-->\n\n==References==\n*{{PD-old-text|title=Burma past and present|year=1878|author=Albert Fytche}}\n*{{PD-old-text|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia of religion and ethics, Volume 8|year=1916|author=James Hastings, John Alexander Selbie, Louis Herbert Gray}}\n{{Reflist|colwidth=24em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation |url= |last=Atwill |first=David G. |title=The Chinese Sultanate: Islam, Ethnicity and the Panthay Rebellion in Southwest China, 1856-1873 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-5159-5 }}\n* {{citation |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_09300 |last=Davenport Northrop |first=Henry |title=The flowery kingdom and the land of the Mikado, or, China, Japan and Corea |work=Making of America Project |year=1894 |publisher=J.H.Moore Co.

The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station.  It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit. SpaceX would not have agreed to fly their satellite otherwise, since this was not part of the core mission and there was a known, material risk of no altitude raise.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121114anomalies/|title=Dragon Mission Report|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=November 14, 2012|work=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}</ref> \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5\n| March 1, 2013 <br />15:10\n| [[Falcon 9 v1.0|F9 v1.0]]<ref name=MuskMay2012/><br />B0007<ref name=block_numbers/>\n| [[CCAFS]] <br />[[LC-40]]\n| [[SpaceX CRS-2]]<ref name=sxManifest20120925 /><br>(Dragon C105)\n| {{convert|677|kg|disp=br()|abbr=on}}{{efn|name=DryDragon}}\n| [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] ([[ISS]])\n| [[NASA]] ([[Commercial Resupply Services|CRS]])\n| {{Success}}\n| style=\"background:#ececec; text-align:center;\" | {{nobr|No attempt}}\n|-\n| colspan=9 | Last launch of the original Falcon 9 v1.0 [[launch vehicle]], first use of the unpressurized trunk section of Dragon.<ref name=\"sxf9_20110321\"/>\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6\n| {{nobr|September 29,}} 2013 <br />16:00<ref name=pa20130930/>\n| [[Falcon 9 v1.1|F9 v1.1]]<ref name=MuskMay2012/><br />B1003<ref name=block_numbers/>\n| [[VAFB]] <br />[[SLC-4E]]\n| [[CASSIOPE]]<ref name=sxManifest20120925 /><ref name=\"CASSIOPE_MDA\">\n {{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518musk/|title=Dragon Mission Report &#124; Q&A with SpaceX founder and chief designer Elon Musk|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=May 18, 2012|work=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}</ref>\n| {{convert|500|kg|disp=br()|abbr=on}}\n| [[Polar orbit|Polar]] [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]\n| [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates|MDA]]\n| {{Success}}<ref name=pa20130930/>\n| {{no2|Uncontrolled}} <br /> <small>(ocean)</small>{{efn|name=ocean landing}}\n|-\n| colspan=9 | First commercial mission with a private customer, first launch from Vandenberg, and demonstration flight of Falcon 9 v1.1 with an improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity.<ref name=\"sxf9_20110321\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |title=Falcon 9 Overview |date=May 27, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012 |publisher=[[SpaceX]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118103620/http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}</ref> After separation from the second stage carrying Canadian commercial and scientific satellites, the first stage booster performed a controlled reentry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/007/ses8_presskit.pdf|title=SES-8 Mission Press Kit|date=November 2013|publisher=SpaceX|via=spaceflightnow.com|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref> and an [[Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests|ocean touchdown test]] for the first time.

The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station.  It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit. SpaceX would not have agreed to fly their satellite otherwise, since this was not part of the core mission and there was a known, material risk of no altitude raise.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121114anomalies/|title=Dragon Mission Report|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=November 14, 2012|work=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}</ref> \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5\n| March 1, 2013 <br />15:10\n| [[Falcon 9 v1.0|F9 v1.0]]<ref name=MuskMay2012/><br />B0007<ref name=block_numbers/>\n| [[CCAFS]] <br />[[LC-40]]\n| [[SpaceX CRS-2]]<ref name=sxManifest20120925 /><br>(Dragon C105)\n| {{convert|677|kg|disp=br()|abbr=on}}{{efn|name=DryDragon}}\n| [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] ([[ISS]])\n| [[NASA]] ([[Commercial Resupply Services|CRS]])\n| {{Success}}\n| style=\"background:#ececec; text-align:center;\" | {{nobr|No attempt}}\n|-\n| colspan=9 | Last launch of the original Falcon 9 v1.0 [[launch vehicle]], first use of the unpressurized trunk section of Dragon.<ref name=\"sxf9_20110321\"/>\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6\n| {{nobr|September 29,}} 2013 <br />16:00<ref name=pa20130930/>\n| [[Falcon 9 v1.1|F9 v1.1]]<ref name=MuskMay2012/><br />B1003<ref name=block_numbers/>\n| [[VAFB]] <br />[[SLC-4E]]\n| [[CASSIOPE]]<ref name=sxManifest20120925 /><ref name=\"CASSIOPE_MDA\">\n {{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518musk/|title=Dragon Mission Report &#124; Q&A with SpaceX founder and chief designer Elon Musk|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=May 18, 2012|work=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}</ref>\n| {{convert|500|kg|disp=br()|abbr=on}}\n| [[Polar orbit|Polar]] [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]\n| [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates|MDA]]\n| {{Success}}<ref name=pa20130930/>\n| {{no2|Uncontrolled}} <br /> <small>(ocean)</small>{{efn|name=ocean landing}}\n|-\n| colspan=9 | First commercial mission with a private customer, first launch from Vandenberg, and demonstration flight of Falcon 9 v1.1 with an improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity.<ref name=\"sxf9_20110321\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |title=Falcon 9 Overview |date=May 27, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012 |publisher=[[SpaceX]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118103620/http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}</ref> After separation from the second stage carrying Canadian commercial and scientific satellites, the first stage booster performed a controlled reentry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/007/ses8_presskit.pdf|title=SES-8 Mission Press Kit|date=November 2013|publisher=SpaceX|via=spaceflightnow.com|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref> and an [[Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests|ocean touchdown test]] for the first time.

{"title_page": "Hessian matrix", "text_new": "{{short description|(Mathematical) matrix of second derivatives}}\n{{Calculus|Multivariable}}\n\nIn [[mathematic]]s, the '''Hessian matrix''' or '''Hessian''' is a [[square matrix]] of second-order [[partial derivative]]s of a scalar-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]], or [[scalar field]]. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. The Hessian matrix was developed in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Otto Hesse|Ludwig Otto Hesse]] and later named after him. Hesse originally used the term \"functional determinants\".\n\n== Definitions and properties ==\n\nSuppose {{math|''f'' : \u211d<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 \u211d}} is a function taking as input a vector {{math|'''x''' \u2208 \u211d<sup>''n''</sup>}} and outputting a scalar {{math|''f''('''x''') \u2208 \u211d}}. If all second [[partial derivative]]s of {{math|''f''}} exist and are continuous over the domain of the function, then the Hessian matrix {{math|'''H'''}} of {{math|''f''}} is a square {{math|''n''\u00d7''n''}} matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf H = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1^2} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1\\,\\partial x_2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1\\,\\partial x_n} \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2\\,\\partial x_1} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2^2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2\\,\\partial x_n} \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n\\,\\partial x_1} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n\\,\\partial x_2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nor, by stating an equation for the coefficients using indices i and j:\n:<math>\\mathbf H_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}.</math>\n\nThe [[determinant]] of the above matrix is called the Hessian determinant.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Binmore |first1=Ken |authorlink1=Kenneth Binmore |last2=Davies |first2=Joan |year=2007 |title=Calculus Concepts and Methods |oclc=717598615 |isbn=978-0-521-77541-0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=190 }}</ref>\n\nThe Hessian matrix of a function f is the transpose of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the gradient of the function: {{math|'''H'''(''f''('''x''')) {{=}} '''J'''(\u2207''f''('''x'''))<sup>T</sup>}}.\n\nThe '''mixed partial derivatives''' of ''f'' are the entries outside the [[main diagonal]] in the Hessian. Assuming that they are continuous in a neighborhood of a given point, the order of differentiation does not matter ([[Symmetry of second derivatives#Schwarz's theorem|Schwarz's theorem]]). Thus,\n\n:<math>\\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_j} \\right) =\n       \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_i} \\right).</math>\n\nIn a formal statement: if the second partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} are all [[continuous function|continuous]] in a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] {{math|''D''}} of a given point, then the Hessian of {{math|''f''}} is a [[symmetric matrix]] throughout {{math|''D''}}; see [[symmetry of second derivatives]].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Second-derivative test ===\n{{Main|Second partial derivative test}}\n\nThe Hessian matrix of a [[convex function]] is [[positive semi-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]]. Refining this property allows us to test whether a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] {{mvar|x}} is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point, as follows:\n\nIf the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]] at {{mvar|x}}, then {{mvar|f}} attains an isolated local minimum at {{mvar|x}}. If the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite, semidefinite and indefinite matrices|negative-definite]] at {{mvar|x}}, then {{mvar|f}} attains an isolated local maximum at {{mvar|x}}. If the Hessian has both positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s, then {{mvar|x}} is a [[saddle point]] for {{mvar|f}}. Otherwise the test is inconclusive. This implies that at a local minimum the Hessian is positive-semidefinite, and at a local maximum the Hessian is negative-semidefinite.\n\nNote that for positive-semidefinite and negative-semidefinite Hessians the test is inconclusive (a critical point where the Hessian is semidefinite but not definite may be a local extremum or a saddle point). However, more can be said from the point of view of [[Morse theory]].\n\nThe [[second-derivative test]] for functions of one and two variables is simple. In one variable, the Hessian contains just one second derivative; if it is positive, then {{mvar|x}} is a local minimum, and if it is negative, then {{mvar|x}} is a local maximum; if it is zero, then the test is inconclusive. In two variables, the [[determinant]] can be used, because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. If it is positive, then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. If it is negative, then the two eigenvalues have different signs. If it is zero, then the second-derivative test is inconclusive.\n\nEquivalently, the second-order conditions that are sufficient for a local minimum or maximum can be expressed in terms of the sequence of principal (upper-leftmost) [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] (determinants of sub-matrices) of the Hessian; these conditions are a special case of those given in the next section for bordered Hessians for constrained optimization\u2014the case in which the number of constraints is zero. Specifically, the sufficient condition for a minimum is that all of these principal minors be positive, while the sufficient condition for a maximum is that the minors alternate in sign, with the 1\u00d71 minor being negative.\n\n=== Critical points ===\n\nIf the [[gradient]] (the vector of the partial derivatives) of a function {{math|''f''}} is zero at some point {{math|'''x'''}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]'' (or ''[[stationary point]]'') at {{math|'''x'''}}. The [[determinant]] of the Hessian at {{math|'''x'''}} is then called the [[discriminant]]. If this determinant is zero then {{math|'''x'''}} is called a ''degenerate critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}, or a ''non-Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise it is non-degenerate, and called a ''Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nThe Hessian matrix plays an important role in [[Morse theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]], because its [[kernel of a matrix|kernel]] and [[eigenvalue]]s allow classification of the critical points.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geruGMKT9_UC&pg=PA248|title=Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View|last=Callahan|first=James J.|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-7332-0|page=248|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcn3CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178|title=Recent Developments in General Relativity|editor-last=Casciaro|editor-first=B.|editor-last2=Fortunato|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Francaviglia|editor-first3=M.|editor-last4=Masiello|editor-first4=A.|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9788847021136|page=178|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Domenico P.

That is,\n\n:<math>y=f(\\mathbf{x} + \\Delta\\mathbf{x})\\approx f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})^\\mathrm{T} \\Delta\\mathbf{x} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta\\mathbf{x}^\\mathrm{T} \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x}) \\Delta\\mathbf{x}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u2207''f''}} is the [[gradient]] {{math|({{sfrac|\u2202''f''|\u2202''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, ..., {{sfrac|\u2202''f''|\u2202''x<sub>n</sub>''}})}}. Computing and storing the full Hessian matrix takes [[Big theta|{{math|\u0398(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}]] memory, which is infeasible for high-dimensional functions such as the [[loss function]]s of [[artificial neural network|neural nets]], [[conditional random field]]s, and other [[statistical model]]s with large numbers of parameters. For such situations, [[truncated Newton method|truncated-Newton]] and [[quasi-Newton method|quasi-Newton]] algorithms have been developed.

It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. The Hessian matrix was developed in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Otto Hesse|Ludwig Otto Hesse]] and later named after him. Hesse originally used the term \"functional determinants\".\n\n== Definitions and properties ==\n\nSuppose {{math|''f'' : \u211d<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 \u211d}} is a function taking as input a vector {{math|'''x''' \u2208 \u211d<sup>''n''</sup>}} and outputting a scalar {{math|''f''('''x''') \u2208 \u211d}}. If all second [[partial derivative]]s of {{math|''f''}} exist and are continuous over the domain of the function, then the Hessian matrix {{math|'''H'''}} of {{math|''f''}} is a square {{math|''n''\u00d7''n''}} matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf H = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1^2} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1\\,\\partial x_2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1\\,\\partial x_n} \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2\\,\\partial x_1} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2^2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2\\,\\partial x_n} \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n\\,\\partial x_1} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n\\,\\partial x_2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nor, by stating an equation for the coefficients using indices i and j:\n:<math>\\mathbf H_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}.</math>\n\nThe [[determinant]] of the above matrix is called the Hessian determinant.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Binmore |first1=Ken |authorlink1=Kenneth Binmore |last2=Davies |first2=Joan |year=2007 |title=Calculus Concepts and Methods |oclc=717598615 |isbn=978-0-521-77541-0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=190 }}</ref>\n\nThe Hessian matrix of a function f is the transpose of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the gradient of the function: {{math|'''H'''(''f''('''x''')) {{=}} '''J'''(\u2207''f''('''x'''))<sup>T</sup>}}.\n\nThe '''mixed partial derivatives''' of ''f'' are the entries outside the [[main diagonal]] in the Hessian. Assuming that they are continuous in a neighborhood of a given point, the order of differentiation does not matter ([[Symmetry of second derivatives#Schwarz's theorem|Schwarz's theorem]]). Thus,\n\n:<math>\\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_j} \\right) =\n       \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left(\\frac {\\partial f }{\\partial x_i} \\right).</math>\n\nIn a formal statement: if the second partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} are all [[continuous function|continuous]] in a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] {{math|''D''}} of a given point, then the Hessian of {{math|''f''}} is a [[symmetric matrix]] throughout {{math|''D''}}; see [[symmetry of second derivatives]].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Second-derivative test ===\n{{Main|Second partial derivative test}}\n\nThe Hessian matrix of a [[convex function]] is [[positive semi-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]]. Refining this property allows us to test whether a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] {{mvar|x}} is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point, as follows:\n\nIf the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]] at {{mvar|x}}, then {{mvar|f}} attains an isolated local minimum at {{mvar|x}}. If the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite, semidefinite and indefinite matrices|negative-definite]] at {{mvar|x}}, then {{mvar|f}} attains an isolated local maximum at {{mvar|x}}. If the Hessian has both positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s, then {{mvar|x}} is a [[saddle point]] for {{mvar|f}}. Otherwise the test is inconclusive. This implies that at a local minimum the Hessian is positive-semidefinite, and at a local maximum the Hessian is negative-semidefinite.\n\nNote that for positive-semidefinite and negative-semidefinite Hessians the test is inconclusive (a critical point where the Hessian is semidefinite but not definite may be a local extremum or a saddle point). However, more can be said from the point of view of [[Morse theory]].\n\nThe [[second-derivative test]] for functions of one and two variables is simple. In one variable, the Hessian contains just one second derivative; if it is positive, then {{mvar|x}} is a local minimum, and if it is negative, then {{mvar|x}} is a local maximum; if it is zero, then the test is inconclusive. In two variables, the [[determinant]] can be used, because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. If it is positive, then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. If it is negative, then the two eigenvalues have different signs. If it is zero, then the second-derivative test is inconclusive.\n\nEquivalently, the second-order conditions that are sufficient for a local minimum or maximum can be expressed in terms of the sequence of principal (upper-leftmost) [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] (determinants of sub-matrices) of the Hessian; these conditions are a special case of those given in the next section for bordered Hessians for constrained optimization\u2014the case in which the number of constraints is zero. Specifically, the sufficient condition for a minimum is that all of these principal minors be positive, while the sufficient condition for a maximum is that the minors alternate in sign, with the 1\u00d71 minor being negative.\n\n=== Critical points ===\n\nIf the [[gradient]] (the vector of the partial derivatives) of a function {{math|''f''}} is zero at some point {{math|'''x'''}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]'' (or ''[[stationary point]]'') at {{math|'''x'''}}. The [[determinant]] of the Hessian at {{math|'''x'''}} is then called the [[discriminant]]. If this determinant is zero then {{math|'''x'''}} is called a ''degenerate critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}, or a ''non-Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise it is non-degenerate, and called a ''Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nThe Hessian matrix plays an important role in [[Morse theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]], because its [[kernel of a matrix|kernel]] and [[eigenvalue]]s allow classification of the critical points.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geruGMKT9_UC&pg=PA248|title=Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View|last=Callahan|first=James J.|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-7332-0|page=248|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcn3CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178|title=Recent Developments in General Relativity|editor-last=Casciaro|editor-first=B.|editor-last2=Fortunato|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Francaviglia|editor-first3=M.|editor-last4=Masiello|editor-first4=A.|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9788847021136|page=178|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Domenico P.

The ''sijo'' of the times, mostly written by men of elite status, are very reflective of the contemporary politics; thus, to understand the importance of the themes of Kory\u014f dynasty ''sijo'', it is important to understand the political climate surrounding the poetry. \n\nMuch of the Kory\u014f dynasty was plagued with political strife. In 1170, the military aristocracy seized power from the civil aristocracy. Instability reigned in the government and the countryside for the next 25 years as military leaders plotted against each other and peasants rebelled against landowners and local officers. It was not until 1196 that things stabilized, when [[Choe Chung-heon]] seized power and established rule of the Choe family. Much of his power came from the parallel government he created, which was based on house institutions under his direct control staffed with people personally loyal to him. He also made effective use of ''mun'gaek'', private military retainers of great clans. \n\nKorea then endured repeated Mongol invasions from 1217 to 1258, and from 1270 to 1356, Korea was under Mongol domination. After Korea was liberated from Mongol control, there were still political conflicts on all sides of Kory\u014f. Kory\u014f was consistently under attack from Japanese pirates and Yuan refugees and faced two invasions from the Red Turbans. Finally, the Kory\u014f dynasty ended when Yi Seong-gye rose to power, proclaiming himself as [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]] and renaming the state as the Chos\u014fn. This transition was quite violent and unstable, as the crown princes and members of the Wang royal house were reinstated only to be purged, and two factions arose towards the later Kory\u014f era&nbsp;\u2013 one whose loyalty to the existing regime continued, another whose loyalty shifted towards the new movement of the Chos\u014fn.\n\nIt was this incident for which the ''sijo'' poems of the late Kory\u014f are most well-known. The most prevalent theme of this era is loyalty to a lost cause<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Kichung |title=An Introduction to Classical Korean Literature: From Hyangga to P'ansori |date=28 Aug 1996 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |location=Armonk, New York |isbn=1-56324-785-2}}</ref>, arising as a reaction to the rise of the new Chos\u014fn dynasty as the most powerful groups of the period struggled with where their loyalties lay. However, exacerbating the situation were the simultaneous struggles of China's Sung dynasty and the ascending Ming dynasty, further conflicting the people's loyalties. Thus, the ensuing confusion and chaos of the times gave way to themes of strong emotions such as regret over aging and sorrow over love, as many sought to express their mixed, complicated thoughts and harken back to the time of peace and stability.\n\nOne of the most famous ''sijo'' poems that demonstrates such political upheavals and tensions of the period is [[Jeong Mong-ju|Ch\u014fng Mongju]]'s ''sijo'', seen below, with the English translation provided by Rutt in ''The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThough this frame should die and die, \n          though I die a hundred times,\nMy bleached bones all turn to dust, \n          my very soul exist or not \u2013\nWhat can change the undivided heart \n          that glows with faith toward my lord?\n</poem>}}\n\nCh\u014fng, a great scholar of the time referred to as P'o\u016dn, supposedly wrote this poem in response to Yi Seong-gye's son's suggestion to defect and join the growing Chos\u014fn movement.  The very idea that one's \"undivided heart\" remains loyal to the same despite dying \"a hundred times\" and one's \"bleached bones all turn(ing) to dust\" clearly exhibits the overall sense of honor, integrity, and fidelity that is emblematic of this generation's ''sijo'' poetry. In fact, this poem has become one of the prototypical examples of loyalty in Korea, even possibly one of the best known of all Korean ''sijo'' poems among Koreans. Today, this ''sijo'' has become to be known as the \"Song of a Loyal Heart,\" or the \"Tansim ka.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCann |first1=David |title=A Brief History of Korean Literature to the Nineteenth Century |date=2000 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-50574-1}}</ref>\n\n== Reemergence of the ''sijo'' in the 18th century ==\n''Sijo'' was first written in the 14th century during the end of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty. However, it was not until the [[Joseon]] dynasty that it gained immense popularity. During the rise of the early Joseon dynasty ''sijo'' became very popular among ''[[yangban]]'' and the ruling class. In its earlier stages ''sijo'' was often written in [[classical Chinese]] by ''yangban'' and the ruling class. A lot of the poems used language which showed social hierarchy. It was not accessible to the masses due to it being written in classical Chinese characters. It was also hard to adapt to ''sijo-chang'' (''sijo'' in song form) because of the Chinese characters. \n\nThe 18th century marked two very important events in ''sijo''. The first being the reemergence of the term. The second being the shift from classical or traditional ''sijo'' to modern ''sijo''. During the 18th century, the word ''sijo'' reemerged and with it came changes. ''Sijo'' was now written in Korean and was more accessible to the masses. It was no longer confined to just being a product by and for the ruling class and the ''yangban''. ''Sijo'' was now available, created and performed by the general Korean public. New poems outside of [[Confucian]] ideal and hierarchy were being written and performed. This led to the invention of different forms of ''sijo'' such as ''sasol sijo'', ''ossijo'', and ''yon sijo''. The themes of ''sijo'' expanded and included more than just the narrative of the upper class.\n\nIn early to mid 18th century ''sijo'' reemerged and can be seen as traditional ''sijo''. This is mainly due to the fact that this period signified Korea's isolation to the outside world. After the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] which opened Korea to a foreign nation, ''Sijo'' also shifted to become a modern poetry form. Up until the end of the Joseon dynasty, there was not a singular name for this form of poetry and ''sijo'' was not considered a literary genre. Instead, they were seen as songs and were labeled to signify what type of song it was. For example, it would have names such as ''sijoelga'' or ''sijeoldanga'' due to the situation in which it was a sung source. It was not until late 18th century that the word \"sijo\" reemerged as a literary poetic genre. It was in the 19th century that the movement of the restoration of ''sijo'' began. The activists involved in that movement took the first part of the word ''sijochang'' which historically was sung and kept the word as \"sijo\" to define this literary genre. \n\n== ''Sijo chang'' ==\n''Sijo'' emerged in the late Kory\u014f Period as a performing art and eventually gained popularity through the Chos\u014fn period. Initially, it spread amongst the ''[[yangban]]'', or upper class, and later amongst the commoners. ''Sijo'' was passed down as an oral tradition during this period as a means to preserve the art form. While ''sijo'' encompasses a wide variety of traditional Korean poetry, one specific variation that derives from it is known as ''sijo chang''. One of the most significant differences when comparing standard ''sijo'' with ''sijo chang'' is the presence of musical instruments. ''Sijo chang'' poetry employs the use of various Korean instruments to accompany the vocalist reciting the poem.\n\n''Sijo chang'' is known as \"short song\" because it has slow tunes with long, drawn-out ending pronunciation. For this reason it may also be called \"the slowest song in the world\". It demands a high level of ability and coordination between drummer and performer in order to keep the song flowing well. Throughout each ''sijo'', the singer employs practiced techniques, such as vibrato and pitch changes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Music of Korean|last=|first=|publisher=The national center for Korean traditional performing arts|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nThe singer is accompanied by the ''dae-gum'' (bamboo flute) and the ''chang-gu'' (hour-glass shaped drum). The singer uses a wide range of vibrato in addition to pitch changes. All ''sijo chang'' are sung in a very deliberate pace. The singer must be trained to extend the notes of the song for effect.  Other instruments are used as the background musical support to keep the flow. For instance, the ''piri'' (bamboo oboe), ''taegum'' (transverse flute), ''tanso'' (vertical flute), and ''haegum'' (two-fiddle zither) may also be used to accompany the vocalist. Although a wide variety of instruments may be used as an accompaniment to the ''sijo chang'' vocalist, not all may be used at one time. In more informal settings the ''chang-gu'' may be used as the sole instrument. Oftentimes, the sound of hitting one's lap may also serve as the only instrumental accompaniment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Chinese influences on Korean ''sijo'' ==\n\n''Sijo'' was first written in Chinese because Chinese was the only written language in Korea before Joseon dynasty. The borrowing and usage of Chinese characters can be traced back to the 5th century. With the adoption of Chinese literary exams during the Goryeo dynasty, the usage of Chinese characters became more popular and it lasted for thousands of years until [[King]] Sejong invented [[Hangul]] in the Joseon dynasty. This brought about a close relationship between Korean and Chinese literature.\n\n''Sijo'' was influenced by Chinese [[Tang poetry]] and ''[[jueju]]'' poetry, one kind of Chinese Tang poetry that has four lines, can be found in the three line organization of ''sijo''. In ''jueju'', the first line states the theme; the second line develops the theme; the third line offers a twist or a contrasting idea, and the last line presents a conclusion. In ''sijo'', the first two lines play a similar role to Chinese Tang poetry, but the third line can be considered as a combination of the third and fourth line of Chinese Tang poetry. ''Sijo''{{'s}} first part of the third line gives a twist and the whole third line offers a conclusion.\n\n== Similarities with Tang poetry in themes and expression of emotion ==\n\nThere are many similarities between Korean ''sijo'' poetry and Chinese Tang poetry: the reason that people wrote poems, the messages that they want to deliver, and how they express their feelings by talking about natural things. The following passage shows the translation of [[Kwon Homun]]'s \"The Wind is Pure and Clear\" ({{lang|ko|\ubc14\ub78c\uc740 \uc808\ub85c \ub9d1\uace0}}):\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe wind is pure and clear, the moon is pure and bright.\nThe pine veranda in the bamboo garden is pure of worldly cares.\nBut a lute and piles of scrolls can make it pure still.<ref>''The Bamboo Grove'' by Richard Rutt</ref>\n</poem>}}\n\nThere are only wind, moon, pine, lute and books in the poem. However, Kwon Homun used these to paint a world of himself that he dreams of. For him, a simple life like this is enough, but even this seemly simple life is hard for him to realize. Similarly, Chinese poets in the Tang dynasty also wrote poems in this way and for this reason. Here is the translation of [[Li Bai]]'s \"At the Yellow Crane Tower to Bid Meng Haoran Bon Voyage\" ({{lang|zh|\u9ec4\u9e64\u697c\u9001\u5b5f\u6d69\u7136\u4e4b\u5e7f\u9675}}):\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAt the tower of yellow crane, my friend, to the west, you said goodbye,\nIn this misty, flowery early spring, for [[Yangzhou]] downstream, you ply.\nA speck, a silhouette is your lonely sail, to the verdant receding, till\nIn my eyes, there is only the long, Long River, rolling to the verge of the sky.\n</poem>}}\n\nOn the surface, this poem is about the view and the landscape that Li Bai saw while he was in the tower of yellow crane superficially, but it actually expresses the deep feeling of Li Bai when he was still gazing at the river even though his friend [[Meng Haoran]] has left. The first line gives readers the background and the second line constructs a confused and sorrowful air. In the last two lines, it describes how Li Bai gazed after Meng Haoran and how he felt, metaphorizing his feelings as the Long River. \n\nBy comparing the meanings of these two poems, we know that both Korean ''sijo'' and Chinese Tang poetry often employ natural objects such as landscape, pines, bamboo, plants and flowers in order to express human emotions.\n\n== Authors ==\n\n=== ''Kisaeng'' ===\nThe ''[[Kisaeng]]'' were women who functioned as professional entertainers, performing artists, and courtesans.<ref>McCann, David R. ''Early Korean literature: selections and introductions''. Columbia University Press, 2000.</ref> These women were selected at a young age from the lower class for their beauty and talents; then trained to work for the government performing-arts bureaucracy. Their presence as poets that contributed to the art of ''sijo'' is notable due to their position as lower class women. They were considered barely above beggars due to their association with prostitution.<ref>Edgin, Kayley. \"Hwang Jini: An Examination of Life as a Joseon Kisaeng.\" ''e-Publications@Marquette'', 1 Jan. 2013, epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=dittman.</ref> Since the [[Joseon|Choson period]] was heavily influenced by [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] ideals, social stratification was heavily enforced. ''Kisaeng''{{'}}s ability to create artwork admired by the ''yangban''\u2014upper class men\u2014was remarkable.\n\nMany scholars note that the ''sijos'' written by ''kisaeng'' contain \"a rare blend of emotional freedom, ironic perspective, and technical mastery\"<ref>Contogenis, Constantine, and Wolhee Choe. ''Songs of the Kisaeng: courtesan poetry of the last Korean dynasty''. BOA Editions, 1997.</ref> because they were free of the shackles of societal expectations. Their lower class standing released them from having to conform to themes of nature or filial piety. Therefore, despite the fact that the number of ''kisaeng'' authored ''sijo'' is unknown, their work is heavily associated with love poetry. [[Hwang Jini]] is one of the most notable ''kisaeng'' poets along with [[Yi Maechang]].  \n\n==== In film ====\nThe title of the 2016 film ''[[Love, Lies (2016 film)|Love, Lies]]'' in English refers to a famous ''sijo'':\n{{verse translation|lang=ko|italicsoff=yes|\n\uc0ac\ub791 \uac70\uc99b\ub9d0\uc774 \ub2d8 \ub0a0\uc0ac\ub791 \uac70\uc99b\ub9d0\uc774\n\n\uafc8\uc5d0 \ubd4c\ub2f7 \ub9d0\uc774 \uae14 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac70\uc99b\ub9d0\uc774\n\n\ub0a0\uac00\uce58 \uc7a0 \uc544\ub2c8 \uc624\uba74 \uc5b4\ub2ac \uafc8\uc5d0 \ubd48\ub9ac\uc624\n|\n\"Love.\" It is a lying word.\nThat you love me, another lie.\n\"The loved one is seen in dreams.\"\nThat is still a greater lie,\nHow can I, who can never sleep,\nhope to see you in my dreams? \n}}\n\nThis follows the \"classic format\" of the three line structure and love-longing content. In , the title of the film literally means \"flowers that understand words\",  which refers to a kiseang's ability to understand the desire or need of men. This film give clear facts on the connection between ''sijo'' and ''kiseang''. It also shows on how ''kiseangs'' trained since they were very young, and how they performed ''sijo chang''.\n\n''[[Hwang Jin Yi (film)|Hwang Jin Yi]]'', a 2007 film, gives an introduction to the well-known ''kiseang'' Hwang Jin Yi, and her legendary life.  The film examples give a clear view and introduction about kisaeng. Also, in these films, there is clear description of the well-educated kisaengs' accomplishmenst in literature. As one of the two classes who contributed to the composition the ''sijo'' poems, ''kisaeng'' also leave numbers of memorable sijo poems.\n\n==Modern ''sijo''==\n\n===Emergence of modern ''sijo''===\n \nThere are two established developments of ''sijo'': before 1876 and after. Before 1876 was when traditional ''sijo'' was prevalent and after 1876 modern ''sijo'' was \"so-called\" created<ref name=\"auto\">Ruth, Richard. The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo. Michigan: University of Michigan Press. 1998.</ref> (p.25). ''Sijo'' is a genre of short Korean poems with a strictly defined structure reflecting the rhythm of a traditional Korean song known as [[pansori]]. It originated from Korea in the Kory\u01d2 dynasty which began to flourish in the Chos\u01d2n dynasty. Established with the Confucian ideology, ''sijo'' became the most popular type of poetry among the ruling Confucian scholars and noblemen. During the time, ''sijo'' was sung and recorded by word of mouth or transcribed. ''Sijo'' is an official name of the genre of poems, which came to be in the period of modernism; especially after a movement for the restoration of ''sijo'' that became active in the 19th century. The activists of the movement copied the first part of the name of the music ''sijo chang'' as the term to reference the poetry as it did not previously have a name.\n\n===Structure and comparison to traditional ''sijo''===\n\nModern ''sijo'' is a new form of Korean vernacular poetry (''sijo''). It was emerged in 'The open-door period' (\uac1c\ud654\uae30) (1876) flourished during The Empire of Korea (1897\u20131910), Japanese Colonial Period (1910\u20131945) and is still created today. It refers only written form.\nModern ''sijo'' is generally structured the same as tradition ''sijo'' with a three line poem consisting of clusters of syllables. The difference is that modern ''sijo'' poems do not follow the fixed form as uniformly and are considered to be free verse. In contrast, people believe that ''sijo'' should remain in tune with the rhythm as it was originally to be sung and consider modern ''sijo'' that do not follow the rules as not being ''sijo''<ref name=\"auto1\">Kim, Jaihun. Modern Korean Vers in sijo Form. 1997.</ref> (p. 37) (using the syllabic pentameter: 3 4 4 3/4). There are various methods for implementing or translating modern ''sijo''. It has to have title name of each modern ''sijo''. Another difference is that traditional ''sijo'' is less likely to have a title; while referencing them, the first line of the poem becomes the title. In comparison, modern writers are more likely to give their work a legitimized title. Modern ''sijo'' is still being developed, such as in the case of contemporary poetry, and is written by experts and beginners as writers are not influenced by the class system (Yangban, Kisaeng,.. etc).\n\n===Writers===\n \n* 1920s \u2013 Choi Nam Seon (\ucd5c\ub0a8\uc120), Lee Gwang Soo (\uc774\uad11\uc218), Jeon In Bo (\uc815\uc778\ubcf4)\n* 1926 \u2013 \ucd5c\ub0a8\uc120 established the first book of modern sijos, \ubc31\ud314\ubc88\ub1cc, the 108 passions.\n* 1930s \u2013 Lee Eun Sang (\uc774\uc740\uc0c1), Lee Byeong Gi (\uc774\ubcd1\uae30), Lee Ho Woo (\uc774\ud638\uc6b0) \n\n===Examples===\n{{verse translation|lang=ko|italicsoff=yes|\n\ub09c\ucd08\n\n\ube7c\uc5b4\ub09c \uac00\ub294 \uc78e\uc0c8 \uad73\uc740 \ub4ef \ubcf4\ub4dc\ub78d\uace0\n\uc790\uc90f\ube5b \uad75\uc740 \ub300\uacf5 \ud558\uc580\ud55c \uaf43\uc774 \ubc8c\uace0\n\uc774\uc2ac\uc740 \uad6c\uc2ac\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4 \ub9c8\ub514\ub9c8\ub514 \ub2ec\ub838\ub2e4\n\ubcf8\ub798 \uadf8 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc740 \uae68\ub057\ud568\uc744 \uc990\uaca8 \ud558\uc5ec\n\uc815\ud55c \ubaa8\ub798 \ud2c8\uc5d0 \ubfcc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc11c\ub824 \ub450\uace0\n\ubbf8\uc9c4\ub3c4 \uac00\uae4c\uc774 \uc54a\uace0 \uc6b0\ub85c \ubc1b\uc544 \uc0ac\ub290\ub2c8\ub77c\n|\nOrchid\n\nFull sprays of slender leaves\nSeem stiff, but are soft and supple;\nThe stocky purplish stalks\nPut out plain white flowers;\nAnd the dew, turned into glass beads,\nClings to every stem\nInside, its true heart\nDelights in its purity;\nIt twists its roots deep down\nBetween grains of clean white sand;\nFar away from the slightest grime\nIt lives on in the rain and the dew\n|attr1=Yi Py\u01d2nggi (1891\u20131968)|attr2=Richard Rutt (260)}}\n\nThis poem was written by Yi Py\u01d2nggi (1891\u20131968), who was a well known author and encouraged the creation of ''sijo''. His work is referred to as gentle. This poem, \"Orchid\", has a traditional moral approach about flowers and is maintained in a modern idiom (Rutt, 260). Yi Py\u01d2nggi was the father of ''sijo'' and came up with the three variants consisting of ''ossijo'', ''sasol'', and ''yon-sijo''. He mentioned that ''sijo'' should convey modern life by the extension of the structure from the conventional single stanza to two or more.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Examples==\n''Sijo'', unlike some other East Asian poetic forms, frequently employs metaphors, puns, allusions and similar word play. Most poets follow these guidelines very closely although there are longer examples.

Following is the first verse from the Spring sequence; notice the added refrains in lines 2 and 4.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nSun lights up the hill behind, mist rises on the channel ahead.\n''Push the boat, push the boat!''\nThe night tide has gone out, the morning tide is coming in.\n''Jigukchong, jigukchong, eosawa!''\nUntamed flowers along the shore reach out to the far village.\n</poem>}}\n\nEither narrative or thematic, this lyric verse introduces a situation or problem in line 1, development (called a turn) in line 2, and a strong conclusion beginning with a surprise (a twist) in line 3, which resolves tensions or questions raised by the other lines and provides a memorable ending.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nWhere pure snow flakes melt\nDark clouds gather threatening\nWhere are the spring flowers abloom?\nA lonely figure lost in the shadow\nof sinking sun, I have no place to go.\n</poem>|[[Yi Saek]] (1328\u20131395), on the decline of [[Goryeo]] Kingdom.}}\n\nKorean poetry can be traced at least as far back as 17 BC with [[Yuri of Goguryeo|King Yuri's]] ''Song of Yellow Birds'' but its roots are in earlier Korean culture (op. cit., Rutt, 1998, \"Introduction\"). ''Sijo'', Korea's favorite poetic genre, is often traced to [[Confucian]] monks of the eleventh century, but its roots, too, are in those earlier forms. One of its peaks occurred as late as the 16th and 17th centuries under the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. One poem of the ''sijo'' genre is from the 14th century:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe spring breeze melted snow on the hills then quickly disappeared.\nI wish I could borrow it briefly to blow over my hair\nAnd melt away the aging frost forming now about my ears.\n</poem>|U Tak (1262\u20131342)}}\n\n''Sijo'' is, first and foremost, a [[song]]. This lyric pattern gained popularity in royal courts amongst the ''yangban'' as a vehicle for [[religious]] or [[philosophical]] expression, but a parallel tradition arose among the commoners. ''Sijo'' were sung or chanted with musical accompaniment, and this tradition survives. The word originally referred only to the music, but it has come to be identified with the lyrics.\n{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|\n{{lang|ko|\ub3d9\uc9c0\ub2ec \uae30\ub098\uae34 \ubc24\uc744 \ud55c \ud5c8\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc84\ud600 \ub0b4\uc5ec\n\ucd98\ud48d \uc774\ubd88 \uc544\ub798 \uc11c\ub9ac\ud5c8\ub9ac \ub123\uc5c8\ub2e4\uac00\n\uc5b4\ub978 \ub2d8 \uc624\uc2e0 \ub0a0 \ubc24\uc774\uc5ec\ub4dc\ub780 \uad6c\ubd80\uad6c\ube44 \ud3b4\ub9ac\ub77c}}\n|attr1=[[Hwang Jin-i]] (1522\u20131565)<br />A famous female Korean sijo poet who was also a [[kisaeng]],<br />a professional entertainer.|\nI will break the back of this long, midwinter night,\nFolding it double, cold beneath my spring quilt,\nThat I may draw out the night, should my love return.}}\n\nNote: The English adaptations of verses by Yun Seondo and U Tak are by Larry Gross (op. cit.) The English adaptation of the verse by Hwang Jin-i is by David R. McCann (op. cit.); Some of the information on the origins of ''sijo'' are cited from The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo, ed. Richard Rutt (U. of Michigan Press, 1998); Kichung Kim's ''An Introduction to Classical Korean Literature: From Hyangga to P'ansori''; and Peter H. Lee.\n\n==In English==\nIn 1986 the journal ''Poet'' dedicated an issue to \"classic\" Korean ''sijo'' translated into English by Korean-American [[Kim Unsong]] (a.k.a. William Kim). This was followed by Kim's ''Classical Korean Poems (Sijo)'' in 1987, ''Sijo by Korean Poets in China'', and ''Poems of Modern Sijo'' (a collection of his originals) in the mid-1990s. They found a devoted audience in American ''theWORDshop'' publisher [[Dr. Larry Gross]] and Canadian haiku poet Elizabeth St. Jacques. As a result, a volume of original English-language ''sijo'' (''Around the Tree of Light'') by St. Jacques appeared and soon after, Gross launched the first issue of ''Sijo West'' with St. Jacques as assistant editor. It was the world's first poetry journal dedicated to English-language ''sijo'' and caught on well with poets dedicated to haiku and other forms of Asian verse.\n\n''Sijo West'' folded in 1999 reportedly due to health problems and tragedies with Gross. St. Jacques reemerged with online postings known as ''Sijo Blossoms'' (circa 2001), which, apparently, has since evolved into the ''Sijo In The Light'' section of her ''Poetry In The Light'' website.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} ''Sijo In The Light'', like the defunct ''Sijo West'', featured original English-language ''sijo'', as well as essays and reviews.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Gross, meanwhile, has maintained a significant presence for ''sijo'' on his website ''Poetry in theWORDshop'', which includes translations from Korean masters as well as original contributions by contemporary poets.

In fact, the earliest existing ''sijo'' was found to have been written towards the end of the 14th century<ref name=\"Rutt4\">{{cite book|title=The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo|author=Richard Rutt |publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1998 |pages=4|isbn=0-472-08558-1}}</ref> as Confucian scholars sought to overcome the existing Buddhist-dominated literary, music, and art forms.<ref>{{cite web |title=\uc2dc\uc870 |url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0032460 |website=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture (\ud55c\uad6d\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc\uc0ac\uc804) |publisher=The Academy of Korean Studies (\ud55c\uad6d\ud559\uc911\uc559\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0) |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> As a result, there are important differences between the ''sijo'' written at the end of the Kory\u014f dynasty and those written in the Chos\u014fn dynasty. The ''sijo'' of the times, mostly written by men of elite status, are very reflective of the contemporary politics; thus, to understand the importance of the themes of Kory\u014f dynasty ''sijo'', it is important to understand the political climate surrounding the poetry. \n\nMuch of the Kory\u014f dynasty was plagued with political strife. In 1170, the military aristocracy seized power from the civil aristocracy. Instability reigned in the government and the countryside for the next 25 years as military leaders plotted against each other and peasants rebelled against landowners and local officers. It was not until 1196 that things stabilized, when [[Choe Chung-heon]] seized power and established rule of the Choe family. Much of his power came from the parallel government he created, which was based on house institutions under his direct control staffed with people personally loyal to him. He also made effective use of ''mun'gaek'', private military retainers of great clans. \n\nKorea then endured repeated Mongol invasions from 1217 to 1258, and from 1270 to 1356, Korea was under Mongol domination. After Korea was liberated from Mongol control, there were still political conflicts on all sides of Kory\u014f. Kory\u014f was consistently under attack from Japanese pirates and Yuan refugees and faced two invasions from the Red Turbans. Finally, the Kory\u014f dynasty ended when Yi Seong-gye rose to power, proclaiming himself as [[King Taejo]] and renaming the state as the Chos\u014fn. This transition was quite violent and unstable, as the crown princes and members of the Wang royal house were reinstated only to be purged, and two factions arose towards the later Kory\u014f era - one whose loyalty to the existing regime continued, another whose loyalty shifted towards the new movement of the Chos\u014fn.\n\nIt was this incident for which the ''sijo'' poems of the late Kory\u014f are most well-known. The most prevalent theme of this era is loyalty to a lost cause<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Kichung |title=An Introduction to Classical Korean Literature: From Hyangga to P'ansori |date=28 Aug 1996 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |location=Armonk, New York |isbn=1-56324-785-2}}</ref>, arising as a reaction to the rise of the new Chos\u014fn dynasty as the most powerful groups of the period struggled with where their loyalties lay. However, exacerbating the situation were the simultaneous struggles of China's Sung dynasty and the ascending Ming dynasty, further conflicting the people's loyalties. Thus, the ensuing confusion and chaos of the times gave way to themes of strong emotions such as regret over aging and sorrow over love, as many sought to express their mixed, complicated thoughts and harken back to the time of peace and stability.\n\nOne of the most famous ''sijo'' poems that demonstrates such political upheavals and tensions of the period is [[Jeong Mong-ju|Ch\u014fng Mongju]]'s ''sijo'', seen below, with the English translation provided by Rutt in ''The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo'':\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThough this frame should die and die, \n          though I die a hundred times,\nMy bleached bones all turn to dust, \n          my very soul exist or not -\nWhat can change the undivided heart \n          that glows with faith toward my lord?\n</poem>}}\n\nCh\u014fng, a great scholar of the time referred to as P'o\u016dn, supposedly wrote this poem in response to Yi Seong-gye's son's suggestion to defect and join the growing Chos\u014fn movement.  The very idea that one's \"undivided heart\" remains loyal to the same despite dying \"a hundred times\" and one's \"bleached bones all turn(ing) to dust\" clearly exhibits the overall sense of honor, integrity, and fidelity that is emblematic of this generation's ''sijo'' poetry. In fact, this poem has become one of the prototypical examples of loyalty in Korea, even possibly one of the best known of all Korean ''sijo'' poems among Koreans. Today, this ''sijo'' has become to be known as the \"Song of a Loyal Heart,\" or the \"Tansim ka.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCann |first1=David |title=A Brief History of Korean Literature to the Nineteenth Century |date=2000 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-50574-1}}</ref>\n\n== Reemergence of the ''sijo'' in the 18th century ==\n''Sijo'' was first written in the 14th century during the end of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty. However, it was not until the [[Joseon]] dynasty that it gained immense popularity. During the rise of the early Joseon dynasty ''sijo'' became very popular among ''[[yangban]]'' and the ruling class. In its earlier stages ''sijo'' was often written in [[classical Chinese]] by ''yangban'' and the ruling class. A lot of the poems used language which showed social hierarchy. It was not accessible to the masses due to it being written in classical Chinese characters. It was also hard to adapt to ''sijo-chang'' (''sijo'' in song form) because of the Chinese characters. \n\nThe 18th century marked two very important events in ''sijo''. The first being the reemergence of the term. The second being the shift from classical or traditional ''sijo'' to modern ''sijo''. During the 18th century, the word ''sijo'' reemerged and with it came changes. ''Sijo'' was now written in Korean and was more accessible to the masses. It was no longer confined to just being a product by and for the ruling class and the ''yangban''. ''Sijo'' was now available, created and performed by the general Korean public. New poems outside of [[Confucian]] ideal and hierarchy were being written and performed. This led to the invention of different forms of ''sijo'' such as ''sasol sijo'', ''ossijo'', and ''yon sijo''. The themes of ''sijo'' expanded and included more than just the narrative of the upper class.\n\nIn early to mid 18th century ''sijo'' reemerged and can be seen as traditional ''sijo''. This is mainly due to the fact that this period signified Korea's isolation to the outside world. After the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] which opened Korea to a foreign nation, ''Sijo'' also shifted to become a modern poetry form. Up until the end of the Joseon dynasty, there was not a singular name for this form of poetry and ''sijo'' was not considered a literary genre. Instead, they were seen as songs and were labeled to signify what type of song it was. For example, it would have names such as ''sijoelga'' or ''sijeoldanga'' due to the situation in which it was a sung source. It was not until late 18th century that the word \"sijo\" reemerged as a literary poetic genre. It was in the 19th century that the movement of the restoration of ''sijo'' began. The activists involved in that movement took the first part of the word ''sijochang'' which historically was sung and kept the word as \"sijo\" to define this literary genre. \n\n== ''Sijo chang'' ==\n''Sijo'' emerged in the late Kory\u014f Period as a performing art and eventually gained popularity through the Chos\u014fn period. Initially, it spread amongst the ''[[yangban]]'', or upper class, and later amongst the commoners. ''Sijo'' was passed down as an oral tradition during this period as a means to preserve the art form. While ''sijo'' encompasses a wide variety of traditional Korean poetry, one specific variation that derives from it is known as ''sijo chang''. One of the most significant differences when comparing standard ''sijo'' with ''sijo chang'' is the presence of musical instruments. ''Sijo chang'' poetry employs the use of various Korean instruments to accompany the vocalist reciting the poem.\n\n''Sijo chang'' is known as \"short song\" because it has slow tunes with long, drawn-out ending pronunciation. For this reason it may also be called \"the slowest song in the world\". It demands a high level of ability and coordination between drummer and performer in order to keep the song flowing well. Throughout each ''sijo'', the singer employs practiced techniques, such as vibrato and pitch changes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Music of Korean|last=|first=|publisher=The national center for Korean traditional performing arts|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nThe singer is accompanied by the ''dae-gum'' (bamboo flute) and the ''chang-gu'' (hour-glass shaped drum). The singer uses a wide range of vibrato in addition to pitch changes. All ''sijo chang'' are sung in a very deliberate pace. The singer must be trained to extend the notes of the song for effect.  Other instruments are used as the background musical support to keep the flow. For instance, the ''piri'' (bamboo oboe), ''taegum'' (transverse flute), ''tanso'' (vertical flute), and ''haegum'' (two-fiddle zither) may also be used to accompany the vocalist. Although a wide variety of instruments may be used as an accompaniment to the ''sijo chang'' vocalist, not all may be used at one time. In more informal settings the ''chang-gu'' may be used as the sole instrument. Oftentimes, the sound of hitting one's lap may also serve as the only instrumental accompaniment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Chinese influences on Korean ''sijo'' ==\n\n''Sijo'' was first written in Chinese because Chinese was the only written language in Korea before Joseon dynasty. The borrowing and usage of Chinese characters can be traced back to the 5th century. With the adoption of Chinese literary exams during the Goryeo dynasty, the usage of Chinese characters became more popular and it lasted for thousands of years until [[King]] Sejong invented [[Hangul]] in the Joseon dynasty. This brought about a close relationship between Korean and Chinese literature.\n\n''Sijo'' was influenced by Chinese [[Tang poetry]] and ''[[jueju]]'' poetry, one kind of Chinese Tang poetry that has four lines, can be found in the three line organization of ''sijo''. In ''jueju'', the first line states the theme; the second line develops the theme; the third line offers a twist or a contrasting idea, and the last line presents a conclusion. In ''sijo'', the first two lines play a similar role to Chinese Tang poetry, but the third line can be considered as a combination of the third and fourth line of Chinese Tang poetry. ''Sijo''{{'s}} first part of the third line gives a twist and the whole third line offers a conclusion.\n\n== Similarities with Tang poetry in themes and expression of emotion ==\n\nThere are many similarities between Korean ''sijo'' poetry and Chinese Tang poetry: the reason that people wrote poems, the messages that they want to deliver, and how they express their feelings by talking about natural things. The following passage shows the translation of [[Kwon Homun]]'s \"The Wind is Pure and Clear\" ({{lang|ko|\ubc14\ub78c\uc740 \uc808\ub85c \ub9d1\uace0}}):\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe wind is pure and clear, the moon is pure and bright.\nThe pine veranda in the bamboo garden is pure of worldly cares.\nBut a lute and piles of scrolls can make it pure still.<ref>''The Bamboo Grove'' by Richard Rutt</ref>\n</poem>}}\n\nThere are only wind, moon, pine, lute and books in the poem. However, Kwon Homun used these to paint a world of himself that he dreams of. For him, a simple life like this is enough, but even this seemly simple life is hard for him to realize. Similarly, Chinese poets in the Tang dynasty also wrote poems in this way and for this reason. Here is the translation of [[Li Bai]]'s \"At the Yellow Crane Tower to Bid Meng Haoran Bon Voyage\" ({{lang|zh|\u9ec4\u9e64\u697c\u9001\u5b5f\u6d69\u7136\u4e4b\u5e7f\u9675}}):\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAt the tower of yellow crane, my friend, to the west, you said goodbye,\nIn this misty, flowery early spring, for [[Yangzhou]] downstream, you ply.\nA speck, a silhouette is your lonely sail, to the verdant receding, till\nIn my eyes, there is only the long, Long River, rolling to the verge of the sky.\n</poem>}}\n\nOn the surface, this poem is about the view and the landscape that Li Bai saw while he was in the tower of yellow crane superficially, but it actually expresses the deep feeling of Li Bai when he was still gazing at the river even though his friend [[Meng Haoran]] has left. The first line gives readers the background and the second line constructs a confused and sorrowful air. In the last two lines, it describes how Li Bai gazed after Meng Haoran and how he felt, metaphorizing his feelings as the Long River. \n\nBy comparing the meanings of these two poems, we know that both Korean ''sijo'' and Chinese Tang poetry often employ natural objects such as landscape, pines, bamboo, plants and flowers in order to express human emotions.\n\n== Authors ==\n\n=== ''Kisaeng'' ===\nThe ''[[Kisaeng]]'' were women who functioned as professional entertainers, performing artists, and courtesans.<ref>McCann, David R. ''Early Korean literature: selections and introductions''. Columbia University Press, 2000.</ref> These women were selected at a young age from the lower class for their beauty and talents; then trained to work for the government performing-arts bureaucracy. Their presence as poets that contributed to the art of ''sijo'' is notable due to their position as lower class women. They were considered barely above beggars due to their association with prostitution.<ref>Edgin, Kayley. \"Hwang Jini: An Examination of Life as a Joseon Kisaeng.\" ''e-Publications@Marquette'', 1 Jan. 2013, epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=dittman.</ref> Since the [[Joseon|Choson period]] was heavily influenced by [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] ideals, social stratification was heavily enforced. ''Kisaeng''{{'}}s ability to create artwork admired by the ''yangban''\u2014upper class men\u2014was remarkable.\n\nMany scholars note that the ''sijos'' written by ''kisaeng'' contain \"a rare blend of emotional freedom, ironic perspective, and technical mastery\"<ref>Contogenis, Constantine, and Wolhee Choe. ''Songs of the Kisaeng: courtesan poetry of the last Korean dynasty''. BOA Editions, 1997.</ref> because they were free of the shackles of societal expectations. Their lower class standing released them from having to conform to themes of nature or filial piety. Therefore, despite the fact that the number of ''kisaeng'' authored ''sijo'' is unknown, their work is heavily associated with love poetry. [[Hwang Jini]] is one of the most notable ''kisaeng'' poets along with [[Yi Maechang]].  \n\n==== In film ====\nThe title of the 2016 film ''[[Love, Lies (2016 film)|Love, Lies]]'' in English refers to a famous ''sijo'':\n{{verse translation|lang=ko|italicsoff=yes|\n\uc0ac\ub791 \uac70\uc99b\ub9d0\uc774 \ub2d8 \ub0a0\uc0ac\ub791 \uac70\uc99b\ub9d0\uc774\n\n\uafc8\uc5d0 \ubd4c\ub2f7 \ub9d0\uc774 \uae14 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac70\uc99b\ub9d0\uc774\n\n\ub0a0\uac00\uce58 \uc7a0 \uc544\ub2c8 \uc624\uba74 \uc5b4\ub2ac \uafc8\uc5d0 \ubd48\ub9ac\uc624\n|\n\"Love.\" It is a lying word.\nThat you love me, another lie.\n\"The loved one is seen in dreams.\"\nThat is still a greater lie,\nHow can I, who can never sleep,\nhope to see you in my dreams? \n}}\n\nThis follows the \"classic format\" of the three line structure and love-longing content. In , the title of the film literally means \"flowers that understand words\",  which refers to a kiseang's ability to understand the desire or need of men. This film give clear facts on the connection between ''sijo'' and ''kiseang''. It also shows on how ''kiseangs'' trained since they were very young, and how they performed ''sijo chang''.\n\n''[[Hwang Jin Yi (film)|Hwang Jin Yi]]'', a 2007 film, gives an introduction to the well-known ''kiseang'' Hwang Jin Yi, and her legendary life.  The film examples give a clear view and introduction about kisaeng. Also, in these films, there is clear description of the well-educated kisaengs' accomplishmenst in literature. As one of the two classes who contributed to the composition the ''sijo'' poems, ''kisaeng'' also leave numbers of memorable sijo poems.\n\n==Modern ''sijo''==\n\n===Emergence of modern ''sijo''===\n \nThere are two established developments of ''sijo'': before 1876 and after. Before 1876 was when traditional ''sijo'' was prevalent and after 1876 modern ''sijo'' was \"so-called\" created<ref name=\"auto\">Ruth, Richard. The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo. Michigan: University of Michigan Press. 1998.</ref> (p.25). ''Sijo'' is a genre of short Korean poems with a strictly defined structure reflecting the rhythm of a traditional Korean song known as [[pansori]]. It originated from Korea in the Kory\u01d2 dynasty which began to flourish in the Chos\u01d2n dynasty. Established with the Confucian ideology, ''sijo'' became the most popular type of poetry among the ruling Confucian scholars and noblemen. During the time, ''sijo'' was sung and recorded by word of mouth or transcribed. ''Sijo'' is an official name of the genre of poems, which came to be in the period of modernism; especially after a movement for the restoration of ''sijo'' that became active in the 19th century. The activists of the movement copied the first part of the name of the music ''sijo chang'' as the term to reference the poetry as it did not previously have a name.\n\n===Structure and comparison to traditional ''sijo''===\n\nModern ''sijo'' is a new form of Korean vernacular poetry (''sijo''). It was emerged in 'The open-door period' (\uac1c\ud654\uae30) (1876) flourished during The Empire of Korea (1897\u20131910), Japanese Colonial Period (1910\u20131945) and is still created today. It refers only written form.\nModern ''sijo'' is generally structured the same as tradition ''sijo'' with a three line poem consisting of clusters of syllables. The difference is that modern ''sijo'' poems do not follow the fixed form as uniformly and are considered to be free verse. In contrast, people believe that ''sijo'' should remain in tune with the rhythm as it was originally to be sung and consider modern ''sijo'' that do not follow the rules as not being ''sijo''<ref name=\"auto1\">Kim, Jaihun. Modern Korean Vers in sijo Form. 1997.</ref> (p. 37) (using the syllabic pentameter: 3 4 4 3/4). There are various methods for implementing or translating modern ''sijo''. It has to have title name of each modern ''sijo''. Another difference is that traditional ''sijo'' is less likely to have a title; while referencing them, the first line of the poem becomes the title. In comparison, modern writers are more likely to give their work a legitimized title. Modern ''sijo'' is still being developed, such as in the case of contemporary poetry, and is written by experts and beginners as writers are not influenced by the class system (Yangban, Kisaeng,.. etc).\n\n===Writers===\n \n* 1920s \u2013 Choi Nam Seon (\ucd5c\ub0a8\uc120), Lee Gwang Soo (\uc774\uad11\uc218), Jeon In Bo (\uc815\uc778\ubcf4)\n* 1926 \u2013 \ucd5c\ub0a8\uc120 established the first book of modern sijos, \ubc31\ud314\ubc88\ub1cc, the 108 passions.\n* 1930s \u2013 Lee Eun Sang (\uc774\uc740\uc0c1), Lee Byeong Gi (\uc774\ubcd1\uae30), Lee Ho Woo (\uc774\ud638\uc6b0) \n\n===Examples===\n{{verse translation|lang=ko|italicsoff=yes|\n\ub09c\ucd08\n\n\ube7c\uc5b4\ub09c \uac00\ub294 \uc78e\uc0c8 \uad73\uc740 \ub4ef \ubcf4\ub4dc\ub78d\uace0\n\uc790\uc90f\ube5b \uad75\uc740 \ub300\uacf5 \ud558\uc580\ud55c \uaf43\uc774 \ubc8c\uace0\n\uc774\uc2ac\uc740 \uad6c\uc2ac\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4 \ub9c8\ub514\ub9c8\ub514 \ub2ec\ub838\ub2e4\n\ubcf8\ub798 \uadf8 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc740 \uae68\ub057\ud568\uc744 \uc990\uaca8 \ud558\uc5ec\n\uc815\ud55c \ubaa8\ub798 \ud2c8\uc5d0 \ubfcc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc11c\ub824 \ub450\uace0\n\ubbf8\uc9c4\ub3c4 \uac00\uae4c\uc774 \uc54a\uace0 \uc6b0\ub85c \ubc1b\uc544 \uc0ac\ub290\ub2c8\ub77c\n|\nOrchid\n\nFull sprays of slender leaves\nSeem stiff, but are soft and supple;\nThe stocky purplish stalks\nPut out plain white flowers;\nAnd the dew, turned into glass beads,\nClings to every stem\nInside, its true heart\nDelights in its purity;\nIt twists its roots deep down\nBetween grains of clean white sand;\nFar away from the slightest grime\nIt lives on in the rain and the dew\n|attr1=Yi Py\u01d2nggi (1891\u20131968)|attr2=Richard Rutt (260)}}\n\nThis poem was written by Yi Py\u01d2nggi (1891\u20131968), who was a well known author and encouraged the creation of ''sijo''. His work is referred to as gentle. This poem, \"Orchid\", has a traditional moral approach about flowers and is maintained in a modern idiom (Rutt, 260). Yi Py\u01d2nggi was the father of ''sijo'' and came up with the three variants consisting of ''ossijo'', ''sasol'', and ''yon-sijo''. He mentioned that ''sijo'' should convey modern life by the extension of the structure from the conventional single stanza to two or more.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Examples==\n''Sijo'', unlike some other East Asian poetic forms, frequently employs metaphors, puns, allusions and similar word play. Most poets follow these guidelines very closely although there are longer examples.

''Sijo'', Korea's favorite poetic genre, is often traced to [[Confucian]] monks of the eleventh century, but its roots, too, are in those earlier forms. One of its peaks occurred as late as the 16th and 17th centuries under the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. One poem of the ''sijo'' genre is from the 14th century:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe spring breeze melted snow on the hills then quickly disappeared.\nI wish I could borrow it briefly to blow over my hair\nAnd melt away the aging frost forming now about my ears.\n</poem>|U Tak (1262\u20131342)}}\n\n''Sijo'' is, first and foremost, a [[song]]. This lyric pattern gained popularity in royal courts amongst the ''yangban'' as a vehicle for [[religious]] or [[philosophical]] expression, but a parallel tradition arose among the commoners. ''Sijo'' were sung or chanted with musical accompaniment, and this tradition survives. The word originally referred only to the music, but it has come to be identified with the lyrics.\n{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|\n{{lang|ko|\ub3d9\uc9c0\ub2ec \uae30\ub098\uae34 \ubc24\uc744 \ud55c \ud5c8\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc84\ud600 \ub0b4\uc5ec\n\ucd98\ud48d \uc774\ubd88 \uc544\ub798 \uc11c\ub9ac\ud5c8\ub9ac \ub123\uc5c8\ub2e4\uac00\n\uc5b4\ub978 \ub2d8 \uc624\uc2e0 \ub0a0 \ubc24\uc774\uc5ec\ub4dc\ub780 \uad6c\ubd80\uad6c\ube44 \ud3b4\ub9ac\ub77c}}\n|attr1=[[Hwang Jin-i]] (1522\u20131565)<br />A famous female Korean sijo poet who was also a [[kisaeng]],<br />a professional entertainer.|\nI will break the back of this long, midwinter night,\nFolding it double, cold beneath my spring quilt,\nThat I may draw out the night, should my love return.}}\n\nNote: The English adaptations of verses by Yun Seondo and U Tak are by Larry Gross (op. cit.) The English adaptation of the verse by Hwang Jin-i is by David R. McCann (op. cit.); Some of the information on the origins of ''sijo'' are cited from The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo, ed. Richard Rutt (U. of Michigan Press, 1998); Kichung Kim's ''An Introduction to Classical Korean Literature: From Hyangga to P'ansori''; and Peter H. Lee.\n\n==In English==\nIn 1986 the journal ''Poet'' dedicated an issue to \"classic\" Korean ''sijo'' translated into English by Korean-American [[Kim Unsong]] (a.k.a. William Kim). This was followed by Kim's ''Classical Korean Poems (Sijo)'' in 1987, ''Sijo by Korean Poets in China'', and ''Poems of Modern Sijo'' (a collection of his originals) in the mid-1990s. They found a devoted audience in American ''theWORDshop'' publisher [[Dr. Larry Gross]] and Canadian haiku poet Elizabeth St. Jacques. As a result, a volume of original English-language ''sijo'' (''Around the Tree of Light'') by St. Jacques appeared and soon after, Gross launched the first issue of ''Sijo West'' with St. Jacques as assistant editor. It was the world's first poetry journal dedicated to English-language ''sijo'' and caught on well with poets dedicated to haiku and other forms of Asian verse.\n\n''Sijo West'' folded in 1999 reportedly due to health problems and tragedies with Gross. St. Jacques reemerged with online postings known as ''Sijo Blossoms'' (circa 2001), which, apparently, has since evolved into the ''Sijo In The Light'' section of her ''Poetry In The Light'' website.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} ''Sijo In The Light'', like the defunct ''Sijo West'', featured original English-language ''sijo'', as well as essays and reviews.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Gross, meanwhile, has maintained a significant presence for ''sijo'' on his website ''Poetry in theWORDshop'', which includes translations from Korean masters as well as original contributions by contemporary poets.

The song \"What's a Girl to Do?\" from this album was included in the [[Ladytron]] compilation ''[[Softcore Jukebox]]'' in 2003, and has been claimed by critic [[Richie Unterberger]] as \"arguably her signature track\".<ref name=Billboard/> The album was re-released in 2004 with six bonus tracks, two of which were produced (and one co-written) by [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cristina \u2014 Sleep It Off |url=https://www.discogs.com/Cristina-Sleep-It-Off/release/554612 |website=Discogs.com |accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> In 2005, she collaborated with New York musician [[Alex Gimeno]] aka Ursula 10000 on the track \"Urgent/Anxious\" off his ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'' album. \n\nShe later contributed learned essays and reviews to publications such as London's ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' while battling autoimmune disorders, including [[relapsing polychondritis]].<ref name=npr/><ref name=\"queen\" /><ref name=\"caramanica\"/> Her two albums for ZE were reissued in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/1934|title=Dusted Reviews \u2013 Cristina|website=Dustedmagazine.com|access-date=October 20, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021203442/http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/1934|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://apolarisview.wordpress.com/2020/04/10/cristina-edgy-star-of-new-york-new-wave/ | title=Cristina, edgy star of New York new-wave\n| publisher=Apolarisview | date=April 10, 2020 | accessdate= April 11, 2020}}</ref> after Michael Esteban revived the label.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCristina Monet Palaci married [[Michael Zilkha]].
