(TSE) is a [[guide dog]] school located in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], in the United States. Founded in 1929, the Seeing Eye is the oldest, and one of the largest, of guide dog schools in the U.S.  The Seeing Eye campus in Morristown includes administrative offices, dormitory residence for students, a veterinary care center, and kennels; there is also a breeding station in Chester, NJ. The Seeing Eye, a founding member of the U.S. Council of Guide Dog Schools and a fully accredited member of the International Guide Dog Federation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.igdf.org.uk/|title=International Guide Dog Federation Home Page|website=www.igdf.org.uk}}</ref> is a lead researcher in canine genetics, breeding, disease control, and behavior.<ref name=\"seeingeye1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seeingeye.org/|title=The Seeing Eye - Homepage|website=www.seeingeye.org}}</ref>\n\nWhile \"Seeing Eye dog\" has become [[Generic trademark|genericized]] as a term for guide dogs, it is a trademark.  The Seeing Eye, Inc., owns the registered trademark \"The Seeing Eye\" (registration number 2,165,163, registered June 16, 1998), and claims that only dogs from The Seeing Eye school in Morristown, N.J., can be called Seeing Eye dogs.\n\n==History==\nThe history of The Seeing Eye began in Europe in the 1920s when [[Dorothy Harrison Eustis]] moved to [[Vevey]], Switzerland, from the United States to set up a breeding and training facility for [[German shepherds]]. Eustis bred and trained police dogs to be intelligent, strong, and responsible. Elliott S. \"Jack\" Humphrey was an American trainer and geneticist who helped Eustis train and develop their own scientific approach to breeding and training.<ref>Putnam, pp. 12-14.</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Elliott Humphrey, 92; pioneered in tutoring of guide dogs in U.S. | newspaper=New York Times | date=June 11, 1981 | last=Treaster | first=Joseph B. | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/11/obituaries/elliott-humphrey-92-pioneered-in-tutoring-of-guide-dogs-in-us.html | access-date=December 16, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], many German soldiers were blinded or visually impaired due to the war, so several schools in Germany began experimenting with guide dogs that were taught specific skills. Eustis learned about these schools and was impressed. She wrote an article for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. The article, \"The Seeing Eye,\" was published on November 5, 1927.  Eustis began receiving countless letters from people who were blind, asking how to obtain a guide dog.<ref>Putnam, pp. 19-25</ref> \n\nHer article was read to [[Morris Frank]], a 19-year-old blind man from [[Nashville]], Tennessee. Frank, who had been blinded in two separate accidents, believed a guide dog would help him regain his independence. Eustis received his letter and although she did not train dogs for the blind, she decided to help Frank. Frank stated that, in addition to wanting a guide dog, he intended to further the work of training guide dogs for the blind in the U.S.<ref>Putnam, pp. 25-28</ref> Eustis and Humphrey began to research and modify their own training, as they hitherto trained other types of working dogs, but not guide dogs.<ref>Putnam, p. 31</ref> In April 1928, Frank met his first guide dog, named Kiss.  He changed her name to Buddy and named all his future Seeing Eye dogs (he had six in total) Buddy. The name is now retired by The Seeing Eye. Frank and Buddy went through six weeks of training that not only created a strong bond, but also taught them to work as a team to navigate busy streets, dangerous obstacles, stairways, crowded shops, and anything that was a danger for Frank. On January 29, 1929, Eustis and Frank established The Seeing Eye in Frank\u2019s hometown of Nashville. \n\nAt first, the American public was apprehensive about the idea of a dog guiding the blind and joining people in public places. Morris Frank and Buddy traveled the U.S. acting as ambassadors for the cause. They opened doors to access for people with disabilities and service dogs.\n\nThe first class was held in February 1929, and after several successful graduates were able to demonstrate the usefulness of a guide dog, people started to accept the idea. [[Mary Dranga Campbell]] became the head of the social service division in 1934 and retired 11 years later. The Seeing Eye moved to [[Whippany, New Jersey]] in 1930, establishing a permanent location for training and student housing.<ref>Putnam, pp. 131-132</ref> In 1965, the organization moved to its current 60-acre campus in [[Morris Township, NJ]], which includes administrative offices, student residences, a veterinary clinic and kennels.\n\nSince 1929, more than 16,000 partnerships have been created between Seeing Eye dogs and people who are blind and visually impaired from the United States and Canada. The Seeing Eye is a [[non-profit organization]] and is funded through private donations. It was the first guide dog school outside of Europe, and is the oldest existing guide dog school in the world. In 2014, The Seeing Eye celebrated its 85th anniversary.<ref>Images of America: The Seeing Eye by Steve Swanbeck</ref> In 2020, the Seeing Eye Dog was designated as the state dog of New Jersey.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seeingeye.org/press/press-releases/seeing-eye-dog-designated.html|title=Seeing Eye\u00ae Dog Designated State Dog of New Jersey|date=January 21, 2020|work=The Seeing Eye Press Release|access-date=March 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Breeds==\nIn 2001, The Seeing Eye built a breeding station on 330 acres in Chester, New Jersey, in which it houses adult breeding dogs and puppies until they are 7 weeks old.

From there, they will move to Morristown, where the dog will learn how to mind up and down curbs, be wary of traffic, obtain spatial awareness, and respond promptly to directional commands. Once the dogs have mastered Morristown, they are brought to New York City to train in a more intense environment. <ref name=\"nyt110618\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/nyregion/guide-dogs-blind.html|title=A Final Proving Ground for Guide Dogs to the Blind: Midtown Manhattan|last1=Kilgannon|first1=Corey|date=November 6, 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe important aspect of formal training is for the dogs to respond and understand directional commands. The dogs will learn how to safely cross the street, stop at curbs, stop or guide their owner through obstacles and overhead obstacles also known as clearance. <ref name=\":0\" /> They continue to practice commands such as forward, sit, down, and rest that they learned with their former puppy raising family as well as new commands such as heel.<ref name=\":1\" /> Once the formal training is completed and the dogs have successfully graduated, they are then partnered up with their new owner based on pull, dependability, and personality.

The tax ID number is 22-1539721. <ref name=\"seeingeye1\" />\n\n==Applying for a Seeing Eye Dog==\nThe applicant, also known as the student, goes through a screening process, which may take 60 to 90 days. The evaluations are based on amount of residual vision, and each applicant must be at least 16 years of age, have independent travel skills, have physical mobility, have appropriate living conditions, have sufficient hearing ability, and have an appropriate plan for use of the dog. Before the applicant is matched with their dog, the dog must return from the puppy raiser and then complete a four-month training program by an instructor. After the applicant is accepted, the dog will be matched with an appropriate student and together will train at The Seeing Eye. For first time students training sessions will take 25 days, however, for returning students the session will take 18 days. After the training is successfully completed and the student and their dog have graduated, the student receives full ownership of the Seeing Eye dog. The students will have support for a lifetime whether they need advice, have issues, or even require an instructor to assist them. Seeing Eye instructors made 792 follow up visits with graduates in 2011. The Seeing Eye is the only guide dog school that gives full ownership rights to the graduates. Seeing Eye dogs will work approximately seven to eight years. Seeing Eye dogs that are retired will be kept as pets or returned to The Seeing Eye.\n\nThe fee charged to students (which includes transportation from anywhere in the U.S. and Canada, room and board, equipment, training, life-time follow-up service, and the dog) has remained unchanged since it was established in the early 1930s: New students pay $150, returning students pay $50, and military veterans pay $1. Students can pay the fee over any time period and no student has ever been turned away due to the inability to pay. \n\nThere are currently 1,720 Seeing Eye dog users in the United States and Canada while 16,000 and more partnerships between individuals and dogs have been made since 1929.<ref name=\"seeingeye1\"></ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of guide dog schools]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n|last=Putnam|first=Peter Brock\n|title=Love in the Lead: The Miracle of the Seeing Eye Dog\n|year=1997\n|edition=2nd\n|publisher=University Press of America\n|isbn=0-7618-0777-2\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.seeingeye.org/ Official website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seeing Eye, The}}\n[[Category:Assistance dogs]]\n[[Category:Dog organizations]]\n[[Category:1929 establishments in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Morristown, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Education in Morris County, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1929]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the guide dog school|the 1951 documentary film about this school|The Seeing Eye (film)}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Seeing Eye|Seeing I|All-seeing eye (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Primary sources|date=February 2016}}\n{{Third-party | date = March 2020}}\n{{Overly detailed | date = March 2020}}\n}}\n\n\n\n{{infobox organization\n\n|image=WASHINGTON_VALLEY_HISTORIC_DISTRICT,_MORRIS_COUNTY.jpg\n| logo=File:Seeingeye.png\n\n|location=[[Morristown, New Jersey]], US\n}}\n'''The Seeing Eye''', Inc.

The dogs will learn how to safely cross the street, stop at curbs, stop or guide their owner through obstacles and overhead obstacles also known as clearance. <ref name=\":0\" /> They continue to practice commands such as forward, sit, down, and rest that they learned with their former puppy raising family as well as new commands such as heel.<ref name=\":1\" /> Once the formal training is completed and the dogs have successfully graduated, they are then partnered up with their new owner based on pull, dependability, and personality. From there, the person being matched with the dog will then have ownership of the dog, but can receive help from The Seeing Eye at any point in the partnership if needed. The Seeing Eye is one of the few guide dog schools that gives the graduates ownership of the dog upon graduation.<ref name=\":2\">\"Your support puts miracles in motion.\" The Seeing Eye, Inc. 2012.

Print.</ref>\n\n== Financials ==\nThe Seeing Eye is a non-profit organization and its services are not covered by insurance. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Seeing Eye, Inc. is a registered United States nonprofit under IRS section 501(c)(3) with tax ID number 22-1539721. <ref name=\"seeingeye1\" />\n\n==Applying for a Seeing Eye Dog==\nThe applicant, also known as the student, goes through a screening process, which may take 60 to 90 days. The evaluations are based on amount of residual vision, and each applicant must be at least 16 years of age, have independent travel skills, have physical mobility, have appropriate living conditions, have sufficient hearing ability, and have an appropriate plan for use of the dog. Before the applicant is matched with their dog, the dog must return from the puppy raiser and then complete a four-month training program by an instructor. After the applicant is accepted, the dog will be matched with an appropriate student and together will train at The Seeing Eye. For first time students training sessions will take 25 days, however, for returning students the session will take 18 days. After the training is successfully completed and the student and their dog have graduated, the student receives full ownership of the Seeing Eye dog. The students will have support for a lifetime whether they need advice, have issues, or even require an instructor to assist them. Seeing Eye instructors made 792 follow up visits with graduates in 2011. The Seeing Eye is the only guide dog school that gives full ownership rights to the graduates. Seeing Eye dogs will work approximately seven to eight years. Seeing Eye dogs that are retired will be kept as pets or returned to The Seeing Eye.\n\nThe fee charged to students (which includes transportation from anywhere in the U.S. and Canada, room and board, equipment, training, life-time follow-up service, and the dog) has remained unchanged since it was established in the early 1930s: New students pay $150, returning students pay $50, and military veterans pay $1. Students can pay the fee over any time period and no student has ever been turned away due to the inability to pay. \n\nThere are currently 1,720 Seeing Eye dog users in the United States and Canada while 16,000 and more partnerships between individuals and dogs have been made since 1929.<ref name=\"seeingeye1\"></ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of guide dog schools]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n|last=Putnam|first=Peter Brock\n|title=Love in the Lead: The Miracle of the Seeing Eye Dog\n|year=1997\n|edition=2nd\n|publisher=University Press of America\n|isbn=0-7618-0777-2\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.seeingeye.org/ Official website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seeing Eye, The}}\n[[Category:Assistance dogs]]\n[[Category:Dog organizations]]\n[[Category:1929 establishments in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Morristown, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Education in Morris County, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1929]]\n", "name_user": "Anamaria.roafs", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFinancials", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seeing_Eye"}

The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

Sun Tzu, (544 - 498 BC), a military strategist, wrote of the superior power of political warfare in battle.]]\n{{War}}\n\n'''Political warfare''' is the use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will, based on hostile intent.  The term political describes the calculated interaction between a government and a target audience to include another state's government, military, and/or general population.  Governments use a variety of techniques to coerce certain actions, thereby gaining relative advantage over an opponent.  The techniques include [[propaganda]] and [[psychological operations]] (PSYOP), which service national and military objectives respectively.  Propaganda has many aspects and a hostile and coercive political purpose.  Psychological operations are for strategic and tactical military objectives and may be intended for hostile military and civilian populations.<ref>Smith, Paul A., On Political War (Washington: National Defense University Press, 1989), p. 7</ref>\n\nPolitical warfare's coercive nature leads to weakening or destroying an opponent's political, social, or societal will, and forcing a course of action favorable to a state's interest.  Political war may be combined with violence, [[economic pressure]], [[subversion]], and [[diplomacy]], but its chief aspect is \"the use of words, images and ideas\".<ref>Smith, p. 3.</ref>  The creation, deployment, and continuation of these coercive methods are a function of statecraft for nations and serve as a potential substitute for more direct military action.<ref>Smith, p. 5</ref>  For instance, methods like economic sanctions or embargoes are intended to inflict the necessary economic damage to force political change.  The utilized methods and techniques in political war depend on the state's political vision and composition.  Conduct will differ according to whether the state is totalitarian, authoritative, or democratic.<ref>Smith, p.12</ref>\n\nThe ultimate goal of political warfare is to alter an opponent's opinions and actions in favour of one state's interests without utilizing military power.  This type of organized persuasion or coercion also has the practical purpose of saving lives through eschewing the use of violence in order to further political goals.  Thus, political warfare also involves \"the art of heartening friends and disheartening enemies, of gaining help for one's cause and causing the abandonment of the enemies'\".<ref>Codevilla, Angelo and Paul Seabury, War: Ends and Means (Washington, DC: Potomac Books, Inc., 2006), p. 151.</ref>  Generally, political warfare is distinguished by its hostile intent and through potential escalation; but the loss of life is an accepted consequence.\n\n==Tools==\n\n===Peaceful===\n\nPolitical warfare utilizes all instruments short of war available to a nation to achieve its national objectives.  The best tool of political warfare is \"effective policy forcefully explained\",<ref name=\"auto\">Codevilla and Seabury, p. 157</ref> or more directly, \"overt policy forcefully backed\".<ref>Angelo M. Codevilla, \"Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends,\" in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008), 218.</ref>  But political warfare is used, as one leading thinker on the topic has explained, \"when public relations statements and gentle, [[public diplomacy]]-style persuasion \u2013 the policies of '[[soft power]]' \u2013 fail to win the needed sentiments and actions\"  around the world.<ref>J. Michael Waller, \"Getting Serious About Strategic Influence,\" ''The Journal of International Security Affairs'' 17 (Fall 2009): 24.</ref>  \nThe major way political warfare is waged is through propaganda.  The essence of these operations can be either overt or covert.  \"White\" or overt propaganda comes from a known source.  \"Gray\" propaganda, on the other hand, is the \"semiofficial amplification of a government's voice\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Liberty]] are examples of \"gray\" propaganda during the Cold War. \"Black\" propaganda, however, is propaganda which originates from an unknown source.  The key to black propaganda is the fact that it most often \"appears to come from a disinterested source when in fact it does not\".<ref>Codevilla, p. 219.</ref>\n\nThere are channels which can be used to transmit propaganda.  Sophisticated use of technology allows to disseminate information to a vast number of people. The most basic channel is the spoken word.  This can include live speeches or radio and television broadcasts.  Overt or covert radio broadcasting can be an especially useful tool.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}  The printed word is also very powerful, including pamphlets, leaflets, books, magazines, political cartoons, and planted newspaper articles (clandestine or otherwise).  Subversion, agents of influence, spies, journalists, and \"[[useful idiot]]s\" can all be used as powerful tools in political warfare.<ref>Codevilla, p. 220.</ref>\n\n===Aggressive===\n[[Image:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|left|Soviet expansion: Formation of the Eastern Bloc]]\n\nPolitical warfare also includes aggressive activities by one actor to offensively gain relative advantage or control over another. Between nation states, it can end in the seizure of power or in the open assimilation of the victimized state into the political system or power complex of the aggressor. This aggressor-victim relationship has also been seen between rivals within a state and may involve tactics like [[assassination]], paramilitary activity, [[sabotage]], [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], [[insurgency]], [[revolution]], [[guerrilla warfare]], and [[civil war]].\n\n*'''Foreign infiltration or liberation''' occurs when a government is overthrown by foreign military or diplomatic intervention, or through covert means.  The campaign's ultimate purpose is to gain control over another nation's political and social structure. The campaign could be led by the aggressor's national forces or by a political faction favorable to the aggressor within the other state. Paul M. Blackstock describes three stages involved in the extension of control by the aggressor over the victim:<ref>Blackstock, Paul W. The strategy of subversion: Manipulating the politics of other nations (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1964),</ref>\n#'''Penetration or infiltration:''' the deliberate infiltration of political and social groups within a victim state by the aggressor with the ultimate purpose of extending influence and control. The aggressor conceals its endgame, which goes beyond the normal influential nature of diplomacy and involves espionage.<ref name=\"auto1\">Blackstock, p. 44.</ref>\n#'''Forced disintegration or atomization:''' \"is the breakdown of the political and social structure of the victim until the fabric of national morale disintegrates and the state is unable to resist further intervention\". The aggressor may exploit the inevitable internal tensions between political, class, ethnic, religious, racial, and other groups.<ref>Blackstock, p.50.</ref>  This concept is a similar strategy to 'divide and conquer'.\n#'''Subversion and defection:''' Subversion is the \"undermining or detachment of the loyalties of significant political and social groups within the victimized state, and their transference to the political or ideological causes of the aggressor\".<ref>Blackstock, p.56.</ref> In lieu of total and direct transference, the aggressor may accept intermediate states that still meets its objectives, such as the favor of politically significant individuals. Furthermore, the formation of a counter-elite, made up of influential individuals and key leaders, within the victim state establishes the legitimacy and permanency of a new regime. Defection is the transference of allegiance of key individuals and leaders to the aggressor's camp. The individual could relocate or stay-in-place in the victim country, continually influencing local issues and events in the aggressor's favor. Defectors also provide insider information to the aggressor.<ref>Blackstock, p.61.</ref>\n\n*'''[[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]''' is the overthrowing of a government through the infiltration of the political, military, and social groups by a small segment of the state apparatus. The small segment exists within the state and targets the critical political levers of power within a government to neutralize opposition to the coup and post-coup governing force. Several pre-existing factors are necessary for a coup:<ref>Luttwak, p. 32-56</ref> political participation being limited to a small portion of the population, independence from foreign power influence and control, and power and decision-making authority concentrated within a political center and not diffused between regional authorities, businesses, or other groups.\nA coup utilizes political resources to gain support within the existing state and neutralize or immobilize those who are capable of rallying against the coup. A successful coup occurs rapidly and after taking over the government, stabilizes the situation by controlling communications and mobility. Furthermore, a new government must gain acceptance from the public and military and administrative structures, by reducing the sense of insecurity. Ultimately, the new government will seek legitimacy in the eyes of its own people as well as seek foreign recognition.<ref>Luttwak, p. 174</ref> The coup d'\u00e9tat can be led by national forces or involve foreign influence, similar to foreign liberation or infiltration.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n*'''Paramilitary Operations:''' transitional political warfare ranging from small-scale use of violence with primitive organizational structure (e.g. sabotage) to full-scale conventional war. The transition and escalation includes a series of stages and depends on tactical and strategic objectives. Paramilitary activities include infiltration and subversion as well as small group operations, insurrection, and civil war.<ref>Smith, p.4.</ref>\n*'''[[Insurgency]]:'''  an organized, protracted political warfare tool designed to weaken the control and eliminate the legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority.<ref>US Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual FM 3-24 (Department of the Army, December 2006), p. 13.</ref> An insurgency is an internal conflict, and the primary struggle is to mobilize local populations for political control and gain popular support towards the insurgents' cause.<ref>US Army, p.20.</ref> Insurgencies include political and military objectives, with the end goal of establishing a legitimate, rival state structure.<ref>Luttwak, p.26.</ref> Insurgencies are unconventional military conflicts which incorporate a variety of methods, ranging from coercive tools like intimidation and assassination, to political tools like propaganda and social services. An insurgency's approaches and objectives could involve perpetual disorder and violence demonstrating the government's inability to provide security for the populace, weakening the government and killing or intimidating any effective opposition against the government, intimidating the population and discouraging its participation in \u2013 or support for \u2013 political or legal processes, controlling or intimidating police and military forces (which limits their ability to respond to insurgent attacks) or by creating government repression by provoking over-reactions by security or military forces.<ref>US Army, p.18,33.</ref>\n\n==In antiquity==\n[[Image:As-Constantine-XR RIC vII 019.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A coin of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] (c.337) showing a depiction of his labarum spearing a serpent.]]\n[[File:Tetradrachm Ptolemaeus I obverse CdM Paris FGM2157.jpg|thumb|right| [[Alexander the Great]] silver [[tetradrachm]].]]\n[[Image:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|The [[Chi-Rho]] symbol]]\n\nThe history of political warfare can be traced to antiquity.  The Chinese general and strategist [[Sun Tzu]] captures its essence in the ancient Chinese military strategy book, ''[[The Art of War]]'': \"So to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; the highest excellence is to subdue the enemy's army without fighting at all...The expert in using the military subdues the enemy's forces without going to battle, takes the enemy's walled cities without launching an attack, and crushes the enemy's state without protracted war.\"<ref>Carr, Caleb, The Book of War:  Sun Tzu The Art of Warfare and Karl Von Clausewitz On War (New York: The Modern Library, 2000), p. 79.</ref>\n\nThere are abundant examples of political warfare in antiquity.  In [[ancient Greece]], a famous example is that of the [[Trojan Horse]], which used deception for tactical military objectives.  Propaganda was commonly utilized, including Greek rhetoric and theatre which used words and images to influence populations throughout the Hellenic world.  This practice has left a lasting legacy of speech as a mechanism of political power, greater than force in solving disputes and inducing submission.<ref>Smith, p. 35.</ref>  During this same period, [[Alexander the Great]] used coinage imprinted with his own image, indirectly forcing conquered nations to accept his legitimacy as national ruler and to unite disparate nations together under his dominion.<ref>Smith, p. 38.</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Rome]] utilized similar political warfare as the Greeks including rhetoric, as displayed by Cicero; and art, as seen in coinage, statues, architecture, engineering, and mosaics.  All of these elements were intended to portray Rome's imperial dominance over its subject nations and the superior nature of Roman society.<ref>Smith, p. 39.</ref>  Following a religious vision, the emperor [[Constantine I]] in AD 330 bound the Roman state to the universal [[Christian Church]].  In doing so, he linked \"religious commitment with imperial ambition\" that proved to be quite successful and powerful.<ref>Smith, p. 43.</ref>  One long-lasting symbol of this is the [[Chi Rho]], which forms the first two letters of the Greeks' name for [[Christ]].  This symbol was used for over one thousand years by Constantine's successors as a symbol of \"imperial majesty and divine authority\"<ref>Smith, p. 42.</ref> and still is a powerful symbol within [[Christianity]].\n\n==By country==\n===United States===\n\n====Creation of political warfare capacity====\n[[Image:US-MarshallPlanAid-Logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo used on aid delivered to European countries during the [[Marshall Plan]].]]\n\n[[American foreign policy]] demonstrates a tendency to move towards political warfare in times of tension and perceived threat, and toward public diplomacy in times of improved relations and peace.  American use of political warfare depends on its central political vision of the world and its subsequent foreign policy objectives.<ref>Smith, p.21</ref>  After World War II, the threat of Soviet expansion brought two new aims for American political warfare:\n#To restore Western Europe through military, economic, and political support\n#To weaken the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe through propaganda<ref>Smith, p. 192.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Harry S. Truman]] established a government political warfare capability in the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. The act created the [[U.S. National Security Council]], which became the infrastructure necessary to apply military power to political purposes.<ref>Smith, p.196.</ref>  Additionally, the United States crafted the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided funding to rebuild, from 1947 to 1951, the European countries devastated by war.  President Truman voiced the United States' national, universalist vision for political warfare against the Soviet Union in an address before Congress on March 12, 1947, thereby establishing the [[Truman Doctrine]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that in a number of other countries there have been similar developments.<br />\nOne way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.<br />\nThe second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio; fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. <br />\nI believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.<br />\nI believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.<br />\nI believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes. <br />\nThe seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive.<br />\nThe free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms.<br />\nIf we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world \u2013 and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation.<ref>President Harry S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress, March 12, 1947, (Avalon Project, [[Yale Law School]]), [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/trudoc.asp Yale.edu]</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\n====Containment policy====\n\nThe Truman Doctrine was the post-WWII basis for American political warfare operations on which the United States government went further to formulate an active, defensive strategy to contain the Soviet threat.<ref>Smith, p.192.</ref>  On 4 May 1948, [[George F. Kennan]], the father of the [[containment policy]], wrote the Policy Planning Staff Memorandum titled [http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/65ciafounding3.htm \"The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare\"].  This [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) memo established a directorate of political warfare operations, under the control of the NSC, known as the Consultative (or Evaluation) Board of the National Security Council.  This directorate fell under the authority of the Secretary of State, while the Board had complete authority over covert political operations.  It recognized political warfare as one instrument in the United States' grand strategy.  Kennan defined 'political warfare' as \"the employment of all means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.  Such actions are both overt and covert.  They range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures (such as ERP \u2013 the Marshall Plan), and 'white' propaganda to such covert operations as clandestine support of 'friendly' foreign elements, 'black' psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground resistance in hostile states.\"<br />\n\nThe memo further defined four projects that were activated by the Board to combat growing Communist influence abroad, including:\n*'''Liberation Committees:''' to encourage the formation of a public American organization which will sponsor selected political refugee committees to give support and guidance to national movements gestating in the Soviet World;\n*'''Support of indigenous anti-communist elements:''' within threatened countries of the free world, to include covertly using private intermediaries;\n*'''Underground activities behind the Iron Curtain'''\n*'''Preventive direct action in free countries:''' only in cases of dire necessity.  This covert operation involved: control over anti-sabotage activities in the Venezuelan oil fields, American sabotage of Near Eastern oil installations on the verge of Soviet capture, and designation of key individuals threatened by the Kremlin who should be protected or removed elsewhere.\n\n====Cold War era====\n[[Image:RFE logoFC wiki.jpg|thumb|[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]] logo]]\n{{Further|Cold War}}\nThe United States used gray and black propaganda research, broadcasting, and print media operations during the Cold War to achieve its political warfare goals.  These operations were conducted against Eastern European targets from Western Europe by two public-private organizations supported partly by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the NSC, and partly by private corporations.  These organizations were Free Europe, which was launched in 1941 and targeted Eastern Europe, and the American Committee for Liberation (AmComLib) created in 1951 to broadcast information into Soviet Russia.  Both were renamed shortly thereafter and combined as [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL).<ref>Smith, p. 198.</ref>  Many RFE/RL recruits came either from European emigrants families who were strongly anti-Communist or from US government agencies, most notably from CIA.  Officially, \"the US government denied any responsibility for the radios and took care to conceal the channels of funding, personnel recruitment, and policy influence.  Obviously, the major support was American, but it was plausibly not official American and it could be excluded from diplomatic intercourse and international legal complication.\"<ref>Smith, p. 199.</ref>  RFE/RL was considered to be a gray operation until its existence was publicly acknowledged by \"activists\" in the United States during the late 1960s.  The goal of the radios was to present the truth to suppressed peoples behind the Iron Curtain \"to aid in rebuilding a lively and diversified intellectual life in Europe which could...defeat Soviet...incursions on their freedom\".<ref>Smith, p.202.</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Voice of America]] (VOA) started broadcasting to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens in 1947 under the pretext of countering \"more harmful instances of [[Soviet propaganda]] directed against American leaders and policies\" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media.<ref name=\"whitton\">{{cite journal |author=John B.

The Trust aimed to create the view that communism was over in Russia and the Soviet Union would abandon its revolutionary ways.  Western intelligence services supported the fake anti-Bolshevik dissidents who provided false intelligence reports.  The operation's purpose was to identify real dissidents and anti-Bolsheviks, internally and abroad.

Sun Tzu, (544 - 498 BC), a military strategist, wrote of the superior power of political warfare in battle.]]\n{{War}}\n\n'''Political warfare''' is the use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will, based on hostile intent.  The term political describes the calculated interaction between a government and a target audience to include another state's government, military, and/or general population.  Governments use a variety of techniques to coerce certain actions, thereby gaining relative advantage over an opponent.  The techniques include [[propaganda]] and [[psychological operations]] (PSYOP), which service national and military objectives respectively.  Propaganda has many aspects and a hostile and coercive political purpose.  Psychological operations are for strategic and tactical military objectives and may be intended for hostile military and civilian populations.<ref>Smith, Paul A., On Political War (Washington: National Defense University Press, 1989), p. 7</ref>\n\nPolitical warfare's coercive nature leads to weakening or destroying an opponent's political, social, or societal will, and forcing a course of action favorable to a state's interest.  Political war may be combined with violence, [[economic pressure]], [[subversion]], and [[diplomacy]], but its chief aspect is \"the use of words, images and ideas\".<ref>Smith, p. 3.</ref>  The creation, deployment, and continuation of these coercive methods are a function of statecraft for nations and serve as a potential substitute for more direct military action.<ref>Smith, p. 5</ref>  For instance, methods like economic sanctions or embargoes are intended to inflict the necessary economic damage to force political change.  The utilized methods and techniques in political war depend on the state's political vision and composition.  Conduct will differ according to whether the state is totalitarian, authoritative, or democratic.<ref>Smith, p.12</ref>\n\nThe ultimate goal of political warfare is to alter an opponent's opinions and actions in favour of one state's interests without utilizing military power.  This type of organized persuasion or coercion also has the practical purpose of saving lives through eschewing the use of violence in order to further political goals.  Thus, political warfare also involves \"the art of heartening friends and disheartening enemies, of gaining help for one's cause and causing the abandonment of the enemies'\".<ref>Codevilla, Angelo and Paul Seabury, War: Ends and Means (Washington, DC: Potomac Books, Inc., 2006), p. 151.</ref>  Generally, political warfare is distinguished by its hostile intent and through potential escalation; but the loss of life is an accepted consequence.\n\n==Tools==\n\n===Peaceful===\n\nPolitical warfare utilizes all instruments short of war available to a nation to achieve its national objectives.  The best tool of political warfare is \"effective policy forcefully explained\",<ref name=\"auto\">Codevilla and Seabury, p. 157</ref> or more directly, \"overt policy forcefully backed\".<ref>Angelo M. Codevilla, \"Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends,\" in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008), 218.</ref>  But political warfare is used, as one leading thinker on the topic has explained, \"when public relations statements and gentle, [[public diplomacy]]-style persuasion \u2013 the policies of '[[soft power]]' \u2013 fail to win the needed sentiments and actions\"  around the world.<ref>J. Michael Waller, \"Getting Serious About Strategic Influence,\" ''The Journal of International Security Affairs'' 17 (Fall 2009): 24.</ref>  \nThe major way political warfare is waged is through propaganda.  The essence of these operations can be either overt or covert.  \"White\" or overt propaganda comes from a known source.  \"Gray\" propaganda, on the other hand, is the \"semiofficial amplification of a government's voice\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Liberty]] are examples of \"gray\" propaganda during the Cold War. \"Black\" propaganda, however, is propaganda which originates from an unknown source.  The key to black propaganda is the fact that it most often \"appears to come from a disinterested source when in fact it does not\".<ref>Codevilla, p. 219.</ref>\n\nThere are channels which can be used to transmit propaganda.  Sophisticated use of technology allows to disseminate information to a vast number of people. The most basic channel is the spoken word.  This can include live speeches or radio and television broadcasts.  Overt or covert radio broadcasting can be an especially useful tool.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}  The printed word is also very powerful, including pamphlets, leaflets, books, magazines, political cartoons, and planted newspaper articles (clandestine or otherwise).  Subversion, agents of influence, spies, journalists, and \"[[useful idiot]]s\" can all be used as powerful tools in political warfare.<ref>Codevilla, p. 220.</ref>\n\n===Aggressive===\n[[Image:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|left|Soviet expansion: Formation of the Eastern Bloc]]\n\nPolitical warfare also includes aggressive activities by one actor to offensively gain relative advantage or control over another. Between nation states, it can end in the seizure of power or in the open assimilation of the victimized state into the political system or power complex of the aggressor. This aggressor-victim relationship has also been seen between rivals within a state and may involve tactics like [[assassination]], paramilitary activity, [[sabotage]], [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], [[insurgency]], [[revolution]], [[guerrilla warfare]], and [[civil war]].\n\n*'''Foreign infiltration or liberation''' occurs when a government is overthrown by foreign military or diplomatic intervention, or through covert means.  The campaign's ultimate purpose is to gain control over another nation's political and social structure. The campaign could be led by the aggressor's national forces or by a political faction favorable to the aggressor within the other state. Paul M. Blackstock describes three stages involved in the extension of control by the aggressor over the victim:<ref>Blackstock, Paul W. The strategy of subversion: Manipulating the politics of other nations (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1964),</ref>\n#'''Penetration or infiltration:''' the deliberate infiltration of political and social groups within a victim state by the aggressor with the ultimate purpose of extending influence and control. The aggressor conceals its endgame, which goes beyond the normal influential nature of diplomacy and involves espionage.<ref name=\"auto1\">Blackstock, p. 44.</ref>\n#'''Forced disintegration or atomization:''' \"is the breakdown of the political and social structure of the victim until the fabric of national morale disintegrates and the state is unable to resist further intervention\". The aggressor may exploit the inevitable internal tensions between political, class, ethnic, religious, racial, and other groups.<ref>Blackstock, p.50.</ref>  This concept is a similar strategy to 'divide and conquer'.\n#'''Subversion and defection:''' Subversion is the \"undermining or detachment of the loyalties of significant political and social groups within the victimized state, and their transference to the political or ideological causes of the aggressor\".<ref>Blackstock, p.56.</ref> In lieu of total and direct transference, the aggressor may accept intermediate states that still meets its objectives, such as the favor of politically significant individuals. Furthermore, the formation of a counter-elite, made up of influential individuals and key leaders, within the victim state establishes the legitimacy and permanency of a new regime. Defection is the transference of allegiance of key individuals and leaders to the aggressor's camp. The individual could relocate or stay-in-place in the victim country, continually influencing local issues and events in the aggressor's favor. Defectors also provide insider information to the aggressor.<ref>Blackstock, p.61.</ref>\n\n*'''[[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]''' is the overthrowing of a government through the infiltration of the political, military, and social groups by a small segment of the state apparatus. The small segment exists within the state and targets the critical political levers of power within a government to neutralize opposition to the coup and post-coup governing force. Several pre-existing factors are necessary for a coup:<ref>Luttwak, p. 32-56</ref> political participation being limited to a small portion of the population, independence from foreign power influence and control, and power and decision-making authority concentrated within a political center and not diffused between regional authorities, businesses, or other groups.\nA coup utilizes political resources to gain support within the existing state and neutralize or immobilize those who are capable of rallying against the coup. A successful coup occurs rapidly and after taking over the government, stabilizes the situation by controlling communications and mobility. Furthermore, a new government must gain acceptance from the public and military and administrative structures, by reducing the sense of insecurity. Ultimately, the new government will seek legitimacy in the eyes of its own people as well as seek foreign recognition.<ref>Luttwak, p. 174</ref> The coup d'\u00e9tat can be led by national forces or involve foreign influence, similar to foreign liberation or infiltration.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n*'''Paramilitary Operations:''' transitional political warfare ranging from small-scale use of violence with primitive organizational structure (e.g. sabotage) to full-scale conventional war. The transition and escalation includes a series of stages and depends on tactical and strategic objectives. Paramilitary activities include infiltration and subversion as well as small group operations, insurrection, and civil war.<ref>Smith, p.4.</ref>\n*'''[[Insurgency]]:'''  an organized, protracted political warfare tool designed to weaken the control and eliminate the legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority.<ref>US Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual FM 3-24 (Department of the Army, December 2006), p. 13.</ref> An insurgency is an internal conflict, and the primary struggle is to mobilize local populations for political control and gain popular support towards the insurgents' cause.<ref>US Army, p.20.</ref> Insurgencies include political and military objectives, with the end goal of establishing a legitimate, rival state structure.<ref>Luttwak, p.26.</ref> Insurgencies are unconventional military conflicts which incorporate a variety of methods, ranging from coercive tools like intimidation and assassination, to political tools like propaganda and social services. An insurgency's approaches and objectives could involve perpetual disorder and violence demonstrating the government's inability to provide security for the populace, weakening the government and killing or intimidating any effective opposition against the government, intimidating the population and discouraging its participation in \u2013 or support for \u2013 political or legal processes, controlling or intimidating police and military forces (which limits their ability to respond to insurgent attacks) or by creating government repression by provoking over-reactions by security or military forces.<ref>US Army, p.18,33.</ref>\n\n==In antiquity==\n[[Image:As-Constantine-XR RIC vII 019.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A coin of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] (c.337) showing a depiction of his labarum spearing a serpent.]]\n[[File:Tetradrachm Ptolemaeus I obverse CdM Paris FGM2157.jpg|thumb|right| [[Alexander the Great]] silver [[tetradrachm]].]]\n[[Image:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|The [[Chi-Rho]] symbol]]\n\nThe history of political warfare can be traced to antiquity.  The Chinese general and strategist [[Sun Tzu]] captures its essence in the ancient Chinese military strategy book, ''[[The Art of War]]'': \"So to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; the highest excellence is to subdue the enemy's army without fighting at all...The expert in using the military subdues the enemy's forces without going to battle, takes the enemy's walled cities without launching an attack, and crushes the enemy's state without protracted war.\"<ref>Carr, Caleb, The Book of War:  Sun Tzu The Art of Warfare and Karl Von Clausewitz On War (New York: The Modern Library, 2000), p. 79.</ref>\n\nThere are abundant examples of political warfare in antiquity.  In [[ancient Greece]], a famous example is that of the [[Trojan Horse]], which used deception for tactical military objectives.  Propaganda was commonly utilized, including Greek rhetoric and theatre which used words and images to influence populations throughout the Hellenic world.  This practice has left a lasting legacy of speech as a mechanism of political power, greater than force in solving disputes and inducing submission.<ref>Smith, p. 35.</ref>  During this same period, [[Alexander the Great]] used coinage imprinted with his own image, indirectly forcing conquered nations to accept his legitimacy as national ruler and to unite disparate nations together under his dominion.<ref>Smith, p. 38.</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Rome]] utilized similar political warfare as the Greeks including rhetoric, as displayed by Cicero; and art, as seen in coinage, statues, architecture, engineering, and mosaics.  All of these elements were intended to portray Rome's imperial dominance over its subject nations and the superior nature of Roman society.<ref>Smith, p. 39.</ref>  Following a religious vision, the emperor [[Constantine I]] in AD 330 bound the Roman state to the universal [[Christian Church]].  In doing so, he linked \"religious commitment with imperial ambition\" that proved to be quite successful and powerful.<ref>Smith, p. 43.</ref>  One long-lasting symbol of this is the [[Chi Ro]], which forms the first two letters of the Greeks' name for [[Christ]].  This symbol was used for over one thousand years by Constantine's successors as a symbol of \"imperial majesty and divine authority\"<ref>Smith, p. 42.</ref> and still is a powerful symbol within [[Christianity]].\n\n==By country==\n===United States===\n\n====Creation of political warfare capacity====\n[[Image:US-MarshallPlanAid-Logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo used on aid delivered to European countries during the [[Marshall Plan]].]]\n\n[[American foreign policy]] demonstrates a tendency to move towards political warfare in times of tension and perceived threat, and toward public diplomacy in times of improved relations and peace.  American use of political warfare depends on its central political vision of the world and its subsequent foreign policy objectives.<ref>Smith, p.21</ref>  After World War II, the threat of Soviet expansion brought two new aims for American political warfare:\n#To restore Western Europe through military, economic, and political support\n#To weaken the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe through propaganda<ref>Smith, p. 192.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Harry S. Truman]] established a government political warfare capability in the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. The act created the [[U.S. National Security Council]], which became the infrastructure necessary to apply military power to political purposes.<ref>Smith, p.196.</ref>  Additionally, the United States crafted the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided funding to rebuild, from 1947 to 1951, the European countries devastated by war.  President Truman voiced the United States' national, universalist vision for political warfare against the Soviet Union in an address before Congress on March 12, 1947, thereby establishing the [[Truman Doctrine]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that in a number of other countries there have been similar developments.<br />\nOne way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.<br />\nThe second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio; fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. <br />\nI believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.<br />\nI believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.<br />\nI believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes. <br />\nThe seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive.<br />\nThe free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms.<br />\nIf we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world \u2013 and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation.<ref>President Harry S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress, March 12, 1947, (Avalon Project, [[Yale Law School]]), [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/trudoc.asp Yale.edu]</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\n====Containment policy====\n\nThe Truman Doctrine was the post-WWII basis for American political warfare operations on which the United States government went further to formulate an active, defensive strategy to contain the Soviet threat.<ref>Smith, p.192.</ref>  On 4 May 1948, [[George F. Kennan]], the father of the [[containment policy]], wrote the Policy Planning Staff Memorandum titled [http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/65ciafounding3.htm \"The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare\"].  This [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) memo established a directorate of political warfare operations, under the control of the NSC, known as the Consultative (or Evaluation) Board of the National Security Council.  This directorate fell under the authority of the Secretary of State, while the Board had complete authority over covert political operations.  It recognized political warfare as one instrument in the United States' grand strategy.  Kennan defined 'political warfare' as \"the employment of all means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.  Such actions are both overt and covert.  They range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures (such as ERP \u2013 the Marshall Plan), and 'white' propaganda to such covert operations as clandestine support of 'friendly' foreign elements, 'black' psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground resistance in hostile states.\"<br />\n\nThe memo further defined four projects that were activated by the Board to combat growing Communist influence abroad, including:\n*'''Liberation Committees:''' to encourage the formation of a public American organization which will sponsor selected political refugee committees to give support and guidance to national movements gestating in the Soviet World;\n*'''Support of indigenous anti-communist elements:''' within threatened countries of the free world, to include covertly using private intermediaries;\n*'''Underground activities behind the Iron Curtain'''\n*'''Preventive direct action in free countries:''' only in cases of dire necessity.  This covert operation involved: control over anti-sabotage activities in the Venezuelan oil fields, American sabotage of Near Eastern oil installations on the verge of Soviet capture, and designation of key individuals threatened by the Kremlin who should be protected or removed elsewhere.\n\n====Cold War era====\n[[Image:RFE logoFC wiki.jpg|thumb|[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]] logo]]\n{{Further|Cold War}}\nThe United States used gray and black propaganda research, broadcasting, and print media operations during the Cold War to achieve its political warfare goals.  These operations were conducted against Eastern European targets from Western Europe by two public-private organizations supported partly by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the NSC, and partly by private corporations.  These organizations were Free Europe, which was launched in 1941 and targeted Eastern Europe, and the American Committee for Liberation (AmComLib) created in 1951 to broadcast information into Soviet Russia.  Both were renamed shortly thereafter and combined as [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL).<ref>Smith, p. 198.</ref>  Many RFE/RL recruits came either from European emigrants families who were strongly anti-Communist or from US government agencies, most notably from CIA.  Officially, \"the US government denied any responsibility for the radios and took care to conceal the channels of funding, personnel recruitment, and policy influence.

Soviet efforts took many forms, ranging from propaganda, forgeries, and general disinformation to assassinations.  The measures aimed to damage the enemy's image, create confusion, mould public opinion, and to exploit existing strains in international relations.<ref>Bittman, Ladislav, ''[[The KGB and Soviet Disinformation|The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider\u2019s View]]''. (Washington: Pergamaon-Brassey\u2019s, 1985) p. 44</ref>  The Soviet Union dedicated vast resources and attention to these active measures, believing that \"mass production of active measures would have a significant cumulative effect over a period of several decades\".<ref>Bittman, p.43-45.</ref>  Soviet active measures were notorious for targeting intended audience's public attitudes, to include prejudices, beliefs, and suspicions deeply rooted in the local history.  Soviet campaigns fed disinformation that was psychologically consistent with the audience.<ref>Bittman, p.56.</ref>  Examples of Soviet active measures include:\n\n*'''[[Trust Operation]]''':  was a counterintelligence operation conducted by Soviet intelligence against domestic and foreign adversaries.  The operation, which ran from 1921\u20131929, set up a fake anti-Bolshevik underground organization, \"Monarchist Union of Central Russia\", MUCR (\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u041c\u041e\u0426\u0420), which claimed to plan a conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government.  The Trust aimed to create the view that communism was over in Russia and the Soviet Union would abandon its revolutionary ways.  Western intelligence services supported the fake anti-Bolshevik dissidents who provided false intelligence reports.  The operation's purpose was to identify real dissidents and anti-Bolsheviks, internally and abroad.  The operation resulted in the arrests and executions of Russian exile leaders and the general demoralization of anti-Soviet efforts.<ref>Epstein, Edward Jay. ''Deception''.

Chapter 10, pp.221-225.</ref>  The story was broadcast by Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress in English and Turkish broadcasts to Asian countries, some of which had important U.S. military bases.  The \"Rumor\" campaign was highly effective in the 1980s and continues to resurface today throughout the world.<ref>Bittman, p.221</ref>\n\nCommunist strategy and tactics continually focused on revolutionary objectives, \"for them the real war is the political warfare waged daily under the guise of peace\".<ref>James D.

The Soviets quickly deployed organizational weapons such as non-political front groups, sponsored 'spontaneous' mass appeals, and puppet politicians. While many of these countries' political and social structures were in post-war disarray, the Soviet Union's proxy communist parties were well-organized and able to take control of these weak, newly formed Eastern European governments.<ref>Smith, p.186.</ref> Moreover, the clandestine operations of the Soviet intelligence services and the occupying forces of the Soviet military further infiltrated the political and social spheres of the new satellites.<ref>Smith, p.187.</ref> Conversely, in 1979, the Soviet Union was unable to successfully penetrate the Afghan society after supporting a coup which brought a new Marxist government to power. While Soviet units were already in Kabul, Afghanistan at the time of the coup, additional Soviet troops arrived to reinforce the units and seize important provincial cities, bringing the total of Soviet troops inside Afghanistan to 125,000\u2013140,000. The Soviets were unprepared for the Afghan resistance which included classic guerrilla tactics with foreign support. In 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, having been unable to infiltrate the Afghan society or immobilize the resistance.<ref>Doughty, Robert. Warfare in the Western World, Vol. II. (D.C.

It has been the subject of several songs and three movies, including the 2016 film ''[[Loving (2016 film)|Loving]]''.

Most sources describe her as black, but she denied being black and often stated she was Native American. See the [[Loving v. Virginia#Plaintiffs|\"Plaintiffs\" section]] for details.}} and her white husband Richard Loving, who in 1958 were sentenced to a year in prison for marrying each other. Their marriage violated Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]], which criminalized marriage between people classified as \"[[White people|white]]\" and people classified as \"[[colored]]\". The Lovings appealed their conviction to the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]], which upheld it. They then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear their case.\n\nOn June 12, 1967, the Court issued a unanimous decision in the Lovings' favor and overturned their convictions.  The Court struck down Virginia's anti-miscegenation law, ending all [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-based legal restrictions on [[marriage in the United States]]. Virginia had argued that its law was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the punishment was the same regardless of the offender's race, and thus it \"equally burdened\" both whites and non-whites.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;9.3.1, p. 757}} The Court found that the law nonetheless violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was based solely on \"distinctions drawn according to race\" and outlawed conduct\u2014namely, getting married\u2014that was otherwise generally accepted and which citizens were free to do.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;9.3.1, p. 757}}\n\n==Background==\n===Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States===\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States]] had been in place in certain states since colonial days. In the [[Reconstruction Era]] in 1865, the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] across the seven states of the lower South made intermarriage illegal.  The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] legislatures in six states repealed the restrictive laws. By 1894, when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the South had returned to power, the restriction had been reimposed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wallenstein |first1=Peter |title=Reconstruction, Segregation, and Miscegenation: Interracial Marriage and the Law in the Lower South, 1865\u20131900 |journal=American Nineteenth Century History |volume=6 |date=16 Aug 2006 |pages=57\u201376 |doi=10.1080/14664650500121827 |quote=On the eve of Congressional Reconstruction, all seven states of the Lower South had laws against interracial marriage.

On the one hand, a person's reputation as black or white was usually decisive in practical matters.

Alabama|volume=106|page=583|year=1883}}</ref> Interracial marital sex was deemed a felony, whereas extramarital sex (\"adultery or fornication\") was only a misdemeanor. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the criminalization of interracial sex was not a violation of the [[equal protection clause]] because whites and non-whites were punished in equal measure for the offense of engaging in interracial sex. The court did not need to affirm the constitutionality of the ban on interracial marriage that was also part of Alabama's anti-miscegenation law, since the plaintiff, Mr. Pace, had chosen not to appeal that section of the law. After ''Pace v. Alabama'', the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws banning marriage and sex between whites and non-whites remained unchallenged until the 1920s.\n\nIn ''Kirby v. Kirby'' (1921), Mr. Kirby asked the state of Arizona for an annulment of his marriage. He charged that his marriage was invalid because his wife was of \"negro\" descent, thus violating the state's anti-miscegenation law. The Arizona Supreme Court judged Mrs. Kirby's race by observing her physical characteristics and determined that she was of mixed race, therefore granting Mr. Kirby's annulment.<ref name=Pascoe_pp49-51>{{harvnb|Pascoe|1996|pp=49\u201351}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Monks'' case (''[[Estate of Monks]]'', 4. Civ. 2835, Records of California Court of Appeals, Fourth district), the Superior Court of San Diego County in 1939 decided to invalidate the marriage of Marie Antoinette and Allan Monks because she was deemed to have \"one eighth negro blood\". The court case involved a legal challenge over the conflicting wills that had been left by the late Allan Monks; an old one in favor of a friend named Ida Lee, and a newer one in favor of his wife. Lee's lawyers charged that the marriage of the Monkses, which had taken place in Arizona, was invalid under Arizona state law because Marie Antoinette was \"a Negro\" and Alan had been white. Despite conflicting testimony by various expert witnesses, the judge defined Mrs. Monks' race by relying on the anatomical \"expertise\" of a surgeon. The judge ignored the arguments of an anthropologist and a biologist that it was impossible to tell a person's race from physical characteristics.<ref name=Pascoe_p56>{{harvnb|Pascoe |1996|p=56}}</ref>\n\nMonks then challenged the Arizona anti-miscegenation law itself, taking her case to the California Court of Appeals, Fourth District. Monks' lawyers pointed out that the anti-miscegenation law effectively prohibited Monks as a mixed-race person from marrying anyone: \"As such, she is prohibited from marrying a negro or any descendant of a negro, a Mongolian or an Indian, a Malay or a Hindu, or any descendants of any of them. Likewise&nbsp;... as a descendant of a negro she is prohibited from marrying a Caucasian or a descendant of a Caucasian.&nbsp;...\" The Arizona anti-miscegenation statute thus prohibited Monks from contracting a valid marriage in Arizona, and was therefore an unconstitutional constraint on her liberty. However, the court dismissed this argument as inapplicable, because the case presented involved not two mixed-race spouses but a mixed-race and a white spouse: \"Under the facts presented the appellant does not have the benefit of assailing the validity of the statute.\"<ref name=Pascoe_p60>{{harvnb|Pascoe |1996|p=60}}</ref> Dismissing Monks' appeal in 1942, the United States Supreme Court refused to reopen the issue.\n\nThe turning point came with ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'' (1948), also known as ''Perez v. Lippold''. In ''Perez'', the [[Supreme Court of California]] recognized that bans on interracial marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n\n==Supreme Court decision==\nOn June 12, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9\u20130 decision that overturned the Lovings' Virginia criminal convictions and struck down anti-miscegenation laws that forbade marriage between people of different races.\n\nThe Court's opinion was written by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]], and all the justices joined it.{{notetag|The decision also includes a very short concurring opinion\u2014only two sentences long\u2014written by Justice [[Potter Stewart]]. Stewart took the position that no state criminal law can be valid \"which makes the criminality  of an act depend upon the race of the actor,\" a standard which reflects Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]]'s dissent in 1896's ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Schoff | first= Rebecca | year=2009 | title = Note: Deciding on Doctrine: Anti-Miscegnation Statutes and the Development of Equal Protection Analysis | url=http://www.virginialawreview.org/volumes/content/deciding-doctrine-anti-miscegenation-statutes-and-development-equal-protection | journal=Virginia Law Review | volume=95 | issue=3 | pages = 627\u201365}}.</ref>}} It began by rejecting Virginia's argument that the anti-miscegenation clause in its Racial Integrity Act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the punishment for violating the statute was the same regardless of the offender's race\u2014that is, a white person who married a black person received the same punishment as black person who married a white person\u2014and therefore it \"equally burdened\" both whites and non-whites. The Court had upheld this \"equal burden\" argument 84 years earlier in the 1883 case ''[[Pace v.

Virginia#Plaintiffs|\"Plaintiffs\" section]] for details.}} and her white husband Richard Loving, who in 1958 were sentenced to a year in prison for marrying each other. Their marriage violated Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]], which criminalized marriage between people classified as \"[[White people|white]]\" and people classified as \"[[colored]]\". The Lovings appealed their conviction to the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]], which upheld it. They then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear their case.\n\nOn June 12, 1967, the Court issued a unanimous decision in the Lovings' favor and overturned their convictions.  The Court struck down Virginia's anti-miscegenation law, ending all [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-based legal restrictions on [[marriage in the United States]]. Virginia had argued that its law was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the punishment was the same regardless of the offender's race, and thus it \"equally burdened\" both whites and non-whites.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;9.3.1, p. 757}} The Court found that the law nonetheless violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was based solely on \"distinctions drawn according to race\" and outlawed conduct\u2014namely, getting married\u2014that was otherwise generally accepted and which citizens were free to do.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;9.3.1, p. 757}}\n\n==Background==\n===Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States===\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States]] had been in place in certain states since colonial days. In the [[Reconstruction Era]] in 1865, the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] across the seven states of the lower South made intermarriage illegal.  The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] legislatures in six states repealed the restrictive laws. By 1894, when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the South had returned to power, the restriction had been reimposed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wallenstein |first1=Peter |title=Reconstruction, Segregation, and Miscegenation: Interracial Marriage and the Law in the Lower South, 1865\u20131900 |journal=American Nineteenth Century History |volume=6 |date=16 Aug 2006 |pages=57\u201376 |doi=10.1080/14664650500121827 |quote=On the eve of Congressional Reconstruction, all seven states of the Lower South had laws against interracial marriage.

On the one hand, a person's reputation as black or white was usually decisive in practical matters.

Alabama]]'' (1883), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the conviction of an Alabama couple for interracial sex, affirmed on appeal by the Alabama Supreme Court, did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name=Pace>{{ussc|name=Pace v. Alabama|volume=106|page=583|year=1883}}</ref> Interracial marital sex was deemed a felony, whereas extramarital sex (\"adultery or fornication\") was only a misdemeanor. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the criminalization of interracial sex was not a violation of the [[equal protection clause]] because whites and non-whites were punished in equal measure for the offense of engaging in interracial sex. The court did not need to affirm the constitutionality of the ban on interracial marriage that was also part of Alabama's anti-miscegenation law, since the plaintiff, Mr. Pace, had chosen not to appeal that section of the law. After ''Pace v. Alabama'', the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws banning marriage and sex between whites and non-whites remained unchallenged until the 1920s.\n\nIn ''Kirby v. Kirby'' (1921), Mr. Kirby asked the state of Arizona for an annulment of his marriage. He charged that his marriage was invalid because his wife was of \"negro\" descent, thus violating the state's anti-miscegenation law. The Arizona Supreme Court judged Mrs. Kirby's race by observing her physical characteristics and determined that she was of mixed race, therefore granting Mr. Kirby's annulment.<ref name=Pascoe_pp49-51>{{harvnb|Pascoe|1996|pp=49\u201351}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Monks'' case (''[[Estate of Monks]]'', 4. Civ. 2835, Records of California Court of Appeals, Fourth district), the Superior Court of San Diego County in 1939 decided to invalidate the marriage of Marie Antoinette and Allan Monks because she was deemed to have \"one eighth negro blood\". The court case involved a legal challenge over the conflicting wills that had been left by the late Allan Monks; an old one in favor of a friend named Ida Lee, and a newer one in favor of his wife. Lee's lawyers charged that the marriage of the Monkses, which had taken place in Arizona, was invalid under Arizona state law because Marie Antoinette was \"a Negro\" and Alan had been white. Despite conflicting testimony by various expert witnesses, the judge defined Mrs. Monks' race by relying on the anatomical \"expertise\" of a surgeon. The judge ignored the arguments of an anthropologist and a biologist that it was impossible to tell a person's race from physical characteristics.<ref name=Pascoe_p56>{{harvnb|Pascoe |1996|p=56}}</ref>\n\nMonks then challenged the Arizona anti-miscegenation law itself, taking her case to the California Court of Appeals, Fourth District. Monks' lawyers pointed out that the anti-miscegenation law effectively prohibited Monks as a mixed-race person from marrying anyone: \"As such, she is prohibited from marrying a negro or any descendant of a negro, a Mongolian or an Indian, a Malay or a Hindu, or any descendants of any of them. Likewise&nbsp;... as a descendant of a negro she is prohibited from marrying a Caucasian or a descendant of a Caucasian.&nbsp;...\" The Arizona anti-miscegenation statute thus prohibited Monks from contracting a valid marriage in Arizona, and was therefore an unconstitutional constraint on her liberty. However, the court dismissed this argument as inapplicable, because the case presented involved not two mixed-race spouses but a mixed-race and a white spouse: \"Under the facts presented the appellant does not have the benefit of assailing the validity of the statute.\"<ref name=Pascoe_p60>{{harvnb|Pascoe |1996|p=60}}</ref> Dismissing Monks' appeal in 1942, the United States Supreme Court refused to reopen the issue.\n\nThe turning point came with ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'' (1948), also known as ''Perez v. Lippold''. In ''Perez'', the [[Supreme Court of California]] recognized that bans on interracial marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n\n==Supreme Court decision==\nOn June 12, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9\u20130 decision that overturned the Lovings' Virginia criminal convictions and struck down anti-miscegenation laws that forbade marriage between people of different races.\n\nThe Court's opinion was written by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]], and all the justices joined it.{{notetag|The decision also includes a very short concurring opinion\u2014only two sentences long\u2014written by Justice [[Potter Stewart]]. Stewart took the position that no state criminal law can be valid \"which makes the criminality  of an act depend upon the race of the actor,\" a standard which reflects Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]]'s dissent in 1896's ''[[Plessy v.

The Court had upheld this \"equal burden\" argument 84 years earlier in the 1883 case ''[[Pace v. Alabama]]'', but in ''Loving'' it rejected it and overruled ''Pace'', stating: \"We reject the notion that the mere 'equal application' of a statute concerning racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial discriminations.\"<ref>{{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;9.3.1, p. 757}}, quoting ''Loving'', 388 U.S. at 8.</ref> The Court ruled that because the races of the people involved were the only factors determining whether or not they broke the law, the law was therefore a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=\u00a7 18.28(a), pp. 80\u201381}}\n{{Quote\n|text=There can be no question but that Virginia's miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race.

The majority believed that what the judge said, that it was God's plan to keep people apart, and that government should discriminate against people in love. But I have lived long enough now to see big changes. The older generation's fears and prejudices have given way, and today's young people realize that if someone loves someone they have a right to marry.\n\nSurrounded as I am now by wonderful children and grandchildren, not a day goes by that I don't think of Richard and our love, our right to marry, and how much it meant to me to have that freedom to marry the person precious to me, even if others thought he was the \"wrong kind of person\" for me to marry. I believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry. Government has no business imposing some people's religious beliefs over others. Especially if it denies people's civil rights.\n\nI am still not a political person, but I am proud that Richard's and my name is on a court case that can help reinforce the love, the commitment, the fairness, and the family that so many people, black or white, young or old, gay or straight seek in life.
