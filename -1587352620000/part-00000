Its boundaries are [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]] to the north, [[Chicago Avenue]] to the south, [[Western Avenue (Chicago)|Western Avenue]] to the west, and Damen Avenue to the east.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en/neighborhoods/ukrainian___east_village.html |title=Chicago Neighborhoods \u2013 Ukrainian & East Village| publisher=City of Chicago |accessdate=2011-06-14}}</ref> It is one of the neighborhoods in the [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]] community area.\n\nBy the 1930s, there were five Ukrainian parishes dotting Chicago's neighborhoods, reflecting a wave of immigration of Ukrainian Catholics. Some churches are built in the Byzantine-Slavonic style of [[St. Nicholas Cathedral (Chicago)|St. Nicholas Cathedral]]. Built between November 1913 and January 1915, St. Nicholas is in the heart of the Ukrainian neighborhood south of [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] and along Chicago Avenue, referred to by locals as Ukrainian Village.\n\nThis neighborhood, northwest of the Loop, was first settled by Polish and Slovak immigrants. With the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and the influx of political refugees during World War I, new immigrants gave it a Ukrainian cultural identity, which it retains.\n\n==History==\nUkrainian Village, like neighboring [[East Village, Chicago|East Village]], began as farmland. Originally, [[German Americans]], who came mostly as immigrants in the mid-19th century, formed the largest ethnic group in the vicinity. With new waves of immigration starting in the late 19th century, by the turn of the century, the neighborhood was largely [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]. Similar to Chicago's ''Lithuanian Downtown'' in [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]], Ukrainians settled in the district because of their familiarity with [[Poles]] who lived in the surrounding [[Polish Downtown (Chicago)|Polish Downtown]]. Dense settlement of the neighborhood was largely spurred by the 1895 construction of an [[Chicago \"L\"|elevated train]] line along Paulina Ave (1700 W), which provided access to workplaces. It was decommissioned in 1964.<ref>[http://www.chicago-l.org/operations/lines/paulina.html]</ref>\n\n[[File:UV restaurant.JPG|thumb|left|A restaurant in Ukrainian Village with the colors of the [[Ukrainian flag]].]]\nThe Ukrainian community in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] is not localized, but there was a concentration of immigrants and their descendants in what is now known as Ukrainian Village. This central area has been the focus of Ukrainian life since around the start of the 20th century. It continues to function as its hub, as it has three major Ukrainian churches, Ukrainian-owned banks,<ref>[https://www.selfreliance.com/]</ref> a Ukrainian-language grammar school, the [[Ukrainian National Museum]], a Ukrainian Cultural Center, the [[Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art]], two Ukrainian youth organizations, and many Ukrainian-owned restaurants, stores and businesses.\n\nOver the past half century, Ukrainian Village has remained a middle-class neighborhood, populated largely by older citizens of [[Eastern Europe]]an ethnicity. It is bordered (and affected) on many sides by areas suffering more poverty and crime. It was insulated somewhat from surrounding socioeconomic change in the large industrial areas on its south and west borders by the strong fabric of ethnic institutions as well as the staying power of the Orthodox and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] congregations. As noted above, there are also significant ethnic cultural institutions in the area.<ref>[http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/208/661 Chicago's Ukrainian Village] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122121832/http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/208/661 |date=2009-01-22 }}, ''The Ukrainian Observer'', Issue 208</ref> Although Ukrainian Village continues to be the center of Chicago's large [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] community, the gentrification of [[West Town, Chicago]] community area is rapidly changing the demographic. Ukrainian Village continues to be home to approximately 15,000 ethnic [[Ukrainians]].\n\nOther notable local landmarks include [[Sts. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church|Ss. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church]], [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Chicago#St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral (in Chicago)|St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral]], St. Volodymyr Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral, [[Roberto Clemente High School]], St Mary's Hospital, and [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Chicago|Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Cathedral]]. The latter was commissioned by [[St. John Kochurov]] and designed by famed architect [[Louis Sullivan]].\n\n===Ukrainian immigration to the United States===\nThere have been four mass immigrations from Ukraine to the United States. The first immigrants arrived during the period 1870-1914. Most of these early immigrants from Ukraine were poor, illiterate peasants seeking work and a better life in America. Many small Ukrainian enclaves developed throughout Chicago, including the area bounded by Division, Racine, Orleans and Roosevelt; another in the Burnside area, and another in what has become known as the Ukrainian Village. A small pocket of immigrants colonized Packingtown on the South Side of Chicago. In 1903 they erected a church that stood in the shadows of the large slaughterhouses that employed thousands of men. The First Greek Catholic Church of St. Mary's of Chicago featured a characteristic three-barred cross on the steeple. Beneath the cross was a crescent, symbolic of the victory of Christianity over Islam. St. Mary's soon became an integral part of [[Rusyn culture]].\n\nThe second, interwar wave of immigration occurred between 1920-1939, following Ukraine's declaration at the end of World War I as an independent nation. Ukrainians arriving in Chicago at this time were semi-skilled, literate workers who had decided to come to the United States to escape the political and economic pressures of the newly independent Ukraine. Ukrainians played an important role in Chicago's [[Century of Progress]] in 1933. The Ukrainian Pavilion at the Exposition housed a restaurant and exhibit halls demonstrating folk art and history.<ref>[http://www.ukrainianmuseum.org/news_071007threadtothepast.html \"Thread to the Past\"], Ukrainian Museum</ref>\nBy the 1930s, five Ukrainian parishes dotted Chicago's neighborhoods. St. Nicholas Cathedral was built in the Byzantine-Slavonic style. Built between November 1913 and January 1915, St. Nicholas is in the heart of the Ukrainian neighborhood south of Wicker Park and along Chicago Avenue, referred to as the Ukrainian Village.\nThis neighborhood, northwest of the Loop, was first settled by Polish and Slovak immigrants, but with the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and the influx of political refugees during World War I, new residents gave it a Ukrainian cultural identity.\n\nThe third, post-World War II wave of immigration occurred between approximately 1948-1955. This wave of immigration brought with it a highly skilled, professional Ukrainian population who entered the United States following the passage of the [[Displaced Persons Act]] of 1948. Forced to leave Ukraine to escape Soviet forces, they were committed to Ukraine's freedom crusade. Following WWII, thousands of political refugees from war-torn Eastern Europe found their way to the United States, including professionals, physicians, lawyers, writers and intellectuals who had opposed the Stalinist regime. The population surge of the 1950s energized Chicago's Ukrainian Village, and spurred construction of new parishes and the founding of new civic and cultural organizations.\n\nThe fourth, and most recent, wave of immigration from Ukraine to the United States occurred in the 1990s, following the [[fall of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and subsequent opening of Ukraine's borders to the west. While the largest influx of Ukrainians to Chicago occurred shortly after 1990, immigration to Chicago from Ukraine continues to the present time. These new arrivals have made their mark on Chicago as well. Many Ukrainian shops were founded along Chicago and Western Avenue over the years. Most prominent among the shops today are those established by the \u201cfourth wave,\u201d whose members have proven to be quite entrepreneurial. Ukrainian-owned businesses can often be identified by the posters they display advertising various Ukrainian cultural events.\n\n==Churches==\nThere are several churches within Ukrainian Village, with three located on one street, and most being within a block of each other. [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Chicago#St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral (in Chicago)|St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral]] was the first of the two Ukrainian Greek Catholic churches in the village.

It was sold twice before it was finally bought and converted by the current Ukrainian parish. The parish runs a Saturday school of Ukrainian language for students from preschool to 10th grade.\n\n==Ukrainian Village District==\nOn December 4, 2002, the [[Ukrainian Village District]], centering on Haddon Avenue, Thomas Street, and Cortez Street between Damen and Leavitt Avenues, including portions of Damen, Hoyne and Leavitt Avenues, was designated as a [[Chicago Landmark]] District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/U/UkranianVillageDist.html|title=Ukrainian Village District|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607153757/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/U/UkranianVillageDist.html|archivedate=2007-06-07}}</ref> Extensions to the district were designated in 2005 and on April 11, 2007.<ref>{{Cite journal | publication-date = 2007-04-11 | title = Reports of Committees: Ukrainian Village District Extension | publisher = City Clerk's Office \u2013 City of Chicago | pages = 102605\u2013102648 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nUkrainian National Museum.JPG|The Ukrainian National Museum\nJosyf Slipyj street.JPG|Street sign marking a street named after a famous Ukrainian religious leader\nUkrainian Village Selfreliance Bank (Chicago).JPG|Selfreliance Credit Union (in Ukrainian Village, Chicago)\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Slavic Village]] in Cleveland, Ohio\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.chicagonow.com/ukrainian-chicago 'Ukrainian Chicago' blog on Chicago Tribune's site ChicagoNow.com]\n* [http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/doit/general/GIS/Chicago_Maps/Community_Areas/CA_WEST_TOWN.pdf Official City of Chicago West Town Community Map]\n*[http://www.forgottenchicago.com/ukg.php ForgottenChicago.com's article on Ornamental Stained Glass in Ukrainian Village]\n* [http://www.uvna.org/index.html Ukrainian Village Neighborhood Association]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/UKVillageWatch/ Ukrainian Village Neighborhood Watch]\n* [http://www.ukrainiandiaspora.ca/ Ukrainian Diaspora in Canada and U.S.]\n{{West Town, Chicago}}\n{{Chicago}}\n{{Community areas of Chicago}}\n{{Neighborhoods in Chicago}}\n{{Ethnicity in Chicago, Illinois}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic enclaves in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Chicago Landmarks]]\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian-American culture in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian communities in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rusyn-American culture in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=October 2012}}\n{{copypaste|date=March 2017}}\n\n{{Coord|41.895989|-87.683734|display=title}}\n\n'''Ukrainian Village''' is a [[Chicago]] neighborhood located on the near west side of Chicago.  Its boundaries are [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]] to the north, [[Chicago Avenue]] to the south, [[Western Avenue (Chicago)|Western Avenue]] to the west, and Damen Avenue to the east.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en/neighborhoods/ukrainian___east_village.html |title=Chicago Neighborhoods \u2013 Ukrainian & East Village| publisher=City of Chicago |accessdate=2011-06-14}}</ref> It is one of the neighborhoods in the [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]] community area.\n\nBy the 1930s, there were five Ukrainian parishes dotting Chicago's neighborhoods, reflecting a wave of immigration of Ukrainian Catholics. Some churches are built in the Byzantine-Slavonic style of [[St. Nicholas Cathedral (Chicago)|St. Nicholas Cathedral]]. Built between November 1913 and January 1915, St. Nicholas is in the heart of the Ukrainian neighborhood south of [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] and along Chicago Avenue, referred to by locals as Ukrainian Village.\n\nThis neighborhood, northwest of the Loop, was first settled by Polish and Slovak immigrants. With the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and the influx of political refugees during World War I, new immigrants gave it a Ukrainian cultural identity, which it retains.\n\n==History==\nUkrainian Village, like neighboring [[East Village, Chicago|East Village]], began as farmland. Originally, [[German Americans]], who came mostly as immigrants in the mid-19th century, formed the largest ethnic group in the vicinity. With new waves of immigration starting in the late 19th century, by the turn of the century, the neighborhood was largely [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]. Similar to Chicago's ''Lithuanian Downtown'' in [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]], Ukrainians settled in the district because of their familiarity with [[Poles]] who lived in the surrounding [[Polish Downtown (Chicago)|Polish Downtown]]. Dense settlement of the neighborhood was largely spurred by the 1895 construction of an [[Chicago \"L\"|elevated train]] line along Paulina Ave (1700 W), which provided access to workplaces. It was decommissioned in 1964.<ref>[http://www.chicago-l.org/operations/lines/paulina.html]</ref>\n\n[[File:UV restaurant.JPG|thumb|left|A restaurant in Ukrainian Village with the colors of the [[Ukrainian flag]].]]\nThe Ukrainian community in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] is not localized, but there was a concentration of immigrants and their descendants in what is now known as Ukrainian Village. This central area has been the focus of Ukrainian life since around the start of the 20th century. It continues to function as its hub, as it has three major Ukrainian churches, Ukrainian-owned banks,<ref>[https://www.selfreliance.com/]</ref> a Ukrainian-language grammar school, the [[Ukrainian National Museum]], a Ukrainian Cultural Center, the [[Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art]], two Ukrainian youth organizations, and many Ukrainian-owned restaurants, stores and businesses.\n\nOver the past half century, Ukrainian Village has remained a middle-class neighborhood, populated largely by older citizens of [[Eastern Europe]]an ethnicity. It is bordered (and affected) on many sides by areas suffering more poverty and crime. It was insulated somewhat from surrounding socioeconomic change in the large industrial areas on its south and west borders by the strong fabric of ethnic institutions as well as the staying power of the Orthodox and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]] congregations. As noted above, there are also significant ethnic cultural institutions in the area.<ref>[http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/208/661 Chicago's Ukrainian Village] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122121832/http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/208/661 |date=2009-01-22 }}, ''The Ukrainian Observer'', Issue 208</ref> Although Ukrainian Village continues to be the center of Chicago's large [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] community, the gentrification of [[West Town, Chicago]] community area is rapidly changing the demographic. Ukrainian Village continues to be home to approximately 15,000 ethnic [[Ukrainians]].\n\nOther notable local landmarks include [[Sts. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church|Ss. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church]], [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Chicago#St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral (in Chicago)|St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral]], St. Volodymyr Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral, [[Roberto Clemente High School]], St Mary's Hospital, and [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Chicago|Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Cathedral]]. The latter was commissioned by [[St. John Kochurov]] and designed by famed architect [[Louis Sullivan]].\n\n===Ukrainian immigration to the United States===\nThere have been four mass immigrations from Ukraine to the United States. The first immigrants arrived during the period 1870-1914. Most of these early immigrants from Ukraine were poor, illiterate peasants seeking work and a better life in America. Many small Ukrainian enclaves developed throughout Chicago, including the area bounded by Division, Racine, Orleans and Roosevelt; another in the Burnside area, and another in what has become known as the Ukrainian Village. A small pocket of immigrants colonized Packingtown on the South Side of Chicago. In 1903 they erected a church that stood in the shadows of the large slaughterhouses that employed thousands of men. The First Greek Catholic Church of St. Mary's of Chicago featured a characteristic three-barred cross on the steeple. Beneath the cross was a crescent, symbolic of the victory of Christianity over Islam. St. Mary's soon became an integral part of [[Rusyn culture]].\n\nThe second, interwar wave of immigration occurred between 1920-1939, following Ukraine's declaration at the end of World War I as an independent nation. Ukrainians arriving in Chicago at this time were semi-skilled, literate workers who had decided to come to the United States to escape the political and economic pressures of the newly independent Ukraine. Ukrainians played an important role in Chicago's [[Century of Progress]] in 1933. The Ukrainian Pavilion at the Exposition housed a restaurant and exhibit halls demonstrating folk art and history.<ref>[http://www.ukrainianmuseum.org/news_071007threadtothepast.html \"Thread to the Past\"], Ukrainian Museum</ref>\nBy the 1930s, five Ukrainian parishes dotted Chicago's neighborhoods.

{"title_page": "1929 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1929 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 20th. One of the key events of the season was the tour of the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] side.\n\nThe First Grade Championship was won by [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] who defeated [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] in the final 5\u20130. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Thistle Cup for competition points accrued during the second round of matches where they went undefeated. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy after defeating [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] in the final 17\u20139. They weren't finished yet, defeating the same opponent to win the Stormont Shield 28\u201314. This was their first time hoisting either of these trophies.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] entered a team into the B Grade which was arguably the first ever 'reserve grade' team in Auckland club rugby league. The B Grade competition was won by [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] who defeated [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] in the final 13 points to 10. This earned [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] the right to playoff with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] who had come last in the A Grade championship. [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] who had lost all 14 of their matches in A Grade triumphed by 5 points to 0 to remain in A Grade for 1930. [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] beat [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] 11\u20130 to win the Stallard Cup which was the B Grade knockout competition.\n\n== South Sydney Tour ==\n[[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] became the first Australian club team to tour [[New Zealand]]. They played two matches against Marist at [[Carlaw Park]] on consecutive Saturdays and a midweek game against Huntly in [[Huntly]]. They were defeated in the first match 10\u20139, before winning the return match 25\u20135.\n\n== Key Events and News ==\nThe annual report for the completed 1928 season revealed that \u00a33272 was taken in gate receipts from club matches alone at [[Carlaw Park]]. The total from all matches was \u00a34573 with \u00a3517 paid to injured players. A further \u00a3609 1s 3d was spent on maintenance and improvement at [[Carlaw Park]]. Clubs were also granted \u00a3326 18s 5d and charitable causes received \u00a3142 10s 4d. League assets including [[Carlaw Park]] were reported as \u00a310,569 16s 4d, with a consolidated fund of \u00a39810 11s 9d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Position in Auckland/Large Sum to Injured Men\n| page = 18\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20211\n| date = 1929-03-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290322.2.174.4\n| accessdate = 2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\nIt was stated prior to the season that [[Auckland Rugby League]] would be concentrating much more on the club game and that no representative games would be played during it. This was in response to the 1928 season where a large representative program had been played along with the hosting of the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The Senior B competition was weakened considerably after the Kingsland team amalgamated with Grafton Athletic and moved up into the A Grade. The Senior B league was also \u2018lowered in status\u2019 with several of the stronger players moving into A grade sides.\n\nOn 23 April ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' published a lengthy summary of rugby league in [[Auckland Rugby League|Auckland]] from its beginnings in 1909 to the present day (1929).<ref>{{cite news\n| title =History of the Code/Increase in Popularity/Progress Since Inception\n| page = 17\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20237\n| date = 1929-04-23\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290423.2.170\n| accessdate = 2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\nThe Otahuhu Trotting Club wrote to the [[Auckland Rugby League]] advising them that the league could make use of two playing grounds on its property on Tennessee Avenue in [[Mangere East]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 15\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20262\n| date = 1929-05-23\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290523.2.161.5\n| accessdate = 2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n== New Clubs and Mergers ==\nOn 2 April a new club was formed in [[Papatoetoe]] after a meeting was held in their town hall. It was decided to field three junior teams.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Papatoetoe Club Formed\n| page = 12\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20221\n| date = 1929-04-04\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290404.2.129.6\n| accessdate = 2019-10-05}}</ref> This was not the [[Papatoetoe Panthers]] club which was formed at a much later date.\n\nAt a meeting of the Grafton Athletic and Kingsland Rovers League Football Clubs it was decided to amalgamate and become known as Kingsland Athletic. The meeting was attended by 80 members. They decided that their colours would be a maroon jersey with a blue and gold shield.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Amalgamation of Clubs\n| page = 14\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20225\n| date = 1929-04-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290409.2.151.4\n| accessdate = 2019-10-05}}</ref> They requested to be placed in the Senior A Grade. A lengthy discussion was held at a management committee meeting before they agreed to accept the team in the A Grade.

They played three matches. The first and third were against the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] at [[Carlaw Park]] with a loss and a win. While in a midweek match they beat Huntly by 30 points to 3 in [[Huntly]].\n\n== Rule Changes ==\nA rule change brought in for the beginning of the season was to make each half 40 minutes in length rather than 45 minutes. Another rule change occurred prior to round 5 with alterations to the play-the-ball rule. The idea was the prevent players from playing the ball to the side. Players had been allowed to turn their body and pass the ball from the foot to their own team. \u201cOn occasions the ball traveled but a few feet, which invariably resulted in players of both teams fighting for possessions on the ground. It must be said that too much of the game is wasted with players lying on the ball. Now it is necessary to play the ball, forwards or backwards, past the opposing player. Should it be kicked to the side, all players must stand outside the five yards limit before the ball can be handled by them\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Five Yards Limit\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20261\n| date = 1929-05-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290522.2.137.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-07}}</ref>\n\n== Player Losses ==\nAn ongoing issue for club league in Auckland, and indeed New Zealand were the continuing losses of top players to English clubs. Over three seasons nine players left to join professional English sides. [[Wigan Wariors|Wigan]] signed [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|L. Brown]], [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|B. Davidson]] and L. Mason, while W. Wilson Hall played for Leeds, and R. Hardgrave, T. Hall, and L. Hutt all joined [[St Helens R.F.C|St. Helens]]. T. Hanlon of the Richmond club signed for [[Broughton Rangers]] Club late in the season.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Loss of Footballer/League Code Player/Hanlon for England\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20325\n| date = 1929-08-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290805.2.106\n| accessdate = 2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\n== Improvements to Carlaw Park ==\nAfter a series of very wet matches played at [[Carlaw Park]] and many requests for improved changing and washing conditions the [[Auckland Rugby League]] met to discuss the matter. They planned to \u201cincrease the showers and add hot water installations\u201d. The [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] delegate said \u201chis club now shared the expense of a bus, and the team went to the [[Tepid Baths]] after each match. Another delegate said that hot water provision was required for curtain-raiser and other teams, which did not desire to leave the ground\u201d. The league decided to begin with the work and complete it by Saturday week.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Extension of Facilities/Provision for Players/First Representative Fixture\n| page = 18\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LX| issue=168\n| date = 1929-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19290718.2.180.1\n| accessdate = 2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October the Management Committee met regarding the improvement of accommodation at [[Carlaw Park]]. Chairman Mr. George Rhodes said that an extra stand with dressing rooms would cost \u00a312,000 which was money that the league did not have. The existing stand was taken up with 800 vice-presidents who gained free entry and so there was little revenue to be gained by adding to this area. He did however say that they were \u201ckeen to assist players in providing better dressing rooms and offices where the League could centralise its business.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =More Stand Accommodation\n| page = 18\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20382\n| date = 1929-10-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19291010.2.164.6\n| accessdate = 2019-10-09}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title= 20th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1929}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1930 Auckland Rugby League season|1930]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n== Senior Grade Competitions ==\nThe Round 6 match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and Kingsland was postponed as Richmond had traveled to [[Hikurangi]] to play against the local team which was in its second season.\n\n=== Senior A Grade Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|15||12||1||2||276||116||'''25'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]]\n|15||11||1||3||236||113||'''23'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|14||9||0||5||166||138||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|14||7||3||4||206||157||'''17'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|14||7||0||7||139||218||'''14'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Kingsland Athletic\n|13||4||1||8||133||209||'''9'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|13||3||0||10||105||161||'''6'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]\n|14||0||0||14||86||235||'''0'''\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Senior A Grade Fixtures ===\nDuring the season [[Craddock Dufty]] who had starred for [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] for several season fell out with the [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] club and asked for a transfer to [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]].

Around 1,000 spectators turned up to watch the match. [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] won a close fought match 10\u20136.\n\nAfter Round 10 was completed the [[Auckland Rugby League]] decided that the match between [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] and [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] would decide the championship. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] and saw [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] win by 13 points to 10.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1929 Senior B Grade Results\n|-\n|\n!

One of the key events of the season was the tour of the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] side.\n\nThe First Grade Championship was won by [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] who defeated [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] in the final 5\u20130. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Thistle Cup for competition points accrued during the second round of matches where they went undefeated. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy after defeating [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] in the final 17\u20139. They weren't finished yet, defeating the same opponent to win the Stormont Shield 28\u201314. This was their first time hoisting either of these trophies.\n\n[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] entered a team into the B Grade which was arguably the first ever 'reserve grade' team in Auckland club rugby league. The B Grade competition was won by [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] who defeated [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] in the final 13 points to 10. This earned [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] the right to playoff with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] who had come last in the A Grade championship. [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] who had lost all 14 of their matches in A Grade triumphed by 5 points to 0 to remain in A Grade for 1930. [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] beat [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] 11\u20130 to win the Stallard Cup which was the B Grade knockout competition.\n\n== South Sydney Tour ==\n[[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] became the first Australian club team to tour [[New Zealand]]. They played two matches against Marist at [[Carlaw Park]] on consecutive Saturdays and a midweek game against Huntly in [[Huntly]]. They were defeated in the first match 10\u20139, before winning the return match 25\u20135.\n\n== Key Events and News ==\nThe annual report for the completed 1928 season revealed that \u00a33272 was taken in gate receipts from club matches alone at [[Carlaw Park]]. The total from all matches was \u00a34573 with \u00a3517 paid to injured players. A further \u00a3609 1s 3d was spent on maintenance and improvement at [[Carlaw Park]]. Clubs were also granted \u00a3326 18s 5d and charitable causes received \u00a3142 10s 4d. League assets including [[Carlaw Park]] were reported as \u00a310,569 16s 4d, with a consolidated fund of \u00a39810 11s 9d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Position in Auckland/Large Sum to Injured Men\n| page = 18\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20211\n| date = 1929-03-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290322.2.174.4\n| accessdate = 2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\nIt was stated prior to the season that [[Auckland Rugby League]] would be concentrating much more on the club game and that no representative games would be played during it. This was in response to the 1928 season where a large representative program had been played along with the hosting of the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The Senior B competition was weakened considerably after the Kingsland team amalgamated with Grafton Athletic and moved up into the A Grade. The Senior B league was also \u2018lowered in status\u2019 with several of the stronger players moving into A grade sides.\n\nOn 23 April ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' published a lengthy summary of rugby league in [[Auckland Rugby League|Auckland]] from its beginnings in 1909 to the present day (1929).<ref>{{cite news\n| title =History of the Code/Increase in Popularity/Progress Since Inception\n| page = 17\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20237\n| date = 1929-04-23\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290423.2.170\n| accessdate = 2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\nThe Otahuhu Trotting Club wrote to the [[Auckland Rugby League]] advising them that the league could make use of two playing grounds on its property on Tennessee Avenue in [[Mangere East]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 15\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20262\n| date = 1929-05-23\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290523.2.161.5\n| accessdate = 2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n== New Clubs and Mergers ==\nOn 2 April a new club was formed in [[Papatoetoe]] after a meeting was held in their town hall.

They played three matches. The first and third were against the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] at [[Carlaw Park]] with a loss and a win. While in a midweek match they beat Huntly by 30 points to 3 in [[Huntly]].\n\n== Rule Changes ==\nA rule change brought in for the beginning of the season was to make each half 40 minutes in length rather than 45 minutes. Another rule change occurred prior to round 5 with alterations to the play-the-ball rule. The idea was the prevent players from playing the ball to the side. Players had been allowed to turn their body and pass the ball from the foot to their own team. \u201cOn occasions the ball traveled but a few feet, which invariably resulted in players of both teams fighting for possessions on the ground. It must be said that too much of the game is wasted with players lying on the ball. Now it is necessary to play the ball, forwards or backwards, past the opposing player. Should it be kicked to the side, all players must stand outside the five yards limit before the ball can be handled by them\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Five Yards Limit\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20261\n| date = 1929-05-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19290522.2.137.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-07}}</ref>\n\n== Player Losses ==\nAn ongoing issue for club league in Auckland, and indeed New Zealand were the continuing losses of top players to English clubs. Over three seasons nine players left to join professional English sides. [[Wigan Wariors|Wigan]] signed [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|L. Brown]], [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|B. Davidson]] and L. Mason, while W. Wilson Hall played for Leeds, and R. Hardgrave, T. Hall, and L. Hutt all joined [[St Helens R.F.C|St. Helens]]. T.

They planned to \u201cincrease the showers and add hot water installations\u201d. The [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] delegate said \u201chis club now shared the expense of a bus, and the team went to the [[Tepid Baths]] after each match. Another delegate said that hot water provision was required for curtain-raiser and other teams, which did not desire to leave the ground\u201d.

Chairman Mr. George Rhodes said that an extra stand with dressing rooms would cost \u00a312,000 which was money that the league did not have. The existing stand was taken up with 800 vice-presidents who gained free entry and so there was little revenue to be gained by adding to this area. He did however say that they were \u201ckeen to assist players in providing better dressing rooms and offices where the League could centralise its business.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =More Stand Accommodation\n| page = 18\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXVI| issue=20382\n| date = 1929-10-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19291010.2.164.6\n| accessdate = 2019-10-09}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title= 20th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1929}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1930 Auckland Rugby League season|1930]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n== Senior Grade Competitions ==\nThe Round 6 match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and Kingsland was postponed as Richmond had traveled to [[Hikurangi]] to play against the local team which was in its second season.\n\n=== Senior A Grade Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|15||12||1||2||276||116||'''25'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]]\n|15||11||1||3||236||113||'''23'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|14||9||0||5||166||138||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|14||7||3||4||206||157||'''17'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|14||7||0||7||139||218||'''14'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Grafton Athletic|Kingsland Athletic]]\n|13||4||1||8||133||209||'''9'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|13||3||0||10||105||161||'''6'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]\n|14||0||0||14||86||235||'''0'''\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Senior A Grade Fixtures ===\nDuring the season [[Craddock Dufty]] who had starred for [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] for several season fell out with the [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] club and asked for a transfer to [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]].
