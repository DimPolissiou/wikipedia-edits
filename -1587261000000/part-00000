As of 2018, its population was 246,452.<ref name=\"IBGE2\" /> The city covers an area of {{cvt|217|km2}}, and the average temperature is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}, which is mild for the region. The [[Sinos River]] runs through the urban area.\n\nConsolidated by German immigrants, the city was named after [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].  Novo Hamburgo's population is still predominantly of German descent.\n\nIn the 1980s, Novo Hamburgo received the nickname of \"the national capital of shoes\", attracting many athletes, tracks and companies connected to the sport. Nowadays, the city is the industrial centre of the [[Sinos River Valley]], the economy of which is based mainly on the manufacture of shoes and the associated leather goods supply chain.\n\n==History==\n\nThe area of the city was first settled by Portuguese immigrants in the mid 18th century, but it would grow to the status of village only with the arrival of the first German immigrants in 1824. At that time, Novo Hamburgo was part of  [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], the cradle of [[German Brazilian|German immigration]] in [[Brazil]]. The Germans established a prosperous agricultural colony and eventually started to supply the state's main urban centers at that time with food.\n\nSome of the immigrants also brought handicraft skills, valuable for a self-sufficient, isolated economy, as the valley and the state were at that time. In Novo Hamburgo, the first urban agglomeration appeared around the Hamburger Berg, circa 1870, where there was a little commerce. The city was emancipated from [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] on 5 April 1927, and soon joined the rest of Brazil in its run to [[industrialization]].  The city was made the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Hamburgo]] in 1980.\n\n==Emancipation==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/emancipacao/</ref>\nIn the mid 1920s, Novo Hamburgo was a sub district of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]]. At this time, the shoe industry was in full swing and there was an intense expansion of trade and an abundance of work for the service providers in the region. In 1924 this expansion prompted a group of men to create a committee with the goal of achieving emancipation for the district. These men were: [[Jacob Kroeff Neto]], [[Pedro Adams Filho]], [[Leopodo Petry]], Andr\u00e9 Klipp, Julius Kunz, Jos\u00e9 Jo\u00e3o Carlos Martins and Carlos Dienstbach.\n\nOn three occasions letters sent to the [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] council requesting emancipation were denied. Faced with this rejection the group decided to send the request to the state government. The governor at that time was [[Borges de Medeiros]] who subsequently asked the commission to submit a formal application including voter signatures requesting emancipation.\n\nThree years later on the 5 April 1927, [[Borges de Medeiros]] signed decree number 3818, known as \u201cThe order Gold\u201d creating the municipality Novo Hamburgo. On the same day decree number 3819 was signed creating an administration with a constitutional basis and allowing for the nomination of a temporary mayor. The document gave a maximum period of two months to hold an election for mayor and councillors.\n[[Jacob Kroeff Netto]] was named the first Provisional Mayor of Novo Hamburgo by Borges, under decree number 3820.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Hydrography===\n\nNovo Hamburgo is part of the [[River Sinos basin]]. The city is divided into four basins, formed by Pampa creek, Cerquinho creek, Luiz Rau creek and Gauchinha creek. As well as these, there are several creeks that flow into the v\u00e1rzea region of the Sinos, both on the north bank of the river and in the south.\n\n===Climate===\n\nNovo Hamburgo has four well defined seasons. In winter, temperatures can hover around {{cvt|0|\u00b0C}}, and in some instances can reach {{cvt|-2|to(-)|-1|\u00b0C}}. In the summer the temperatures get high, often above {{cvt|30|\u00b0C}}. The average temperature of Novo Hamburgo during the year is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Novo Hamburgo\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|width = 100%\n|collapsed =\n|Jan high C =\t29.3\n|Feb high C =\t28.4\n|Mar high C =\t26.3\n|Apr high C =\t23.4\n|May high C =\t20.4\n|Jun high C =\t19.3\n|Jul high C =\t19.5\n|Aug high C =\t20.8\n|Sep high C =\t22.7\n|Oct high C =\t25\n|Nov high C =\t27.4\n|Dec high C =\t26.6\n|year high C =\t24.1\n|Jan mean C =\t24.5\n|Feb mean C =\t23.9\n|Mar mean C =\t21.8\n|Apr mean C =\t18.9\n|May mean C =\t16\n|Jun mean C =\t14.8\n|Jul mean C =\t14.9\n|Aug mean C =\t16.1\n|Sep mean C =\t17.9\n|Oct mean C =\t20\n|Nov mean C =\t22.2\n|Dec mean C =\t21.8\n|year mean C =\t19.4\n|Jan low C =\t19.8\n|Feb low C =\t19.4\n|Mar low C =\t17.4\n|Apr low C =\t14.4\n|May low C =\t11.7\n|Jun low C =\t10.4\n|Jul low C =\t10.4\n|Aug low C =\t11.5\n|Sep low C =\t13.1\n|Oct low C =\t15.1\n|Nov low C =\t17\n|Dec low C =\t17.1\n|year low C =\t14.8\n|precipitation colour =\tgreen\n|Jan precipitation mm =\t126\n|Feb precipitation mm =\t124\n|Mar precipitation mm =\t128\n|Apr precipitation mm =\t110\n|May precipitation mm =\t107\n|Jun precipitation mm =\t131\n|Jul precipitation mm =\t123\n|Aug precipitation mm =\t126\n|Sep precipitation mm =\t143\n|Oct precipitation mm =\t124\n|Nov precipitation mm =\t106\n|Dec precipitation mm =\t119\n|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Industry==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is most famous for its footwear industry.<ref name=\"novohamburgo.org\">http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/industria-comercio-e-servicos/</ref> The footwear manufacturing industry came about quite quickly, and led to Novo Hamburgo being recognized as the Capital of Brazilian Footwear. The city also has industries in the area of pharmacy, cosmetics, furniture, food, appliances, clothing, graphic art, electronics, chemical and constructions.\n\nThis industry also spread into neighboring towns, with many tanneries, chemical plants and shoe component factories being opened.\nOne example of this industry is the National Fair of Shoes held annually in Fenac. This fair was started locally in 1963 held in a small neighbourhood convention centre. Today, [[Fenac]] is not only home to this fair but also other related fairs such as Fimec (footwear machines exhibition), and Courovis\u00e3o Ecovis\u00e3o (Leather Fair).\n\nA new Industrial District is being planned in the area of [[Lomba Grande]], however some locals have voiced concerns that this construction may have environmental implications.\n\n===Export===\nIt is estimated that about 80% of Brazilian exports of shoes come out of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], with Novo Hamburgo being the center of these operations.<ref name=\"novohamburgo.org\"/> Novo Hamburgo has developed a complete infrastructure for production, marketing and trading of footwear, and now has the largest movement of containers in [[Brazil]]. The export of shoes is currently worth about two billion dollars.\n\n==Shops and services==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is the largest commercial area of [[Sinos River Valley]], with more than 5,500 outlets, including major Brazilian chain stores such as Magazine Luiza, [[Lojas Renner]], [[C&A]], [[Lojas Americanas]], [[Casas Bahia]], [[Ponto Frio]], [[Lojas Colombo]] and Delta Sul.\n\nIn the shopping district there are four large supermarkets([[Wal-Mart, recently sold by the parent multinational and now under different ownership]]), [[Carrefour]], Bourbon ([[Zaffari]]) and Hiper Rissul. There are two malls in this city: Bourbon Shopping Novo Hamburgo and i-Fashion Outlet.\n\nExample of the service industry are cargo agents, brokers, export agents, trading companies as well as the presence of important banks.\n\n==Theatre==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/lazer/teatro/</ref> \n[[File:Teatro Feevale.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre Feevale.]]\nThe Paschoal Charlemagne Theatre located at the Culture Department of Novo Hamburgo, has a capacity for approximately 490 people. Paran\u00f3ia Productions has a school in the theatre trains local actors. The school has sent students to the biggest cities of the country to work inplays and shows.\n\n<ref>http://www.feevale.br/internas/vwImprensaVisualizar.asp?intIdSecao=2575&intIdConteudo=48472&dteDataPublicacao=2011/09/23/</ref> The [[Feevale University]] inaugurated on 20 September 2011 the largest theatre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul with a capacity to 1.805 spectators in Novo Hamburgo. The theatre was built in the campus II of the university. It is administered in partnership with Opus Promotions.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Evangelic School Hamburgo Velho.jpg|thumb|right|The first students of the Evangelical Foundation Teachers and Founders.]]\n\nThe first school in Novo Hamburgo was founded in 1832, called Comunidade Evang\u00e9lica Hamburgo Velho (Old Hamburg Evangelic Community).<ref>http://www.historiaehistoria.com.br/materia.cfm?tb=artigos&id=151</ref> The school taught through the [[German language]] as that was the most common language at that time. The teaching material was poor and the provincial government was giving them little support. The central government at the time had no interest in investing in education and therefore would not release funds to the different provinces.\n\nIn 1833 there were only two public schools, in 1866 a school for girls was founded by a group of Nuns - The Engel Sisters located in the [[Hamburgo Velho]] neighborhood. which would become a \"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Evang\u00e9lica\" (Evangelic Foundation). The creation of this school was a big step for women's education, although still largely focused on traditional values such as child rearing and home care.\n\nThe first Catholic school created in the town was Santa Catarina college founded on the 10 June 1900<ref>http://pt.scribd.com/doc/33658980/Livro-Colegio-Santa-Catarina-100-Anos-de-Historia</ref> by the Sisters Maria Romualda Flash and Maria Julitta Schwark, who were invited to come to the Hamburg Berg region (which would later become Hamburgo Velho) by several families - Czermak, Carlos Klein, Jos\u00e9 Kroeff, Jo\u00e3o Altmeyer, Zimmer and Plentz.\n\nThe Jesuit [[priests]] arrived in the [[Sinos River Valley]] region in the mid-nineteenth century and took over the Church Nossa Senhora da Piedade in [[Hamburgo Velho]]. In 1914, the Priest Benedict Meienhofer organized the opening of a Catholic school for boys, which was called St. Jacob's college.\n[[File:Campus II.jpg|thumb|right|Feevale University.]]\nIn 1927, the year when Novo Hamburgo was emancipated, there were seven state schools in the city, with a total of 374 students, one state school with 72 students and six private schools with 478 students. In 1930 there were eight state schools, six city run schools and eight private schools, with the student population rising to 1,477.\n\nThe [[Vargas Era]] (1930\u20131945) represented a significant advance in Brazilian education. This educational revolution also had an impact in Novo Hamburgo. In 1943, the city schools had grown to a total of 35, with a total of 3668 students.\n \nThe main educational institutions in Novo Hamburgo today are:\n\n* Ceducs Centro de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Superior\n* Col\u00e9gio Marista Pio XII\n* Col\u00e9gio Santa Catarina\n* Faculdade IENH \u2014 Institui\u00e7\u00e3o Evang\u00e9lica do Novo Hamburgo\n* Ftec Faculdades\n* Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Escola T\u00e9cnica Liberato Salzano V da Cunha\n* Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul\n* [[Universidade Feevale]]\n\n==Tourism==\n\n[[File:Schmitt-Presser.JPG|thumb|right|[[Schmitt-Presser]] Museum.]]\n[[File:Foundation Scheffel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Foundation Scheffel]].]]\nNovo Hamburgo is one of 13 charming cities on the [[Rota Rom\u00e2ntica]], a scenic bypass of Brazilian cities in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] with heavy Germanic influence.  Other cities on the [[Rota Rom\u00e2ntica]] are [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], [[Est\u00e2ncia Velha]], [[Ivoti]], [[Dois Irm\u00e3os]], [[Morro Reuter]], [[Santa Maria do Herval]], [[Presidente Lucena]], [[Picada Caf\u00e9]], [[Nova Petr\u00f3polis]], [[Gramado]], [[Canela, Rio Grande do Sul|Canela]] and [[S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul|S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula]].\n\nIn the historical centre which is located in the Hamburgo Velho neighbourhood, there are still some half-timbered buildings constructed in the same technique, as the Community [[Schmitt-Presser Museum]] (first exemplary technique protected by IPHAN in Brazil).\nThere are also the works of the German architect Ernst Seubert, some of his known buildings are the [[Church of Reis Magos]] (IECLB), the [[Church of Our Lady of Mercy]], [[Bakery Reiss]] (\"Padaria Reiss\"), [[Schmitt House]] (\"Casa Rosa\") and [[Municipal Public Library Machado De Assis]]. Also noteworthy is the neoclassical building of the [[Ernesto Frederico Scheffel Foundation]].\n\nThere is a \"historic-cultural street\" called Rua General Os\u00f3rio, along which there are dozens of historic buildings from various periods. Notable buildings along this street are the [[St. Catherine College]], the building of the former [[Frohsin Society]], designed by the German architect Theo Wiederspahn, the homes of the families Richter, Klein, Momberger, Snel, and Grunner, This street is recognized by the City Master Plan as an area of historical and cultural interest.\n\nThe downtown area has landmarks such as the [[Monument to the Shoemaker]], [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis Gonzaga]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Ascension]], both historical constructions of the 1950s. The latter follows the Gothic style, with pure forms of the original Gothic architecture. There are also dozens of eclectic houses distributed among this historical area, but these are not officially recognized. The city also presents some interesting examples of modernism, especially residences built in the period 1950\u20131960.\n\n===Natural Attractions Lomba Grande===\n<ref>[[:pt:Lomba Grande]]</ref>\nIt is the Rural District of Novo Hamburgo, occupied an area of 156 square kilometers, making a total of two thirds of the municipal area. It is considered environmentally protected area where the wetlands of the [[Sinos River]] is very important for the preservation of the ecosystem, both [[fauna]] as [[flora]].\n\n[[Lomba Grande]] also received the first [[Germans|German]] [[immigrants]] who settled in the Hemp Linen factory, then owned by the municipality of [[Sao Leopoldo]]. Today provides one of the main points of visiting the city, where the natural attractions of the neighborhood next to developments designed for leisure and tourism attracts many tourists.\n<ref>http://lombagrande.blogspot.com/</ref>\nThey are [[horse racing]], recreational sites, [[resorts]], environmental education center, allowing tourists to enjoy outdoor activities such as horseback riding, [[adventure tourism]], contact with [[animals]], recreation, [[swimming pools]], [[mountain biking]], among a host of other activities.\n\n<ref>http://www.lombagrande.org.br/index.htm</ref>\nAlso in Lomba Grande that are harvested without pesticides the [[horticultural]] trade shows that cater to the rural producer in some properties of family farms and cooperatives produce colonial products and integrals.\nThere are restaurants offering food fresh from the colonial neighborhood itself. The neighborhood also has many cultural attractions such as [[church (building)|churches]], [[cemeteries]] and a roadmap that includes visits to artists.\n\n==Economy and society==\n\nThe [[Germans|German]] craftsmen eventually started to manufacture shoes and machinery on a large scale and in the 1960s began to export goods, a process that transformed the city into a magnet for internal immigrants from impoverished areas around the state and the country. This caused significant demographic growth that was not accompanied by the infrastructure needed to accommodate the recently arrived population; [[favelas]] then formed, which are the source of many of today's social problems.\nToday's Novo Hamburgo depends heavily upon shoe exports, although it diversified its industrial and commercial base in the early 1990s.\n\n==Newspapers==\n<ref>https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:h2b2d1ZZERgJ:paginas.ufrgs.br/alcar/encontros-nacionais-1/2o-encontro-2004-1/A%2520HISTORIA%2520DO%2520JORNALISMO%2520EM%2520NOVO%2520HAMBURGO.doc+jornal+monoclo+novo+hamburgo&hl=en&gl=ie&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg7VbgAlmKl69YlkA6WJ204m2o4hL9Dw6bKd0txK1619LF8sFwN90VavRSxwN7379hg3bFvdibkShHMy3wXw4aNT60jwieXa1o4Ccx1WlxXkyHGzWdl1cmJe24EIKVu5G2etLCK&sig=AHIEtbQ9D-3CjLWfCtWu_4K4wqb_4bL28A</ref>\nIn 1918 the first newspaper called the Monoclo was registered and circulated, the paper was directed by Arnaldo Mayer and distributed on Saturdays. This newspaper had a short life, lasting only nine issues, this was during the period in which [[Hamburguer Berg]] was still a district of [[Sao Leopoldo]]. There are reports that the Monoclo had an important role in the fight for emancipation of Novo Hamburgo city, despite having closed its activities before Novo Hamburgo was emancipated.\n\nThe ''5 Abril'' newspaper is considered the first newspaper published in the city of Novo Hamburgo, this was set up by [[Leopoldo Petry]] who decided to create the newspaper to defend the interests of the city. The ''5 Abril'' newspapers were published weekly in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], but with [[Advertising|ads]] in [[German language|German]]. The newspaper lasted 35 years, completing 1811 editions. There were four pages per issue and 200 to 300 copies were distributed each week. These were significant numbers for the period, given that the [[German language]] was predominant among the 8,500 inhabitants.<ref name=\"unirevista.unisinos.br\">http://www.unirevista.unisinos.br/_pdf/UNIrev_Machado.PDF</ref> Over the next 30 to 50 years, there were several newspapers that began publishing in Novo Hamburgo such as:\n\n* The Novo Hamburgo newspaper directed by Anthony Benfica Filho,\n* The Intriga newspaper (1931).\n* Pau na Nunca newspaper (1931);\n* Gazeta Novo Hamburgo, led by Octavian Barreto de Borba (1934);\n* Gazeta newspaper (1948);\n* Evolucao newspaper (1953);\n* Correio Gaucho (1955);\n* Jornal NH (1960).\n\nThe development of \u201c[[ga\u00facho]]\u201d journalism generated opportunities for the creation of new newspapers in such as the Jornal SL in 1957 in [[Sao Leopoldo]] and [[Jornal NH]], in 1960 in Novo Hamburgo. Today, with more than 250,000 inhabitants, Novo Hamburgo is the seventh most populated city in the state. Jornal NH is the largest newspaper in the region, one of the largest published in the state and the largest newspaper in Brazil outside a major metropolitan area, by number of subscribers. Jornal NH is part of Grupo Sinos, a conglomerate of regional newspapers, magazines, radio and digital content.\n\n===Radio===\n<ref name=\"unirevista.unisinos.br\"/>\nThe first broadcast in Novo Hamburgo was Radio Hamburguense Progresso in 1948, directed by Milton Vergara Corr\u00eaa.

It is affectionately known as Anilado among fans. The club dispute some championships. The club was founded on 1 May 1911 by a group of employees of the extinct Adams shoe factory.\nSince then, the Hamburguenses could watch in the victories of team the Santa Rosa Stadium.\nThe stadium was sold in 2005, and a new stadium was built in 2011, called [[Est\u00e1dio do Vale]].\n\nTennis is another sport very important in Novo Hamburgo. The city featured athletes like [[Fernando Roese]], [[Paulo Taicher]], [[Tom\u00e1s Behrend]], [[Andr\u00e9 Heller]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Ghem]].\n\nThere are some places that offer tennis courts and host sport competitions such as Sociedade Gin\u00e1stica, Alian\u00e7a and Wallau Centro de Esportes.\n\nIn the city, it is also possible to practice or attend games and competitions in tennis, volleyball, punhobol, futsal, archery, handball, bicycle motocross, among other activities.\n\n==Metro==\n\n<ref>http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rs_linhaspoa/novohamb.htm</ref>\nThe history of the railways of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] date back to 1866 with proposals for construction in the [[Sinos River Valley]] region. On 14 April 1874, the first train track between [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Sao Leopoldo]] was completed. This was constructed by a British Company called ''[[The Porto Alegre & New Hamburg Brazilian Railway Company Limited]]''. Owned by Johan Mac Ginity.\n\nThe first train arrived in Novo Hamburgo on 1 January 1876. The station was named Novo Hamburgo Station. The railway did not go through the village of [[Hamburguer Berg]], the station was built some 3&nbsp;km away thus, a new urban area began to develop around the railway station. Only in 1882 the Novo Hamburgo station was connected at the village which was named as Hamburguer Berg, this line eventually was extended to [[Canela, Rio Grande do Sul|Canela]] in 1922.\n\nIn 1919, the Novo Hamburgo station was renamed Borges de Medeiros, reflecting the anti-German sentiment caused by Great War and also Hamburg Berg was renamed Genuine Sampaio. However, Novo Hamburgo station returned to the original name in 1920 and Hamburguer Berg received its current name of [[Hamburgo Velho]].\n\nIn 1964, the Novo Hamburgo to [[Taquara]] line was closed, leaving Novo Hamburgo station as the end point of the line. In late 1966, the rest of section, Rio dos Sinos to Novo Hamburgo stations was abolished and the station was deactivated.\n\nIn 2008 the Federal government authorized the expansion of [[Porto Alegre Metro]] train services to Novo Hamburgo. The works started in early 2009 and is expected to be completed 2013. This project includes the construction of an additional 9.3 kilometres and four new stations: Rio dos Sinos, in the municipality of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], Liberdade, Fenac and Novo Hamburgo, in the city of Novo Hamburgo.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Maicon (footballer born 1981)|Maicon]] (born 1981), football player\n* [[Muriel Gustavo Becker]] (born 1987), football player\n* [[Alisson]] (born 1992), football goalkeeper\n* [[Matheus Leist]], racing driver\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Novo Hamburgo}}\n* [http://www.novohamburgo.rs.gov.br Novo Hamburgo Local Government]\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=novo+hamburgo,+brazil&ie=UTF8&z=13&om=1 Novo Hamburgo detailed city Street Map]\n\n{{Municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul}}\n{{Rota Rom\u00e2ntica}}\n\n[[Category:Novo Hamburgo]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1832]]\n[[Category:German-Brazilian culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name            = City of Novo Hamburgo\n| nickname                 = National Capital of Shoes\n| motto                    =\n| website                  = [http://www.novohamburgo.rs.gov.br novohamburgo.rs.gov.br]\n| image_skyline            = Viewnovohamburgo.JPG\n| image_caption            = \n| image_flag               = Bandeira de Novo Hamburgo.svg\n| image_seal               = Bras\u00e3o de Novo Hamburgo.svg\n| image_map                = Locator map of Novo Hamburgo in Rio Grande do Sul.svg\n| map_caption              = Location in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]]\n| subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_type1        = [[Regions of Brazil|Region]]\n| subdivision_type2        = [[States of Brazil|State]]\n| subdivision_name         = {{BRA}}\n| subdivision_name1        = [[South Region, Brazil|South]] \n| subdivision_name2        = [[Rio Grande do Sul]]\n| leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n| leader_name              = F\u00e1tima Daudt ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]])\n| established_title        = Founded\n| established_date         = 1832\n| established_title2       = Incorporated\n| established_date2        = 1927\n| area_footnotes           =\n| area_total_km2           = 224\n| population_footnotes     =\n| population_as_of         = 2018 est.<ref name=\"IBGE2\">{{cite web |title=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|url=ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Estimativas_de_Populacao/Estimativas_2018/estimativa_dou_2018_20181019.pdf |year=2018 |quote=2018 Estimates of Population |accessdate=6 March 2019 |language=pt-BR |format=PDF}}</ref>\n| population_total         = 246452\n| population_density_km2   = auto\n| timezone                 = [[UTC|UTC\u22123]]\n| utc_offset               = -3\n| timezone_DST             = [[UTC|UTC\u22122]]\n| utc_offset_DST           = -2\n| coordinates              = {{coord|29|40|40|S|51|07|51|W|region:BR|display=inline,title}}\n| elevation_footnotes      =\n| elevation_m              = 57\n| footnotes                =\n}}\n'''Novo Hamburgo''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''New [[Hamburg]]''; {{lang-de|Neu-Hamburg}}) is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the southernmost [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], located in the [[metropolitan area]] of [[Porto Alegre]], the state capital. As of 2018, its population was 246,452.<ref name=\"IBGE2\" /> The city covers an area of {{cvt|217|km2}}, and the average temperature is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}, which is mild for the region. The [[Sinos River]] runs through the urban area.\n\nConsolidated by German immigrants, the city was named after [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].  Novo Hamburgo's population is still predominantly of German descent.\n\nIn the 1980s, Novo Hamburgo received the nickname of \"the national capital of shoes\", attracting many athletes, tracks and companies connected to the sport. Nowadays, the city is the industrial centre of the [[Sinos River Valley]], the economy of which is based mainly on the manufacture of shoes and the associated leather goods supply chain.\n\n==History==\n\nThe area of the city was first settled by Portuguese immigrants in the mid 18th century, but it would grow to the status of village only with the arrival of the first German immigrants in 1824. At that time, Novo Hamburgo was part of  [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], the cradle of [[German Brazilian|German immigration]] in [[Brazil]]. The Germans established a prosperous agricultural colony and eventually started to supply the state's main urban centers at that time with food.\n\nSome of the immigrants also brought handicraft skills, valuable for a self-sufficient, isolated economy, as the valley and the state were at that time. In Novo Hamburgo, the first urban agglomeration appeared around the Hamburger Berg, circa 1870, where there was a little commerce. The city was emancipated from [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] on 5 April 1927, and soon joined the rest of Brazil in its run to [[industrialization]].  The city was made the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Hamburgo]] in 1980.\n\n==Emancipation==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/emancipacao/</ref>\nIn the mid 1920s, Novo Hamburgo was a sub district of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]]. At this time, the shoe industry was in full swing and there was an intense expansion of trade and an abundance of work for the service providers in the region. In 1924 this expansion prompted a group of men to create a committee with the goal of achieving emancipation for the district. These men were: [[Jacob Kroeff Neto]], [[Pedro Adams Filho]], [[Leopodo Petry]], Andr\u00e9 Klipp, Julius Kunz, Jos\u00e9 Jo\u00e3o Carlos Martins and Carlos Dienstbach.\n\nOn three occasions letters sent to the [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] council requesting emancipation were denied. Faced with this rejection the group decided to send the request to the state government. The governor at that time was [[Borges de Medeiros]] who subsequently asked the commission to submit a formal application including voter signatures requesting emancipation.\n\nThree years later on the 5 April 1927, [[Borges de Medeiros]] signed decree number 3818, known as \u201cThe order Gold\u201d creating the municipality Novo Hamburgo. On the same day decree number 3819 was signed creating an administration with a constitutional basis and allowing for the nomination of a temporary mayor. The document gave a maximum period of two months to hold an election for mayor and councillors.\n[[Jacob Kroeff Netto]] was named the first Provisional Mayor of Novo Hamburgo by Borges, under decree number 3820.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Hydrography===\n\nNovo Hamburgo is part of the [[River Sinos basin]]. The city is divided into four basins, formed by Pampa creek, Cerquinho creek, Luiz Rau creek and Gauchinha creek. As well as these, there are several creeks that flow into the v\u00e1rzea region of the Sinos, both on the north bank of the river and in the south.\n\n===Climate===\n\nNovo Hamburgo has four well defined seasons. In winter, temperatures can hover around {{cvt|0|\u00b0C}}, and in some instances can reach {{cvt|-2|to(-)|-1|\u00b0C}}. In the summer the temperatures get high, often above {{cvt|30|\u00b0C}}. The average temperature of Novo Hamburgo during the year is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Novo Hamburgo\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|width = 100%\n|collapsed =\n|Jan high C =\t29.3\n|Feb high C =\t28.4\n|Mar high C =\t26.3\n|Apr high C =\t23.4\n|May high C =\t20.4\n|Jun high C =\t19.3\n|Jul high C =\t19.5\n|Aug high C =\t20.8\n|Sep high C =\t22.7\n|Oct high C =\t25\n|Nov high C =\t27.4\n|Dec high C =\t26.6\n|year high C =\t24.1\n|Jan mean C =\t24.5\n|Feb mean C =\t23.9\n|Mar mean C =\t21.8\n|Apr mean C =\t18.9\n|May mean C =\t16\n|Jun mean C =\t14.8\n|Jul mean C =\t14.9\n|Aug mean C =\t16.1\n|Sep mean C =\t17.9\n|Oct mean C =\t20\n|Nov mean C =\t22.2\n|Dec mean C =\t21.8\n|year mean C =\t19.4\n|Jan low C =\t19.8\n|Feb low C =\t19.4\n|Mar low C =\t17.4\n|Apr low C =\t14.4\n|May low C =\t11.7\n|Jun low C =\t10.4\n|Jul low C =\t10.4\n|Aug low C =\t11.5\n|Sep low C =\t13.1\n|Oct low C =\t15.1\n|Nov low C =\t17\n|Dec low C =\t17.1\n|year low C =\t14.8\n|precipitation colour =\tgreen\n|Jan precipitation mm =\t126\n|Feb precipitation mm =\t124\n|Mar precipitation mm =\t128\n|Apr precipitation mm =\t110\n|May precipitation mm =\t107\n|Jun precipitation mm =\t131\n|Jul precipitation mm =\t123\n|Aug precipitation mm =\t126\n|Sep precipitation mm =\t143\n|Oct precipitation mm =\t124\n|Nov precipitation mm =\t106\n|Dec precipitation mm =\t119\n|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Industry==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is most famous for its footwear industry.<ref name=\"novohamburgo.org\">http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/industria-comercio-e-servicos/</ref> The footwear manufacturing industry came about quite quickly, and led to Novo Hamburgo being recognized as the Capital of Brazilian Footwear. The city also has industries in the area of pharmacy, cosmetics, furniture, food, appliances, clothing, graphic art, electronics, chemical and constructions.\n\nThis industry also spread into neighboring towns, with many tanneries, chemical plants and shoe component factories being opened.\nOne example of this industry is the National Fair of Shoes held annually in Fenac. This fair was started locally in 1963 held in a small neighbourhood convention centre. Today, [[Fenac]] is not only home to this fair but also other related fairs such as Fimec (footwear machines exhibition), and Courovis\u00e3o Ecovis\u00e3o (Leather Fair).\n\nA new Industrial District is being planned in the area of [[Lomba Grande]], however some locals have voiced concerns that this construction may have environmental implications.\n\n===Export===\nIt is estimated that about 80% of Brazilian exports of shoes come out of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], with Novo Hamburgo being the center of these operations.<ref name=\"novohamburgo.org\"/> Novo Hamburgo has developed a complete infrastructure for production, marketing and trading of footwear, and now has the largest movement of containers in [[Brazil]]. The export of shoes is currently worth about two billion dollars.\n\n==Shops and services==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is the largest commercial area of [[Sinos River Valley]], with more than 5,500 outlets, including major Brazilian chain stores such as Magazine Luiza, [[Lojas Renner]], [[C&A]], [[Lojas Americanas]], [[Casas Bahia]], [[Ponto Frio]], [[Lojas Colombo]] and Delta Sul.\n\nIn the shopping district there are four large supermarkets([[Wal-Mart, recently sold by the parent multinational and now under different ownership]]), [[Carrefour]], Bourbon ([[Zaffari]]) and Hiper Rissul. There are two malls in this city: Bourbon Shopping Novo Hamburgo and i-Fashion Outlet.\n\nExample of the service industry are cargo agents, brokers, export agents, trading companies as well as the presence of important banks.\n\n==Theatre==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/lazer/teatro/</ref> \n[[File:Teatro Feevale.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre Feevale.]]\nThe Paschoal Charlemagne Theatre located at the Culture Department of Novo Hamburgo, has a capacity for approximately 490 people. Paran\u00f3ia Productions has a school in the theatre trains local actors. The school has sent students to the biggest cities of the country to work inplays and shows.\n\n<ref>http://www.feevale.br/internas/vwImprensaVisualizar.asp?intIdSecao=2575&intIdConteudo=48472&dteDataPublicacao=2011/09/23/</ref> The [[Feevale University]] inaugurated on 20 September 2011 the largest theatre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul with a capacity to 1.805 spectators in Novo Hamburgo. The theatre was built in the campus II of the university. It is administered in partnership with Opus Promotions.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Evangelic School Hamburgo Velho.jpg|thumb|right|The first students of the Evangelical Foundation Teachers and Founders.]]\n\nThe first school in Novo Hamburgo was founded in 1832, called Comunidade Evang\u00e9lica Hamburgo Velho (Old Hamburg Evangelic Community).<ref>http://www.historiaehistoria.com.br/materia.cfm?tb=artigos&id=151</ref> The school taught through the [[German language]] as that was the most common language at that time. The teaching material was poor and the provincial government was giving them little support. The central government at the time had no interest in investing in education and therefore would not release funds to the different provinces.\n\nIn 1833 there were only two public schools, in 1866 a school for girls was founded by a group of Nuns - The Engel Sisters located in the [[Hamburgo Velho]] neighborhood. which would become a \"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Evang\u00e9lica\" (Evangelic Foundation). The creation of this school was a big step for women's education, although still largely focused on traditional values such as child rearing and home care.\n\nThe first Catholic school created in the town was Santa Catarina college founded on the 10 June 1900<ref>http://pt.scribd.com/doc/33658980/Livro-Colegio-Santa-Catarina-100-Anos-de-Historia</ref> by the Sisters Maria Romualda Flash and Maria Julitta Schwark, who were invited to come to the Hamburg Berg region (which would later become Hamburgo Velho) by several families - Czermak, Carlos Klein, Jos\u00e9 Kroeff, Jo\u00e3o Altmeyer, Zimmer and Plentz.\n\nThe Jesuit [[priests]] arrived in the [[Sinos River Valley]] region in the mid-nineteenth century and took over the Church Nossa Senhora da Piedade in [[Hamburgo Velho]]. In 1914, the Priest Benedict Meienhofer organized the opening of a Catholic school for boys, which was called St. Jacob's college.\n[[File:Campus II.jpg|thumb|right|Feevale University.]]\nIn 1927, the year when Novo Hamburgo was emancipated, there were seven state schools in the city, with a total of 374 students, one state school with 72 students and six private schools with 478 students. In 1930 there were eight state schools, six city run schools and eight private schools, with the student population rising to 1,477.\n\nThe [[Vargas Era]] (1930\u20131945) represented a significant advance in Brazilian education. This educational revolution also had an impact in Novo Hamburgo. In 1943, the city schools had grown to a total of 35, with a total of 3668 students.\n \nThe main educational institutions in Novo Hamburgo today are:\n\n* Ceducs Centro de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Superior\n* Col\u00e9gio Marista Pio XII\n* Col\u00e9gio Santa Catarina\n* Faculdade IENH \u2014 Institui\u00e7\u00e3o Evang\u00e9lica do Novo Hamburgo\n* Ftec Faculdades\n* Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Escola T\u00e9cnica Liberato Salzano V da Cunha\n* Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul\n* [[Universidade Feevale]]\n\n==Tourism==\n\n[[File:Schmitt-Presser.JPG|thumb|right|[[Schmitt-Presser]] Museum.]]\n[[File:Foundation Scheffel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Foundation Scheffel]].]]\nNovo Hamburgo is one of 13 charming cities on the [[Rota Rom\u00e2ntica]], a scenic bypass of Brazilian cities in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] with heavy Germanic influence.  Other cities on the [[Rota Rom\u00e2ntica]] are [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], [[Est\u00e2ncia Velha]], [[Ivoti]], [[Dois Irm\u00e3os]], [[Morro Reuter]], [[Santa Maria do Herval]], [[Presidente Lucena]], [[Picada Caf\u00e9]], [[Nova Petr\u00f3polis]], [[Gramado]], [[Canela, Rio Grande do Sul|Canela]] and [[S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul|S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula]].\n\nIn the historical centre which is located in the Hamburgo Velho neighbourhood, there are still some half-timbered buildings constructed in the same technique, as the Community [[Schmitt-Presser Museum]] (first exemplary technique protected by IPHAN in Brazil).\nThere are also the works of the German architect Ernst Seubert, some of his known buildings are the [[Church of Reis Magos]] (IECLB), the [[Church of Our Lady of Mercy]], [[Bakery Reiss]] (\"Padaria Reiss\"), [[Schmitt House]] (\"Casa Rosa\") and [[Municipal Public Library Machado De Assis]]. Also noteworthy is the neoclassical building of the [[Ernesto Frederico Scheffel Foundation]].\n\nThere is a \"historic-cultural street\" called Rua General Os\u00f3rio, along which there are dozens of historic buildings from various periods. Notable buildings along this street are the [[St. Catherine College]], the building of the former [[Frohsin Society]], designed by the German architect Theo Wiederspahn, the homes of the families Richter, Klein, Momberger, Snel, and Grunner, This street is recognized by the City Master Plan as an area of historical and cultural interest.\n\nThe downtown area has landmarks such as the [[Monument to the Shoemaker]], [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis Gonzaga]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Ascension]], both historical constructions of the 1950s. The latter follows the Gothic style, with pure forms of the original Gothic architecture. There are also dozens of eclectic houses distributed among this historical area, but these are not officially recognized. The city also presents some interesting examples of modernism, especially residences built in the period 1950\u20131960.\n\n===Natural Attractions Lomba Grande===\n<ref>[[:pt:Lomba Grande]]</ref>\nIt is the Rural District of Novo Hamburgo, occupied an area of 156 square kilometers, making a total of two thirds of the municipal area. It is considered environmentally protected area where the wetlands of the [[Sinos River]] is very important for the preservation of the ecosystem, both [[fauna]] as [[flora]].\n\n[[Lomba Grande]] also received the first [[Germans|German]] [[immigrants]] who settled in the Hemp Linen factory, then owned by the municipality of [[Sao Leopoldo]]. Today provides one of the main points of visiting the city, where the natural attractions of the neighborhood next to developments designed for leisure and tourism attracts many tourists.\n<ref>http://lombagrande.blogspot.com/</ref>\nThey are [[horse racing]], recreational sites, [[resorts]], environmental education center, allowing tourists to enjoy outdoor activities such as horseback riding, [[adventure tourism]], contact with [[animals]], recreation, [[swimming pools]], [[mountain biking]], among a host of other activities.\n\n<ref>http://www.lombagrande.org.br/index.htm</ref>\nAlso in Lomba Grande that are harvested without pesticides the [[horticultural]] trade shows that cater to the rural producer in some properties of family farms and cooperatives produce colonial products and integrals.\nThere are restaurants offering food fresh from the colonial neighborhood itself. The neighborhood also has many cultural attractions such as [[church (building)|churches]], [[cemeteries]] and a roadmap that includes visits to artists.\n\n==Economy and society==\n\nThe [[Germans|German]] craftsmen eventually started to manufacture shoes and machinery on a large scale and in the 1960s began to export goods, a process that transformed the city into a magnet for internal immigrants from impoverished areas around the state and the country. This caused significant demographic growth that was not accompanied by the infrastructure needed to accommodate the recently arrived population; [[favelas]] then formed, which are the source of many of today's social problems.\nToday's Novo Hamburgo depends heavily upon shoe exports, although it diversified its industrial and commercial base in the early 1990s.\n\n==Newspapers==\n<ref>https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:h2b2d1ZZERgJ:paginas.ufrgs.br/alcar/encontros-nacionais-1/2o-encontro-2004-1/A%2520HISTORIA%2520DO%2520JORNALISMO%2520EM%2520NOVO%2520HAMBURGO.doc+jornal+monoclo+novo+hamburgo&hl=en&gl=ie&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg7VbgAlmKl69YlkA6WJ204m2o4hL9Dw6bKd0txK1619LF8sFwN90VavRSxwN7379hg3bFvdibkShHMy3wXw4aNT60jwieXa1o4Ccx1WlxXkyHGzWdl1cmJe24EIKVu5G2etLCK&sig=AHIEtbQ9D-3CjLWfCtWu_4K4wqb_4bL28A</ref>\nIn 1918 the first newspaper called the Monoclo was registered and circulated, the paper was directed by Arnaldo Mayer and distributed on Saturdays. This newspaper had a short life, lasting only nine issues, this was during the period in which [[Hamburguer Berg]] was still a district of [[Sao Leopoldo]]. There are reports that the Monoclo had an important role in the fight for emancipation of Novo Hamburgo city, despite having closed its activities before Novo Hamburgo was emancipated.\n\nThe ''5 Abril'' newspaper is considered the first newspaper published in the city of Novo Hamburgo, this was set up by [[Leopoldo Petry]] who decided to create the newspaper to defend the interests of the city. The ''5 Abril'' newspapers were published weekly in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], but with [[Advertising|ads]] in [[German language|German]]. The newspaper lasted 35 years, completing 1811 editions. There were four pages per issue and 200 to 300 copies were distributed each week. These were significant numbers for the period, given that the [[German language]] was predominant among the 8,500 inhabitants.<ref name=\"unirevista.unisinos.br\">http://www.unirevista.unisinos.br/_pdf/UNIrev_Machado.PDF</ref> Over the next 30 to 50 years, there were several newspapers that began publishing in Novo Hamburgo such as:\n\n* The Novo Hamburgo newspaper directed by Anthony Benfica Filho,\n* The Intriga newspaper (1931).\n* Pau na Nunca newspaper (1931);\n* Gazeta Novo Hamburgo, led by Octavian Barreto de Borba (1934);\n* Gazeta newspaper (1948);\n* Evolucao newspaper (1953);\n* Correio Gaucho (1955);\n* Jornal NH (1960).\n\nThe development of \u201c[[ga\u00facho]]\u201d journalism generated opportunities for the creation of new newspapers in such as the Jornal SL in 1957 in [[Sao Leopoldo]] and [[Jornal NH]], in 1960 in Novo Hamburgo. Today, with more than 250,000 inhabitants, Novo Hamburgo is the seventh most populated city in the state. Jornal NH is the largest newspaper in the region, one of the largest published in the state and the largest newspaper in Brazil outside a major metropolitan area, by number of subscribers. Jornal NH is part of Grupo Sinos, a conglomerate of regional newspapers, magazines, radio and digital content.\n\n===Radio===\n<ref name=\"unirevista.unisinos.br\"/>\nThe first broadcast in Novo Hamburgo was Radio Hamburguense Progresso in 1948, directed by Milton Vergara Corr\u00eaa.

It is affectionately known as Anilado among fans. The club dispute some championships. The club was founded on 1 May 1911 by a group of employees of the extinct Adams shoe factory.\nSince then, the Hamburguenses could watch in the victories of team the Santa Rosa Stadium.\nThe stadium was sold in 2005, and a new stadium was built in 2011, called [[Est\u00e1dio do Vale]].\n\nTennis is another sport very important in Novo Hamburgo. The city featured athletes like [[Fernando Roese]], [[Paulo Taicher]], [[Tom\u00e1s Behrend]], [[Andr\u00e9 Heller]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Ghem]].\n\nThere are some places that offer tennis courts and host sport competitions such as Sociedade Gin\u00e1stica, Alian\u00e7a and Wallau Centro de Esportes.\n\nIn the city, it is also possible to practice or attend games and competitions in tennis, volleyball, punhobol, futsal, archery, handball, bicycle motocross, among other activities.\n\n==Metro==\n\n<ref>http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rs_linhaspoa/novohamb.htm</ref>\nThe history of the railways of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] date back to 1866 with proposals for construction in the [[Sinos River Valley]] region. On 14 April 1874, the first train track between [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Sao Leopoldo]] was completed. This was constructed by a British Company called ''[[The Porto Alegre & New Hamburg Brazilian Railway Company Limited]]''. Owned by Johan Mac Ginity.\n\nThe first train arrived in Novo Hamburgo on 1 January 1876. The station was named Novo Hamburgo Station. The railway did not go through the village of [[Hamburguer Berg]], the station was built some 3&nbsp;km away thus, a new urban area began to develop around the railway station. Only in 1882 the Novo Hamburgo station was connected at the village which was named as Hamburguer Berg, this line eventually was extended to [[Canela, Rio Grande do Sul|Canela]] in 1922.\n\nIn 1919, the Novo Hamburgo station was renamed Borges de Medeiros, reflecting the anti-German sentiment caused by Great War and also Hamburg Berg was renamed Genuine Sampaio. However, Novo Hamburgo station returned to the original name in 1920 and Hamburguer Berg received its current name of [[Hamburgo Velho]].\n\nIn 1964, the Novo Hamburgo to [[Taquara]] line was closed, leaving Novo Hamburgo station as the end point of the line. In late 1966, the rest of section, Rio dos Sinos to Novo Hamburgo stations was abolished and the station was deactivated.\n\nIn 2008 the Federal government authorized the expansion of [[Porto Alegre Metro]] train services to Novo Hamburgo. The works started in early 2009 and is expected to be completed 2013. This project includes the construction of an additional 9.3 kilometres and four new stations: Rio dos Sinos, in the municipality of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], Liberdade, Fenac and Novo Hamburgo, in the city of Novo Hamburgo.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Maicon (footballer born 1981)|Maicon]] (born 1981), football player\n* [[Muriel Gustavo Becker]] (born 1987), football player\n* [[Alisson (footballer, born 1992)|Alisson]], football player\n* [[Matheus Leist]], racing driver\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Novo Hamburgo}}\n* [http://www.novohamburgo.rs.gov.br Novo Hamburgo Local Government]\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=novo+hamburgo,+brazil&ie=UTF8&z=13&om=1 Novo Hamburgo detailed city Street Map]\n\n{{Municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul}}\n{{Rota Rom\u00e2ntica}}\n\n[[Category:Novo Hamburgo]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1832]]\n[[Category:German-Brazilian culture]]\n", "name_user": "Dale Arnett", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotable people", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novo_Hamburgo"}

It is a part of the [[Council Rock School District]]. The school is located across from [[Newtown Middle School]] and [[Tyler State Park (Pennsylvania)|Tyler State Park]], and near [[Bucks County Community College]]. The current student population is 2500 for grades 9-12.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe school is three stories tall and is divided into an East wing and a West wing. Until 2006, there was no direct connection between the third floors on each wing, so students and staff had to use hallways on the first or second floor to cross between wings.\n\nWhen originally constructed, the school was the only high school in the district and was known simply as \"Council Rock High School\". As the local population continued to grow, a new high school ([[Council Rock High School South]]) was built in [[Holland, Pennsylvania]], which opened in the fall of 2002, and \"North\" was added to the original school's name. When the new school was opened, middle schools were re-districted as follows: Holland Middle School students attend Council Rock South, [[Newtown Middle School]] students and Richboro Middle School students attend Council Rock North.\n\nThe school colors are blue and silver, and the school sports teams are known as the Council Rock Indians. After the split in 2002, silver was given to North and gold given to South to distinguish them while still maintaining the two traditional colors of the original high school.\n\nThe school and the school district are named for Council Rock (also known as Indian Rock), a rock outcropping that forms a cliff in Tyler State Park.{{cn|date=August 2018}} This rock was once a council rock for [[Lenape]] Indians living in the area.{{cn|date=August 2018}} A large rock located near the school parking lot's main entrance on Rock Way is a reminder of this, and it is tradition for students of the school to paint the rock in anticipation of major events such as sporting events or proms.\n\n== Academics ==\nCouncil Rock High School North academics are consistently ranked highly among other high schools in the [[Philadelphia]] area, [[Pennsylvania]], and the [[United States]]. Council Rock High School North is ranked 51st within Pennsylvania and ranked 1,419 in the National Rankings. Council Rock High School North offers 19 Advanced Placement courses. The Advanced Placement participation rate at the school is 48%. Council Rock North is known as one of the top tier public schools in the Bucks County Region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205201259/http://www.crsd.org/503115123152434/site/default.asp|title=CR High School North &#124; CRN Report Card|date=February 5, 2008|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=February 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOf the 2009 graduates, ten were named valedictorians, 17 were named [[National Merit]] Semi-Finalists (outscoring 99.5% of all PSAT test-takers), 20 were named [[National Merit]] Commended students, and all 17 semi-finalists attained finalist status. Council Rock High School North students are consistently offered admission to top tier universities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nAbout 91% of students pursue higher education, and the graduation rate is above 99.9%. The attendance rate is 95.0%. In the 2008-09 school year, 45 students were named [[Advanced Placement]] Scholars. SAT scores routinely exceed the national and state averages; Critical Reading, Writing and Math average scores were 550, 546 and 568, respectively. The difference, for all three sections combined, in national average SAT scores and Council Rock North student average SAT scores is 163 points.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[Philadelphia Magazine]] recognized Council Rock High School North as one of the top schools in the [[Philadelphia]] Metropolitan Area; Council Rock High Schools were the only high schools in Bucks County named to the \"50 Best Schools List\" (2004).

It is a part of the [[Council Rock School District]]. The school is located across from [[Newtown Middle School]] and [[Tyler State Park (Pennsylvania)|Tyler State Park]], and near [[Bucks County Community College]]. The current student population is 2500 for grades 9-12.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe school is three stories tall and is divided into an East wing and a West wing. Until 2006, there was no direct connection between the third floors on each wing, so students and staff had to use hallways on the first or second floor to cross between wings.\n\nWhen originally constructed, the school was the only high school in the district and was known simply as \"Council Rock High School\". As the local population continued to grow, a new high school ([[Council Rock High School South]]) was built in [[Holland, Pennsylvania]], which opened in the fall of 2002, and \"North\" was added to the original school's name. When the new school was opened, middle schools were re-districted as follows: Holland Middle School students attend Council Rock South, [[Newtown Middle School]] students and Richboro Middle School students attend Council Rock North.\n\nThe school colors are blue and silver, and the school sports teams are known as the Council Rock Indians. After the split in 2002, silver was given to North and gold given to South to distinguish them while still maintaining the two traditional colors of the original high school.\n\nThe school and the school district are named for Council Rock (also known as Indian Rock), a rock outcropping that forms a cliff in Tyler State Park.{{cn|date=August 2018}} This rock was once a council rock for [[Lenape]] Indians living in the area.{{cn|date=August 2018}} A large rock located near the school parking lot's main entrance on Rock Way is a reminder of this, and it is tradition for students of the school to paint the rock in anticipation of major events such as sporting events or proms.\n\n== Academics ==\nCouncil Rock High School North academics are consistently ranked highly among other high schools in the [[Philadelphia]] area, [[Pennsylvania]], and the [[United States]]. Council Rock High School North is ranked 51st within Pennsylvania and ranked 1,419 in the National Rankings. Council Rock High School North offers 19 Advanced Placement courses. The Advanced Placement participation rate at the school is 48%. Council Rock North is known as one of the top tier public schools in the Bucks County Region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205201259/http://www.crsd.org/503115123152434/site/default.asp|title=CR High School North &#124; CRN Report Card|date=February 5, 2008|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=February 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOf the 2009 graduates, ten were named valedictorians, 17 were named [[National Merit]] Semi-Finalists (outscoring 99.5% of all PSAT test-takers), 20 were named [[National Merit]] Commended students, and all 17 semi-finalists attained finalist status.

The former employees provided picture evidence of terrible enclosure conditions for Mei, an Orangutan that was 32-years old at the time. Pictures of Mei and her enclosure featured rotten foliage and feces all throughout the enclosure as well as on Mei herself. Mei the orangutan later passed away after a successful surgery. They also provided pictures of a large, oozing, injury on King, Monkey Jungle's gorilla. The former keeper also said that they encouraged the zoo to allow different healing ointments to be applied to King as he would repeatedly wipe of the ointment that was being used, but the pleads went largely ignored. The former keeper also mentioned that besides that and an already corrected enclosure size issue, King was in relatively good spirits<ref name=\":1\" />. Monkey Jungle soon responded, claiming that the former employees took advantage of the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, and continued on to give their story as to why the conditions were the ways that they were, as well as the different ways that they care for every animal within the park, especially those talked about in the allegations. Monkey Jungle's response can be found on the company [https://twitter.com/miamonkeyjungle?lang=en Twitter] page. \n\n= Experiences =\nAlong with the ability to walk by and view each area of the park on jungle trails, Monkey Jungle also offers individual experiences and presentations personalized to each area/exhibit.\n\n=== Wild Monkey Swimming Pool & Trail ===\nVisiting this exhibit brings guests to the home of the Java Macaques, which are native to Southeast Asia. These monkeys are the soul of Monkey Jungle, being the first primates introduced to the park and accounting for the majority of the primates in the park. This 7-acre exhibit provides the guests the opportunity to spectate Java Macaques in an environment similar to one that the species thrives in Southeast Asia. Stick around long enough and guests may even have the opportunity to see them dive into the pond in search of snacks. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.monkeyjungle.com/primates|title=Exhibits & Shows|website=monkey3|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nDaily presentation times for this exhibit are: 10:00 am, 12:15 pm, 2:30 pm, and 4:30 pm. <ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Cameroon Gorilla Forest ===\nThe Cameroon Gorilla Forest experience brings guests to the doorstep of King, Monkey Jungle's own king of the jungle. Guests are able to watch King as he interacts with the environment within his 10-acre enclosure, which is designed to be similar to his natural habitat. King has the enclosure all to himself. <ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Squirrel monkey.jpg|thumb|Squirrel Monkey]]\nDaily presentation times for this exhibit are: 11:00 am, 1:15 pm, and 3:30 pm. \n\n=== Amazonian Rainforest ===\nThe Amazonian Rainforest is a large exhibit that immerses guests into the world of the Amazon Rainforest and is North America's only semi-natural tropical rainforest. Frank DuMond spent over 5 years in the Amazon Rainforest, mostly in a 100-mile radius of Iquitos, Peru, collecting a wide range of plants to ensure that the area was as natural as possible. The monkeys here are free to live however they'd like, with no forced human contact. This provides the opportunity for guests to view the monkeys in a very natural way, allowing for some studies conducted here to receive international attention.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.monkeyjungle.com/amazonian-rain-forest|title=Amazonian Rain Forest|website=monkey3|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Three different species of monkeys call this exhibit a home, all of which have helped make an impact in the science community: \n\n'''Squirrel Monkey -''' The most plentiful species in the park, Monkey Jungle's Squirrel Monkeys number around 125, making them pretty easy to spot<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n'''Black-Capped Capuchin -''' The largest of the three monkey species in the exhibit, the Black-Capped Capuchin can be easily recognized by guests by the raised black fur on the top of their heads<ref name=\":2\" />.

The birds are housed in large geodesic domes alongside intra-species and inter-species companions. The domes are furnished with natural foliage to add to the well being and security of the birds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monkeyjungle.com/wings-of-love|title=Wings of Love {{!}} Parrot Sanctuary|website=monkey3|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThere are no daily presentation times for this exhibit; guests are free to visit the birds throughout the day!\n\n= The DuMond Conservancy =\nThe DuMond Conservancy for Primates and Tropical Forests is the not-for-profit science and education affiliate of Monkey Jungle. The team consists of staff, volunteers, and students who, in partnership with academic institutions and conservation, study the primates and their vulnerable habitats utilizing Monkey Jungle's unique environment. The goal of the DuMond Conservancy is to facilitate the understanding of scientists, students, and the public of nonhuman primates and their habitats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://dumondconservancy.org/|title=DuMond Conservancy {{!}} (305) 238-9981 \u00b7 14805 SW 216 Street Miami, Florida 33170 \u00b7 dumondconservancy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> \n\nResearch focuses on questions regarding primate ecology, biology, and development that are hoped to provide insight into human condition and the means to improve the welfare of nonhuman primate populations. The conservancy's education efforts provide \"living lab\" training and research opportunities for those interested in primate conservation efforts, such as conservationists, educators, and young scientists. The conservancy partners with NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) in nearby countries native to many nonhuman primate species. They also work to engage the public in conservation related efforts. DuMond conservancy is also home to owl monkeys that were formerly in research labs. Florida's warm climate allows the conservancy to provide the owl monkeys a place to range either freely, in a lush, multi-acre, forest habitat, or in large, secluded enclosures with natural vegetation<ref name=\":3\" />. \n\nDuMond Conservancy at Monkey Jungle provides South Florida Youth the opportunities to learn about conservation efforts and nonhuman primates in an immersive and inclusive environment<ref name=\":3\" />. This provides the chance to learn about primates, conservation, and STEM related topics to those who are interested in learning, as well as those who don't typically have the opportunities to do so. \n\n= References =\n{{reflist}}\n\n=External links=\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.monkeyjungle.com}}\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=33137&ie=UTF8&t=k&om=1&z=18&ll=25.566983,-80.431563&spn=0.002221,0.005364 Aerial close-up of Monkey Jungle]\n*[http://dumondconservancy.org/ Dumond Conservancy website]\n\n{{Zoos of Florida}}\n\n{{Greater Miami}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Miami-Dade County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Zoos in Florida]]\n[[Category:Monkey parks]]\n[[Category:1933 establishments in Florida]]\n\n\n{{MiamiDadeCountyFL-geo-stub}}\n{{zoo-stub}}\n{{Miami-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox zoo\n|zoo_name         = Monkey Jungle\n|logo             =\n|logo_caption     =\n|image            = Monkey-Jungle-Attraction-Miami.jpg\n|image_caption    \n|location         =[[Miami, Florida]], [[United States]]\n|date_opened      = 1933\n|date_closed      =\n|coordinates      = {{coord|25.566367|-80.431312|display=title|type:landmark_region:US}}\n|area             =\n|num_species      =\n|num_animals      =\n|largest_tank_vol =\n|total_tank_vol   =\n|annual_visitors  =\n|members          =\n|exhibits         =\n|website          = {{URL|http://www.monkeyjungle.com}}\n}}'''Monkey Jungle''' is a {{convert|30|acre|sing=on}} zoological park located in Miami, Florida.

The former keeper also mentioned that besides that and an already corrected enclosure size issue, King was in relatively good spirits<ref name=\":1\" />. Monkey Jungle soon responded, claiming that the former employees took advantage of the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, and continued on to give their story as to why the conditions were the ways that they were, as well as the different ways that they care for every animal within the park, especially those talked about in the allegations. \n\n= Experiences =\nAlong with the ability to walk by and view each area of the park on jungle trails, Monkey Jungle also offers individual experiences and presentations personalized to each area/exhibit.\n\n=== Wild Monkey Swimming Pool & Trail ===\nVisiting this exhibit brings guests to the home of the Java Macaques, which are native to Southeast Asia. These monkeys are the soul of Monkey Jungle, being the first primates introduced to the park and accounting for the majority of the primates in the park. This 7-acre exhibit provides the guests the opportunity to spectate Java Macaques in an environment similar to one that the species thrives in Southeast Asia. Stick around long enough and guests may even have the opportunity to see them dive into the pond in search of snacks. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.monkeyjungle.com/primates|title=Exhibits & Shows|website=monkey3|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nDaily presentation times for this exhibit are: 10:00 am, 12:15 pm, 2:30 pm, and 4:30 pm. <ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Cameroon Gorilla Forest ===\nThe Cameroon Gorilla Forest experience brings guests to the doorstep of King, Monkey Jungle's own king of the jungle. Guests are able to watch King as he interacts with the environment within his 10-acre enclosure, which is designed to be similar to his natural habitat. King has the enclosure all to himself. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDaily presentation times for this exhibit are: 11:00 am, 1:15 pm, and 3:30 pm. \n\n=== Amazonian Rainforest ===\nThe Amazonian Rainforest is a large exhibit that immerses guests into the world of the Amazon Rainforest and is North America's only semi-natural tropical rainforest. Frank DuMond spent over 5 years in the Amazon Rainforest, mostly in a 100-mile radius of Iquitos, Peru, collecting a wide range of plants to ensure that the area was as natural as possible. The monkeys here are free to live however they'd like, with no forced human contact. This provides the opportunity for guests to view the monkeys in a very natural way, allowing for some studies conducted here to receive international attention.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.monkeyjungle.com/amazonian-rain-forest|title=Amazonian Rain Forest|website=monkey3|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Three different species of monkeys call this exhibit a home, all of which have helped make an impact in the science community: \n\n'''Squirrel Monkey -''' The most plentiful species in the park, Monkey Jungle's Squirrel Monkeys number around 125, making them pretty easy to spot<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\n'''Black-Capped Capuchin -''' The largest of the three monkey species in the exhibit, the Black-Capped Capuchin can be easily recognized by guests by the raised black fur on the top of their heads<ref name=\":2\" />. Widely considered to be one of the smartest of the monkey species, Black-Capped Capuchin's are even involved in programs to assist quadriplegics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animalia.bio/black-capped-capuchin|title=Black-Capped Capuchin - Facts, Diet, Habitat & Pictures on Animalia.bio|website=animalia.bio|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n'''Red Howler Monkey -''' The last of the three monkey species in the exhibit, the Howler Monkey is one of the most unique primates in the entire park. Guests can spot these territorial primates by looking for their distinctive red fur and black face, that is, if they aren't able to locate them by following the sound of their roar-like vocalizations that can be heard about a mile away<ref name=\":2\" />. \n\nDaily presentation times for this exhibit are: 11:30 am, 1:45 pm, and 4:00 pm. \n\n=== Wings of Love ===\nMonkey Jungle is home to the Wings of Love Foundation, a non-profit organization that created a sanctuary for captive parrots that have been displaced or can no longer be taken care of by their owners. The birds are housed in large geodesic domes alongside intra-species and inter-species companions. The domes are furnished with natural foliage to add to the well being and security of the birds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monkeyjungle.com/wings-of-love|title=Wings of Love {{!}} Parrot Sanctuary|website=monkey3|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThere are no daily presentation times for this exhibit; guests are free to visit the birds throughout the day!\n\n= The DuMond Conservancy =\nThe DuMond Conservancy for Primates and Tropical Forests is the not-for-profit science and education affiliate of Monkey Jungle. The team consists of staff, volunteers, and students who, in partnership with academic institutions and conservation, study the primates and their vulnerable habitats utilizing Monkey Jungle's unique environment. The goal of the DuMond Conservancy is to facilitate the understanding of scientists, students, and the public of nonhuman primates and their habitats.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://dumondconservancy.org/|title=DuMond Conservancy {{!}} (305) 238-9981 \u00b7 14805 SW 216 Street Miami, Florida 33170 \u00b7 dumondconservancy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> \n\nResearch focuses on questions regarding primate ecology, biology, and development that are hoped to provide insight into human condition and the means to improve the welfare of nonhuman primate populations. The conservancy's education efforts provide \"living lab\" training and research opportunities for those interested in primate conservation efforts, such as conservationists, educators, and young scientists. The conservancy partners with NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) in nearby countries native to many nonhuman primate species. They also work to engage the public in conservation related efforts. DuMond conservancy is also home to owl monkeys that were formerly in research labs. Florida's warm climate allows the conservancy to provide the owl monkeys a place to range either freely, in a lush, multi-acre, forest habitat, or in large, secluded enclosures with natural vegetation<ref name=\":3\" />. \n\nDuMond Conservancy at Monkey Jungle provides South Florida Youth the opportunities to learn about conservation efforts and nonhuman primates in an immersive and inclusive environment<ref name=\":3\" />. This provides the chance to learn about primates, conservation, and STEM related topics to those who are interested in learning, as well as those who don't typically have the opportunities to do so. \n\n= References =\n{{reflist}}\n\n=External links=\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.monkeyjungle.com}}\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=33137&ie=UTF8&t=k&om=1&z=18&ll=25.566983,-80.431563&spn=0.002221,0.005364 Aerial close-up of Monkey Jungle]\n*[http://dumondconservancy.org/ Dumond Conservancy website]\n\n{{Zoos of Florida}}\n\n{{Greater Miami}}\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Miami-Dade County, Florida]]\n[[Category:Zoos in Florida]]\n[[Category:Monkey parks]]\n[[Category:1933 establishments in Florida]]\n\n\n{{MiamiDadeCountyFL-geo-stub}}\n{{zoo-stub}}\n{{Miami-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Jmcghee20", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor additions and fixes.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Jungle"}
