From 1999 to 2003, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the American Society for Vaginal Surgery. From 2000 to 2005, he was President of the European Society of Pelvic Surgery. In 2002, the Italian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology awarded him honorary membership.\n\n=== Investigations ===\n\nAs an expert in bioresonance, Vitalfeld, normobar oxygen therapy, \u201ctachyonic field therapy\u201d and [[dark-field microscopy]]<ref group=alpha name=\"Dunkelfeldmikroskopie\">[[Dark-field microscopy]] \u2014 in German: ''Dunkelfeldmikroskopie''.</ref>, he devoted almost all of his free time, hobbies and holidays to conducting personal research into other medicines. Driven by an insatiable passion, his clinical and academic training allowed him to deepen his exponential knowledge of alternative therapies for nearly four decades.\n\n=== OHT: ''Ozonhochdosistherapy'' ===\n\n[[file:Ozone_IV_Therapy_AMA_Skincare.jpg|thumb|Patient benefiting from a session of Major Autohemotherapy<ref group=alpha name=\"O3_AHT\" /><ref group=alpha name=\"h\u00e9moth\u00e9rapie\" /> (or O3 AHT) in a dedicated centre that includes ozonotherapy in its care panel. The blood is first drawn by infusion to be collected in a glass bottle\u2014or a specific flexible material\u2014which is medically designed for this purpose and already containing a heparin anticoagulant. The whole is immediately enriched with a specific supply of ultra-pure ozone before returning immediately\u2014but slowly\u2014to the original blood circulation.]]\n\nSelf-funding his own work on the therapeutic effects of medical ozone with respect to its implications and related impacts on mitochondria and stem cells, he has been focusing on an innovative form of ozone therapy that he is still gradually developing and perfecting since 2010.\n\n=== Early stages ===\n\nDr. Lahodny started from the premise that every human being is endowed with a gigantic potential of stem cells possessing within them a symbiotic reparative faculty dedicated to segmental readjustments induced by possible collateral damage altering the optimal functioning of the global structure of the body and mind. According to Lahodny, the real progress in medicine would thus lie in the use and targeted therapeutic exploitation of these stem cells, of which each organism would be the priority holder.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" />\n\n=== Protocol ===\n\nThe evolution of the ozonotherapeutic treatment promoted by Dr. Lahodny would then consist, in a way, in breaking the restrictive rules relating to pragmatic dosage which tended to prevail until now with regard to a usual protocol which still remains well anchored in traditional customs and habits. Indeed, any former procedure usually involved a single injection of ozonated [[autologous blood therapy]] containing 200 ml of ozone at a concentration of 40&nbsp;ug, after which the session would end. This conceptual limit was based on an arbitrary credo that exceeding this dose boundary\u2014in terms of both quantity and concentration administered\u2014would be likely to result in cell bursting by blood dissolution, a supputive risk whose consequences had previously been considered hypothetically lethal.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" />\n\n=== Experiments ===\n\nLahodny always felt skeptical of such an a priori, given that this had never been duly confirmed by facts or clinical experience. Thus, he sat himself up as an improvised guinea pig. To do so, he boldly ventured\u2014at his own risk\u2014to test a new protocol on himself. His exploration consisted of\u2014dangerously\u2014increasing the original concentration and dose of infused ozone by pushing back the maximum approved limits. He pushed the experiment to the point where he first performed 10 \u201cozonated self-hemo-therapeutic transits\u201d into an only one single session, each successive interaction being \u201ccoupled\u201d to 200 ml of blood \u201cfused\u201d with 200 ml of ozone gas respectively brought to a concentration of 70 \u03bcg/ml, thus providing a cumulative ozone intake of 140,000 \u03bcg.<ref name=\"Rowen\"/>\n\n=== Results ===\n\nDespite fears, the clinical examinations which were subsequently carried out a did not even show the slightest clinical nor hematological abnormality or alteration. He then went one step further by dubbing the dose, this time carrying out 20 successive ozonated autologous blood transits together once more into one single session. Thus, as before, each interaction contained 200 ml of blood taken by infusion and then mixed with 200 ml of ozone gas. The whole content was brought to a concentration of 70 \u03bcg/ml, providing, in total, via 20 uninterrupted round trips, a cumulative supply of \u201cduplicated\u201d ozone quantity which, by extension, was brought to an amount of 240,000 \u03bcg. Again, laboratory tests did not show any detectable problem.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" />\n\n=== Sequential emulation ===\n\nThe continuation of the previously initiated experiments also enabled him to observe a significant stimulation of the exponential activation of stem cells. These cells, via OHT, seem to be \u201cemulated\u201d and automatically directed towards any lesion or peptidic signal that the organism would directly or indirectly report, should the case arise.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" />\n\n=== Further prospects ===\n\nBased on encouraging and recurrent therapeutic results, Lahodny became convinced that any curative effect generated by this improved innovative treatment would essentially come from the \u201creviviscence\u201d of stem cells, which appear somehow \u201cinvigorated\u201d by the stimulation indirectly induced by OHT.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" />\n\n=== Developments ===\n\nIn 2014, he discovered and refined a new dosage\u2014L1\u2014that he believes would activate the growth of stem cells and the production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). Its application can be summed up as a major [[autologous blood therapy]]  coupled with massive doses of ozone injections both in terms of concentration\u2014up to 70 \u03bcg/ml in ozone IV,<ref group=alpha name=\"O3_AHT\" /><ref group=alpha name=\"h\u00e9moth\u00e9rapie\" /> or even 80 \u03bcg/ml in rectal insufflation<ref group=H name=\"Bocci\">{{harvnb|Bocci, Zanardi, Borrelli|Travagli|pp=482\u2013489|ref=Bocci}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Since then, the old dosages, both in terms of medical ozone concentration\u2014initially up to 70 \u03bcg/ml in major autohaemotherapy<ref group=alpha name=\"O3_AHT\" /><ref group=alpha name=\"O3_AHT\" /><ref group=alpha name=\"h\u00e9moth\u00e9rapie\" /> and even up to 80 \u03bcg/ml in rectal insufflation<ref group=H name=\"Bocci\" />\u2014have mostly been reduced to 50 \u03bcg/ml.|group=alpha|name=\u03bcg/ml}}<ref group=alpha name=\"O3_AHT\">In French : grande autoh\u00e9moth\u00e9rapie \u2014 in German: Eigenbluttherapie \u2014 in English: ''Major Autohemotherapy'' or ''O3 AHT''.</ref>{{#tag:ref|In the case of ozonated autohemotherapy, the patient's blood is first drawn and mixed with an oxygen-ozone gas mixture before being re-injected into the donor's circulation through the same channel and infusion.

From 1999 to 2003, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the American Society for Vaginal Surgery. From 2000 to 2005, he was President of the European Society of Pelvic Surgery. In 2002, the Italian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology awarded him honorary membership.\n\n=== Investigations ===\n\nAs an expert in bioresonance, Vitalfeld, normobar oxygen therapy, \u201ctachyonic field therapy\u201d and [[dark-field microscopy]]<ref group=alpha name=\"Dunkelfeldmikroskopie\">[[Dark-field microscopy]] \u2014 in German: ''Dunkelfeldmikroskopie''.</ref>, he devoted almost all of his free time, hobbies and holidays to conducting personal research into other medicines. Driven by an insatiable passion, his clinical and academic training allowed him to deepen his exponential knowledge of alternative therapies for nearly four decades.\n\n=== OHT: ''Ozonhochdosistherapy'' ===\n\n[[file:Ozone_IV_Therapy_AMA_Skincare.jpg|thumb|Patient benefiting from a session of Major Autohemotherapy<ref group=alpha name=\"O3_AHT\" /><ref group=alpha name=\"h\u00e9moth\u00e9rapie\" /> (or O3 AHT) in a dedicated centre that includes ozonotherapy in its care panel. The blood is first drawn by infusion to be collected in a glass bottle\u2014or a specific flexible material\u2014which is medically designed for this purpose and already containing a heparin anticoagulant. The whole is immediately enriched with a specific supply of ultra-pure ozone before returning immediately\u2014but slowly\u2014to the original blood circulation.]]\n\nSelf-funding his own work on the therapeutic effects of medical ozone with respect to its implications and related impacts on mitochondria and stem cells, he has been focusing on an innovative form of ozone therapy that he is still gradually developing and perfecting since 2010.\n\n=== Early stages ===\n\nDr. Lahodny started from the premise that every human being is endowed with a gigantic potential of stem cells possessing within them a symbiotic reparative faculty dedicated to segmental readjustments induced by possible collateral damage altering the optimal functioning of the global structure of the body and mind. According to Lahodny, the real progress in medicine would thus lie in the use and targeted therapeutic exploitation of these stem cells, of which each organism would be the priority holder.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" />\n\n=== Protocol ===\n\nThe evolution of the ozonotherapeutic treatment promoted by Dr. Lahodny would then consist, in a way, in breaking the restrictive rules relating to pragmatic dosage which tended to prevail until now with regard to a usual protocol which still remains well anchored in traditional customs and habits. Indeed, any former procedure usually involved a single injection of ozonated [[autologous blood therapy]] containing 200 ml of ozone at a concentration of 40&nbsp;ug, after which the session would end. This conceptual limit was based on an arbitrary credo that exceeding this dose boundary\u2014in terms of both quantity and concentration administered\u2014would be likely to result in cell bursting by blood dissolution, a supputive risk whose consequences had previously been considered hypothetically lethal.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" />\n\n=== Experiments ===\n\nLahodny always felt skeptical of such an a priori, given that this had never been duly confirmed by facts or clinical experience. Thus, he sat himself up as an improvised guinea pig. To do so, he boldly ventured\u2014at his own risk\u2014to test a new protocol on himself. His exploration consisted of\u2014dangerously\u2014increasing the original concentration and dose of infused ozone by pushing back the maximum approved limits. He pushed the experiment to the point where he first performed 10 \u201cozonated self-hemo-therapeutic transits\u201d into an only one single session, each successive interaction being \u201ccoupled\u201d to 200 ml of blood \u201cfused\u201d with 200 ml of ozone gas respectively brought to a concentration of 70 \u03bcg/ml, thus providing a cumulative ozone intake of 140,000 \u03bcg.<ref name=\"Rowen\"/>\n\n=== Results ===\n\nDespite fears, the clinical examinations which were subsequently carried out a did not even show the slightest clinical nor hematological abnormality or alteration. He then went one step further by dubbing the dose, this time carrying out 20 successive ozonated autologous blood transits together once more into one single session. Thus, as before, each interaction contained 200 ml of blood taken by infusion and then mixed with 200 ml of ozone gas. The whole content was brought to a concentration of 70 \u03bcg/ml, providing, in total, via 20 uninterrupted round trips, a cumulative supply of \u201cduplicated\u201d ozone quantity which, by extension, was brought to an amount of 240,000 \u03bcg.

Created during the presidency of [[John Quincy Adams]] and enacted during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]], it was labeled the '''\"Tariff of Abominations\"''' by its [[Southern United States|Southern]] detractors because of the effects it had on the Southern economy. It set a 38% tax on some imported goods and a 45% tax on certain imported raw materials.<ref>https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=004/llsl004.db&recNum=317</ref> \nThe manufacturing-based economy in the Northern United States was suffering from low-priced imported [[Good (economics)|goods]] from Europe. The major goal of the tariff was to protect the North's industries by taxing goods from Europe. Some in the South, particularly those from South Carolina, felt they were harmed directly by having to pay higher for goods imported from Europe. Hypothetically the South was also harmed indirectly because reducing the exportation of British goods to the U.S. would make it difficult for the British to pay for the cotton they imported from the South.<ref>\"1816\u20131860: The Second American Party System and the Tariff\", ''Tax History Museum''</ref>  The reaction in the South, particularly in [[South Carolina]], led to the [[Nullification Crisis]].<ref>Stamp, Kenneth. ''The Causes of the Civil War''. 3rd ed. New York: Touchstone, 1991</ref>  The tariff marked the high point of U.S. tariffs in terms of average percent of value taxed,<ref>See [[:File:Droits de douane (France, UK, US).png]]</ref> though not resulting revenue as percent of GDP.<ref>See [[:File:Federal taxes by type.pdf]].   depends on the percent of goods produced domestically vs. internationally, and non-maximal revenue can result from either a rate that taxes imports too little, or rate so high that it severely discourages importation.</ref>\n\n== pASSage of the Bill ==\n[[File:Average Tariff Rates in USA (1821-2016).png|thumb|Average Tariff Rates in USA (1821-2016)]]\nThe 1828 tariff was part of a series of tariffs that began after the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], when the blockade of Europe led British manufacturers to offer goods in America at low prices that American manufacturers often could not match. The [[Tariff of 1816|first protective tariff]] was passed by Congress in 1816; its tariff rates were [[Tariff of 1824|increased in 1824]]. Southern states such as South Carolina contended that the tariff was unconstitutional and were opposed to the newer [[Protectionism|protectionist]] tariffs, as they would have to pay, but Northern states favored them because they helped strengthen their industrial-based economy.<ref>[http://www.mises.org/etexts/taussig.pdf] Taussig, F.W., ''The Tariff History of the United States, Part I'', 5th ed. G.&nbsp;P. Putnam's Sons, 1910, pp. 70\u201374 (pp. 44\u201347 in .pdf format)</ref>\n\nIn an elaborate scheme to prevent passage of still higher tariffs, while at the same time appealing to [[Andrew Jackson]]'s supporters in the North, [[John C. Calhoun]] and other Southerners joined them in crafting a tariff bill that would also weigh heavily on materials imported by the New England states. It was believed that President [[John Quincy Adams]]'s supporters in New England, the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], or as they would later be called, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], would uniformly oppose the bill for this reason and that the Southern legislators could then withdraw their support, killing the legislation while blaming it on New England.\n\n{{quote|What that plan was, Calhoun explained very frankly nine years later, in a speech reviewing the events of 1828 and defending the course taken by himself and his southern fellow members. A high-tariff bill was to be laid before the House. It was to contain not only a high general range of duties, but duties especially high on those raw materials on which New England wanted the duties to be low. It was to satisfy the protective demands of the Western and Middle States, and at the same time to be obnoxious to the New England members. The Jackson men of all shades, the protectionists from the North and the free-traders from the South, were to unite in preventing any amendments; that bill, and no other, was to be voted on. When the final vote came, the Southern men were to turn around and vote against their own measure. The New England men, and the Adams men in general, would be unable to swallow it, and would also vote against it. Combined, they would prevent its passage, even though the Jackson men from the North voted for it. The result expected was that no tariff bill at all would be passed during the session, which was the object of the Southern wing of the opposition. On the other hand, the obloquy of defeating it would be cast on the Adams party, which was the object of the Jacksonians of the North. The tariff bill would be defeated, and yet the Jackson men would be able to parade as the true \"friends\".<ref>[http://www.mises.org/etexts/taussig.pdf] Taussig, F.W., ''The Tariff History of the United States, Part I, Fifth Edition'', G.&nbsp;P.

Created during the presidency of [[John Quincy Adams]] and enacted during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]], it was labeled the '''\"Tariff of Abominations\"''' by its [[Southern United States|Southern]] detractors because of the effects it had on the Southern economy. It set a 38% tax on some imported goods and a 45% tax on certain imported raw materials.<ref>https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=004/llsl004.db&recNum=317</ref> \nThe manufacturing-based economy in the Northern United States was suffering from low-priced imported [[Good (economics)|goods]] from Europe. The major goal of the tariff was to protect the North's industries by taxing goods from Europe. Some in the South, particularly those from South Carolina, felt they were harmed directly by having to pay higher for goods imported from Europe. Hypothetically the South was also harmed indirectly because reducing the exportation of British goods to the U.S. would make it difficult for the British to pay for the cotton they imported from the South.<ref>\"1816\u20131860: The Second American Party System and the Tariff\", ''Tax History Museum''</ref>  The reaction in the South, particularly in [[South Carolina]], led to the [[Nullification Crisis]].<ref>Stamp, Kenneth.

The [[Tariff of 1816|first protective tariff]] was passed by Congress in 1816; its tariff rates were [[Tariff of 1824|increased in 1824]]. Southern states such as South Carolina contended that the tariff was unconstitutional and were opposed to the newer [[Protectionism|protectionist]] tariffs, as they would have to pay, but Northern states favored them because they helped strengthen their industrial-based economy.<ref>[http://www.mises.org/etexts/taussig.pdf] Taussig, F.W., ''The Tariff History of the United States, Part I'', 5th ed. G.&nbsp;P. Putnam's Sons, 1910, pp. 70\u201374 (pp. 44\u201347 in .pdf format)</ref>\n\nIn an elaborate scheme to prevent passage of still higher tariffs, while at the same time appealing to [[Andrew Jackson]]'s supporters in the North, [[John C. Calhoun]] and other Southerners joined them in crafting a tariff bill that would also weigh heavily on materials imported by the New England states. It was believed that President [[John Quincy Adams]]'s supporters in New England, the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], or as they would later be called, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], would uniformly oppose the bill for this reason and that the Southern legislators could then withdraw their support, killing the legislation while blaming it on New England.\n\n{{quote|What that plan was, Calhoun explained very frankly nine years later, in a speech reviewing the events of 1828 and defending the course taken by himself and his southern fellow members. A high-tariff bill was to be laid before the House. It was to contain not only a high general range of duties, but duties especially high on those raw materials on which New England wanted the duties to be low. It was to satisfy the protective demands of the Western and Middle States, and at the same time to be obnoxious to the New England members. The Jackson men of all shades, the protectionists from the North and the free-traders from the South, were to unite in preventing any amendments; that bill, and no other, was to be voted on. When the final vote came, the Southern men were to turn around and vote against their own measure. The New England men, and the Adams men in general, would be unable to swallow it, and would also vote against it. Combined, they would prevent its passage, even though the Jackson men from the North voted for it. The result expected was that no tariff bill at all would be passed during the session, which was the object of the Southern wing of the opposition. On the other hand, the obloquy of defeating it would be cast on the Adams party, which was the object of the Jacksonians of the North. The tariff bill would be defeated, and yet the Jackson men would be able to parade as the true \"friends\".<ref>[http://www.mises.org/etexts/taussig.pdf] Taussig, F.W., ''The Tariff History of the United States, Part I, Fifth Edition'', G.&nbsp;P.

A newspaper report from 1948 indicates that the owners spent $165,000 on two new rides, including a new [[The Comet (Great Escape)|Comet]] roller coaster that replaced the [[Crystal Beach Cyclone|Cyclone]].<ref name=\"spot\" /> In the 1950s, the Lusse \"Auto Skooter\" bumper cars were added at a cost of $50,000. Although attendance was down by then, a half million dollars was spent after a 1974 fire damaged the dance hall and another $250,000 in 1975 to update some facilities.<ref name=\"CEC\" /> \n\nBy 1983, the park was feeling serious competition from [[Darien Lake]], [[Marineland of Canada]] and [[Canada's Wonderland]]. Crystal Beach was nearly bankrupt but was saved by the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] after going into receivership. New owners took over in 1984 and spent over $2 million during the next three seasons for renovations and improvements including new rides.

The G prefix denotes a civil aircraft registered in the [[United Kingdom]].]]\n[[File:Aircraft Registration Prefixes Map of the World 2014.svg|thumb|Geographic map of registration prefixes]]\n\nAn '''aircraft registration''', alternatively called a '''tail number''' (albeit very loosely) is a code unique to a single aircraft, required by international convention to be marked on the exterior of every civil aircraft. The registration indicates the aircraft's country of registration, and functions much like an automobile license plate or a ship registration. This code must also appear in its Certificate of Registration, issued by the relevant [[National Aviation Authority]] (NAA). An aircraft can only have one registration, in one jurisdiction, though it is changeable over the life of the aircraft.\n\n==Legal provisions==\nIn accordance with the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] (also known as the Chicago Convention), all civil aircraft must be registered with a [[national aviation authority]] (NAA) using procedures set by each country. Every country, even those not party to the Chicago Convention, has an NAA whose functions include the registration of [[civil aircraft]]. An aircraft can only be registered once, in one jurisdiction, at a time. The NAA allocates a unique [[alphanumeric]] string to identify the aircraft, which also indicates the nationality (i.e., country of registration<ref>Article 17 of the Chicago Convention</ref>) of the aircraft, and provides a legal document called a '''Certificate of Registration''', one of the documents which must be carried when the aircraft is in operation.<ref>Article 29 of the Chicago Convention</ref>\n\nThe registration identifier must be displayed prominently on the aircraft.<ref>Article 20 of the Chicago Convention</ref> Most countries also require the registration identifier to be imprinted on a permanent fireproof plate mounted on the [[fuselage]] in case of a post-fire/post-crash aircraft accident [[Aircraft accident#Investigation|investigation]]. \n\nMost nations' [[military aircraft]] typically use tail codes and serial numbers.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0222.shtml|title=US Air Force Tail Codes|publisher=Aerospaceweb.org| accessdate =4 December 2015}}</ref> Military aircraft most often are not assigned civil registration codes. However, government-owned non-military civil aircraft (for example, aircraft of the United States Department of Homeland Security) are assigned civil registrations.\n\nAlthough each aircraft registration identifier is unique, some countries allow it to be re-used when the aircraft has been sold, destroyed or retired. For example, N3794N is assigned to a [[Mooney M20|Mooney M20F]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N3794N|title=N3794N|publisher=Registry.faa.gov|accessdate=2019-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129224555/https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N3794N|archive-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> It had been previously assigned to a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] (specifically, the aircraft in which [[Buddy Holly]] was [[The Day the Music Died|killed]]). An individual aircraft may be assigned different registrations during its existence. This can be because the aircraft changes ownership, [[jurisdiction]] of registration, or in some cases for vanity reasons.\n\n==Choice of aircraft registry==\nMost often, aircraft are registered in the jurisdiction in which the carrier is resident or based, and may enjoy preferential rights or privileges as a [[flag carrier]] for international operations.\n\nCarriers in [[emerging markets]] may be required to register aircraft in an offshore jurisdiction where they are leased or purchased but financed by banks in major onshore financial centres. The financing institution may be reluctant to allow the aircraft to be registered in the carrier's home country (either because it does not have sufficient regulation governing [[civil aviation]], or because it feels the courts in that country would not cooperate fully if it needed to enforce any [[security interest]] over the aircraft), and the carrier is reluctant to have the aircraft registered in the financier's jurisdiction (often the United States or the United Kingdom) either because of personal or political reasons, or because they fear spurious lawsuits and potential arrest of the aircraft.\n\n==International standards==\n[[File:JAL B747-400(JA8089) (5481514185).jpg|thumb|left|Registration JA8089 on a [[Japan Airlines]] [[Boeing 747-400]]]]\n\nThe first use of aircraft registrations was based on the radio callsigns allocated at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference in 1913. The format was a single letter prefix followed by four other letters (like A-BCDE).<ref name=\"Archive\">{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink=  |coauthors= |year=1980 |month= |title=Complete Civil Registers:1 Belgium |journal=Air-Britain Archive |volume=1980 |issue=1 |page=11 |issn=0262-4923}}</ref> The major nations operating aircraft were allocated a single letter prefix.  Smaller countries had to share a single letter prefix, but were allocated exclusive use of the first letter of the suffix.<ref name=\"Archive\" /> This was modified by agreement by the International Bureau at Berne and published on April 23, 1913. Although initial allocations were not specifically for aircraft but for any radio user, the International Air Navigation Convention held in Paris in 1919 ([[Paris Convention of 1919]]) made allocations specifically for aircraft registrations, based on the 1913 callsign list. The agreement stipulated that the nationality marks were to be followed by a hyphen then a group of four letters that must include a vowel (and for the convention Y was considered to be a vowel). This system operated until the adoption of the revised system in 1928.\n\nThe International Radiotelegraph Convention at Washington in 1927 revised the list of markings. These were adopted from 1928 and are the basis of the currently used registrations. The markings have been amended and added to over the years, and the allocations and standards have since 1947 been managed by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).\n\nArticle 20 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), signed in 1944, requires that all aircraft engaged in international air navigation bears its appropriate nationality and registration marks. Upon the completement of the necesary procedures, the aircraft receives its unique \"registration\", which must be displayed prominently on the aircraft.\n\nAnnex 7 to the Chicago Convention describes the definitions, location, and measurement of nationality and registration marks. The aircraft registration is made up of a prefix selected from the country's [[ITU prefix|callsign prefix]] allocated by the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunication Union (ITU)]] (making the registration a quick way of determining the country of origin) and the registration suffix. Depending on the country of registration, this suffix is a numeric or alphanumeric code, and consists of one to five characters. A supplement to Annex 7 provides an updated list of approved nationality and common marks used by various countries.\n\n==Country-specific usage==\n{{see also|List of aircraft registration prefixes}}\n[[File:airfrance.a318-100.f-gugj.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Air France]] [[Airbus A318]] displaying registration F-GUGJ on the [[wing]] undersurface and the last two letters of the registration, GJ, on the [[Landing gear|nose wheel]] doors]]\n[[File:Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (VT-ANG) departs London Heathrow Airport 2ndJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 787-8]] Dreamliner displaying [[Air India]] registration VT-ANG on the [[wing]] undersurface, on the [[Landing gear|nose wheel]] doors and on the rear [[fuselage]]]]\nWhile the Chicago convention sets out the country-specific prefixes used in registration marks, and makes provision for the ways they are used in international civil aviation and displayed on aircraft, individual countries also make further provision for their formats and the use of registration marks for intranational flight.\n\nWhen painted on the aircraft's fuselage, the prefix and suffix are usually separated by a dash (for example, YR-BMA). When entered in a [[flight plan]], the dash is omitted (for example, YRBMA). In some countries that use a number suffix rather than letters, like the United States (N), South Korea (HL), and Japan (JA), the prefix and suffix are connected without a dash. Aircraft flying privately usually use their registration as their radio [[callsign]], but many aircraft flying in commercial operations (especially charter, cargo, and airlines) use the [[ICAO airline designator]] or a company callsign. \n\nSome countries will permit an aircraft that will not be flown into the airspace of another country to display the registration with the country prefix omitted - for example, [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]] registered in [[Australia]] commonly display only the three-letter unique mark, without the \"VH-\" national prefix.\n\nSome countries also operate a separate registry system, or use a separate group of unique marks, for gliders, ultralights, and/or other less-common types of aircraft. For example, Germany and Switzerland both use lettered suffixes (in the form D-xxxx and HB-xxx respectively) for most forms of flight-craft but numbers (D-nnnn and HB-nnn) for unpowered gliders. Many other nations register gliders in subgroups beginning with the letter G, such as Norway with LN-Gxx and New Zealand with ZK-Gxx.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], the registration number is commonly referred to as an \"N\" number, because all aircraft registered there have a number starting with the letter N. An alphanumeric system is used because of the large numbers of aircraft registered in the United States. An ''N-number'' begins with a run of one or more numeric digits, may end with one or two alphabetic letters, may only consist of one to five characters in total, and must start with a digit other than zero. In addition, ''N-numbers'' may not contain the letters ''I'' or ''O'', due to their similarities with the numerals ''1'' and ''0''.<ref name=\"nnumbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/forming_nnumber/ |title=Forming an N-Number |publisher=Faa.gov |date=2015-03-19 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}</ref>\n\nEach alphabetic letter in the suffix can have one of 24 discrete values, while each numeric digit can be one of 10, except the first, which can take on only one of nine values.

This additional letter is not actually part of the aircraft identification (e.g. NC12345 is the same registration as N12345). Aircraft category letters have not been included on any registration numbers issued since 1 January 1949, but they still appear on antique aircraft for authenticity purposes. The categories were:\n\n*C = airline, commercial and private\n*G = glider\n*L = limited\n*R = restricted (such as cropdusters and racing aircraft)<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Sport Aviation|title=What does restricted category have to do with experimental|author=Sean Elliott|page=11|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n*S = state\n*X = experimental\n\nFor example, N-X-211, the Ryan NYP aircraft flown by [[Charles Lindbergh]] as the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'' was registered in the experimental category.\n\nThere is a unique overlap in the United States with aircraft having a single number followed by two letters and [[Amateur radio licensing in the United States|radio call signs issued by the Federal Communications Commission to Amateur Radio operators]] holding the Amateur Extra class license.  For example, N4YZ is, on the one hand, a Cessna 206 registered to a private individual in California, while, on the other hand, is also issued to an Amateur Radio operator in North Carolina.{{Importance inline}}\n\n== Decolonisation and independence==\nThe impact of [[decolonisation]] and independence on aircraft registration schemes has varied from place to place. Most countries, upon independence, have had a new allocation granted \u2013 in most cases this is from the new country's new ITU allocation, but neither is it uncommon for the new country to be allocated a subset of their former colonial power's allocation. For example, after partition in 1947, [[India]] retained the VT designation it had received as part of the British Empire's Vx series allocation, while [[Pakistan]] adopted the AP designation from the newly allocated ITU callsigns APA-ASZ. \n\nWhen this happens it is usually the case that aircraft will be re-registered into the new series retaining as much of the suffix as is possible. For example, when in 1929 the British [[Dominion]]s at the time established their own aircraft registers, marks were reallocated as follows:\n* Canada: G-Cxxx to CF-xxx, then expanded to C-Fxxx, C-Gxxx, and C-Ixxx in 1974)\n* Australia: G-AUxx to VH-Uxx, then immediately expanded to all VH-xxx marks.\n* New Zealand: G-NZxx to ZK-Zxx, then immediately expanded to all ZK-xxx marks.\n* Newfoundland: G-Cxxx (with Canada) to VO-xxx, then re-merged with the Canadian register in 1949 to CF-xxx.\n* South Africa: G-UAxx to ZU-Axx, then expanded to all ZU-xxx marks, then again to current ZS-xxx, ZT-Rxx, and ZU-xxx allocations.\n\nTwo oddities created by this reallocation process are the current formats used by the [[Special Administrative Regions]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], both of which were returned to PRC control from Britain in [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|1997]] and Portugal in [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|1999]] respectively. Hong Kong's prefix of VR-H and Macau's of CS-M, both subdivisions of their colonial powers' allocations, were replaced by China's B- prefix without the registration mark being extended, leaving aircraft from both SARs with registration marks of only four characters, as opposed to the norm of five.\n\n==Registration prefixes and patterns by countries==\n{{main|List of aircraft registration prefixes}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aircraft lease]]\n*[[List of aircraft registration prefixes]]\n*[[Belgian aircraft registration and serials]]\n*[[List of aircraft by tail number]]\n*[[ITU prefix]]\n*[[United Kingdom aircraft registration]]\n*[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials]]\n*[[United States military aircraft serials]]\n*[[Tail code|United States military tail code]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n\n==External links==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n*[http://www.airframes.org/ Searchable worldwide registration database]\n*[http://www.airsafetyfirst.com/ Aruba Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.casa.gov.au/aircraft-register Australian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.austrocontrol.at/en/aviation_agency/aircraft/aircraft_register/search_online Austrian Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.mobilit.fgov.be/bcaa/aircraft/search.jsf Belgian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204095822/http://www.anac.gov.br/aeronaves/cons_rab.asp Brazilian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060719070104/http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?categoryid=60&pagetype=65&applicationid=1 British Aircraft Register]\n*[http://wwwapps.tc.gc.ca/saf-sec-sur/2/ccarcs-riacc/Menu.aspx Canadian Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.ccaa.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/98/Hrvatski%20registar%20civilnih%20zrakoplova%20za%2001%2007%202012%20.pdf/ Croatian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103104809/http://dcaa.slv.dk/natregister/ Danish Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111228000806/http://www.newfoundland.nl/luchtvaartregister/user/en/zoeken.htm Dutch Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.hdekker.info Dutch Historic Aircraft Registers]\n*[http://www.trafi.fi/en/aviation/aircraft_register Finnish Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190123114601/http://www.immat.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/ French  Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027180302/http://dgacguate.com/dgac2009/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=69 Guatemalan Aircraft Register]\n*[http://dgca.nic.in/aircraft/reg-ind.htm Indian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.internationalregistry.aero/ International Registry of Mobile Assets], pursuant to the [[Cape Town Treaty]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081217142938/http://www.iaa.ie/index.jsp?p=93&n=99 Irish Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.gov.im/ded/Aircraft/aboutus/registeredaircraft.xml Isle of Man Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.caa.lv/lv/informacija-un-uzzinas/gaisa-kugu-registrs Latvian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081016095500/http://www.lebcaa.com/a_r.shtml Lebanese Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.dac.public.lu/services/espace_aeronefs/registre/index.html Luxembourg Aircraft Register]\n*[http://aircraftregistrationmalta.com/ Maltese Aircraft Registration]\n*[http://www.caa.govt.nz/Script/Air_Reg_Query.asp New Zealand Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.aircraftregister.net Norwegian Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/Aviation_Development/List_of_Aircraft_on_Singapore_Register/?__locale=en Singapore Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.caa.co.za/Pages/Airworthiness/Aircraft_Register_List.aspx South African Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.transportstyrelsen.se/en/Aviation/Aircraft/Swedish-Civil-Aircraft-Register/Aircraft-search/ Swedish Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.bazl.admin.ch/bazl/en/home/specialists/aircraft/swiss-aircraft-registry.html Swiss Aircraft Registry]\n*[http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/ United States Aircraft Registry]\n*[http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_orig.pdf Article 20 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140222045446/http://www.dfld.de/Downloads/Annex_07.pdf Annex 7 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation]\n*[https://www.icao.int/safety/airnavigation/NationalityMarks/NationalityMarks%20WEB%20en.pdf Supplement to Annex 7 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aircraft Registration}}\n[[Category:Country codes]]\n[[Category:Public records]]\n[[Category:Aviation licenses and certifications]]\n[[Category:Aircraft markings]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Registration and identification assigned to an individual aircraft by national aviation authorities}}\n[[File:vans.rv-7.g-kels.arp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|A [[Van's Aircraft RV-7]] displaying registration G-KELS. The G prefix denotes a civil aircraft registered in the [[United Kingdom]].]]\n[[File:Aircraft Registration Prefixes Map of the World 2014.svg|thumb|Geographic map of registration prefixes]]\n\nAn '''aircraft registration''', alternatively called a '''tail number''' (albeit very loosely) is a code unique to a single aircraft, required by international convention to be marked on the exterior of every civil aircraft. The registration indicates the aircraft's country of registration, and functions much like an automobile license plate or a ship registration. This code must also appear in its Certificate of Registration, issued by the relevant [[National Aviation Authority]] (NAA). An aircraft can only have one registration, in one jurisdiction, though it is changeable over the life of the aircraft.\n\n==Legal provisions==\nIn accordance with the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] (also known as the Chicago Convention), all civil aircraft must be registered with a [[national aviation authority]] (NAA) using procedures set by each country. Every country, even those not party to the Chicago Convention, has an NAA whose functions include the registration of [[civil aircraft]]. An aircraft can only be registered once, in one jurisdiction, at a time. The NAA allocates a unique [[alphanumeric]] string to identify the aircraft, which also indicates the nationality (i.e., country of registration<ref>Article 17 of the Chicago Convention</ref>) of the aircraft, and provides a legal document called a '''Certificate of Registration''', one of the documents which must be carried when the aircraft is in operation.<ref>Article 29 of the Chicago Convention</ref>\n\nThe registration identifier must be displayed prominently on the aircraft.<ref>Article 20 of the Chicago Convention</ref> Most countries also require the registration identifier to be imprinted on a permanent fireproof plate mounted on the [[fuselage]] in case of a post-fire/post-crash aircraft accident [[Aircraft accident#Investigation|investigation]]. \n\nMost nations' [[military aircraft]] typically use tail codes and serial numbers.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0222.shtml|title=US Air Force Tail Codes|publisher=Aerospaceweb.org| accessdate =4 December 2015}}</ref> Military aircraft most often are not assigned civil registration codes. However, government-owned non-military civil aircraft (for example, aircraft of the United States Department of Homeland Security) are assigned civil registrations.\n\nAlthough each aircraft registration identifier is unique, some countries allow it to be re-used when the aircraft has been sold, destroyed or retired. For example, N3794N is assigned to a [[Mooney M20|Mooney M20F]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N3794N|title=N3794N|publisher=Registry.faa.gov|accessdate=2019-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129224555/https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N3794N|archive-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> It had been previously assigned to a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] (specifically, the aircraft in which [[Buddy Holly]] was [[The Day the Music Died|killed]]). An individual aircraft may be assigned different registrations during its existence. This can be because the aircraft changes ownership, [[jurisdiction]] of registration, or in some cases for vanity reasons.\n\n==Choice of aircraft registry==\nMost often, aircraft are registered in the jurisdiction in which the carrier is resident or based, and may enjoy preferential rights or privileges as a [[flag carrier]] for international operations.\n\nCarriers in [[emerging markets]] may be required to register aircraft in an offshore jurisdiction where they are leased or purchased but financed by banks in major onshore financial centres. The financing institution may be reluctant to allow the aircraft to be registered in the carrier's home country (either because it does not have sufficient regulation governing [[civil aviation]], or because it feels the courts in that country would not cooperate fully if it needed to enforce any [[security interest]] over the aircraft), and the carrier is reluctant to have the aircraft registered in the financier's jurisdiction (often the United States or the United Kingdom) either because of personal or political reasons, or because they fear spurious lawsuits and potential arrest of the aircraft.\n\n==International standards==\n[[File:JAL B747-400(JA8089) (5481514185).jpg|thumb|left|Registration JA8089 on a [[Japan Airlines]] [[Boeing 747-400]]]]\n\nThe first use of aircraft registrations was based on the radio callsigns allocated at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference in 1913. The format was a single letter prefix followed by four other letters (like A-BCDE).<ref name=\"Archive\">{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink=  |coauthors= |year=1980 |month= |title=Complete Civil Registers:1 Belgium |journal=Air-Britain Archive |volume=1980 |issue=1 |page=11 |issn=0262-4923}}</ref> The major nations operating aircraft were allocated a single letter prefix.  Smaller countries had to share a single letter prefix, but were allocated exclusive use of the first letter of the suffix.<ref name=\"Archive\" /> This was modified by agreement by the International Bureau at Berne and published on April 23, 1913. Although initial allocations were not specifically for aircraft but for any radio user, the International Air Navigation Convention held in Paris in 1919 ([[Paris Convention of 1919]]) made allocations specifically for aircraft registrations, based on the 1913 callsign list. The agreement stipulated that the nationality marks were to be followed by a hyphen then a group of four letters that must include a vowel (and for the convention Y was considered to be a vowel). This system operated until the adoption of the revised system in 1928.\n\nThe International Radiotelegraph Convention at Washington in 1927 revised the list of markings. These were adopted from 1928 and are the basis of the currently used registrations. The markings have been amended and added to over the years, and the allocations and standards have since 1947 been managed by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).\n\nArticle 20 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), signed in 1944, requires that all aircraft engaged in international air navigation bears its appropriate nationality and registration marks. Upon the completement of the necesary procedures, the aircraft receives its unique \"registration\", which must be displayed prominently on the aircraft.\n\nAnnex 7 to the Chicago Convention describes the definitions, location, and measurement of nationality and registration marks. The aircraft registration is made up of a prefix selected from the country's [[ITU prefix|callsign prefix]] allocated by the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunication Union (ITU)]] (making the registration a quick way of determining the country of origin) and the registration suffix. Depending on the country of registration, this suffix is a numeric or alphanumeric code, and consists of one to five characters. A supplement to Annex 7 provides an updated list of approved nationality and common marks used by various countries.\n\n==Country-specific usage==\n{{see also|List of aircraft registration prefixes}}\n[[File:airfrance.a318-100.f-gugj.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Air France]] [[Airbus A318]] displaying registration F-GUGJ on the [[wing]] undersurface and the last two letters of the registration, GJ, on the [[Landing gear|nose wheel]] doors]]\n[[File:Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (VT-ANG) departs London Heathrow Airport 2ndJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 787-8]] Dreamliner displaying [[Air India]] registration VT-ANG on the [[wing]] undersurface, on the [[Landing gear|nose wheel]] doors and on the rear [[fuselage]]]]\nWhile the Chicago convention sets out the country-specific prefixes used in registration marks, and makes provision for the ways they are used in international civil aviation and displayed on aircraft, individual countries also make further provision for their formats and the use of registration marks for intranational flight.\n\nWhen painted on the aircraft's fuselage, the prefix and suffix are usually separated by a dash (for example, YR-BMA). When entered in a [[flight plan]], the dash is omitted (for example, YRBMA). In some countries that use a number suffix rather than letters, like the United States (N), South Korea (HL), and Japan (JA), the prefix and suffix are connected without a dash. Aircraft flying privately usually use their registration as their radio [[callsign]], but many aircraft flying in commercial operations (especially charter, cargo, and airlines) use the [[ICAO airline designator]] or a company callsign. \n\nSome countries will permit an aircraft that will not be flown into the airspace of another country to display the registration with the country prefix omitted - for example, [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]] registered in [[Australia]] commonly display only the three-letter unique mark, without the \"VH-\" national prefix.\n\nSome countries also operate a separate registry system, or use a separate group of unique marks, for gliders, ultralights, and/or other less-common types of aircraft. For example, Germany and Switzerland both use lettered suffixes (in the form D-xxxx and HB-xxx respectively) for most forms of flight-craft but numbers (D-nnnn and HB-nnn) for unpowered gliders.

Hong Kong's prefix of VR-H and Macau's of CS-M, both subdivisions of their colonial powers' allocations, were replaced by China's B- prefix without the registration mark being extended, leaving aircraft from both SARs with registration marks of only four characters, as opposed to the norm of five.\n\n==Registration prefixes and patterns by countries==\n{{main|List of aircraft registration prefixes}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aircraft lease]]\n*[[List of aircraft registration prefixes]]\n*[[Belgian aircraft registration and serials]]\n*[[List of aircraft by tail number]]\n*[[ITU prefix]]\n*[[United Kingdom aircraft registration]]\n*[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials]]\n*[[United States military aircraft serials]]\n*[[Tail code|United States military tail code]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n\n==External links==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n*[http://www.airframes.org/ Searchable worldwide registration database]\n*[http://www.airsafetyfirst.com/ Aruba Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.casa.gov.au/aircraft-register Australian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.austrocontrol.at/en/aviation_agency/aircraft/aircraft_register/search_online Austrian Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.mobilit.fgov.be/bcaa/aircraft/search.jsf Belgian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204095822/http://www.anac.gov.br/aeronaves/cons_rab.asp Brazilian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060719070104/http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?categoryid=60&pagetype=65&applicationid=1 British Aircraft Register]\n*[http://wwwapps.tc.gc.ca/saf-sec-sur/2/ccarcs-riacc/Menu.aspx Canadian Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.ccaa.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/98/Hrvatski%20registar%20civilnih%20zrakoplova%20za%2001%2007%202012%20.pdf/ Croatian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103104809/http://dcaa.slv.dk/natregister/ Danish Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111228000806/http://www.newfoundland.nl/luchtvaartregister/user/en/zoeken.htm Dutch Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.hdekker.info Dutch Historic Aircraft Registers]\n*[http://www.trafi.fi/en/aviation/aircraft_register Finnish Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190123114601/http://www.immat.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/ French  Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027180302/http://dgacguate.com/dgac2009/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=69 Guatemalan Aircraft Register]\n*[http://dgca.nic.in/aircraft/reg-ind.htm Indian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.internationalregistry.aero/ International Registry of Mobile Assets], pursuant to the [[Cape Town Treaty]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081217142938/http://www.iaa.ie/index.jsp?p=93&n=99 Irish Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.gov.im/ded/Aircraft/aboutus/registeredaircraft.xml Isle of Man Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.caa.lv/lv/informacija-un-uzzinas/gaisa-kugu-registrs Latvian Aircraft Register]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081016095500/http://www.lebcaa.com/a_r.shtml Lebanese Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.dac.public.lu/services/espace_aeronefs/registre/index.html Luxembourg Aircraft Register]\n*[http://aircraftregistrationmalta.com/ Maltese Aircraft Registration]\n*[http://www.caa.govt.nz/Script/Air_Reg_Query.asp New Zealand Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.aircraftregister.net Norwegian Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/Aviation_Development/List_of_Aircraft_on_Singapore_Register/?__locale=en Singapore Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.caa.co.za/Pages/Airworthiness/Aircraft_Register_List.aspx South African Aircraft Register]\n*[http://www.transportstyrelsen.se/en/Aviation/Aircraft/Swedish-Civil-Aircraft-Register/Aircraft-search/ Swedish Aircraft Register]\n*[https://www.bazl.admin.ch/bazl/en/home/specialists/aircraft/swiss-aircraft-registry.html Swiss Aircraft Registry]\n*[http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/ United States Aircraft Registry]\n*[http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_orig.pdf Article 20 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140222045446/http://www.dfld.de/Downloads/Annex_07.pdf Annex 7 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation]\n*[https://www.icao.int/safety/airnavigation/NationalityMarks/NationalityMarks%20WEB%20en.pdf Supplement to Annex 7 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aircraft Registration}}\n[[Category:Country codes]]\n[[Category:Public records]]\n[[Category:Aviation licenses and certifications]]\n[[Category:Aircraft markings]]\n", "name_user": "Arcatom", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnited States", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"}

That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.</blockquote>\n\nThe three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University|Yale]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|signer]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery were co-authors of the Charter of the College two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref>\n\nThere is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter ... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein.</blockquote>\n\nThe Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination: the [[First Baptist Church in America]], founded in Providence in 1638 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges; the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] had [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Isaac Backus was the historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, writing in 1784. He described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref>Isaac Backus, ''A History of New-England'', 3 vols. (Boston, 1777\u201396), vol. 2, quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.</blockquote>\n\nManning arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.\n\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] was vice chancellor, [[John Tillinghast]] treasurer, and [[Thomas Eyres]] secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees be composed of 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists\u2014including the College president\u2014\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 502\u2013503; the Charter and its drafts and associated documents are printed in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 493\u2013507; and in [[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 119\u2013146.</ref>\n\nThe Charter was not the grant of [[King George III]], as is sometimes supposed, but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars, the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's Charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" Second, according to Brown University historian Walter Bronson, \"the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation.\"<ref name=\"Bronson, pp. 29-33\"/> The oft-repeated statement is inaccurate that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.\n\n[[File:Brown University 1792 engraving.jpg|thumb|right|[[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] (right) and president's house, engraving 1792]]\n[[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765 and served until 1791. In 1770, the College moved from [[Warren, Rhode Island]] to the crest of [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] overlooking Providence. [[Solomon Drowne]], a freshman in the class of 1773, wrote in his diary on March 26, 1770:<ref>Quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This day the Committee for settling the spot for the College, met at the New-Brick School House, when it was determined it should be set on ye Hill opposite Mr. John Jenkes; up the Presbyterian Lane.</blockquote>\n\nPresbyterian Lane is the present College Street. The eight-acre site had been purchased in two parcels by the Corporation for \u00a3219, mainly from [[Moses Brown]] and [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], the parcels having \"formed a part of the original home lots of their ancestor, [[Chad Brown (minister)|Chad Brown]], and of George Rickard, who bought them from the Indians.\" [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] was known as \"The College Edifice\" until 1823; it was modelled on [[Nassau Hall]] at the College of New Jersey.

The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument\u2014with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze\u2014compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden. Pembroke Hall, originally a classroom building and library, now houses the Cogut Center for the Humanities.\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, was originally the site of [[Bryant University]]. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to move to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown bought their Providence campus for $5 million. This expanded the Brown campus by {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and 26 buildings, included several historic houses, notably the Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850 (now Brown's Orwig Music Library), and the Robert Taft House, built 1895 (now King House).

Brown and RISD students can cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD that count towards a Brown degree. The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.\n\nAfter several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|title=07-013 (Brown/RISD Joint Degree)|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2018-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818025835/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|archive-date=August 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 19 of the 707 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2018, an acceptance rate of 2.7 percent.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|title=News from Brown - With record applications, Brown admits 2,566 to Class of 2022|last=|first=|date=|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504155559/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|archive-date=May 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with the entire spectrum of Brown's departmental offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.\n\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum, while taking up to three Brown classes. The second year is spent in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual \"BRDD Exhibition\" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-LymanHall.jpg|thumb|221x221px|Lyman Hall, built 1890\u201392, designed by [[Stone, Carpenter & Willson|Stone, Carpenter and Willson]] in [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, houses the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies|alt=]]\n\n===Theatre and playwriting===\nBrown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country.

The undergraduate concentration (major) in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department, and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.\n\n===Author prizewinners===\nAlumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won.

Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A). The Institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the Institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its [[Casualties of the Iraq War|Costs of War Project]], first released in 2011 and continuously updated. The Project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.\n\n[[File:Slater_Hall,_Brown_University.jpg|thumb|Slater Hall, built 1879, designed by [[Stone, Carpenter & Willson|Stone and Carpenter]] in [[High Victorian Gothic|Ruskinian Gothic]] style.

In 1916, the departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a Division of Engineering, and in 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.\n\nEngineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines\u2014including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences. The School practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.\n\n===IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program===\nSince 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; [[IE Business School]] in Madrid.

The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799, a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806, the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. \"These two great rivals,\" says the university historian, \"divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 181.</ref> Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the university.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 120, 147\u2013148, 180\u2013182, 239\u2013244, 348\u2013349 & 483\u2013484.</ref>\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|right|160px|upright|The sesquicentennial poster]]\nThe Cammarian Club\u2014founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food\u2014was at first a semi-secret society which \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.\n\n[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as \"Pacifica House,\" is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823.<ref>Rhode Island Historical Society, \"Providence Franklin Society Records, 1826-1922,\" published online at [http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091221/http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm |date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> The \"Pacifica House\" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883. But the first of these (Rhees 1859, see footnote ''infra'') is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization; the second (Stockwell 1876) is a reference-book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society's own publication, which the \"Pacifica House\" reference mis-ascribes to the \"Franklin Society,\" dropping the word \"Providence.\"<ref>The three cited items of \"evidence\" in Pacifica House publicity are William J.

That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.</blockquote>\n\nThe three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University|Yale]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|signer]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery were co-authors of the Charter of the College two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref>\n\nThere is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter ... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein.</blockquote>\n\nThe Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination: the [[First Baptist Church in America]], founded in Providence in 1638 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges; the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] had [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Isaac Backus was the historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, writing in 1784. He described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref>Isaac Backus, ''A History of New-England'', 3 vols. (Boston, 1777\u201396), vol. 2, quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.</blockquote>\n\nManning arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.\n\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] was vice chancellor, [[John Tillinghast]] treasurer, and [[Thomas Eyres]] secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees be composed of 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists\u2014including the College president\u2014\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 502\u2013503; the Charter and its drafts and associated documents are printed in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 493\u2013507; and in [[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 119\u2013146.</ref>\n\nThe Charter was not the grant of [[King George III]], as is sometimes supposed, but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars, the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's Charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" Second, according to Brown University historian Walter Bronson, \"the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation.\"<ref name=\"Bronson, pp. 29-33\"/> The oft-repeated statement is inaccurate that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.\n\n[[File:Brown University 1792 engraving.jpg|thumb|right|[[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] (right) and president's house, engraving 1792]]\n[[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765 and served until 1791.

[[Solomon Drowne]], a freshman in the class of 1773, wrote in his diary on March 26, 1770:<ref>Quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This day the Committee for settling the spot for the College, met at the New-Brick School House, when it was determined it should be set on ye Hill opposite Mr. John Jenkes; up the Presbyterian Lane.</blockquote>\n\nPresbyterian Lane is the present College Street.

It houses a very large percentage of the titles published before that date about the discovery, settlement, history, and natural history of the New World. The \"JCB\", as it is known, published the 29-volume ''Bibliotheca Americana'', a principal bibliography in the field.

Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, RI. The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology, and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.\n\n=== Annmary Brown Memorial ===\n{{Main|Annmary Brown Memorial}}\n[[File:BrownUniversity-AnnmaryBrownMemorial.jpg|thumb|The Annmary Brown Memorial, designed by [[Norman Isham]] in 1903.]]\nThe Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907 by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General [[Rush Hawkins]], as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a member of the Brown family.

When it merged with Brown in 1971, the Pembroke Campus was absorbed into the Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument\u2014with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze\u2014compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden. Pembroke Hall, originally a classroom building and library, now houses the Cogut Center for the Humanities.\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, was originally the site of [[Bryant University]]. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to move to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown bought their Providence campus for $5 million. This expanded the Brown campus by {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and 26 buildings, included several historic houses, notably the Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850 (now Brown's Orwig Music Library), and the Robert Taft House, built 1895 (now King House). The area was named East Campus in 1971.\n\n[[Thayer Street]] runs through Brown's main campus, north to south, and is College Hill's reduced-scale counterpart to [[Harvard Square]] or Berkeley's [[Telegraph Avenue]]. Restaurants, cafes, bistros, taverns, pubs, bookstores, second-hand shops, and the like abound. Tourists, people-watchers, buskers, and students from Providence's six colleges make the scene. Half a mile south of campus is Thayer Street's hipper cousin, [[Wickenden Street]]. More picturesque and with older architecture, it features galleries, pubs, specialty shops, artist-supply stores, and a regionally famous coffee shop that doubles as a film set (for [[Woody Allen]] and others).\n[[File:Game_at_Brown_Stadium,_Providence_Rhode_Island.jpg|thumb|Football game between Brown and [[Cornell University]] at Brown Stadium]]\n[[Brown Stadium]], which was built in 1925 and is home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus. Marston Boathouse, the home of the crew teams, lies on the Blackstone/Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School is situated in the historic [[Jewelry District (Providence)|Jewelry District of Providence]], near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, [[Rhode Island Hospital]], [[Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island|Women and Infants Hospital]], and Hasbro Children's Hospital. Other university research facilities in the Jewelry District include the Laboratories for Molecular Medicine.\n\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building overlooking Memorial Park on the Providence Riverwalk. Brown also owns {{convert|376|acre|km2|adj=on}} the [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope Grant]] in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[King Philip's War]] site.

The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.\n\nAfter several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|title=07-013 (Brown/RISD Joint Degree)|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2018-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818025835/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|archive-date=August 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 19 of the 707 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2018, an acceptance rate of 2.7 percent.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|title=News from Brown - With record applications, Brown admits 2,566 to Class of 2022|last=|first=|date=|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504155559/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|archive-date=May 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with the entire spectrum of Brown's departmental offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.\n\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum, while taking up to three Brown classes. The second year is spent in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual \"BRDD Exhibition\" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-LymanHall.jpg|thumb|221x221px|Lyman Hall, built 1890\u201392, designed by [[Stone, Carpenter & Willson|Stone, Carpenter and Willson]] in [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, houses the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies|alt=]]\n\n===Theatre and playwriting===\nBrown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country.

The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799, a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806, the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. \"These two great rivals,\" says the university historian, \"divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 181.</ref> Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the university.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 120, 147\u2013148, 180\u2013182, 239\u2013244, 348\u2013349 & 483\u2013484.</ref>\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|right|160px|upright|The sesquicentennial poster]]\nThe Cammarian Club\u2014founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food\u2014was at first a semi-secret society which \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.\n\n[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as \"Pacifica House,\" is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823.<ref>Rhode Island Historical Society, \"Providence Franklin Society Records, 1826-1922,\" published online at [http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091221/http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm |date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> The \"Pacifica House\" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883.

This however was cancelled when the unit caught fire.<ref name=\"RTM\">{{cite web |title=Vivarail test train catches fire over festive period as NUCKLE trial postponed |url=http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/vivarail-test-train-catches-fire-over-festive-period-as-nuckle-trial-postponed |website=Rail Technology Magazine |accessdate=11 August 2018}}</ref> This unit was first used in passenger service at the 2017 Rail Live exhibition, running a service from {{stnlnk|Honeybourne}} to the event location at [[Quinton, Warwickshire|Quinton]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=Stefanie |title=D-Train to carry passengers to Rail Live |journal=[[Rail Magazine]] |date=13 April 2017 |issue=824 |url=http://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/d-train-to-carry-passengers-to-rail-live |accessdate=6 July 2017 |language=en |archivedate=6 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706085200/http://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/d-train-to-carry-passengers-to-rail-live |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe second prototype was built as a two-car battery-electric unit; although self-powered life the original, instead of a diesel engine to power the traction motors, this unit uses batteries that can be recharged from a charging point at each end of its journey. This unit was complete by the summer of 2018, and was put on a testing programme; this culminated in the battery powered unit running a distance of 40 miles using battery power alone, a first for a train in the UK, in January 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vivarail.co.uk/40-miles-on-battery-power-a-uk-first-for-vivarail/ |title=40 miles on battery power \u2013 a UK first for Vivarail |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=15 January 2020 |website=vivarail.co.uk |publisher=Vivarail |access-date=19 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Orders==\n===West Midlands Trains===\nThe first full D-Train order came from [[West Midlands Trains]], which procured a trio of 2-car {{BRC|230}} [[diesel multiple unit|DMU]]s for use on the [[Marston Vale line]].<ref name = \"westmid17\"/> These are operated under the London Northwestern Railway brand, with the first entering service on 23 April 2019.\n\n===Transport for Wales===\nA second order for Class 230s came from [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], with five 3-car sets ordered. Although these are also Class 230s, rather than straight DMUs they will be built as diesel/battery hybrid units, to be used on the [[Borderlands Line]], [[Conwy Valley line]] and [[Chester to Crewe line]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/uk/vivarail-d-trains-for-wales-and-borders/46587.article |title=Vivarail D-Trains for Wales & Borders |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=7 June 2018 |website=Railway Gazette |publisher= |access-date=18 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Island Line===\nIn 2019, [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]] announced an order for five 2-car D-Train sets for use by its [[Island Line (brand)|Island Line]] operation on the [[Isle of Wight]].
