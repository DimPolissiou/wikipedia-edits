Studio D became the home, accommodating around six staff directors and home to many other producers and support staff. Approximately half of the studio's films were helmed by independent female directors from around the country. Over the next couple of decades, the filming studio would rise to success, earning three [[Academy Awards]] over that period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfb.ca/channels/studio-d-films-women-women/|title=Studio D: Films by women, for women - NFB|last=Canada|first=National Film Board of|website=National Film Board of Canada|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Historians have stated that despite the studio's success, women were still typically discouraged from making films or told that not thinking like a woman was best for making films. Women were also still paid significantly less than male counterparts. The studio also experienced issues with funding during the 1980s, as there were more women coming to the studio to look for work than the studio could afford to hire.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Why not D?

Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings. The development of feminist film theory was influenced by [[second wave feminism]] and the development of [[women's studies]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Feminist scholars began taking cues from the new theories arising from these movements to analyzing film. Initial attempts in the United States in the early 1970s were generally based on [[sociological theory]] and focused on the function of women characters in particular film [[narrative]]s or [[genre]]s and of [[stereotype]]s as a reflection of a society's view of women. Studies analyzed how the women portrayed in film related to the broader historical context, the stereotypes depicted, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women.<ref>Erens, Patricia. \u201cIntroduction\u201d ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.'' Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xvi.</ref> In contrast, film theoreticians in England began integrating perspectives based on [[critical theory]] and drawing inspiration from [[psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalysis]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marxism]]. Eventually these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the later 1970s and 1980s. Analysis focused on they ways \"cinematic production affect the representation of women and reinforce sexism\".<ref>Erens, Patricia. \"Introduction\", ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''

Budd Boetticher summarises the view thus: \"What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does.

The different types are; power-over, power-to, and power-with. Power-over, when referring to a female character having \u201cpower-over,\u201d a male character, has the female character being portrayed as having more \u201cmasculine,\u201d in their physical appearance or interactions. This can be shown more in social class and race, and most of the time this is seen in \u201cworking class black and white women.\u201d\u00a0 Power-to, or \u201cempowerment and resistance,\u201d can be seen in films mainly about overcoming obstacles and going against \u201csocial norms.\u201d Films that display \u201cpower-to,\u201d mostly have middle and working class white women at the center of the story.

The requirement that the two women must be named characters, rather than generic [[stock character]]s (e.g., \"[[girlfriend]]\", \"[[groupie]]\", etc.) is sometimes added. Only about half of all films meet these requirements, according to user-edited film databases and media industry press.

This change was led by [[Debra Zimmerman]], the executive director of WMM since 1983.<ref name=\":3\" /> It came in response to the lack of distribution and presentation of films made by women in a male dominated field. Additionally, the organization was losing funding, but they were able to regain it through the help of Rich and the NYSCA with their new distribution program.<ref name=\":3\" /> The program originally focused on screenings in New York and the foundation of women's films festivals. Today, the distribution program is their primary work. WMM distributes its collection of more than 500 films to institutions such as colleges, galleries, museums, etc.<ref name=\":0\" /> The program \u201chas been able to influence university curricula deeply and to advance the careers of women filmmakers whom it has taken under its wing.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAs part of the distribution program, WMM is involved with international women's films festivals.

It aims to combine politics and social problems with film theory to accurately depict the lives of women.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Studio D ===\nIn the early 1970s the [[National Film Board of Canada]] established [[Studio D]], which was the first ever publicly funded female film production studio in the world. Studio D became the home, accommodating around six staff directors and home to many other producers and support staff. Approximately half of the studio's films were helmed by independent female directors from around the country. Over the next couple of decades, the filming studio would rise to success, earning three [[Academy Awards]] over that period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfb.ca/channels/studio-d-films-women-women/|title=Studio D: Films by women, for women - NFB|last=Canada|first=National Film Board of|website=National Film Board of Canada|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Historians have stated that despite the studio's success, women were still typically discouraged from making films or told that not thinking like a woman was best for making films. Women were also still paid significantly less than male counterparts. The studio also experienced issues with funding during the 1980s, as there were more women coming to the studio to look for work than the studio could afford to hire.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Why not D?

Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings. The development of feminist film theory was influenced by [[second wave feminism]] and the development of [[women's studies]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Feminist scholars began taking cues from the new theories arising from these movements to analyzing film. Initial attempts in the United States in the early 1970s were generally based on [[sociological theory]] and focused on the function of women characters in particular film [[narrative]]s or [[genre]]s and of [[stereotype]]s as a reflection of a society's view of women. Studies analyzed how the women portrayed in film related to the broader historical context, the stereotypes depicted, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women.<ref>Erens, Patricia. \u201cIntroduction\u201d ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''

Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xvi.</ref> In contrast, film theoreticians in England began integrating perspectives based on [[critical theory]] and drawing inspiration from [[psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalysis]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marxism]]. Eventually these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the later 1970s and 1980s.

Budd Boetticher summarises the view thus: \"What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents.

The different types are; power-over, power-to, and power-with. Power-over, when referring to a female character having \u201cpower-over,\u201d a male character, has the female character being portrayed as having more \u201cmasculine,\u201d in their physical appearance or interactions.

Only about half of all films meet these requirements, according to user-edited film databases and media industry press. The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to [[gender inequality]] in fiction due to [[sexism]].<ref name=T>[http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/testy Bechdel, Allison. \"Testy\".

Linder of Skidmore College, and Melissa Lindquist and Julie Arnold of Concordia College, they researched how well movies that pass the Bechdel Test, do in the box office. In this study they discovered that, of most of the popular movies from 2000\u20132009, a little less than half passed the Bechdel Test. These films also didn't make as much money as more male dominated films or films that failed the Bechdel Test. Although, they don't believe it's because people don't want to see female characters at the center of feature films, but rather because the films that do pass the Bechdel Test have a lower budget. Because of their lower production budget, they earn quite a bit less in the box office. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindner|first=Andrew M.|date=August 2015|title=Million Dollar Maybe?

The player has potential access to a variety of weapons ranging from AR's, SMG's, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc. All of these weapons, adjacent to other shooter games, are effective at various ranges dependent upon several variables like player position and distance from the enemy. Weapon effectiveness and functionality is heavily dependent upon the attachments and mods that the player installs on the weapon, such as sights and barrel attachments. The major difference between the combat in ''Escape from Tarkov'' and other FPS games is how damage is dealt. Instead of a standard health bar, players take damage to different areas and limbs of the body. Depending on the weapon type and the damage dealt, various status effects can be applied to a player's limbs that drastically effect how the PC moves and functions such as fractures and bleeding. Damage can be effectively avoided depending on player movement and gear. Body armor can protect certain areas of the body and leaning mechanics can allow a player to reduce their visible hit box to the enemy.\nObservers find ''Escape from Tarkov''<nowiki/>'s hardcore combat to be similar to that of [[Bohemia Interactive|Bohemia Interactive's]] [[ARMA (series)|''ARMA'']].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Escape from Tarkov'' is set in the fictional city of Tarkov, the capital of the Norvinsk [[Special economic zone|Special Economic Zone]] in [[Northwest Russia|Northwestern Russia]] between the year 2015 and 2026.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://unity.com/madewith/escape-from-tarkov|title=Escape from Tarkov by Battlestate Games - A shooter {{!}} Made with Unity|last=|first=|date=|website=Unity Technologies|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Political scandals and collapse of corruptions have resulted in the social breakdown of Tarkov and warring factions have turned the city into a shell of itself with sections of the city being under control of aggressive locals called \"scavs.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> As of March 2020, players can play across seven of the game's playable locations all within Tarkov: Factory, Customs, Woods, Shoreline, Interchange, The Lab, and Reserve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dexerto.com/escape-from-tarkov/all-escape-from-tarkov-maps-and-extraction-points-guide-1309294|title=All Escape from Tarkov maps and extraction points guide|website=Dexerto.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Streets of Tarkov as of March 2020 is a location under development and is planned to become the next playable location in the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.futuregamereleases.com/2020/01/battlestate-games-shares-eft-streets-of-tarkov-concept/|title=Battlestate Games Shares EFT's \"Streets of Tarkov\" Environment Concept Art|date=2020-01-31|website=Future Game Releases|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> There would be a free-roam option in the game that would combine all the locations into one, giving an open-world experience for players in ''Escape of Tarkov''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.futuregamereleases.com/2017/10/escape-tarkov-include-open-world/|title=Escape From Tarkov to Include Open World|date=2017-10-17|website=Future Game Releases|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Factions ===\nThere are two [[Private military company|PMC]] factions for players to choose in the game: United Security (USEC), a [[Western world|Western]]-based company hired by a corporation known as TerraGroup to cover up the company's illegal activities and BEAR, a company created by the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] to investigate these activities.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gosunoob.com/guides/tarkov-bear-or-usec-2020-which-faction-to-choose-in-escape-from-tarkov/|title=Tarkov BEAR or USEC 2020 - Which Faction to Choose in Escape From Tarkov|last=Ketchua|date=2020-02-12|website=GosuNoob.com Video Game News & Guides|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chartattack.com/how-to-play-escape-from-tarkov-with-your-friends/|title=How to Play Escape from Tarkov with Your Friends 2020|last=Jonson|first=Jerrard|date=2020-03-13|website=Chart Attack|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> It is planned that each faction would have its own gameplay advantages as well as unique cosmetics.

The player has potential access to a variety of weapons ranging from AR's, SMG's, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc. All of these weapons, adjacent to other shooter games, are effective at various ranges dependent upon several variables like player position and distance from the enemy. Weapon effectiveness and functionality is heavily dependent upon the attachments and mods that the player installs on the weapon, such as sights and barrel attachments. The major difference between the combat in ''Escape from Tarkov'' and other FPS games is how damage is dealt. Instead of a standard health bar, players take damage to different areas and limbs of the body. Depending on the weapon type and the damage dealt, various status effects can be applied to a player's limbs that drastically effect how the PC moves and functions such as fractures and bleeding. Damage can be effectively avoided depending on player movement and gear. Body armor can protect certain areas of the body and leaning mechanics can allow a player to reduce their visible hit box to the enemy.\nObservers find ''Escape from Tarkov''<nowiki/>'s hardcore combat to be similar to that of [[Bohemia Interactive|Bohemia Interactive's]] [[ARMA (series)|''ARMA'']].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Escape from Tarkov'' is set in the fictional city of Tarkov, the capital of the Norvinsk [[Special economic zone|Special Economic Zone]] in [[Northwest Russia|Northwestern Russia]] between the year 2015 and 2026.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://unity.com/madewith/escape-from-tarkov|title=Escape from Tarkov by Battlestate Games - A shooter {{!}} Made with Unity|last=|first=|date=|website=Unity Technologies|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Political scandals and collapse of corruptions have resulted in the social breakdown of Tarkov and warring factions have turned the city into a shell of itself with sections of the city being under control of aggressive locals called \"scavs.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> As of March 2020, players can play across seven of the game's playable locations all within Tarkov: Factory, Customs, Woods, Shoreline, Interchange, The Lab, and Reserve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dexerto.com/escape-from-tarkov/all-escape-from-tarkov-maps-and-extraction-points-guide-1309294|title=All Escape from Tarkov maps and extraction points guide|website=Dexerto.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Streets of Tarkov as of March 2020 is a location under development and is planned to become the next playable location in the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.futuregamereleases.com/2020/01/battlestate-games-shares-eft-streets-of-tarkov-concept/|title=Battlestate Games Shares EFT's \"Streets of Tarkov\" Environment Concept Art|date=2020-01-31|website=Future Game Releases|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> The expected release date of Streets of Tarkov is April 20 2020.

The play was previously adapted for film in Russia in 1957.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] is in the midst of a long and ruinous war with [[France]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and its queen is completely under the control of her old friend [[Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]], leader of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig party]] - she wants to prolong the war to her own benefit and that of her husband [[John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough]], commander-in-chief of the British forces. Against them are the [[Tories]], led by Lord Bolingbroke, who believe that the war has to stop and peace talks begin. Anne supports the Whigs because she and her court are both completely subordinated to Sarah's will.\n\nIt seems nothing can shake Sarah's power and so Bolingbroke has no chance of achieving peace negotiations. However, he befriends Arthur Masham, an impoverished nobleman and officer in the royal guards who is in love with [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail]], forced to serve in a jewellery shop. Abigail and Arthur are about to get married, but this hits an obstacle when Arthur kills a cousin of Lord Bolingbroke in a duel. Anne's jeweller visits Abigail secretly and offers her a position at court, but - afraid of Sarah's intrigues and unwilling to admit their love to the queen - Arthur and Abigail decide not to lose this opportunity.\n\nHowever, Bolingbroke still has power over the couple, since he knows that Arthur's secret patron - gaining him promotion and sending him gifts - is none other than Sarah herself. Bolingbroke resorts to blackmail, returning to Sarah a letter from her to Masham (which she does not want her jealous husband to see) and in exchange gaining Abigail a position at court. This finally gains him a supporter close to Anne.\n\nCut off from real life by Sarah, Anne is bored of spending her days caught up in court ritual. She revels in novels and dreams about falling in love. She admits to her new confidante Abigail that she has fallen in love with a young member of her guards - none other than Arthur, whose engagement to Abigail is still a secret from all but Bolingbroke. Confused, Abigail rushes to him for help and Bolingbroke realises that he finally has a way of breaking Sarah's influence over Anne. All he now needs is a way to act on it and soon he finds it, when Sarah interrupts a rendezvous between Anne and Masham. Offering Anne a glass of water, he brings about Sarah's fall.\n\nAs a result, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, removed from the court, Lord Bolingbroke in the new government became Minister of foreign affairs, begin peace negotiations, which ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], Abigail married Arthur Masham and becomes the favourite of the Queen, and only Queen Anne remains in a sad loneliness, deprived of the object of her love.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kirill Lavrov]] - [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]\n*[[Alla Demidova]] - [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]]\n*[[Natalia Belokhvostikova]] - [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]]\n*[[Svetlana Smirnova (actor)|Svetlana Smirnova]] - [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Hill]]\n*Peteris Gaudinsh - [[Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham|Arthur Masham]]\n*[[Igor Dmitriev]] - [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquess of Torcy]]\n*[[Juris Strenga]] - Count Stauenbauer, Austrian Ambassador\n*Alexander Vokach - [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]]\n*Boris Blank - artist\n*George Vsevolodov - master of ceremonies\n*Nikolai Yerofeyev - Oliver\n*Svetlana Danilchenko\n*Larisa Zhukovskaya\n*Konstantin Chistyakov\n*Anna Frolovtseva\n*Nina Veselovskaya\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0173242}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glass of Water, A}}\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet television films]]\n[[Category:Soviet comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet films]]\n[[Category:Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1710s]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Anne of Great Britain]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:Soviet films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Soviet historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Youli Karassik]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]]\n[[Category:Melodramas]]\n[[Category:1970s historical comedy films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = A Glass of Water (1979 film)\n| image          = \n| alt            = \n| caption        = \n| film name      = \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b (Stakan vody)\n| director       = [[Youli Karassik]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = [[Youli Karassik]]\n| screenplay     = \n| story          = \n| based on       = {{based on|[[The Glass of Water|''Le verre d'eau ou Les effets et les causes'']]|[[Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]]}}\n| starring       = [[Kirill Lavrov]]<br>[[Alla Demidova]]<br>[[Natalia Belokhvostikova]]<br>[[Svetlana Smirnova (actor)|Svetlana Smirnova]]<br>Peteris Gaudinsh<br>[[Igor Dmitriev]]<br>[[Juris Strenga]]\n| music          = [[Yuri Saulsky]]\n| cinematography = [[Vladimir Chukhnov]]\n| editing        = \n| studio         = [[Mosfilm]]\n| distributor    = \n| released       = 1979\n| runtime        = 128 min.\n| country        = [[USSR]]\n| language       = Russian\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n'''''A Glass of Water''''' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b|Stakan vody}}) is a 1979 Soviet [[Historical period drama|historical]] [[melodrama]]tic<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b|url=https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/stakan-vody-1979-94752/|website=\u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u041f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a|publisher=KinoPoisk.Ru|language=ru|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[comedy film|comedy]] [[television film]]<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b (1979) |url=https://www.film.ru/movies/stakan-vody|publisher=Film.ru|language=ru|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> directed by [[Youli Karassik]] and based on the [[The Glass of Water|1840 play of the same title]] by [[Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]], set in the court of [[Queen Anne of Great Britain]] at the start of the 18th century.

The service is submissive and was included into the structure of the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health Care]] of Russia till 2012. This service was founded in 2004. Since May 2012 Rospotrebnadzor was excluded from the Ministry of Health and reports directly to the Russian Government. It functions on the base of the Act of Federal Service on the base of the Administrative Regulation.\n\n==History==\nOrganization's history goes back to the Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR \"On the sanitary authorities of the Republic\" dated 15 September 1922.\n \nUp to 2004 in Russia functioned 2218 sanitary-epidemiological stations (centers).\n \nThe current structure of the organization founded by the [[decree of the President of Russia]] on March 9, 2004 No. 314 \"On the system and structure of federal bodies of executive power\". Subordinated to the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health]]. In accordance with the presidential decree of May 21, 2012 No. 636 \"On the system and structure of federal executive bodies\" under the direct authority of the Government of Russia. Since the establishment of the Federal Service (2004) is led by [[Gennady Onishchenko]]. \n \nAll the organs and institutions of the Federal Service currently employs approximately 110,000 professionals.\n\n== Rospotrebnadzor and permissive documents==\n\nRospotrebnadzor in the plan of regulating of the state functions connected with the technical regulation, evaluation of conformity or other kinds of state regulating performs the following functions:\n\n* Performs the sanitary control, control and issuing some kinds of permissive documents;\n* Performs licensing of certain kinds of activities;\n* Performs certification of different objects of evaluating of conformity to Russian legislation. \n* Performs sanitary certification of production according to the requirements of the Customs Union;\n* Performs state registration of production of the RF (excepting medicaments);\n* Performs state registration of production of the Customs Union on the territory of Russia (with the exception of pharmaceuticals).\n\nEven listing the kinds of activities of Rospotrebnadzor, connected with drawing up different kinds of permissive documents makes a significant list. Let's give more details about some certain directions while receiving permissive documents.\n\n==Permissive documents in the plan of sanitary control and supervision==\n\nPermissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are issued in the form of Permit for exploitation of buildings and premises. This document testifies about the fact that the premises conforms to the requirements to performing a certain kind of activity and providing some kind of service. This document is obligatory for receiving for owners of restaurants and cafes, food shops and swimming pools, children's preschool, school institutions, medical cabinets and clinics, by providing hair-dresser, laundry and other similar institutions.\n\nThe function of permissive document is brought by negotiation of the Program of Industrial Control of an object of any legal entity or an individual entrepreneur that applied to Rospotrebnadzor in order to draw up a sanitary conclusion or permit for exploitation or in other cases. This Program appears to be the plan of sanitary measurements of an organization or institutions that allow meet all the requirements of the Russian sanitary legislation.\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by licensing==\n\nIt is clear that such kind of permissive documents is called a license, that is drawn up after performing an analysis of the documents presented before the body of licensing, that prove performing all the requirements of licensing set for the certain kind of activities.\n\nRospotrebnadzor is authorized to draw up permissive documents for the following directions of licensed kinds of entrepreneurship:\n\n* Activities connected with application of provocatives of infection diseases;\n* Activities connected with application of sources of [[ionizing]] radiation.\n\nIssuing different kinds of documents is performed both by territorial bodies of Rospotrebnadzor and its central apparatus depending on the class of danger of apparatus of ionizing radiation and the class of danger of provocatives of infection diseases. Drawing up permissive documents is primarily required for meeting requirements of the Federal Law \"About Sanitary Well Being of the population of the RF\".\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing certification in the sphere of sanitary safety==\n\nThe kind of drawn up permissive documents primarily depends on the object suffering evaluation of conformity. So, for many kinds of production it was required to draw up the sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion. The SEC, this was the widely known name of thus famous document. But from 1 July 2012 issuing of these permissive documents was stopped. They were replaced by the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the Customs Union and the Expert Conclusion.\n\nThe Expert Conclusion is not the direct analog of the SEC. Earlier, until 1 July 2010, the mandatory sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion (SEC) or [[hygienic]] certificate for realization both Russian and foreign goods were required for the most part of production on the [[Russian market]]. All the children's goods, all the production that we eat, drink or wear, or all that we use in our everyday life underwent the mandatory evaluation of conformity to SNiPs or SanPins. After the moment that the legislation of the [[Customs Union]] went into force, for some groups of goods that may do the most significant harm with their unquality, it became necessary to prove the conformity with the help of the unified requirements of the CU by means of drawing up of the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.\n\nIn the same document, that states the list of such production (Decision of the CU Commission 299 of 28 May 2010) in the first part there is a list of the goods for which by crossing the border of the RF (CU) there can be the necessity of sanitary-epidemiologic control. In this case for this kind of production we'll need the hygienic certificate \u2013 the Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor.\n\nThe Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor unlike the SEC appears to be the voluntary document. As the situation of the sanitary control may occur or may not occur. The reason why the customs services may require sanitary documents and going through hygienic control of the load may be as follows:\n\nInjured cartridge, conveyor or other kind of package in which transportation of the load is performed;\nMismatch between documents and loads detected;\nThere is information about breaking that is connected with given delivery, about mismatch between the documents and the contents of the transport units and in some other cases.\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing the sanitary supervision of the Customs Union (CU)==\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are mandatory to draw up for the production included into the List of the goods to go through sanitary control by crossing the border of the CU, that was approved by the Commission of the CU on 18 July 2010.\n\nIf the production is included into the first part of this document, so the kind of the permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor is the Expert Conclusion. If the production is included into the second part of the document, so the kind of the document of Rospotrebnadzor is the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.\n\nThe both documents are possible to be received only on the base of the Expert Conclusion after the performed certification tests, done by the certification laboratory (having authorization of the CU). They prove that the studied product meets the Unified sanitary requirements of the three countries the Union members.\n\nSuch documents must be received also for these kinds of Russian production if they are firstly manufactured for realization on the market of the [[Customs Union]].\n\nThe volume of the production items for which it is required the following permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor is reduced nearly ten times in comparison with the list of goods for which it is necessary to draw up the SEC and (or) the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.\n\nIn the cases that the production went through the sanitary supervision on the base of the Russian Sanitary Rules and in the present it needs drawing up the sanitary permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the CU, bet nevertheless the customs inspection requires the document of proof, but also it is necessary to apply to Rospotrebnadzor.\n\nIn such situations you will receive the drawn up the Exemption Letter of Rospotrebnadzor. But the information, which it usually comprises, is of the general legislative character (it can be read in the laws of the CU). That is why the consultants recommend draw up the Expert Conclusion of Rospotrebnadzor in such cases.\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by State registration of production==\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor were issued till the end of 2012 for the production that in accordance with the national legislation required its inclusion into the State Registry before its start of realization on the territory of the RF.\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor drawn up on the blank of the Certificate of State Registration of the RF will be valid on the territory of Russia till the end of the year.\n\n==The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor of State Registration of the CU==\n\nSuch a document is drawn up from 1 July 2010 and is called the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. On which it is required to draw up the given permissive documents. The above-mentioned article describes it.\n\nAs the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the CU replaced two earlier existing Russian documents proving the sanitary safety of production and duplicating each other. Earlier entrepreneurs had to go through the same procedure of proving conformity of production to sanitary requirements of the Russian legislation twice. The Certificate of the CU replaced the Sanitary-Epidemiologic Conclusion and the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|close}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [[GOST|GOST standards]]\n* [http://Intergost.com/ The International Portal about Procedure of Product Certification in Russia]\n* [http://Rostest.biz/ The Official Department of the Rostest Certification Center in St. Petersburg]\n* [https://archive.is/20130706115829/http://rostest.se/ The Official Department of the Rostest Certification Center in Stockholm]\n* [http://Progost.com/ The International Portal about Russian Documentation required for Importing goods into Russia]\n* [http://www.gost-r.info/ The International Portal about Procedure of Russian Certification]\n* [http://www.en.gost24.com/ Current information about the products whose subject under the Expert Conclusion]\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/en/}}\n\n{{Government of the Russian Federation}}\n\n[[Category:2004 establishments in Russia]]\n[[Category:Consumer protection law]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Government agencies of Russia]]\n[[Category:Government of Russia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{manual|date=January 2019}}\n{{no footnotes|date=November 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox government agency\n| name                 = Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing\n| native_name          = \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0443 \u0432 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u044f \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430\n| native_name_a        = \n| native_name_r        = \n| type                 = Federal service\n| seal                 = Emblem of the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare.svg\n| seal_width           = \n| seal_caption         = Emblem of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing\n| logo                 = \n| logo_width           = \n| logo_caption         = \n| image                = \n| image_size           = \n| image_caption        = \n| formed               = {{Start date|2004|3|12}}\n| preceding1           = \n| preceding2           = \n| dissolved            = \n| superseding1         = \n| superseding2         = \n| jurisdiction         = [[Prime Minister of Russia]]\n| headquarters         = 18/5 and 7, Vadkovsky Lane, [[Moscow]], 127994, [[Russia]]\n| coordinates          = <!-- {{coord|LATITUDE|LONGITUDE|type:landmark_region:US|display=inline,title}} -->\n| motto                = \n| employees            = ~110,000\n| budget               = \n| minister1_name       = \n| minister1_pfo        = \n| minister2_name       = \n| minister2_pfo        = \n| deputyminister1_name = \n| deputyminister1_pfo  = \n| deputyminister2_name = \n| deputyminister2_pfo  = \n| chief1_name          = {{ill|Anna Popova|ru|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u042e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430}}\n| chief1_position      = \n| chief2_name          = \n| chief2_position      = \n| public_protector     = \n| deputy               = \n| parent_department    = \n| parent_agency        = \n| parent_agency_type   = <!-- defaults to |type if left blank -->\n| child1_agency        = \n| child2_agency        = \n| keydocument1         = \n| website              = {{URL|rospotrebnadzor.ru}}\n| agency_id            = \n| map                  = \n| map_size             = \n| map_caption          = \n| footnotes            = \n| embed                = \n}}\nThe '''Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing''' ({{lang-ru|\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0443 \u0432 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u044f \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430}}) or '''Rospotrebnadzor''' ({{lang-ru|\u0420\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440|link=no}}) is the federal service responsible for the supervision of [[consumer rights]] protection and human wellbeing in Russia. The service is submissive and was included into the structure of the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health Care]] of Russia till 2012. This service was founded in 2004. Since May 2012 Rospotrebnadzor was excluded from the Ministry of Health and reports directly to the Russian Government. It functions on the base of the Act of Federal Service on the base of the Administrative Regulation.\n\n==History==\nOrganization's history goes back to the Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR \"On the sanitary authorities of the Republic\" dated 15 September 1922.\n \nUp to 2004 in Russia in 2218 functioned sanitary-epidemiological stations (centers).\n \nThe current structure of the organization founded by the [[decree of the President of Russia]] on March 9, 2004 No. 314 \"On the system and structure of federal bodies of executive power\". Subordinated to the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health]]. In accordance with the presidential decree of May 21, 2012 No. 636 \"On the system and structure of federal executive bodies\" under the direct authority of the Government of Russia. Since the establishment of the Federal Service (2004) is led by [[Gennady Onishchenko]]. \n \nAll the organs and institutions of the Federal Service currently employs approximately 110,000 professionals.\n\n== Rospotrebnadzor and permissive documents==\n\nRospotrebnadzor in the plan of regulating of the state functions connected with the technical regulation, evaluation of conformity or other kinds of state regulating performs the following functions:\n\n* Performs the sanitary control, control and issuing some kinds of permissive documents;\n* Performs licensing of certain kinds of activities;\n* Performs certification of different objects of evaluating of conformity to Russian legislation. \n* Performs sanitary certification of production according to the requirements of the Customs Union;\n* Performs state registration of production of the RF (excepting medicaments);\n* Performs state registration of production of the Customs Union on the territory of Russia (with the exception of pharmaceuticals).\n\nEven listing the kinds of activities of Rospotrebnadzor, connected with drawing up different kinds of permissive documents makes a significant list. Let's give more details about some certain directions while receiving permissive documents.\n\n==Permissive documents in the plan of sanitary control and supervision==\n\nPermissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are issued in the form of Permit for exploitation of buildings and premises. This document testifies about the fact that the premises conforms to the requirements to performing a certain kind of activity and providing some kind of service. This document is obligatory for receiving for owners of restaurants and cafes, food shops and swimming pools, children's preschool, school institutions, medical cabinets and clinics, by providing hair-dresser, laundry and other similar institutions.\n\nThe function of permissive document is brought by negotiation of the Program of Industrial Control of an object of any legal entity or an individual entrepreneur that applied to Rospotrebnadzor in order to draw up a sanitary conclusion or permit for exploitation or in other cases. This Program appears to be the plan of sanitary measurements of an organization or institutions that allow meet all the requirements of the Russian sanitary legislation.\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by licensing==\n\nIt is clear that such kind of permissive documents is called a license, that is drawn up after performing an analysis of the documents presented before the body of licensing, that prove performing all the requirements of licensing set for the certain kind of activities.\n\nRospotrebnadzor is authorized to draw up permissive documents for the following directions of licensed kinds of entrepreneurship:\n\n* Activities connected with application of provocatives of infection diseases;\n* Activities connected with application of sources of [[ionizing]] radiation.\n\nIssuing different kinds of documents is performed both by territorial bodies of Rospotrebnadzor and its central apparatus depending on the class of danger of apparatus of ionizing radiation and the class of danger of provocatives of infection diseases. Drawing up permissive documents is primarily required for meeting requirements of the Federal Law \"About Sanitary Well Being of the population of the RF\".\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing certification in the sphere of sanitary safety==\n\nThe kind of drawn up permissive documents primarily depends on the object suffering evaluation of conformity. So, for many kinds of production it was required to draw up the sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion. The SEC, this was the widely known name of thus famous document. But from 1 July 2012 issuing of these permissive documents was stopped. They were replaced by the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the Customs Union and the Expert Conclusion.\n\nThe Expert Conclusion is not the direct analog of the SEC. Earlier, until 1 July 2010, the mandatory sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion (SEC) or [[hygienic]] certificate for realization both Russian and foreign goods were required for the most part of production on the [[Russian market]]. All the children's goods, all the production that we eat, drink or wear, or all that we use in our everyday life underwent the mandatory evaluation of conformity to SNiPs or SanPins. After the moment that the legislation of the [[Customs Union]] went into force, for some groups of goods that may do the most significant harm with their unquality, it became necessary to prove the conformity with the help of the unified requirements of the CU by means of drawing up of the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.\n\nIn the same document, that states the list of such production (Decision of the CU Commission 299 of 28 May 2010) in the first part there is a list of the goods for which by crossing the border of the RF (CU) there can be the necessity of sanitary-epidemiologic control. In this case for this kind of production we'll need the hygienic certificate \u2013 the Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor.\n\nThe Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor unlike the SEC appears to be the voluntary document. As the situation of the sanitary control may occur or may not occur. The reason why the customs services may require sanitary documents and going through hygienic control of the load may be as follows:\n\nInjured cartridge, conveyor or other kind of package in which transportation of the load is performed;\nMismatch between documents and loads detected;\nThere is information about breaking that is connected with given delivery, about mismatch between the documents and the contents of the transport units and in some other cases.\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing the sanitary supervision of the Customs Union (CU)==\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are mandatory to draw up for the production included into the List of the goods to go through sanitary control by crossing the border of the CU, that was approved by the Commission of the CU on 18 July 2010.\n\nIf the production is included into the first part of this document, so the kind of the permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor is the Expert Conclusion. If the production is included into the second part of the document, so the kind of the document of Rospotrebnadzor is the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.\n\nThe both documents are possible to be received only on the base of the Expert Conclusion after the performed certification tests, done by the certification laboratory (having authorization of the CU). They prove that the studied product meets the Unified sanitary requirements of the three countries the Union members.\n\nSuch documents must be received also for these kinds of Russian production if they are firstly manufactured for realization on the market of the [[Customs Union]].\n\nThe volume of the production items for which it is required the following permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor is reduced nearly ten times in comparison with the list of goods for which it is necessary to draw up the SEC and (or) the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.\n\nIn the cases that the production went through the sanitary supervision on the base of the Russian Sanitary Rules and in the present it needs drawing up the sanitary permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the CU, bet nevertheless the customs inspection requires the document of proof, but also it is necessary to apply to Rospotrebnadzor.\n\nIn such situations you will receive the drawn up the Exemption Letter of Rospotrebnadzor. But the information, which it usually comprises, is of the general legislative character (it can be read in the laws of the CU). That is why the consultants recommend draw up the Expert Conclusion of Rospotrebnadzor in such cases.\n\n==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by State registration of production==\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor were issued till the end of 2012 for the production that in accordance with the national legislation required its inclusion into the State Registry before its start of realization on the territory of the RF.\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor drawn up on the blank of the Certificate of State Registration of the RF will be valid on the territory of Russia till the end of the year.\n\n==The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor of State Registration of the CU==\n\nSuch a document is drawn up from 1 July 2010 and is called the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. On which it is required to draw up the given permissive documents. The above-mentioned article describes it.\n\nAs the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the CU replaced two earlier existing Russian documents proving the sanitary safety of production and duplicating each other. Earlier entrepreneurs had to go through the same procedure of proving conformity of production to sanitary requirements of the Russian legislation twice. The Certificate of the CU replaced the Sanitary-Epidemiologic Conclusion and the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|close}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [[GOST|GOST standards]]\n* [http://Intergost.com/ The International Portal about Procedure of Product Certification in Russia]\n* [http://Rostest.biz/ The Official Department of the Rostest Certification Center in St. Petersburg]\n* [https://archive.is/20130706115829/http://rostest.se/ The Official Department of the Rostest Certification Center in Stockholm]\n* [http://Progost.com/ The International Portal about Russian Documentation required for Importing goods into Russia]\n* [http://www.gost-r.info/ The International Portal about Procedure of Russian Certification]\n* [http://www.en.gost24.com/ Current information about the products whose subject under the Expert Conclusion]\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/en/}}\n\n{{Government of the Russian Federation}}\n\n[[Category:2004 establishments in Russia]]\n[[Category:Consumer protection law]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Government agencies of Russia]]\n[[Category:Government of Russia]]\n", "name_user": "2dk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Service_for_Surveillance_on_Consumer_Rights_Protection_and_Human_Wellbeing"}
