The attraction's name comes from Grizzly Peak, the bear shaped mountain that the rapids flow around.

The extended queue winds past an office that features a radio, a map of the river, a canoe, and a list of the various rapids on the river. Guests past various water buckets as they head to the loading station. \n\nAs part of the park's major 2007\u20132012 refurbishment, the old queue that had been themed around [[extreme sport]]s was replaced with an homage to California state parks, specifically after [[Redwood Creek (Humboldt County)|Redwood Creek]] and the [[Sacramento River]]. Elements that evoke the \"golden age\" of national parks are placed around the entrance, alluding to the wave of turn-of-the-century wildlife conservation.\n\n===Main ride===\nThe raft trip around Grizzly Peak begins with the raft being lifted up a wooden conveyor that runs under leaking pipes that spray water on the riders. Upon reaching the top of the conveyor, the rafts are dropped into the water to be descended down the peak, passing through a cave and bumping against a log jam. The climax of the ride drops the rafts down into a geyser field. The final drop has a unique element in that the rafts are spun as they begin their descent.\n\nAs with all flume-type rides, there must be a location to store or drain the water in the upper sections of the flumes when the pumps are shut down. The original plan was to create a large, underground basin beneath Grizzly Peak to hold water. This would have required costly excavation and construction. Upon looking at the final layout of California Adventure, it was noticed that the Pacific Wharf area of the park had a water element meant to simulate a tidal basin. The tidal basin is located across a walkway from Grizzly River Run and became the catch basin for water from the raft ride. The rise and fall of water in the tidal basin serves the dual purpose of providing a location to store water and being a scenic element that simulates a rising and falling tide.\n\n===Plot or Ride Story=== \nAccording to legend, long ago a coyote met a Grizzly Bear on top of the mountain. Seeing that the grizzly was such a powerful creature, the coyote asked him to watch over and protect the land. Even as people came upon the mountain and tried to chase the grizzly bear down, the bear held his ground. When the coyote saw that the bear was alone against the surrounding people, he turned the grizzly into stone so he could never be driven away. To this day, people claim they can hear the bear\u2019s spirit in the wind when traveling through the caverns of Grizzly Peak. The majestic grizzly bear is the symbol of California\u2014land of towering peaks, giant trees and thundering waterfalls.\nAs you make your way towards the debarkation point, look for the distinctive bear profile at the top of the mountain. According to early folklore, Grizzly Peak was once a giant bear named Oo-soo'-ma-te, whom A-ha-le the Coyote transformed into stone to watch over and protect the mountain. \nListen closely and you may hear the great bear's spirit roaring along the river!<ref>https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2018/06/look-closer-grizzly-river-run-at-disney-california-adventure-park/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kali River Rapids]] at Disney's Animal Kingdom\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disney-california-adventure/grizzly-river-run/}}\n\n{{Disney California Adventure}}\n\n{{coord|33|48|26|N|117|55|15|W|type:landmark_source:kolossus-frwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts attractions]]\n[[Category:Disney California Adventure]]\n[[Category:Water rides by name]]\n[[Category:Water rides manufactured by Intamin]]\n[[Category:Grizzly Peak (Disney California Adventure)]]\n[[Category:River rapids rides]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:2001 establishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2009}}\n{{Notability|date=July 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2013}}\n\n{{infobox water ride\n| name                 = Grizzly River Run\n| logo                 = Grizzly river dca.JPG\n| logo_width           = <!--Must be expressed in pixels (px); default is 250px-->\n| location             = Disney California Adventure\n| locationarticle      = <!--Must not be linked.-->\n| section              = [[Grizzly Peak (Disney California Adventure)|Grizzly Peak]]\n| status               = Open\n| cost                 = \n| coordinates          = <!--Should only be used if only at one park.
