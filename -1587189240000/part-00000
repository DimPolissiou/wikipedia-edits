normal [[binocular vision]] there is an effect of [[parallax]], and therefore the dominant eye is the one that is primarily relied on for precise positional information. This may be extremely important in sports which require aim, such as [[archery]], [[darts]] or [[shooting sports]].\n\nIt has been asserted that [[cross-dominance]] (in which the dominant eye is on one side and the dominant hand is on the other) is advantageous in sports requiring side-on stances (e.g. baseball, [[cricket]], golf);<ref>{{cite web | first = Brian | last = Ariel | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0148.htm | title = Sports Vision Training: An expert guide to improving performance by training the eyes }}</ref> however, studies within the last 20 years have shown this not to be the case.

The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female.\n\nThe condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [[Bird nest|nests]] at elevations of up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.\n\nThe Andean condor is a national symbol of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] and plays an important role in the [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered [[Near Threatened|near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> It is threatened by habitat loss and by [[secondary poisoning]] from carcasses killed by hunters. [[Captive breeding]] programs have been instituted in several countries.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe Andean condor was described by [[Sweden|Swedish]] scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and retains its original [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name of ''Vultur gryphus''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female.\n\nThe condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [[Bird nest|nests]] at elevations of up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.\n\nThe Andean condor is a national symbol of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] and plays an important role in the [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered [[Near Threatened|near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> It is threatened by habitat loss and by [[secondary poisoning]] from carcasses killed by hunters. [[Captive breeding]] programs have been instituted in several countries.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe Andean condor was described by [[Sweden|Swedish]] scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and retains its original [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name of ''Vultur gryphus''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

Thaao was born in captivity in 1930 and died on January 26, 2010, making him 79 years of age.<ref>[http://beardsleyzoo.org/node/150 Zoo Family Mourns Death of Oldest Living Andean Condor in Captivity | Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520105325/http://www.beardsleyzoo.org/node/150 |date=2012-05-20 }}.

She participated in the duo [[Mel and Kim]], with her sister [[Melanie Appleby]], until her sister's death from pneumonia following treatment for cancer.\n\n==Biography==\nKim Appleby was born in [[Stoke Newington]] to a [[Jamaicans of African ancestry|Jamaican]] father and British mother, and grew up in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], East London.  Kim found worldwide success at the age of 24 with her sister Mel, as one of the first acts produced by Stock, Aitken & Waterman.  Pete Waterman says that it was their success with Mel and Kim which gave them their career as producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=(melandkim.com Pete Waterman interview)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Dancing Nation Records Ltd.Co.)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> Mel and Kim achieved huge chart hits across the globe between 1986 and 1988, including a number one UK single with \"[[Respectable (Mel and Kim song)|Respectable]]\".  However, the sisters were forced to stop performing and recording in 1987 due to Mel being diagnosed with cancer.  Kim took time out of her career to nurse her sister but, tragically, Mel died in January 1990.\n\n== Solo music career ==\nKim released her first solo album ''Kim Appleby'', in November 1990. The album included songs co-written with Mel for what was intended to be the next \"Mel and Kim\" album, alongside other songs that Kim had composed following Mel's passing. One of these songs, \"Don't Worry\", was selected as the first single, and reached number two in the British charts in November 1990, as well as being a huge hit in Europe. As a result, \"Don't Worry\" was nominated for a prestigious [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Contemporary Song in 1991.\n\nA follow up single \"G.L.A.D.\" was a UK #10 hit. Subsequent singles from her debut album were \"Mama\" [#19] and \"If You Cared\" [#44].\n\nKim's second album, ''Breakaway'', only received a limited release. However, she released three further singles, \"Light Of The World\" [#41, 1993], \"Breakaway\" [#56, 1993] and \"Free Spirit\" [#51, 1994] which saw her reunite with Stock and Aitken.\n\n== British Academy of Songwriter, Composers and Authors ==\nIn 1994, Kim decided that she wanted to take a break from being a recording artist to concentrate purely on song writing for other acts. As a result, she spent some time in Sweden working with top songwriter [[Anders Bagge]], co-founder of the [[Murlyn Music Group]]. She has also collaborated with Michael Garvin (\"[[Never Give Up on A Good Thing]]\") as well as [[Sheppard Solomon]] (Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Imbruglia).<ref>{{cite web|url=(http://www.talent4media.com/talent/kim-appleby/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Talent 4 Media Ltd.)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nKim also worked closely with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) where she chaired the Ivor Novello Awards judges panel for Best Contemporary Song for over ten years, and previously the Best Song Musically and Lyrically for two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=(https://web.archive.org/web/20160324181837/http:/basca.org.uk/news/songwriter-committee/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Brewster Kahle)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nKim also served on the Ivor Novello Awards Committee and the Songwriters Executive Committee at BASCA and remains a keen champion of songwriters' rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=(https://musicforstowaways.wordpress.com/2018/11/08/ivor-novello-awards-the-1990s/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(automattic.com)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nKim currently sits on the PRS Members Fund Committee, where she continues to support songwriters.\n\n== Return to releasing music and performing ==\nA download only single called \"High\" was released in 2007.\n\nIn December 2010, the single \"Took a Minute\" by Levthand featuring Kim Appleby was released in Europe.{{citation needed |date=January 2020}}\n\nIn September 2016 a promo CD was issued for a new song called \"What's Not to Love', which was co-written with Dominic King.\n\nIn January 2018, a previously unreleased track \"Where Is Love\" was released through Dancing Nation Records. The song was taken from the demo tape which gave the sisters their original record deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=(https://www.melandkim.com/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Dancing Nation Records Ltd.Co.)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Kim returned to performing live after 20 years and is now performing Mel and Kim and her solo tracks to sell-out Let's Rock and Rewind Festivals around the country.

She participated in the duo [[Mel and Kim]], with her sister [[Melanie Appleby]], until her sister's death from pneumonia following treatment for cancer.\n\n==Biography==\nKim Appleby was born in [[Stoke Newington]] to a [[Jamaicans of African ancestry|Jamaican]] father and British mother, and grew up in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], East London.  Kim found worldwide success at the age of 24 with her sister Mel, as one of the first acts produced by Stock, Aitken & Waterman.  Pete Waterman says that it was their success with Mel and Kim which gave them their career as producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=(melandkim.com Pete Waterman interview)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Dancing Nation Records Ltd.Co.)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> Mel and Kim achieved huge chart hits across the globe between 1986 and 1988, including a number one UK single with \"[[Respectable (Mel and Kim song)|Respectable]]\".  However, the sisters were forced to stop performing and recording in 1987 due to Mel being diagnosed with cancer.  Kim took time out of her career to nurse her sister but, tragically, Mel died in January 1990.\n\n== Solo music career ==\nKim released her first solo album ''Kim Appleby'', in November 1990. The album included songs co-written with Mel for what was intended to be the next \"Mel and Kim\" album, alongside other songs that Kim had composed following Mel's passing. One of these songs, \"Don't Worry\", was selected as the first single, and reached number two in the British charts in November 1990, as well as being a huge hit in Europe. As a result, \"Don't Worry\" was nominated for a prestigious [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Contemporary Song in 1991.\n\nA follow up single \"G.L.A.D.\" was a UK #10 hit. Subsequent singles from her debut album were \"Mama\" [#19] and \"If You Cared\" [#44].\n\nKim's second album, ''Breakaway'', only received a limited release. However, she released three further singles, \"Light Of The World\" [#41, 1993], \"Breakaway\" [#56, 1993] and \"Free Spirit\" [#51, 1994] which saw her reunite with Stock and Aitken.\n\n== British Academy of Songwriter, Composers and Authors ==\nIn 1994, Kim decided that she wanted to take a break from being a recording artist to concentrate purely on song writing for other acts. As a result, she spent some time in Sweden working with top songwriter [[Anders Bagge]], co-founder of the [[Murlyn Music Group]]. She has also collaborated with Michael Garvin (\"[[Never Give Up on A Good Thing]]\") as well as [[Sheppard Solomon]] (Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Imbruglia).<ref>{{cite web|url=(http://www.talent4media.com/talent/kim-appleby/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Talent 4 Media Ltd.)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nKim also worked closely with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) where she chaired the Ivor Novello Awards judges panel for Best Contemporary Song for over ten years, and previously the Best Song Musically and Lyrically for two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=(https://web.archive.org/web/20160324181837/http:/basca.org.uk/news/songwriter-committee/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Brewster Kahle)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nKim also served on the Ivor Novello Awards Committee and the Songwriters Executive Committee at BASCA and remains a keen champion of songwriters' rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=(https://musicforstowaways.wordpress.com/2018/11/08/ivor-novello-awards-the-1990s/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(automattic.com)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nKim currently sits on the PRS Members Fund Committee, where she continues to support songwriters.\n\n== Return to releasing music and performing ==\nA download only single called \"High\" was released in 2007.\n\nIn December 2010, the single \"Took a Minute\" by Levthand featuring Kim Appleby was released in Europe.{{citation needed |date=January 2020}}\n\nIn September 2016 a promo CD was issued for a new song called \"What's Not to Love', which was co-written with Dominic King.\n\nIn January 2018, a previously unreleased track \"Where Is Love\" was released through Dancing Nation Records. The song was taken from the demo tape which gave the sisters their original record deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=(https://www.melandkim.com/)|title=(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Appleby})|publisher=(Dancing Nation Records Ltd.Co.)|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Kim returned to performing live after 20 years and is now performing Mel and Kim and her solo tracks to sell-out Let's Rock and Rewind Festivals around the country.  At Let's Rock, Kim's playlist was \"F.L.M.\", \"Free Spirit\", \"That's the Way It Is\", \"Don't Worry\" and \"Respectable\". At Rewind, Kim performed \"Showing Out\", \"F.L.M.\", \"Don't Worry\" and \"Respectable\".\n\nIn 2018, Kim co-presented the three-part series on BBC Four \"Smashing Hits!
