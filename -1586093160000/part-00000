He was given the green light to create the series without a [[pilot episode]]. The location, Camp Waziyatah, was decided a few months before the 1997 camp season started. The producers conducted about 100 phone interviews and 60 home visits before selecting 27 campers. Four camp counselors were chosen from both the camp's existing group and 350 members of the public in response to an open call on the Internet.
