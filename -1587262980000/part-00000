He reported that Cambridge Analytica was working for United States Senator [[Ted Cruz]] using data harvested from millions of people's Facebook accounts without their consent.<ref name=\"guardian December 20155\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data|title=Ted Cruz campaign using firm that harvested data on millions of unwitting Facebook users|last1=Davies|first1=Harry|date=December 11, 2015|website=the Guardian|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216175150/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data|archive-date=February 16, 2016|df=}}</ref> Facebook refused to comment on the story other than to say it was investigating. Further reports followed in the Swiss publication ''Das Magazin'' by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''), [[Carole Cadwalladr]] in ''The Guardian'' (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in ''[[The Intercept]]'' (March 2017). Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The scandal eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==Characteristics of the data==\n\n==== Numbers ====\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''The New

Further reports followed in the Swiss publication ''Das Magazin'' by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus (December 2016), (later translated and published by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''), [[Carole Cadwalladr]] in ''The Guardian'' (starting in February 2017) and Mattathias Schwartz in ''[[The Intercept]]'' (March 2017). Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]].
