Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

It had been a separate city prior to January 1, 2002, when it along with several other neighbouring [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] municipalities were merged into Longueuil. According to the Quebec Statistics Institute, Saint-Hubert had 78,336 in 2006. The area of the borough is {{convert|65.98|km2|abbr=on|2}}. Longueuil's [[city hall]] is now located in Saint-Hubert. Saint-Hubert is located about {{convert|14|km|mi}} from downtown [[Montreal]].\n\nThe borough has a wide array of commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises. The [[aerospace industry]] is arguably the most important of these enterprises. [[Pratt & Whitney Canada]] designs and manufactures jet engines at a plant near [[Montr\u00e9al/St-Hubert Airport|Saint-Hubert Airport]]. The [[Canadian Space Agency]] has its head office in the borough. The [[\u00c9cole nationale d'a\u00e9rotechnique]], a school that teaches [[aeronautics]] is located in the borough and operated by [[Coll\u00e8ge \u00c9douard-Montpetit]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe city's namesake is derived from [[Hubertus]],  who later became commonly known as St. Hubert. It was originally established as a parish in 1860, and was granted official city status in 1958.\n\nIn 1971, the former city of [[Lafl\u00e8che, Quebec|Lafl\u00e8che]] (previously known as Mackayville), merged with the city of Saint-Hubert.\n\n;October Crisis\nAt the height of the 1970 [[October Crisis]], Quebec [[Minister of Labour (Quebec)|Labour Minister]] [[Pierre Laporte]] was kidnapped from his [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec]] home and held at Saint-Hubert Airport. The city of Saint-Hubert, like many other Quebec municipalities, named a park in his honour, ''Parc Pierre-Laporte''.\n\n;Recent history\nIn 1992, the city began work on the creation of a large park, to be known as ''[[Parc de la Cit\u00e9]]''. It is located in the heart of the city and includes a one-kilometre long man-made lake.\n\n==Politics==\n\nIt is split between the [[Vachon (electoral district)|Vachon]] and [[Laporte (electoral district)|Laporte]] (Lafl\u00e8che) provincial electoral districts. Vachon's Member of the National Assembly is [[Martine Ouellet]] of the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. Laporte's Member of the National Assembly is [[Nicole M\u00e9nard]] of the [[Quebec Liberal Party]].\n\nIt is composed of five municipal districts, each with a city councilor. The borough president is Lorraine Guay-Boivin of Action Longueuil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Saint-Hubert Borough Council\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"150px\" | District\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"200px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"150px\" | Councilor\n|-\n| Iberville\n| bgcolor=#AFBD22 width=\"20px\"  | &nbsp;\n| Action Longueuil\n| \u00c9ric Beaulieu\n|-\n| [[Lafl\u00e8che, Quebec|Lafl\u00e8che]]\n| {{Canadian party colour|MTL|Independent|background}} | &nbsp;\n| Independent\n| Jacques Lemire\n|-\n| Mara\u00eechers\n| bgcolor=#AFBD22 width=\"20px\"  | &nbsp;\n| Action Longueuil\n| Lorraine Guay-Boivin\n|-\n| [[Parc de la Cit\u00e9|Parc-de-la-Cit\u00e9]]\n| bgcolor=#AFBD22 width=\"20px\"  | &nbsp;\n| Action Longueuil\n| Jacques E.

It had been a separate city prior to January 1, 2002, when it along with several other neighbouring [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]] municipalities were merged into Longueuil. According to the Quebec Statistics Institute, Saint-Hubert had 78,336 in 2006. The area of the borough is {{convert|65.98|km2|abbr=on|2}}. Longueuil's [[city hall]] is now located in Saint-Hubert. Saint-Hubert is located about {{convert|14|km|mi}} from downtown [[Montreal]].\n\nThe borough has a wide array of commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises. The [[aerospace industry]] is arguably the most important of these enterprises. [[Pratt & Whitney Canada]] designs and manufactures jet engines at a plant near [[Montr\u00e9al/St-Hubert Airport|Saint-Hubert Airport]]. The [[Canadian Space Agency]] has its head office in the borough. The [[\u00c9cole nationale d'a\u00e9rotechnique]], a school that teaches [[aeronautics]] is located in the borough and operated by [[Coll\u00e8ge \u00c9douard-Montpetit]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe city's namesake is derived from [[Hubertus]],  who later became commonly known as St. Hubert. It was originally established as a parish in 1860, and was granted official city status in 1958.\n\nIn 1971, the former city of [[Lafl\u00e8che, Quebec|Lafl\u00e8che]] (previously known as Mackayville), merged with the city of Saint-Hubert.\n\n;October Crisis\nAt the height of the 1970 [[October Crisis]], Quebec [[Minister of Labour (Quebec)|Labour Minister]] [[Pierre Laporte]] was kidnapped from his [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec]] home and held at Saint-Hubert Airport. The city of Saint-Hubert, like many other Quebec municipalities, named a park in his honour, ''Parc Pierre-Laporte''.\n\n;Recent history\nIn 1992, the city began work on the creation of a large park, to be known as ''[[Parc de la Cit\u00e9]]''. It is located in the heart of the city and includes a one-kilometer long man-made lake.\n\n==Politics==\n\nIt is split between the [[Vachon (electoral district)|Vachon]] and [[Laporte (electoral district)|Laporte]] (Lafl\u00e8che) provincial electoral districts. Vachon's Member of the National Assembly is [[Martine Ouellet]] of the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. Laporte's Member of the National Assembly is [[Nicole M\u00e9nard]] of the [[Quebec Liberal Party]].\n\nIt is composed of five municipal districts, each with a city councilor. The borough president is Lorraine Guay-Boivin of Action Longueuil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Saint-Hubert Borough Council\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"150px\" | District\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"200px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"150px\" | Councilor\n|-\n| Iberville\n| bgcolor=#AFBD22 width=\"20px\"  | &nbsp;\n| Action Longueuil\n| \u00c9ric Beaulieu\n|-\n| [[Lafl\u00e8che, Quebec|Lafl\u00e8che]]\n| {{Canadian party colour|MTL|Independent|background}} | &nbsp;\n| Independent\n| Jacques Lemire\n|-\n| Mara\u00eechers\n| bgcolor=#AFBD22 width=\"20px\"  | &nbsp;\n| Action Longueuil\n| Lorraine Guay-Boivin\n|-\n| [[Parc de la Cit\u00e9|Parc-de-la-Cit\u00e9]]\n| bgcolor=#AFBD22 width=\"20px\"  | &nbsp;\n| Action Longueuil\n| Jacques E.

The song was written by band members [[Larry Blackmon]] and Tomi Jenkins. Its frequent airing on American dance, R&B, and contemporary hit radio, as well as its [[MTV]] music video (in which [[LeVar Burton]] appears as a police detective trying to arrest the band),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/cameos-got-word|title=Cameo's Got The Word|date=September 28, 2011|publisher=grammy.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref> helped the single become the band's best known hit.\n\n==Release and reception==\nFrom the album ''[[Word Up!

In the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]], it spent 10 weeks in the top 40, peaking at number 3 on September 21, 1986.\n\nBesides being a commercial success, the track also earned critical acclaim from several publications. \"Word Up!\" won Cameo the [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single, Group, Band or Duo|Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single]] as well as the [[NME Award]] for Best Dance Record. Like the band's previous single \"Single Life\", \"Word Up!\" features a reference to the opening notes of [[Ennio Morricone]]'s theme to ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (theme)|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]''.\n\n\"Word Up\" was a [[colloquialism]], popular in [[New York City]] and other US urban areas, that acted as an affirmation of what was said\u2009\u2014\u2009a kind of a more-hip \"You Bet.\"\n\nBlackmon said of the song:\n<blockquote>It just sounded good, and it was before its time. You can play 'Word Up' anyplace anywhere, and someone is going to be grooving and bobbing their head. Our sound was unique, as well. I haven\u2019t heard another one like it, and we probably won\u2019t hear another one like it in the future.

As they walk out of the changing room, Jade tries to pick up a [[barbell]] pretending that she cannot lift it but then she lifts it up and walks away carrying it. Perrie then walks along four women who are working out while Jade is on a [[stationary bicycle]] among three other women, following the instructions of a trainer. With the bicycle, Jade starts going forward with the rest following her at the back.\n\nThe scene then switches to a court with the band exercising and dancing the same time along with other people while singing the chorus of the song. Afterwards, Leigh-Anne is stood in front of some athletes with one using her as a barbell at the end of her part. Jesy continues with her part while dancing in front of two men working out on [[treadmill]]s and fall off them after some time. During the chorus, the scene changes again to the court with the owner (Barrie, who had previously played a gym manager in BBC sitcom ''[[The Brittas Empire]]'') of the gym seeing the girls and the rest dancing and runs upset out of his office. As he is going down to the court, he sees the athletes in the swimming pool shaping out the title of the song. When he reaches the court, he starts dancing with them.\n\n=== Track listings ===\n;Digital download<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/word-up!-single/id795609578|title = Word Up! \u2013 Single|date = March 14, 2014|accessdate = |website = iTunes|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n#\"Word Up!\" \u2013 3:26\n\n;Digital remixes<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Word-Up-Remixes-Little-Mix/dp/B00IK5AG7O/ref=sr_1_2?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1394923563&sr=1-2&keywords=little+mix+word+up |title=Word Up!

In the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]], it spent 10 weeks in the top 40, peaking at number 3 on September 21, 1986.\n\nBesides being a commercial success, the track also earned critical acclaim from several publications. \"Word Up!\" won Cameo the [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single, Group, Band or Duo|Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Single]] as well as the [[NME Award]] for Best Dance Record. Like the band's previous single \"Single Life\", \"Word Up!\" features a reference to the opening notes of [[Ennio Morricone]]'s theme to ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (theme)|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]''.\n\n\"Word Up\" was a [[colloquialism]], popular in [[New York City]] and other US urban areas, that acted as an affirmation of what was said\u2009\u2014\u2009a kind of a more-hip \"You Bet.\"\n\nBlackmon said of the song:\n<blockquote>It just sounded good, and it was before its time.

As they walk out of the changing room, Jade tries to pick up a [[barbell]] pretending that she cannot lift it but then she lifts it up and walks away carrying it.

With the bicycle, Jade starts going forward with the rest following her at the back.\n\nThe scene then switches to a court with the band exercising and dancing the same time along with other people while singing the chorus of the song. Afterwards, Leigh-Anne is stood in front of some athletes with one using her as a barbell at the end of her part. Jesy continues with her part while dancing in front of two men working out on [[treadmill]]s and fall off them after some time. During the chorus, the scene changes again to the court with the owner (Barrie, who had previously played a gym manager in BBC sitcom [[The Brittas Empire]]) of the gym seeing the girls and the rest dancing and runs upset out of his office. As he is going down to the court, he sees the athletes in the swimming pool shaping out the title of the song.

A former classmate brings them all together for a party to celebrate his engagement to a girl he met in the class. However, she ends up dumping him at the party as the reunited classmates get to know each other. \"They have separate lives and there are few connections that exist beforehand,\" Klarik said. \"But through the course of the series, connections are made between the characters.

Haas planned the ultimate surprise party for his beloved [[fianc\u00e9e]], Joanne Richman (Casey Wilson): a [[Class reunion|reunion]] with their [[third-grade]] classmates to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the day they met. But Joanne felt he was smothering her and left. He is a [[pediatrician]] with a [[golden retriever]], like his ex-fianc\u00e9e. He met a woman named Sue who mistook him for a guy named Dan with whom she was supposed to have a blind date. When Ethan told Sue that he had lied about his identity at Oprah's birthday party (after many people, including Holly Ellenbogen, Perry Pearl, and Kyle Lendo, called him by his real name), she dumped him. He has developed a strong friendship with Kat and they have spent much time together. Ethan was the one who found out about Kat's boyfriend, Benjamin Chow, cheating on her with a girl named Susan, from Benjamin's son Jonah (who is one of Ethan's patients). By the [[The Class Goes Back to the Hospital|end of the series]], Ethan discovered he has romantic feelings for Kat and the storyline ended with him trying to pursue them.\n* Kat Warbler is Lina's [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] fraternal twin sister whose [[Sarcasm|sarcastic]] tongue hides her kind heart. She is a freelance [[photographer]]. She helps Ethan cope after he is dumped; behind her cynicism, she seems attracted to him. The two share a strong friendship.  Her birthday is adjacent to [[Son of Sam]]'s. She dated a world-famous violinist named Benjamin Chow, whom she had stalked for months, until she found that he had another girlfriend named Susan. She broke up with him when she asked him about it. Her storyline ended with her appearing to have a [[one-night stand]] with Duncan Carmello after she visits his house looking for her sister Lina, who was at the hospital.\n* Lina Warbler, Kat's [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twin]] sister, wears her heart on her sleeve and remains optimistic about love. She received the telephone call about Ethan's party just as she found her boyfriend Adam, in her bed with another woman. She hit it off with Richie at the party, but their budding relationship has encountered significant obstacles \u2013 particularly, the revelation that Richie is married; although, it seems that she has forgiven him.  After their first date, Richie accidentally ran over Lina's feet with his car, breaking 52 bones and causing her to wear casts until \"The Class Has to Go to a Stupid Museum\". She also got lost in a [[hurricane]] and was sent flying into a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[car]] holding her umbrella, which she said made her feel like [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]]. Lina, a vegetarian, hosts a dinner party where she serves Moroccan chicken that Richie calls \"The [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] of Chickens\".  Lina and Richie became informally engaged at the [[The Class Goes Back to the Hospital|end of the series]].\n* Duncan Carmello was a well-liked boy in school and is now a [[General contractor|contractor]] who still lives with his mother, Tina Carmello. He had a relationship with Nicole Allen in high school but dumped her, a decision he now regrets. In \"The Class Has a Snowday\", it was revealed that he dumped her because she was \"being a [[bitch (insult)|bitch]]\" the night of Valentine's Day. After they spent the night of the party together, he got a job renovating her house while trying to win her back. In \"The Class Springs a Leak\", he had finished the renovations, prompting Nicole to decide whether she wants to stay with Yonk or leave him for Duncan. She chose Duncan, but she second-guessed it when Yonk landed in the hospital. Duncan refused to leave the relationship in limbo; his storyline ended with him appearing to have a [[one-night stand]] with Kat Warbler.\n* Kyle Lendo was a popular boy in school; all the girls were in love with him. He took Holly Ellenbogen to their [[Prom|senior prom]], but at the afterparty he was caught in bed with Michael from his Spanish class. He is now a first-grade teacher at Pembridge Academy, an elite [[private school]], and lives with his boyfriend, Aaron. He goes to the reunion party hoping to make amends. He enjoys watching television, especially when Holly is reporting on the news. He has become good friends with Ethan since the party for Holly's daughter Oprah, where Ethan pretended to be someone named Dan Slutski. He also plays racquetball with Ethan. He appeared to lose contact with Holly after \"The Class Runs into a Convenience Store\".\n* Richard (a.k.a. Richie) Brittany Velch was a quiet kid whose life had gone downhill since third grade; Ethan's party invitation interrupted nothing less than his suicide attempt. He and Lina hit it off at the party, but he accidentally ran over her feet with his car afterwards. At the hospital, an angry Kat told him to stay away and he went back to finish his suicide. He was just swallowing the pills when Kat called to tell him that Lina's first words were a request to see him again. Prior to the reunion, Richie had been a researcher at a pharmaceutical company; but after blowing the whistle on his employer, he lost that job and had to take another one trucking [[toxic waste]] to a [[landfill]] in [[New Jersey]]. He later reunited with Duncan Carmello, who was installing [[wheelchair]] ramps in Lina's apartment. Duncan invited him to help renovate Nicole and Yonk Allen's house and even offered him a permanent position upon completion of that job. Though (unhappily) married when he met Lina, he left his wife soon afterwards \u2013 something he'd been trying to work up the courage to do for years. At the series' end, he proposed to Lina and she accepted. In [[High school (North America)|high school]], he worked at the local [[RadioShack]] and had a crush on Melanie Deacon.\n* Nicole Allen (formerly Nicole Campbell) is a pretty woman who was popular in high school. She was in love with Duncan, but he dumped her on Valentine's Day. She is now the unfulfilled, but loving, [[trophy wife]] of former pro-football player Yonk Allen. After the party, she spent the night with Duncan but went back to her husband. When Duncan visited her house, he realized he'd been on the construction crew for it. He pointed out how badly it had been built, and Nicole got Yonk to agree to hire Duncan to fix it up. Yonk knew so little about his wife's likes and dislikes that he gifted her a [[striptease|stripping]] [[Pole dance|pole]] for their anniversary. In \"The Class Springs a Leak\", Nicole decided to leave Yonk for Duncan \u2013 but in the final episode, she expresses doubt after Yonk suffers a heart attack. Her final decision is unknown.\n* Holly Ellenbogen<ref name=\"lucypunch\" /> was Kyle Lendo's senior prom date, but she was heartbroken when she discovered him cheating on her with a guy at the afterparty. She is now a successful [[Reporter|television news reporter]]. She is married to Perry Pearl, an interior decorator; they have a daughter, Oprah Pearl. Holly attended the reunion party mainly to rub her happiness in Kyle's face. Oprah is eventually admitted to Pembridge Academy and enrolled in Kyle's first-grade class. Holly seems oblivious to her husband's embodiment of a flamboyantly gay stereotype, a running joke among the other classmates. She apparently gets this trait from her mother, who is also married to an effeminate man. The character's final appearance was somewhat of a cliffhanger in \"The Class Visits a Bad Neighborhood\", in which Fern Velch vows over the phone to \"get her\" after Richie, at gunpoint, tells her he is dating \"Holly Ellenbogen\" \u2013 blurting out what he thought sounded like a made-up name \u2013 to protect Lina. Actress Lucy Punch left the show due to creative changes implemented by the executive producers.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://community.tvguide.com/thread.jspa?threadID=700016446 |title=''The Class'' Drops a Mate |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |date=January 12, 2007 |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016070538/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-News-Blog/Todays-News/Class-Drops-Mate/700016446 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> But Perry makes an appearance in both \"The Class Has a Snow Day\" and the finale, confirming that Holly is okay.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* Tina Carmello is Duncan's mother, who means well but can sometimes be a bit overbearing. She did show understanding when Nicole came by her house to be with Duncan, and she left them alone. She frequently appears at unexpected times \u2013 particularly when she is revealed to be [[eavesdropping]] on Duncan's telephone conversations. According to Duncan, she also steals.\n* Yonk Allen is a legendary University of Tennessee and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[List of American football players|football player]] and spokesman for a line of [[barbecue grill]]s (of which it turns out that one in every fifty blow up). He seems to put his personal achievements \u2013 including playing in the [[Super Bowl]], earning money from his barbecue grill endorsements, and having dinner at the [[White House]] \u2013 ahead of Nicole and her feelings. He is aware of his wife's and Duncan's former relationship; while uncomfortable with it, he uses Duncan to get insight into his wife's psyche. Nicole is his third wife. His first wife's name is unknown. His second is named Eileen; he is still in contact with her. He's also mistaken Nicole for her at least once. He has at least two daughters from previous marriages: one who is attractive, and one who inherited his build and her mother's personality; an unrefined character named Penny. He is good friends with [[Jerry Rice]]. At the end of \"The Class Rides a Bull\", he has a heart attack. He undergoes a quintuple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]]; his fate is unknown.\n* Perry Pearl is Holly's husband, a highly [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] man. Kyle and Aaron find him to be an amusing stereotype of a \"gay\" personality: he is very excitable, acts as the family gourmand, regularly instructs his wife on how to dress, and purposely failed to hire puppeteers for his daughter's birthday party so that he would have an excuse to put on his own sock-puppet musical revue. But despite all this, he is, according to himself, heterosexual. He appears to have a platonic boy-crush on Aaron. Perry is an interior decorator, and was hired by Nicole Allen to redecorate her home.\n* Palmer Wyland is Ethan's ex-girlfriend. She went to art school with Kat, who strongly dislikes her. Palmer used to have a crush on Kat. She is also a photographer, and usually takes pictures of fruit in costumes, which annoys Kat. She is known not to be particularly bright. Her relationship with Ethan is more sexual than serious. They recently broke up.\n* Fern Velch, Richie's ex-wife, works as a cleaning lady in Lina's office. She was his first (and only) girlfriend in college. Richie has recently left her after years of unhappiness. She responded with a death threat to Holly Ellenbogen (the woman whom she thought stole Richie away). It was revealed in the episode \"The Class Hits It\" that Richie had only ever slept with Fern, and that she'd literally booed him during intercourse. She also complained that it was like a damp, old man was dying on top of her.\n* Aaron is Kyle's live-in boyfriend. Holly has difficulty understanding him, supposedly due to his heavy [[Hispanic]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], though in reality it is not very strong.  He is not fond of Holly, but tolerates her for Kyle's sake. He is a software engineer for an internet security company. Sometime after \"The Class Hits It\", he travels to [[Chile]] and returns at the end of \"[[The Class Goes Back to the Hospital]]\".\n* Oprah Liza Pearl is the name of Holly and Perry's daughter, whom Perry named after [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Liza Minnelli]]. Her babysitter's name is Samantha. She has a birthday in the episode \"The Class Celebrates a Birthday\". She attends Pembridge Academy, where Kyle Lendo is her teacher.\n* Benjamin Chow is an internationally-known English violinist, and Kat's ex-boyfriend. Kat used to stalk him before they dated (and he did forgive her after he found out). Kat was actually his mistress; he has a girlfriend named Susan. He has a son, Jonah, who is one of Ethan's patients.\n* Penny Allen is Yonk's daughter, and Nicole's stepdaughter. Her [[biological]] mother is Yonk's first wife. She has been described as having Yonk's build and her mother's (presumably unpleasant) personality. Yonk nicknames her \"[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]\" and Duncan nicknames her \"The Creature\". She doesn't appreciate waiting for food.\n\n==Production history==\n\n===Conception===\nThe idea for ''The Class and the ...teacher'' came about when show creators David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik were cleaning their basement and they found a box of David Crane's school photographs of him with his third grade class. The pair wondered what the third graders were like now and if they were happy with their lives or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-class/exclusive-interview-david-crane-and-jeffrey-klarik-creators-of-the-class-2292.aspx |title=Exclusive Interview: David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik, Creators of The Class |accessdate=October 15, 2007 |author=Buddy TV |date=November 2, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924062745/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-class/exclusive-interview-david-crane-and-jeffrey-klarik-creators-of-the-class-2292.aspx |archive-date=September 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDue to the overwhelming reputation of the creators, CBS, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and NBC made bids for a full 13-episode season, the latter network was also reported to have offered a 22 episode commitment, prior to seeing a pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7003 |title=DEVELOPMENT UPDATE: OCTOBER 10\u201311 |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |author=The Futon Critic Staff |date=October 11, 2005}}</ref> Ultimately, CBS won the bidding war with an undisclosed amount.\n\n====Casting====\nIn December 2005, English actress Lucy Punch was the first lead to be cast for the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7047 |title=DEVELOPMENT UPDATE: DECEMBER 12\u201314 |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |author=The Futon Critic Staff |date=December 5, 2005}}</ref>\n\nNext to be cast, in January 2006 were Jason Ritter and Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Ethan Haas and Richie Velch respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7063 |title=DEVELOPMENT UPDATE: JANUARY 18\u201319 |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |author=The Futon Critic Staff |date=January 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, Jon Bernthal, Heather Goldenhersh, and Andrea Anders (who, at the time was still part of the cast of ''[[Friends]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', which was on hiatus) were cast as Duncan Carmello, Lina Warbler and Nicole Allen.

The series followed the lives of eight very different alumni of the fictional Woodman Elementary School. The show was created by [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Jeffrey Klarik]]'s production company CraneKlarik in association with [[Warner Bros.

A former classmate brings them all together for a party to celebrate his engagement to a girl he met in the class. However, she ends up dumping him at the party as the reunited classmates get to know each other. \"They have separate lives and there are few connections that exist beforehand,\" Klarik said. \"But through the course of the series, connections are made between the characters.

Haas planned the ultimate surprise party for his beloved [[fianc\u00e9e]], Joanne Richman (Casey Wilson): a [[Class reunion|reunion]] with their [[third-grade]] classmates to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the day they met. But Joanne felt he was smothering her and left. He is a [[pediatrician]] with a [[golden retriever]], like his ex-fianc\u00e9e. He met a woman named Sue who mistook him for a guy named Dan with whom she was supposed to have a blind date. When Ethan told Sue that he had lied about his identity at Oprah's birthday party (after many people, including Holly Ellenbogen, Perry Pearl, and Kyle Lendo, called him by his real name), she dumped him. He has developed a strong friendship with Kat and they have spent much time together. Ethan was the one who found out about Kat's boyfriend, Benjamin Chow, cheating on her with a girl named Susan, from Benjamin's son Jonah (who is one of Ethan's patients). By the [[The Class Goes Back to the Hospital|end of the series]], Ethan discovered he has romantic feelings for Kat and the storyline ended with him trying to pursue them.\n* Kat Warbler is Lina's [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] fraternal twin sister whose [[Sarcasm|sarcastic]] tongue hides her kind heart. She is a freelance [[photographer]]. She helps Ethan cope after he is dumped; behind her cynicism, she seems attracted to him. The two share a strong friendship.  Her birthday is adjacent to [[Son of Sam]]'s. She dated a world-famous violinist named Benjamin Chow, whom she had stalked for months, until she found that he had another girlfriend named Susan. She broke up with him when she asked him about it. Her storyline ended with her appearing to have a [[one-night stand]] with Duncan Carmello after she visits his house looking for her sister Lina, who was at the hospital.\n* Lina Warbler, Kat's [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twin]] sister, wears her heart on her sleeve and remains optimistic about love. She received the telephone call about Ethan's party just as she found her boyfriend Adam, in her bed with another woman. She hit it off with Richie at the party, but their budding relationship has encountered significant obstacles \u2013 particularly, the revelation that Richie is married; although, it seems that she has forgiven him.  After their first date, Richie accidentally ran over Lina's feet with his car, breaking 52 bones and causing her to wear casts until \"The Class Has to Go to a Stupid Museum\". She also got lost in a [[hurricane]] and was sent flying into a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[car]] holding her umbrella, which she said made her feel like [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]]. Lina, a vegetarian, hosts a dinner party where she serves Moroccan chicken that Richie calls \"The [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] of Chickens\".  Lina and Richie became informally engaged at the [[The Class Goes Back to the Hospital|end of the series]].\n* Duncan Carmello was a well-liked boy in school and is now a [[General contractor|contractor]] who still lives with his mother, Tina Carmello. He had a relationship with Nicole Allen in high school but dumped her, a decision he now regrets. In \"The Class Has a Snowday\", it was revealed that he dumped her because she was \"being a [[bitch (insult)|bitch]]\" the night of Valentine's Day. After they spent the night of the party together, he got a job renovating her house while trying to win her back. In \"The Class Springs a Leak\", he had finished the renovations, prompting Nicole to decide whether she wants to stay with Yonk or leave him for Duncan. She chose Duncan, but she second-guessed it when Yonk landed in the hospital. Duncan refused to leave the relationship in limbo; his storyline ended with him appearing to have a [[one-night stand]] with Kat Warbler.\n* Kyle Lendo was a popular boy in school; all the girls were in love with him. He took Holly Ellenbogen to their [[Prom|senior prom]], but at the afterparty he was caught in bed with Michael from his Spanish class. He is now a first-grade teacher at Pembridge Academy, an elite [[private school]], and lives with his boyfriend, Aaron. He goes to the reunion party hoping to make amends. He enjoys watching television, especially when Holly is reporting on the news. He has become good friends with Ethan since the party for Holly's daughter Oprah, where Ethan pretended to be someone named Dan Slutski. He also plays racquetball with Ethan. He appeared to lose contact with Holly after \"The Class Runs into a Convenience Store\".\n* Richard (a.k.a. Richie) Brittany Velch was a quiet kid whose life had gone downhill since third grade; Ethan's party invitation interrupted nothing less than his suicide attempt. He and Lina hit it off at the party, but he accidentally ran over her feet with his car afterwards. At the hospital, an angry Kat told him to stay away and he went back to finish his suicide. He was just swallowing the pills when Kat called to tell him that Lina's first words were a request to see him again. Prior to the reunion, Richie had been a researcher at a pharmaceutical company; but after blowing the whistle on his employer, he lost that job and had to take another one trucking [[toxic waste]] to a [[landfill]] in [[New Jersey]]. He later reunited with Duncan Carmello, who was installing [[wheelchair]] ramps in Lina's apartment. Duncan invited him to help renovate Nicole and Yonk Allen's house and even offered him a permanent position upon completion of that job. Though (unhappily) married when he met Lina, he left his wife soon afterwards \u2013 something he'd been trying to work up the courage to do for years. At the series' end, he proposed to Lina and she accepted. In [[High school (North America)|high school]], he worked at the local [[RadioShack]] and had a crush on Melanie Deacon.\n* Nicole Allen (formerly Nicole Campbell) is a pretty woman who was popular in high school. She was in love with Duncan, but he dumped her on Valentine's Day. She is now the unfulfilled, but loving, [[trophy wife]] of former pro-football player Yonk Allen. After the party, she spent the night with Duncan but went back to her husband. When Duncan visited her house, he realized he'd been on the construction crew for it. He pointed out how badly it had been built, and Nicole got Yonk to agree to hire Duncan to fix it up. Yonk knew so little about his wife's likes and dislikes that he gifted her a [[striptease|stripping]] [[Pole dance|pole]] for their anniversary. In \"The Class Springs a Leak\", Nicole decided to leave Yonk for Duncan \u2013 but in the final episode, she expresses doubt after Yonk suffers a heart attack. Her final decision is unknown.\n* Holly Ellenbogen<ref name=\"lucypunch\" /> was Kyle Lendo's senior prom date, but she was heartbroken when she discovered him cheating on her with a guy at the afterparty. She is now a successful [[Reporter|television news reporter]]. She is married to Perry Pearl, an interior decorator; they have a daughter, Oprah Pearl. Holly attended the reunion party mainly to rub her happiness in Kyle's face. Oprah is eventually admitted to Pembridge Academy and enrolled in Kyle's first-grade class. Holly seems oblivious to her husband's embodiment of a flamboyantly gay stereotype, a running joke among the other classmates. She apparently gets this trait from her mother, who is also married to an effeminate man. The character's final appearance was somewhat of a cliffhanger in \"The Class Visits a Bad Neighborhood\", in which Fern Velch vows over the phone to \"get her\" after Richie, at gunpoint, tells her he is dating \"Holly Ellenbogen\" \u2013 blurting out what he thought sounded like a made-up name \u2013 to protect Lina. Actress Lucy Punch left the show due to creative changes implemented by the executive producers.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://community.tvguide.com/thread.jspa?threadID=700016446 |title=''The Class'' Drops a Mate |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |date=January 12, 2007 |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016070538/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-News-Blog/Todays-News/Class-Drops-Mate/700016446 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> But Perry makes an appearance in both \"The Class Has a Snow Day\" and the finale, confirming that Holly is okay.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* Tina Carmello is Duncan's mother, who means well but can sometimes be a bit overbearing. She did show understanding when Nicole came by her house to be with Duncan, and she left them alone. She frequently appears at unexpected times \u2013 particularly when she is revealed to be [[eavesdropping]] on Duncan's telephone conversations. According to Duncan, she also steals.\n* Yonk Allen is a legendary University of Tennessee and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[List of American football players|football player]] and spokesman for a line of [[barbecue grill]]s (of which it turns out that one in every fifty blow up). He seems to put his personal achievements \u2013 including playing in the [[Super Bowl]], earning money from his barbecue grill endorsements, and having dinner at the [[White House]] \u2013 ahead of Nicole and her feelings. He is aware of his wife's and Duncan's former relationship; while uncomfortable with it, he uses Duncan to get insight into his wife's psyche. Nicole is his third wife. His first wife's name is unknown. His second is named Eileen; he is still in contact with her. He's also mistaken Nicole for her at least once. He has at least two daughters from previous marriages: one who is attractive, and one who inherited his build and her mother's personality; an unrefined character named Penny. He is good friends with [[Jerry Rice]]. At the end of \"The Class Rides a Bull\", he has a heart attack. He undergoes a quintuple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]]; his fate is unknown.\n* Perry Pearl is Holly's husband, a highly [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] man. Kyle and Aaron find him to be an amusing stereotype of a \"gay\" personality: he is very excitable, acts as the family gourmand, regularly instructs his wife on how to dress, and purposely failed to hire puppeteers for his daughter's birthday party so that he would have an excuse to put on his own sock-puppet musical revue. But despite all this, he is, according to himself, heterosexual. He appears to have a platonic boy-crush on Aaron. Perry is an interior decorator, and was hired by Nicole Allen to redecorate her home.\n* Palmer Wyland is Ethan's ex-girlfriend. She went to art school with Kat, who strongly dislikes her. Palmer used to have a crush on Kat. She is also a photographer, and usually takes pictures of fruit in costumes, which annoys Kat. She is known not to be particularly bright. Her relationship with Ethan is more sexual than serious. They recently broke up.\n* Fern Velch, Richie's ex-wife, works as a cleaning lady in Lina's office. She was his first (and only) girlfriend in college. Richie has recently left her after years of unhappiness. She responded with a death threat to Holly Ellenbogen (the woman whom she thought stole Richie away). It was revealed in the episode \"The Class Hits It\" that Richie had only ever slept with Fern, and that she'd literally booed him during intercourse. She also complained that it was like a damp, old man was dying on top of her.\n* Aaron is Kyle's live-in boyfriend. Holly has difficulty understanding him, supposedly due to his heavy [[Hispanic]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], though in reality it is not very strong.  He is not fond of Holly, but tolerates her for Kyle's sake. He is a software engineer for an internet security company. Sometime after \"The Class Hits It\", he travels to [[Chile]] and returns at the end of \"[[The Class Goes Back to the Hospital]]\".\n* Oprah Liza Pearl is the name of Holly and Perry's daughter, whom Perry named after [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Liza Minnelli]]. Her babysitter's name is Samantha. She has a birthday in the episode \"The Class Celebrates a Birthday\". She attends Pembridge Academy, where Kyle Lendo is her teacher.\n* Benjamin Chow is an internationally-known English violinist, and Kat's ex-boyfriend. Kat used to stalk him before they dated (and he did forgive her after he found out). Kat was actually his mistress; he has a girlfriend named Susan. He has a son, Jonah, who is one of Ethan's patients.\n* Penny Allen is Yonk's daughter, and Nicole's stepdaughter. Her [[biological]] mother is Yonk's first wife. She has been described as having Yonk's build and her mother's (presumably unpleasant) personality. Yonk nicknames her \"[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]\" and Duncan nicknames her \"The Creature\". She doesn't appreciate waiting for food.\n\n==Production history==\n\n===Conception===\nThe idea for ''The Class and the ...teacher'' came about when show creators David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik were cleaning their basement and they found a box of David Crane's school photographs of him with his third grade class. The pair wondered what the third graders were like now and if they were happy with their lives or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-class/exclusive-interview-david-crane-and-jeffrey-klarik-creators-of-the-class-2292.aspx |title=Exclusive Interview: David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik, Creators of The Class |accessdate=October 15, 2007 |author=Buddy TV |date=November 2, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924062745/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-class/exclusive-interview-david-crane-and-jeffrey-klarik-creators-of-the-class-2292.aspx |archive-date=September 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDue to the overwhelming reputation of the creators, CBS, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and NBC made bids for a full 13-episode season, the latter network was also reported to have offered a 22 episode commitment, prior to seeing a pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7003 |title=DEVELOPMENT UPDATE: OCTOBER 10\u201311 |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |author=The Futon Critic Staff |date=October 11, 2005}}</ref> Ultimately, CBS won the bidding war with an undisclosed amount.\n\n====Casting====\nIn December 2005, English actress Lucy Punch was the first lead to be cast for the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7047 |title=DEVELOPMENT UPDATE: DECEMBER 12\u201314 |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |author=The Futon Critic Staff |date=December 5, 2005}}</ref>\n\nNext to be cast, in January 2006 were Jason Ritter and Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Ethan Haas and Richie Velch respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7063 |title=DEVELOPMENT UPDATE: JANUARY 18\u201319 |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |author=The Futon Critic Staff |date=January 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, Jon Bernthal, Heather Goldenhersh, and Andrea Anders (who, at the time was still part of the cast of ''[[Friends]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', which was on hiatus) were cast as Duncan Carmello, Lina Warbler and Nicole Allen.

The show was produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] and Chernin Entertainment. The show was created by Dana Fox who served as an executive producer alongside [[Peter Chernin]], Katherie Pope, and [[Jake Kasdan]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe series focuses on a brother and sister who at first seem to be exact opposites: Ben is an over-the-top dreamer and professional underachiever, while younger sister Kate is a more practical single mother working as a bar manager. After visiting their home in [[Los Angeles]], Ben realizes that his sister needs help with her life and taking care of her six-year-old daughter, Maddie. Because of this, he moves in with Kate so he can discover some of the things he has missed out on and Kate hopes to return the favor by bringing her brother back to reality. Along the way, they are surrounded by their close friends, B.J. and Tommy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main cast and characters===\n*[[Dakota Johnson]] as Kate Fox, a neurotic and awkward yet earnest single mom who works as a bartender. Her college boyfriend broke up with her once she became pregnant with Maddie and she is since wary of the dating world.\n*[[Nat Faxon]] as Ben Fox, Kate's goofy older brother who moves into her house.  Despite being caught in a state of arrested development, Ben is very popular and protective of his family. He frequently tries his hand at [[inventing]] and [[entrepreneurship]], though few attempts pan out.  His ideas include \"Bunk Bed Pizza\", which makes another friend rich, and, more recently, \"Rail Mall\", which he actually focuses on turning into a reality.\n*[[Lucy Punch]] as BJ (Beatrice Joan) Harrison, Kate's much more confident best friend and co-worker.  A vain hard partier, BJ is secretly married to Ben, despite the two sharing no feelings for each other. She often lectures Maddie at a level beyond her understanding. Although she has a British accent, she reveals she's actually from Texas.\n*[[Maggie Elizabeth Jones]] as Maddie Fox, Kate's 6-year-old daughter.\n*[[Echo Kellum]] as Tommy, Ben's charismatic best friend who works at a country club as a tennis instructor. In addition to sharing many of Ben's quirks, Tommy has been in love with Kate since high school. He is also a frequent collaborator on Ben's quirky schemes and business ideas.\n\n===Recurring cast and characters===\n*[[Geoff Stults]] as Will, a friendly single dad and neighbor who briefly dates Kate. Though they have chemistry, he becomes wary of her eccentric friends and family.\n*[[Rob Corddry]] as Buddy, the boorish owner of the bar where Kate and BJ work, also BJ's on-and-off boyfriend.\n*[[Brittany Snow]] as Lila, Tommy's girlfriend.\n*[[Melinda McGraw]] as Vera, a successful businesswoman who is physically attracted to Ben and helps his \"Rail Mall\" idea become an actual business.\n*[[Lauren Miller]] as Darcy, Ben's ex, whom he is still in love with when the series begins.\n*[[Luka Jones]] as Lance, a laid-back baker who begins to date Kate after she breaks up with Will.\n*[[Bruce McGill]] as Randy, Ben and Kate's negligent yet friendly father.\n\n==Production==\n===Development and production===\nIn October 2011, Fox bought the project, titled ''Ben Fox is My Manny'', from creator [[Dana Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-buys-sibling-comedy-from-feature-scribe-dana-fox-with-penalty/|title=Fox Buys Sibling Comedy From Feature Writer Dana Fox With Penalty|author=Andreeva, Nellie|date=25 October 2011|publisher=deadline.com|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> In January 2012, Fox ordered the show to pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/fox-greenlights-dana-fox-comedy-pilot/|title=Fox Greenlights Dana Fox Comedy Pilot|author=Andreeva, Nellie|date=9 January 2012|publisher=deadline.com|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> The show was retitled to ''Ned Fox Is My Manny'', then to ''The Kids'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/casting/fox-pilot-ned-fox-is-my-manny-gets-new-name-new-casting-directors/|title=Fox Pilot \u2018Ned Fox Is My Manny\u2019 Gets New Name, New Casting Directors|author=Keeley, Pete|date=30 March 2012|publisher=backstage.com|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> before finally being called ''Ben and Kate''.

The show was produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] and Chernin Entertainment. The show was created by Dana Fox who served as an executive producer alongside [[Peter Chernin]], Katherie Pope, and [[Jake Kasdan]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe series focuses on a brother and sister who at first seem to be exact opposites: Ben is an over-the-top dreamer and professional underachiever, while younger sister Kate is a more practical single mother working as a bar manager. After visiting their home in [[Los Angeles]], Ben realizes that his sister needs help with her life and taking care of her six-year-old daughter, Maddie. Because of this, he moves in with Kate so he can discover some of the things he has missed out on and Kate hopes to return the favor by bringing her brother back to reality. Along the way, they are surrounded by their close friends, B.J. and Tommy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main cast and characters===\n*[[Dakota Johnson]] as Kate Fox, a neurotic and awkward yet earnest single mom who works as a bartender. Her college boyfriend broke up with her once she became pregnant with Maddie and she is since wary of the dating world.\n*[[Nat Faxon]] as Ben Fox, Kate's goofy older brother who moves into her house.  Despite being caught in a state of arrested development, Ben is very popular and protective of his family. He frequently tries his hand at [[inventing]] and [[entrepreneurship]], though few attempts pan out.  His ideas include \"Bunk Bed Pizza\", which makes another friend rich, and, more recently, \"Rail Mall\", which he actually focuses on turning into a reality.\n*[[Lucy Punch]] as BJ (Beatrice Joan) Harrison, Kate's much more confident best friend and co-worker.  A vain hard partier, BJ is secretly married to Ben, despite the two sharing no feelings for each other. She often lectures Maddie at a level beyond her understanding. Although she has a British accent, she reveals she's actually from Texas.\n*[[Maggie Elizabeth Jones]] as Maddie Fox, Kate's 6-year-old daughter.\n*[[Echo Kellum]] as Tommy, Ben's charismatic best friend who works at a country club as a tennis instructor. In addition to sharing many of Ben's quirks, Tommy has been in love with Kate since high school. He is also a frequent collaborator on Ben's quirky schemes and business ideas.\n\n===Recurring cast and characters===\n*[[Geoff Stults]] as Will, a friendly single dad and neighbor who briefly dates Kate. Though they have chemistry, he becomes wary of her eccentric friends and family.\n*[[Rob Corddry]] as Buddy, the boorish owner of the bar where Kate and BJ work, also BJ's on-and-off boyfriend.\n*[[Brittany Snow]] as Lila, Tommy's girlfriend.\n*[[Melinda McGraw]] as Vera, a successful businesswoman who is physically attracted to Ben and helps his \"Rail Mall\" idea become an actual business.\n*[[Lauren Miller]] as Darcy, Ben's ex, whom he is still in love with when the series begins.\n*[[Luka Jones]] as Lance, a laid-back baker who begins to date Kate after she breaks up with Will.\n*[[Bruce McGill]] as Randy, Ben and Kate's negligent yet friendly father.\n\n==Production==\n===Development and production===\nIn October 2011, Fox bought the project, titled ''Ben Fox is My Manny'', from creator [[Dana Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-buys-sibling-comedy-from-feature-scribe-dana-fox-with-penalty/|title=Fox Buys Sibling Comedy From Feature Writer Dana Fox With Penalty|author=Andreeva, Nellie|date=25 October 2011|publisher=deadline.com|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> In January 2012, Fox ordered the show to pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/fox-greenlights-dana-fox-comedy-pilot/|title=Fox Greenlights Dana Fox Comedy Pilot|author=Andreeva, Nellie|date=9 January 2012|publisher=deadline.com|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> The show was retitled to ''Ned Fox Is My Manny'', then to ''The Kids'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/casting/fox-pilot-ned-fox-is-my-manny-gets-new-name-new-casting-directors/|title=Fox Pilot \u2018Ned Fox Is My Manny\u2019 Gets New Name, New Casting Directors|author=Keeley, Pete|date=30 March 2012|publisher=backstage.com|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> before finally being called ''Ben and Kate''.
