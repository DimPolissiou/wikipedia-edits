Corral}}\n'''Joseph Isaac Clanton''' (1847 \u2013 June 1, 1887) was a member of a loose association of outlaws known as [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|The Cowboys]] who clashed with lawmen [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Morgan Earp]] as well as [[Doc Holliday]]. On October 26, 1881, Clanton was present at the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] in the [[boomtown]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]] but was unarmed and ran from the gunfight, in which his 19-year-old brother, [[Billy Clanton|Billy]], was killed.\n\nClanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday but after a 30-day preliminary hearing, Justice [[Wells Spicer]] ruled that the lawmen had acted within their lawful duty. Clanton was implicated in the attempted assassination of Virgil Earp on December 30, 1881 but other Cowboys provided an alibi and he was released. Six years later Clanton was killed attempting to flee when he was shot by a lawman seeking to arrest him for [[cattle raiding|cattle-rustling]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n{{details|topic=his early life|Newman Haynes Clanton}}\n\nBorn in [[Callaway County, Missouri]], Joseph Isaac \"Ike\" Clanton was one of seven children of [[Newman Haynes Clanton]], (1816\u20131881) and his wife Mariah Sexton (Kelso) Clanton. His father worked at times as a day laborer, a gold miner, a farmer, and by the late 1870s, a cattleman in [[Arizona Territory]].\n\nClanton's mother died in 1866. Ike stayed with the family when they moved to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone, Arizona Territory]], about 1877 (before Tombstone became a town or even a mining center). At that time, Newman Clanton was living with his sons [[Phineas Clanton|Phin]] (or \"Fin\"), Ike, and Billy. By 1878 Ike was running a small \"lunch counter\" at the Tombstone Mill site (now Millville on the San Pedro River\u2014not in modern Tombstone). By 1881, however, he was working on his father's ranch at Lewis Springs, about {{convert|12|mi}} west of Tombstone and {{convert|5|mi}} from [[Charleston, Arizona|Charleston]].<ref>Traywick, B., Wyatt Earp's 13 Dead Men, pg. 15</ref>\n\nThe Clantons and their ranch hands and associates were known as the \"[[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]\", and they had a reputation for reckless behavior. They were accused of [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustling]] from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Mexico border]], as well as other acts of banditry and murder.\n\n== Notoriety, clashes with the Earp lawmen ==\n\nClanton's notoriety is based largely on his conflict with [[Wyatt Earp]] and Wyatt's friend [[Doc Holliday]]. The Earps and the Clantons had political, personal, and legal differences and the animosity between them grew throughout 1881. The Cowboys supported incumbent Sheriff Charles Shibell while the Earps supported his opponent Bob Paul in the November 1880 election. Clanton repeatedly boasted in public, drank heavily, and had a quick temper. He was well known for talking too much.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn November 1879, shortly after arriving in Tombstone, Earp had a horse stolen. More than a year later, probably sometime in December 1880, Earp was told the horse was being used near Charleston, and Wyatt and Holliday were forced to ride to the Clanton's ranch near Charleston to await ownership papers in order to legally recover it. According to Wyatt's testimony later, 18-year-old Billy Clanton asked him insolently if he had any more horses to \"lose,\" but he gave the horse up without first being shown the ownership papers, demonstrating to Wyatt that Billy Clanton knew to whom the horse belonged. Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] later testified that the incident had angered Ike Clanton. It also angered Earp.\n\n===Earp offers Clanton reward money===\n\nAfter he was passed over by [[Johnny Behan]] for the position of [[undersheriff]], Earp thought he might beat him in the next [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] election. He thought catching the March 15, 1881 robbers of the Benson Stage (in which the driver and a passenger were killed) would help him win the sheriff's office. Earp later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the [[Wells Fargo|Wells, Fargo & Co.]] reward money and more to Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Earp, the plan was foiled when the three suspects, Leonard, Head and Crane, were killed in unrelated incidents.<ref name=\"historynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2011|publisher=HistoryNet.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005161307/http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|archivedate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1881, Clanton got into an argument with gambler \"Denny\" McCann. On the morning of June 9, 1881, they were drinking in an Allen Street [[Western saloon|saloon]] when Clanton insulted McCann. McCann slapped Clanton, who left and fetched his pistol. McCann did the same and the two met on the street in front of the Wells Fargo office.

On October 25, 1881, while Clanton was in Tombstone, drunk and very loud, Holliday accused him of lying about the Benson stagecoach robbery. Tombstone City Marshal Virgil Earp intervened and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing, and Holliday went home.\n\nAfter the confrontation with Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his boarding house at Camillus Sidney \"Buck\" Fly's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then went home and to bed. [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] [[Marshal]] Virgil Earp played cards with Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise [[County Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]] and a fifth man (unknown to Clanton and to history), until morning.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/>\n\nAt about dawn on October 26, the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed.

Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Clanton, who had been drinking all night, in front of the telegraph office. Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Clanton insisted he would not go to bed.

They had heard from their neighbor, Ed Frink, that Clanton had been stirring up trouble in town overnight, and they had ridden into town on horseback to back up their brothers.

Clanton also said Holliday had confessed to him about killing the stage driver.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/> Murder was a [[capital offense]], and given their relationship, it was unlikely Holliday would confide in Clanton.

Corral}}\n'''Joseph Isaac Clanton''' (1847 \u2013 June 1, 1887) was a member of a loose association of outlaws known as [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|The Cowboys]] who clashed with lawmen [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Morgan Earp]] as well as [[Doc Holliday]]. On October 26, 1881, Clanton was present at the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] in the [[boomtown]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]] but was unarmed and ran from the gunfight, in which his 19-year-old brother, [[Billy Clanton|Billy]], was killed.\n\nClanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday but after a 30-day preliminary hearing, Justice [[Wells Spicer]] ruled that the lawmen had acted within their lawful duty. Clanton was implicated in the attempted assassination of Virgil Earp on December 30, 1881 but other Cowboys provided an alibi and he was released. Six years later Clanton was killed attempting to flee when he was shot by a lawman seeking to arrest him for [[cattle raiding|cattle-rustling]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n{{details|topic=his early life|Newman Haynes Clanton}}\n\nBorn in [[Callaway County, Missouri]], Joseph Isaac \"Ike\" Clanton was one of seven children of [[Newman Haynes Clanton]], (1816\u20131881) and his wife Mariah Sexton (Kelso) Clanton. His father worked at times as a day laborer, a gold miner, a farmer, and by the late 1870s, a cattleman in [[Arizona Territory]].\n\nClanton's mother died in 1866. Ike stayed with the family when they moved to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone, Arizona Territory]], about 1877 (before Tombstone became a town or even a mining center). At that time, Newman Clanton was living with his sons [[Phineas Clanton|Phin]] (or \"Fin\"), Ike, and Billy. By 1878 Ike was running a small \"lunch counter\" at the Tombstone Mill site (now Millville on the San Pedro River\u2014not in modern Tombstone). By 1881, however, he was working on his father's ranch at Lewis Springs, about {{convert|12|mi}} west of Tombstone and {{convert|5|mi}} from [[Charleston, Arizona|Charleston]].<ref>Traywick, B., Wyatt Earp's 13 Dead Men, pg. 15</ref>\n\nThe Clantons and their ranch hands and associates were known as the \"[[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]\", and they had a reputation for reckless behavior. They were accused of [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustling]] from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Mexico border]], as well as other acts of banditry and murder.\n\n== Notoriety, clashes with the Earp lawmen ==\n\nClanton's notoriety is based largely on his conflict with [[Wyatt Earp]] and Wyatt's friend [[Doc Holliday]]. The Earps and the Clantons had political, personal, and legal differences and the animosity between them grew throughout 1881. The Cowboys supported incumbent Sheriff Charles Shibell while the Earps supported his opponent Bob Paul in the November 1880 election. Clanton repeatedly boasted in public, drank heavily, and had a quick temper. He was well known for talking too much.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn November 1879, shortly after arriving in Tombstone, Earp had a horse stolen. More than a year later, probably sometime in December 1880, Earp was told the horse was being used near Charleston, and Wyatt and Holliday were forced to ride to the Clanton's ranch near Charleston to await ownership papers in order to legally recover it. According to Wyatt's testimony later, 18-year-old Billy Clanton asked him insolently if he had any more horses to \"lose,\" but he gave the horse up without first being shown the ownership papers, demonstrating to Wyatt that Billy Clanton knew to whom the horse belonged. Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] later testified that the incident had angered Ike Clanton. It also angered Earp.\n\n===Earp offers Clanton reward money===\n\nAfter he was passed over by [[Johnny Behan]] for the position of [[undersheriff]], Earp thought he might beat him in the next [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] election. He thought catching the March 15, 1881 robbers of the Benson Stage (in which the driver and a passenger were killed) would help him win the sheriff's office. Earp later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the [[Wells Fargo|Wells, Fargo & Co.]] reward money and more to Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Earp, the plan was foiled when the three suspects, Leonard, Head and Crane, were killed in unrelated incidents.<ref name=\"historynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2011|publisher=HistoryNet.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005161307/http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|archivedate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1881, Clanton got into an argument with gambler \"Denny\" McCann. On the morning of June 9, 1881, they were drinking in an Allen Street [[Western saloon|saloon]] when Clanton insulted McCann. McCann slapped Clanton, who left and fetched his pistol.

He decided he had to act. Several members of the citizen's vigilance committee offered to support him with arms, but Virgil said no.<ref name=\"wgbh\"/> He had previously deputized Morgan and Wyatt and also deputized Doc Holliday that morning. Wyatt spoke of his brothers Virgil and Morgan as the \"marshals\" while he acted as \"deputy.\"\n\nWitnesses later testified that Ike Clanton had spent all day, even after his arrest and disarming, threatening to gun down the Earps. However, when the gunfight broke out, Clanton ran forward and grabbed Wyatt, exclaiming that he was unarmed and did not want a fight. To this protest Wyatt said he responded, \"Go to fighting or get away!\".\"<ref name=\"turner\"/>{{rp|66\u201368}}{{rp|164}} Clanton ran through the front door of Fly's boarding house and escaped, unwounded.\n\nIn the days prior to the gunfight, Clanton had enlisted the help of fellow Cowboy [[Billy Claiborne]], who was reputed to be good with a gun. Claiborne, who was also unarmed, fled the gunfight. Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton were killed.\n\n== Files murder charges against Earps ==\n\nAfter the gunfight in Tombstone, during which the McLaury brothers and Billy Clanton were killed, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. They were arrested and released on bail. During a month-long preliminary hearing before Judge [[Wells Spicer]], Clanton told a story of abuse that he had suffered at the hands of the Earps and Holliday the night before the gunfight. He denied threatening the Earps. He testified that the Clantons and Frank McLaury raised their hands after Virgil's command, and Tom thrust open his vest to show he was unarmed. Clanton said Wyatt shoved his revolver in his belly, telling him, \"You son-of-a-bitch, you can have a fight!\".<ref name=\"iketestimony\" />\n\nClanton backed up Cochise County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]]'s testimony that Holliday and Morgan Earp had fired the first two shots and that the next several shots also came from the Earp party.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/> Under [[cross-examination]], Clanton told a story of the lead-up to the gunfight that did not make sense. He said the Benson stage robbery was concocted by the Earps and Holliday to cover up money they had \"piped off\" to pay bribes. Clanton also claimed that Doc Holliday and Morgan, Wyatt, and Virgil Earp had separately confessed to him their role in the Benson stage holdup, or else the cover-up of the robbery by allowing the robbers' escape.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/>\n\nClanton proved a better witness for the defense than the prosecution. He said that Doc Holliday, Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Morgan Earp had all confided in him that they had actually been involved in the stage robbery. He further claimed that Holliday had told him that Holliday had \"piped off\" money from the stage before it left (although no money was missing, and the stage had not been successfully robbed). Clanton also said Holliday had confessed to him about killing the stage driver.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/> Murder was a [[capital offense]], and given their relationship, it was unlikely Holliday would confide in Clanton. Clanton testified that Earp had threatened to kill his confederates because he feared they would reveal his part in the robbery. Clanton said he feared that Wyatt wanted to kill him because he knew of Wyatt's role.

On the morning of the shooting Virgil Earp had arrested him for carrying a revolver. At the gunfight, he was unarmed. Spicer noted that Clanton had claimed the Earps were out to murder him, yet on both occasions that day the Earps had not killed him, and allowed him to escape unchallenged during the fight.

Clanton appears in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story \"[[The Gunfighters]]\" (1966), played by William Hurndell, which is largely based on the Sturges film.

In the film, Clanton is portrayed as being second-in-command of the Clanton Gang and the plot's [[comic relief]]. Although he is sadistic and talks tough, he is cowardly, as he begs for his life whenever someone is trying to kill him.  The film shows him firing at the Earps during the gunfight after running away, though is not clear if this happened. \n\n[[Jeff Fahey]] played Clanton in the movie ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]'' (1994),<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/fahey-williams-others-join-earp-cast-107893/ |title=Fahey, Williams, others join \u2018Earp\u2019 cast |first=Christian |last=Moerk |date=17 June 1993 |access-date=17 January 2019 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]}}</ref> starring [[Kevin Costner]] as Wyatt Earp.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/wyatt-earp-1200437510/ |title=Wyatt Earp |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |date=20 June 1994 |access-date=17 January 2019 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]}}</ref> [[Christopher Fulford]] played him in 2007 in the [[BBC]] drama-documentary ''Gunfight at the O.K.

He vigorously promoted the extension of the Episcopal Church in Central and Western New York.  He founded the [[General Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]] and [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Geneva College]], later renamed Hobart Free College in 1852 after him, in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], in the [[Finger Lakes]] area of upstate New York.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and family===\nJohn Henry Hobart was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Sept. 14, 1775; the son of Capt.

His grandfather John Hobart had moved from [[Hingham, Massachusetts]] to Philadelphia, where he married a Swedish woman and became a member of the [[Anglican Church]]. His great-grandfather Peter Hobart was a graduate of the [[University of Cambridge]], England, 1629, and teacher and pastor in [[Suffolk]]; he emigrated to America in 1635.<ref>''Lamb's Biographical Dictionary of the United States,'' Vol.IV. 1901. p. 86.</ref>\n\n===Education===\nCaptain Hobart died when the future bishop was an infant, and was buried in the family tomb at [[Christ Church Burial Ground]]. At age nine, John was a pupil in the Episcopal Academy. He studied classics under professor [[John Andrews (clergyman)|John Andrews]], 1785\u201390, and followed when his mentor became vice-provost of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], which Hobart attended, 1790-91. He transferred to the junior class of the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] (Princeton) and graduated, A.B., 1793, A.M., 1796. Hobart worked as a tutor at Princeton, 1797\u201398, while pursuing his studies in theology under the direction of Bishop [[William White (bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]].\n\n===Ministry===\nHobart was ordained [[deacon]] by Bishop White in Philadelphia on June 3, 1798, and as a priest by Bishop Provoost on April 5, 1801 in [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]]. He then served as pastor of Trinity Church in [[Oxford, Pennsylvania|Oxford]] and All Saints in [[Perkiomen, Pennsylvania|Perkiomen]] in Pennsylvania, before moving to New Jersey to serve at Christ Church, [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in New York hired Hobart as its assistant minister in 1803. Hobart showed his zeal for the historic episcopacy, ''An Apology for Apostolic Order and its Advocates'' in 1807, a series of letters to John M. Mason, who, in ''The Christian's Magazine'', of which he was editor, had attacked the Episcopacy in general and in particular Hobart's collection of ''Essays on the Subject of Episcopacy'' (1806).<ref>[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/240.html John Henry Hobart]</ref>\n\nIn 1811, Hobart was elected assistant bishop of New York, with the right of succession. The ill-health of Bishop [[Benjamin Moore (bishop)|Benjamin Moore]] led Hobart to effectively run the diocese for several years before formally succeeding on the latter's death in February 1816. As bishop, Hobart worked to build up his diocese, attempting to visit every parish annually. He was able, impetuous, frank, perfectly fearless in controversy, a speaker and preacher of much [[eloquence]]. A supporter of missions to the [[Oneida tribe|Oneida Indians]], Hobart helped relocate many of the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] from New York State to Wisconsin.\n\nHobart was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisth American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>  The AAS holds numerous books and pamphlets authored by or related to Hobart, including many sermons and other theologically related texts.<ref>[http://catalog.mwa.org/vwebv/search?searchType=7&searchId=2281&maxResultsPerPage=10&recCount=10&recPointer=0&resultPointer=0&headingId=666345 AAS online catalog search results for '''Hobart, John Henry, 1775-1830''']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOne of the founders of the [[General Theological Seminary]], Hobart became its professor of Pastoral Theology in 1821, served as its first dean and governed the seminary as bishop. He opposed the plan of [[Philander Chase]], Bishop of [[Episcopal Diocese of Ohio|Ohio]], for an Episcopal seminary in that diocese; but when the [[Ohio]] seminary was made directly responsible to the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|House of Bishops]], Hobart withdrew his opposition.\n\nBishop Hobart supported the [[High church|High Church Movement]] within the Episcopal Church. A predecessor of the [[Anglo-Catholic|Anglo-Catholic Movement]] deriving from the [[Oxford Movement]] in the 1830s and 40s, the High Church movement, like the Anglo-Catholic, stressed continuity with the pre-[[Protestant Reformation]] church, while at the same time strongly opposed certain Roman Catholic doctrines.  The movement emphasized the Apostolic Succession and Anglican Covenantal Theology. In contrast to the later Anglo-Catholic movement, Hobart's High Churchmanship did not have a significant liturgical character.  Hobart emphasized the significance of [[baptism]] and apostolic succession, and how the apostolic succession affected Episcopal ecumenical relationships and ministry with \"non-apostolic\" churches. The seminary became a center for the High Church Movement and later for the Oxford Movement in America. Through General Seminary, Hobart in particular influenced two future bishops: [[Benjamin Onderdonk]] and [[Jackson Kemper]].\n\nHobart also opposed the [[American Bible Society]], perhaps part of his strong opposition to dissenting churches. In 1816 he published a pamphlet to dissuade Episcopalians from joining the new movement, which he thought the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Protestant Episcopal Church]] had not the numerical or the financial strength to control. Instead, in 1818, to counterbalance the [[Bible Society]]'s influence and especially of Scott's ''Commentaries'', Hobart began to edit the ''Family Bible'' of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]. He also delivered episcopal charges to the clergy of [[Connecticut]] and New York entitled ''The Churchman'' (1819) and ''The High Churchman Vindicated'' (1826), in which Hobart accepted the label high churchman, explaining his principles to distinguish them from the corruptions of the [[Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] and from the Errors of Certain Protestant Sects.\n\nBy 1818, Hobart had also become convinced that an institution of higher education was needed in the western reaches of the state of New York. Though he had visited many areas as a bishop, he selected the small village of Geneva on Seneca Lake for his new outpost of learning. The site for the new [[Geneva College]] was selected in 1820, and the first building erected in 1822.  Geneva College became Hobart Free College, later renamed Hobart College in 1852 in honor of its founder, and which became [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].\n\nIn failing health, Hobart visited [[Europe]] from 1823-1825. Upon his return, he preached a sermon entitled ''The United States of America compared with some European Countries, particularly England'' (published 1826). Hobart so criticized the establishment, state patronage, cabinet appointment of bishops, low discipline, and the low requirements of theological education, as to rouse much hostility in England, where he had been highly praised for two volumes of ''Sermons on the Principal Events and Truths of Redemption'' (1824).\n\n==Death and legacy==\nBishop Hobart died at [[Auburn, New York]], on September 12, 1830, and is buried at [[Trinity Church Cemetery|Trinity Churchyard]] near his beloved General Theological Seminary in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/73730275 |title=John Henry Hobart (1775 - 1830) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}</ref> The Episcopal Church remembers Bishop Hobart annually on the anniversary of his death, September 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.io.com/~kellywp/LesserFF/Sep/Hobart.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903094817/http://www.io.com/~kellywp/LesserFF/Sep/Hobart.html |archivedate=2006-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Oneida, Wisconsin)|Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Oneida, Wisconsin]] was dedicated in his memory, and nearby [[Hobart, Wisconsin|Hobart]], in [[Brown County, Wisconsin]], was named for him in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.witowns.com/OurWisconsinTowns.htm |title=Our Wisconsin Towns |publisher=Witowns.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Consecrators===\n* [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]], [[List of Presiding Bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|first and fourth]] [[Presiding Bishop]], [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|first]] [[Bishop]] of [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Samuel Provoost]], [[List of Presiding Bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|third]] [[Presiding Bishop]], [[Episcopal Diocese of New York|first]] [[Bishop]] of [[Episcopal Diocese of New York|New York]]\n* [[Abraham Jarvis]], [[Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut|second]] [[Bishop]] of [[Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut|Connecticut]]\n\n===Publications===\n* ''A Clergyman's Companion'' (1805)\n* ''A Companion for the Altar'' (1804)\n* ''A Companion to the Book of Common Prayer'' (1805)\n* ''Festivals and Fasts'' (1804)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* ''The Catholic Movement in the American Episcopal Church'' (2nd Ed.) by George E.

Though he had visited many areas as a bishop, he selected the small village of Geneva on Seneca Lake for his new outpost of learning. The site for the new [[Geneva College]] was selected in 1820, and the first building erected in 1822.  Geneva College became Hobart Free College, later renamed Hobart College in 1852 in honor of its founder, and which became [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].\n\nIn failing health, Hobart visited [[Europe]] from 1823-1825. Upon his return, he preached a sermon entitled ''The United States of America compared with some European Countries, particularly England'' (published 1826). Hobart so criticized the establishment, state patronage, cabinet appointment of bishops, low discipline, and the low requirements of theological education, as to rouse much hostility in England, where he had been highly praised for two volumes of ''Sermons on the Principal Events and Truths of Redemption'' (1824).\n\n==Death and legacy==\nBishop Hobart died at [[Auburn, New York]], on September 12, 1830, and is buried at [[Trinity Church Cemetery|Trinity Churchyard]] near his beloved General Theological Seminary in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/73730275 |title=John Henry Hobart (1775 - 1830) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}</ref> The Episcopal Church remembers Bishop Hobart annually on the anniversary of his death, September 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.io.com/~kellywp/LesserFF/Sep/Hobart.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903094817/http://www.io.com/~kellywp/LesserFF/Sep/Hobart.html |archivedate=2006-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Oneida, Wisconsin)|Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Oneida, Wisconsin]] was dedicated in his memory, and nearby [[Hobart, Wisconsin|Hobart]], in [[Brown County, Wisconsin]], was named for him in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.witowns.com/OurWisconsinTowns.htm |title=Our Wisconsin Towns |publisher=Witowns.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Consecrators===\n* [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]], [[List of Presiding Bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|first and fourth]] [[Presiding Bishop]], [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|first]] [[Bishop]] of [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Samuel Provoost]], [[List of Presiding Bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|third]] [[Presiding Bishop]], [[Episcopal Diocese of New York|first]] [[Bishop]] of [[Episcopal Diocese of New York|New York]]\n* [[Abraham Jarvis]], [[Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut|second]] [[Bishop]] of [[Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut|Connecticut]]\n\n===Publications===\n* ''A Clergyman's Companion'' (1805)\n* ''A Companion for the Altar'' (1804)\n* ''A Companion to the Book of Common Prayer'' (1805)\n* ''Festivals and Fasts'' (1804)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* ''The Catholic Movement in the American Episcopal Church'' (2nd Ed.) by George E.
