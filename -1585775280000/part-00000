The Ottomans first entered Albania in 1385 at the invitation of the Allbanian Noble [[Karl Thopia]] to suppress the forces of the other Albanian noble Balsha II at the [[Battle of Savra]]. The [[Sanjak of Albania]] was established in 1420 controlling mostly Central Albania, while Ottoman rule became more consolidated in 1479, after the fall of [[Shkodra]]. The Albanians revolted again  in 1481 but the Ottomans finally controlled Albania by 1488. The Ottomans had previously ruled some Albanian regions after the [[Battle of Savra]] in 1385. The Ottomans placed garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1418 and established formal jurisdiction in central Albania by 1431. Even though The Ottomans claimed rule of all Albanian lands, most Albanian ethnic territories were still governed by [[Albanian Princes]] who were free of Ottoman rule. In 1431 Many Albanian Princes including [[Gjergj Arianiti]], [[Zenevisi family]] and [[Gjon Kastrioti]] started a war against the Ottoman Empire which resulted in defeat of Gjon Kastrioti but victory in 5 battles for Gjergj Arianiti ( Gjergj Atianiti being the first European prince to defeat Ottomans in 5 battles). These Albanian victories opened the way for the coming of Skanderbeg in 1443 in Kruja. Independence for most of the Albanian regions was maintained during 1443\u20131479, with the uprising under the lead of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html</ref> The Albanian resistance and war against Ottomans continued for 37 years. The last towns captured by the Ottomans were [[Shkod\u00ebr]] in 1479 and [[Durr\u00ebs]] in 1501. A period of the semi independence  started in the 1750s with the Independent Albanian Pashas . In 1754 the autonomous Albanian Pashalik of [[Bushati dynasty]] would be established with center the city of Shkodra called [[Pashalik of Shkodra]]. Later on the same autonomous Pashalik of Berat would be established and culminating with the Albanian Pashalik of [[Ali Pashe Tepelena]] in 1787. Albanian Pashaliks would end in 1831 with the last one being the Bushati Pashalik. These half independent Albanian Pashaliks would extend from Bosnia up to Southern Greece.\n\nAlbanians would enter later on in the 16th and 17th centuries a period of Islamization.   The territory which today belongs to the [[Republic of Albania]] remained part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until it declared independence in 1912, during the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{See also|Islamization of Albania}}\n[[File:Sanjak of Albania Map 1431.svg|left|190px|thumb|[[Sanjak of Albania]] in 1431.]]\n[[File:Elifbaja shqip.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Elifba alphabet|Elifbaja shqip]] - Albanian Arabic script alphabet]]\nThe [[Ottomans]] expanded their control from [[Anatolia]] to the [[Balkans]] in the middle of the 14th century. They entered European territory in 1352, and they defeated a Serbian army in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389. Ottoman pressure lessened in 1402 when the Mongol leader, [[Tamerlane]], attacked Anatolia from the east, killed the Sultan, and sparked a civil war.<ref>Dimitris J.

In 1385, the Albanian ruler of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Karl Thopia]], appealed to the sultan for support against his rivals, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]]. An Ottoman force quickly marched into Albania along the [[Via Egnatia]] and routed [[Balsha II]] in the [[Battle of Savra]]. Some of the Albanian Principalities soon started to become vassals of the Ottoman Empire after 1420. [[Gjirokastra]] became the [[county town]] of the [[Sanjak of Albania]] in 1420.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000929/092980eo.pdf |title=Ethnographic and open-air museums |last1= Riza |first1= Emin |last2= |first2= |year=1992 |work= |publisher= UNESCO, Paris |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref>  and than Kruja was established as the center of Sanjak of Albania after Gjergj Arianiti defeated the Ottomans between 1431\u20131435. The Ottomans allowed  Albanian clan chiefs to maintain their positions, rule and property, but they had to pay tribute, and sometimes send their sons to the Ottoman court as hostages, and provide the Ottoman army with auxiliary troops.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" /> However many Albanian clans and Principalities did not recognize the Ottoman authority and did not pay tribute.\n\nThe Albanians' resistance to the Ottomans in the 14th century and especially in the 15th century won them acclaim all over Europe. [[Gjon Kastrioti]] of [[Kruj\u00eb]] was one of the Albanian clan leaders who submitted to Ottoman suzerainty in 1425. He was compelled to send his four sons to the Ottoman capital to be trained for military service. The youngest, [[George Kastrioti]] (1403\u201368), who would become the Albanians' national hero, captured the sultan's attention. Renamed Iskander when he converted to Islam, the young man participated in military expeditions to Asia Minor and Europe. When appointed to administer a Balkan district, Iskander became known as [[Skanderbeg]]. After Ottoman forces under Skanderbeg's command suffered defeat in a battle near [[Ni\u0161]] in present-day [[Serbia]] in 1443, Skanderbeg rushed to Kruj\u00eb and tricked a Turkish pasha into surrendering the Albanian fortress. Skanderbeg then embraced Roman Catholicism and declared a holy war against the Turks.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" />\n\n[[File:Mehmedpasha.jpg|thumb|right|222px|[[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]] was the most powerful Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]] of Albanian origins.]]\n\nOn 1 March 1444, Albanian chieftains gathered in the cathedral of [[Lezh\u00eb]] with the prince of Montenegro and delegates from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and proclaimed Skanderbeg commander of the Albanian resistance. All of Albania accepted his leadership against the Ottomans, but local leaders kept control of their own districts. Under a red flag bearing Skanderbeg's heraldic emblem, an Albanian force of about 10,000-15.000 men held off Ottoman campaigns against their lands for twenty-four years. Three times the Albanians overcame sieges of Kruj\u00eb. In 1450, the Albanians routed Sultan Murad II himself. Later, they repulsed attacks led by Sultan Mehmed II in 1466 and 1467. In 1461, Skanderbeg went to the aid of his suzerain, King [[Alfonso I of Naples]], against the [[kings of Sicily]]. The government under Skanderbeg was unstable, however, and at times local Albanian rulers cooperated with the Ottomans against him.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" />\n\nWith political and minor material support from the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], resistance to the Ottoman Empire continued for 35 years. Kruj\u00eb fell to the Ottomans only in 1478, ten years after the death of Skanderbeg; [[Shkod\u00ebr]] succumbed in 1479 after a failed siege in 1474 and [[Siege of Shkodra|a stronger siege]] in 1478 that ended with Venice ceding Shkodra to the Ottomans. The Venetians then evacuated Durr\u00ebs, in 1501. The conquests triggered a great Albanian exodus to Venice and Italy, especially to the kingdom of Naples, as well as to [[Sicily]], Romania and [[Egypt]]. Most of the Albanian refugees belonged to the Orthodox Church. The Albanians of Italy significantly influenced the Albanian national movement in future centuries, and Albanian [[Franciscan priests]], most of whom were descended from \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Italy, played a significant role in the preservation of Catholicism in Albania's northern regions.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" />\n\nSkanderbeg's long struggle to keep Albania free became highly significant to the Albanian people, as it strengthened their solidarity, made them more conscious of their national identity, and served later as a great source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity, freedom, and independence.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium</ref> The memory of the mid-15th century resistance under Skanderbeg continues to be important to Albanians,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and his family's banner, bearing a black two-headed eagle on a red field, became the [[Flag of Albania|flag]] under which the Albanian national movement rallied centuries later.\n\nAfter the death of Skenderbeg and the fall of Kruj\u00eb, the Ottoman Empire gained control of the ethnic Albanian territories and made many changes.\n\nThe Albanian population gradually began to convert to Islam through the teachings of [[Bektashism]], which offered considerable material advantages in Ottoman trade networks, bureaucracy and army. Many Albanians were recruited into the [[Janissary]] and [[Dev\u015firme]] and later on through becoming Muslims they opened their path for very successful military and political carriers. For example, 42 [[Grand Viziers]] were of Albanian origin. The most prominent Albanians during Ottoman rule were: [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], [[Ballaban Badera]], [[Koca Davud Pasha]], [[Hamza Kastrioti]], [[Iljaz Hoxha]], [[Mimar Sinan]], [[Nezim Frakulla]], [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]], [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena|Ali Pasha]], [[Edhem Pasha]], [[Omer Vrioni]], [[Patrona Halil]], [[Haxhi Shehreti]], [[Ali Pasha of Gucia]], [[Ibrahim Pasha of Berat]], [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]], [[Kara Murad Pasha]], [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]], [[Mustafa Bushati]], [[Ibrahim Bushati]], [[Sedefkar Mehmed Agha]].\n\nAlbanians also played a crucial role during the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1499\u20131503)]], [[Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars]] and [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]] before gaining Independence.\n\n===18th century===\n\n[[File:Tomb of Ali Pasa Ioannina.jpg|thumb|The [[Fethiye Mosque (Ioannina)|Fethiye mosque]] just adjacent to [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]]'s grave.]]\n[[File:Dupr\u00e9 - Ali Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ali Pasha of Tepelen\u00eb]] is one of the most famous Albanians in Ottoman history.]]\n\nThe weakening of Ottoman central authority and the [[timar]] system brought anarchy to the Albanian-populated lands. In the late 18th century, two Albanian centers of power emerged: [[Shkod\u00ebr]], under the Bushati family; and [[Ioannina]], under [[Ali Pasha of Tepelen\u00eb]]. When it suited their goals, both places cooperated with the [[Sublime Porte]], and when it was expedient to defy the central government, each acted independently.<ref name=\"Ottoman Albanians\">{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

[[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] attempted to establish an autonomous principality and expand the lands under his control by playing off Austria and Russia against the Sublime Porte. In 1785, Kara Mahmud's forces attacked [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] territory, and Austria offered to recognize him as the ruler of all Albania if he would ally himself with [[Vienna]] against the Sublime Porte. Seizing an opportunity, Kara Mahmud sent the sultan the heads of an Austrian delegation in 1788, and the Ottomans appointed him governor of Shkod\u00ebr. When he attempted to wrest land from Montenegro in 1796, however, he was defeated and beheaded. Kara Mahmud's brother, [[Ibrahim Bushati]], cooperated with the Sublime Porte until his death in 1810, but his successor, [[Mustafa Pasha Bushati]], proved to be recalcitrant despite participation in Ottoman military campaigns against [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolutionaries]] and rebel pashas. He cooperated with the mountain tribes and brought a large area under his control.<ref name = \"Ottoman Albanians\" />\n\n[[File:Flag_of_Mahmut_pasha_Bushatli_-_1796.png|thumb|250px|Flag of the Bushatli dynasty (1796).]]\n\nSouth of the Shkumbini River, the mostly peasant Tosks lived in compact villages under elected rulers. Some Tosks living in settlements high in the mountains maintained their independence and often escaped payment of taxes. The Tosks of the lowlands, however, were easy for the Ottoman authorities to control. The Albanian tribal system disappeared there, and the Ottomans imposed a system of military fiefs under which the sultan granted soldiers and cavalrymen temporary landholdings, or timars, in exchange for military service. By the 18th century, many military fiefs had effectively become the hereditary landholdings of economically and politically powerful families who squeezed wealth from their hard-strapped Christian and Muslim tenant farmers. The beys, like the clan chiefs of the northern mountains, became virtually independent rulers in their own provinces, had their own military contingents, and often waged war against each other to increase their landholdings and power. The [[Sublime Porte]] attempted to press a divide-and-rule policy to keep the local beys from uniting and posing a threat to Ottoman rule itself, but with little success.<ref name = \"Ottoman Rule\" />\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Turkish guns 1750-1800.jpg|thumb|left|[[Janissary]] guns from the year 1826, during the [[Auspicious Incident]].]]\nOttoman-Albanian relations worsened in the year 1826 during the reign of [[Mahmud II]], he had instigated the notorious [[Auspicious Incident]] and the turmoil that followed caused the violent dissolution of the [[Janissary]], [[Dev\u015firme]] and the entire Balkan Muslim leadership in [[Rumelia]] causing a new wave of revolts and instability in the gradually weakening [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nAfter crushing the Bushatis and Ali Pasha, the [[Sublime Porte]] introduced a series of reforms, known as the [[tanzimat]], which were aimed at strengthening the empire by reining in fractious pashas. The ''timars'' officially became large individual landholdings, especially in the lowlands. In 1835, the Sublime Porte divided the Albanian-populated lands into the ''[[vilayet]]s'' of Janina and [[Rumelia]] and dispatched officials from Constantinople to administer them. This provoked a [[Albanian Revolt of 1843\u20131844|series of revolts]] in 1843\u20131844, but they were suppressed by the Ottoman army.\n\nAfter 1865, the central authorities redivided the Albanian lands between the ''vilayets'' of [[Scutari Vilayet|Scutari]], [[Janina Vilayet|Janina]], and [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]]. The reforms angered the highland Albanian chieftains, who found their privileges reduced with no apparent compensation, and the authorities eventually abandoned efforts to control them. Ottoman troops crushed local rebellions in the lowlands, however, and conditions there remained bleak. The religious division of the northern Albanian tribes brought them into opposition.

In July 1908, a month after a Young Turk rebellion in Macedonia supported by an Albanian uprising in [[Kosovo]] and [[Vardar Macedonia]] escalated into widespread insurrection and mutiny within the imperial army, Sultan Abd\u00fcl Hamid II agreed to demands by the Young Turks to restore constitutional rule. Many Albanians participated in the Young Turks uprising, hoping that it would gain their people autonomy within the empire. The Young Turks lifted the Ottoman ban on Albanian-language schools and on writing the Albanian language. As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting in [[Manastir]] (present day town of [[Bitola]]) in 1908 chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. The Young Turks, however, were set on maintaining the empire and not interested in making concessions to the myriad nationalist groups within its borders. After securing the abdication of Abd\u00fcl Hamid II in April 1909, the new authorities levied taxes, outlawed guerrilla groups and nationalist societies, and attempted to extend Constantinople's control over the northern Albanian mountain men. In addition, the Young Turks legalized the [[bastinado]], or beating with a stick, even for misdemeanors, banned carrying rifles, and denied the existence of an Albanian nationality. The new government also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians' unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet.\n\nThe Albanians refused to submit to the Young Turks' campaign to \"Ottomanize\" them by force. [[Albanian Revolt of 1910|New Albanian uprisings]] began in Kosovo and the northern mountains in early April 1910. Ottoman forces quashed these rebellions after three months, outlawed Albanian organizations, disarmed entire regions, and closed down schools and publications. Montenegro, preparing to grab Albanian-populated lands for itself, supported a 1911 uprising by the mountain tribes against the Young Turks regime that grew into a widespread revolt. Unable to control the Albanians by force, the Ottoman government granted concessions on schools, military recruitment, and taxation and sanctioned the use of the Latin script for the Albanian language. The government refused, however, to unite the four Albanian-inhabited vilayets into one, [[Albanian vilayet]].\n\n==Governing structure==\nAdministratively, the Ottomans divided the Albanian-inhabited lands among a number of districts, or ''[[vilayet]]s''. The Ottoman authorities did not initially stress conversion to Islam.<ref name=\"Ottoman Rule\">{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

Prominent ''viziers'' and ''pashas'' hailed from Albania, and were appointed to their posts long before the majority of Albanians professed Islam.\n\n===Administrative===\n[[File:Amadeo Preziosi Albanians Mercenaries in the Ottoman Army.jpg|thumb|190px|Albanian mercenaries in the Ottoman Army in the year 1857.]]\n\n: ''For details of'' : [[State organisation of the Ottoman Empire|State Organization]]\nThe Ottoman sultan considered himself God's agent on Earth, the leader of a religious\u2014not a national\u2014state whose purpose was to defend and propagate Islam. Non-Muslims paid extra taxes and held an inferior status, but they could retain their old religion and a large measure of local autonomy. By converting to Islam, individuals among the conquered could elevate themselves to the privileged stratum of society. In the early years of the empire, all Ottoman high officials were the sultan's bondsmen the children of Christian subjects chosen in childhood for their promise, converted to Islam, and educated to serve. Some were selected from prisoners of war, others sent as gifts, and still others obtained through devshirme, the tribute of children levied in the Ottoman Empire's Balkan lands. Many of the best fighters in the sultan's elite guard, the [[Janissary|janissaries]], were conscripted as young boys from Christian Albanian families, and high-ranking Ottoman officials often had Albanian bodyguards.<ref name = \"Ottoman Rule\" />\n\n===Taxation===\nAccording to historian Zija Shkodra, Albania was developed as much as the rest of the Balkans {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. In the mountains north of the Shkumbini River, Geg herders maintained their self-governing society base on clans. An association of clans was called a [[bajrak]].\n\nTaxes on the northern tribes were difficult if not impossible for the Ottomans to collect because of the rough terrain and fierceness of the Albanian highlanders. Some mountain tribes succeeded in defending their independence through the centuries of Ottoman rule, engaging in intermittent guerrilla warfare with the Ottomans, who never deemed it worthwhile to subjugate them.\n\nUntil recent times, Geg clan chiefs, or bajraktars, exercised patriarchal powers, arranged marriages, mediated quarrels, and meted out punishments. The tribesmen of the northern Albanian mountains recognized no law but the Code of [[Lek\u00eb Dukagjini]] ([[Kanuni i Lek\u00eb Dukagjinit]]), a collection of tribal laws transcribed in the 14th century by a Roman Catholic priest. The code regulates a variety of subjects, including blood vengeance. Even today, many Albanian highlanders regard the canon as the supreme law of the land.<ref name = \"Ottoman Rule\" />\n\n===Religion===\n{{Details|Millet (Ottoman Empire)}}\n[[File:Arnavut Abdurrahman Abdi Pascha.jpg|thumb|The Albanian, [[Abdurrahman Abdi Arnavut]] was one of the most important Ottoman commanders during the [[Great Turkish War|War of the Holy League]].]]\n\nFive centuries of Ottoman rule grouped the Albanian people along religious, regional, and tribal lines. In the early 17th century, however, Albanians converted to Islam in large numbers. Within a century, the Muslim Albanian community was the largest religious community in the country. Albanians in this time were divided into two distinct tribal and dialectal groupings: the [[Geg]]s and [[Tosk]]s (see [[Albanian language]]). In the rugged northern mountains, Geg shepherds lived in a tribal society often completely independent of Ottoman rule. In the south, peasant Muslim and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Tosks worked the land for Muslim [[bey]]s, provincial rulers who frequently revolted against the sultan's authority.\n\nIn the early 17th century, many Albanian converts to Islam migrated elsewhere within the Ottoman Empire and found careers in the Ottoman military and government. Some attained powerful positions in the Ottoman administration. About thirty Albanians rose to the position of grand [[vizier]], chief deputy to the sultan himself. In the second half of the 17th century, the Albanian [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family|K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc]] family provided four grand viziers, who fought against corruption, temporarily shored up eroding central government control over rapacious local beys, and won several military victories.\n\nAs early as the 18th century, a mystic Islamic sect, the [[Bektashi]] [[dervishes]], spread into the empire's Albanian-populated lands. Probably founded in the late 13th century in [[Anatolia]], Bektashism became the janissaries' official faith in the late 16th century. The Bektashi sect contains features quite distinct from normative Islam and emphasizes man as a reflection of the Divine. Women, unveiled, participate in Bektashi ceremonies on an equal basis, and the celebrants use wine despite the ban on alcohol in most Islamic interpretations of the [[Sharia]]. The Bektashis became the largest religious group in southern Albania after the sultan disbanded the janissaries in 1826. Bektashi leaders played key roles in the Albanian nationalist movement of the late 19th century and were to a great degree responsible for the Albanians' traditional tolerance of religious differences.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Ottoman sultans tried in vain to shore up their collapsing empire by introducing a series of reforms aimed at reining in recalcitrant local officials and dousing the fires of nationalism among its myriad peoples. The power of nationalism, however, proved too strong to counteract.\n\n==Albanian nationalism==\n{{Main|Albanian National Awakening}}\n{{expand section|date=September 2015}}\nAs a result of contacts maintained between the Tosks and their relatives living or returning from abroad, foreign ideas began to seep into Albania.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Literature==\n*{{cite book|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press (The Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group Incorporated)|year=2010|isbn=0-8108-6188-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC|ref=harv}}\n\n{{History of Ottoman}}\n{{Albania topics}}\n\n{{commons category|Ottoman Albania}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Ottoman Albania}}\n[[Category:Ottoman Albania| ]]\n[[Category:Islam in Albania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n{{History_of_Albania}}\n[[Albania]] was ruled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in different periods from 1479 to 1912. The Ottomans first entered Albania in 1385 at the invitation of the Allbanian Noble [[Karl Thopia]] to suppress the forces of the other Albanian noble Balsha II at the [[Battle of Savra]]. The [[Sanjak of Albania]] was established in 1420 controlling mostly Central Albania, while Ottoman rule became more consolidated in 1479, after the fall of [[Shkodra]]. The Albanians revolted again  in 1481 but the Ottomans finally controlled Albania by 1488. The Ottomans had previously ruled some Albanian regions after the [[Battle of Savra]] in 1385. The Ottomans placed garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1418 and established formal jurisdiction in central Albania by 1431. Even though The Ottomans claimed rule of all Albanian lands, most Albanian ethnic territories were still governed by [[Albanian Princes]] who were free of Ottoman rule. In 1431 Many Albanian Princes including [[Gjergj Arianiti]], [[Zenevisi family]] and [[Gjon Kastrioti]] started a war against the Ottoman Empire which resulted in defeat of Gjon Kastrioti but victory in 5 battles for Gjergj Arianiti ( Gjergj Atianiti being the first European prince to defeat Ottomans in 5 battles). These Albanian victories opened the way for the coming of Skanderbeg in 1443 in Kruja. Independence for most of the Albanian regions was maintained during 1443-1479, with the uprising under the lead of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html</ref> The Albanian resistance and war against Ottomans continued for 37 years. The last towns captured by the Ottomans were [[Shkod\u00ebr]] in 1479 and [[Durr\u00ebs]] in 1501. A period of the semi independence  started in the 1750s with the Independent Albanian Pashas . In 1754 the autonomous Albanian Pashalik of [[Bushati dynasty]] would be established with center the city of Shkodra called [[Pashalik of Shkodra]]. Later on the same autonomous Pashalik of Berat would be established and culminating with the Albanian Pashalik of [[Ali Pashe Tepelena]] in 1787. Albanian Pashaliks would end in 1831 with the last one being the Bushati Pashalik. These half independent Albanian Pashaliks would extend from Bosnia up to Southern Greece.\n\nAlbanians would enter later on in the 16th and 17th centuries a period of Islamization.   The territory which today belongs to the [[Republic of Albania]] remained part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until it declared independence in 1912, during the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{See also|Islamization of Albania}}\n[[File:Sanjak of Albania Map 1431.svg|left|190px|thumb|[[Sanjak of Albania]] in 1431.]]\n[[File:Elifbaja shqip.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Elifba alphabet|Elifbaja shqip]] - Albanian Arabic script alphabet]]\nThe [[Ottomans]] expanded their control from [[Anatolia]] to the [[Balkans]] in the middle of the 14th century. They entered European territory in 1352, and they defeated a Serbian army in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389. Ottoman pressure lessened in 1402 when the Mongol leader, [[Tamerlane]], attacked Anatolia from the east, killed the Sultan, and sparked a civil war.<ref>Dimitris J.

In 1385, the Albanian ruler of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Karl Thopia]], appealed to the sultan for support against his rivals, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]]. An Ottoman force quickly marched into Albania along the [[Via Egnatia]] and routed [[Balsha II]] in the [[Battle of Savra]]. Some of the Albanian Principalities soon started to become vassals of the Ottoman Empire after 1420. [[Gjirokastra]] became the [[county town]] of the [[Sanjak of Albania]] in 1420.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000929/092980eo.pdf |title=Ethnographic and open-air museums |last1= Riza |first1= Emin |last2= |first2= |year=1992 |work= |publisher= UNESCO, Paris |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref>  and than Kruja was established as the center of Sanjak of Albania after Gjergj Arianiti defeated the Ottomans between 1431-1435. The Ottomans allowed  Albanian clan chiefs to maintain their positions, rule and property, but they had to pay tribute, and sometimes send their sons to the Ottoman court as hostages, and provide the Ottoman army with auxiliary troops.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" /> However many Albanian clans and Principalities did not recognize the Ottoman authority and did not pay tribute.\n\nThe Albanians' resistance to the Ottomans in the 14th century and especially in the 15th century won them acclaim all over Europe. [[Gjon Kastrioti]] of [[Kruj\u00eb]] was one of the Albanian clan leaders who submitted to Ottoman suzerainty in 1425. He was compelled to send his four sons to the Ottoman capital to be trained for military service. The youngest, [[George Kastrioti]] (1403\u201368), who would become the Albanians' national hero, captured the sultan's attention. Renamed Iskander when he converted to Islam, the young man participated in military expeditions to Asia Minor and Europe. When appointed to administer a Balkan district, Iskander became known as [[Skanderbeg]]. After Ottoman forces under Skanderbeg's command suffered defeat in a battle near [[Ni\u0161]] in present-day [[Serbia]] in 1443, Skanderbeg rushed to Kruj\u00eb and tricked a Turkish pasha into surrendering the Albanian fortress. Skanderbeg then embraced Roman Catholicism and declared a holy war against the Turks.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" />\n\n[[File:Mehmedpasha.jpg|thumb|right|222px|[[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]] was the most powerful Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]] of Albanian origins.]]\n\nOn 1 March 1444, Albanian chieftains gathered in the cathedral of [[Lezh\u00eb]] with the prince of Montenegro and delegates from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and proclaimed Skanderbeg commander of the Albanian resistance. All of Albania accepted his leadership against the Ottomans, but local leaders kept control of their own districts. Under a red flag bearing Skanderbeg's heraldic emblem, an Albanian force of about 10,000-15.000 men held off Ottoman campaigns against their lands for twenty-four years. Three times the Albanians overcame sieges of Kruj\u00eb. In 1450, the Albanians routed Sultan Murad II himself. Later, they repulsed attacks led by Sultan Mehmed II in 1466 and 1467. In 1461, Skanderbeg went to the aid of his suzerain, King [[Alfonso I of Naples]], against the [[kings of Sicily]]. The government under Skanderbeg was unstable, however, and at times local Albanian rulers cooperated with the Ottomans against him.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" />\n\nWith political and minor material support from the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], resistance to the Ottoman Empire continued for 35 years. Kruj\u00eb fell to the Ottomans only in 1478, ten years after the death of Skanderbeg; [[Shkod\u00ebr]] succumbed in 1479 after a failed siege in 1474 and [[Siege of Shkodra|a stronger siege]] in 1478 that ended with Venice ceding Shkodra to the Ottomans. The Venetians then evacuated Durr\u00ebs, in 1501. The conquests triggered a great Albanian exodus to Venice and Italy, especially to the kingdom of Naples, as well as to [[Sicily]], Romania and [[Egypt]]. Most of the Albanian refugees belonged to the Orthodox Church. The Albanians of Italy significantly influenced the Albanian national movement in future centuries, and Albanian [[Franciscan priests]], most of whom were descended from \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Italy, played a significant role in the preservation of Catholicism in Albania's northern regions.<ref name = \"Ottoman Conquest\" />\n\nSkanderbeg's long struggle to keep Albania free became highly significant to the Albanian people, as it strengthened their solidarity, made them more conscious of their national identity, and served later as a great source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity, freedom, and independence.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium</ref> The memory of the mid-15th century resistance under Skanderbeg continues to be important to Albanians,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and his family's banner, bearing a black two-headed eagle on a red field, became the [[Flag of Albania|flag]] under which the Albanian national movement rallied centuries later.\n\nAfter the death of Skenderbeg and the fall of Kruj\u00eb, the Ottoman Empire gained control of the ethnic Albanian territories and made many changes.\n\nThe Albanian population gradually began to convert to Islam through the teachings of [[Bektashism]], which offered considerable material advantages in Ottoman trade networks, bureaucracy and army. Many Albanians were recruited into the [[Janissary]] and [[Dev\u015firme]] and later on through becoming Muslims they opened their path for very successful military and political carriers. For example, 42 [[Grand Viziers]] were of Albanian origin. The most prominent Albanians during Ottoman rule were: [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], [[Ballaban Badera]], [[Koca Davud Pasha]], [[Hamza Kastrioti]], [[Iljaz Hoxha]], [[Mimar Sinan]], [[Nezim Frakulla]], [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]], [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena|Ali Pasha]], [[Edhem Pasha]], [[Omer Vrioni]], [[Patrona Halil]], [[Haxhi Shehreti]], [[Ali Pasha of Gucia]], [[Ibrahim Pasha of Berat]], [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]], [[Kara Murad Pasha]], [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]], [[Mustafa Bushati]], [[Ibrahim Bushati]], [[Sedefkar Mehmed Agha]].\n\nAlbanians also played a crucial role during the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1499\u20131503)]], [[Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars]] and [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]] before gaining Independence.\n\n===18th century===\n\n[[File:Tomb of Ali Pasa Ioannina.jpg|thumb|The [[Fethiye Mosque (Ioannina)|Fethiye mosque]] just adjacent to [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]]'s grave.]]\n[[File:Dupr\u00e9 - Ali Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ali Pasha of Tepelen\u00eb]] is one of the most famous Albanians in Ottoman history.]]\n\nThe weakening of Ottoman central authority and the [[timar]] system brought anarchy to the Albanian-populated lands. In the late 18th century, two Albanian centers of power emerged: [[Shkod\u00ebr]], under the Bushati family; and [[Ioannina]], under [[Ali Pasha of Tepelen\u00eb]]. When it suited their goals, both places cooperated with the [[Sublime Porte]], and when it was expedient to defy the central government, each acted independently.<ref name=\"Ottoman Albanians\">{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

[[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] attempted to establish an autonomous principality and expand the lands under his control by playing off Austria and Russia against the Sublime Porte. In 1785, Kara Mahmud's forces attacked [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] territory, and Austria offered to recognize him as the ruler of all Albania if he would ally himself with [[Vienna]] against the Sublime Porte. Seizing an opportunity, Kara Mahmud sent the sultan the heads of an Austrian delegation in 1788, and the Ottomans appointed him governor of Shkod\u00ebr. When he attempted to wrest land from Montenegro in 1796, however, he was defeated and beheaded. Kara Mahmud's brother, [[Ibrahim Bushati]], cooperated with the Sublime Porte until his death in 1810, but his successor, [[Mustafa Pasha Bushati]], proved to be recalcitrant despite participation in Ottoman military campaigns against [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolutionaries]] and rebel pashas. He cooperated with the mountain tribes and brought a large area under his control.<ref name = \"Ottoman Albanians\" />\n\n[[File:Flag_of_Mahmut_pasha_Bushatli_-_1796.png|thumb|250px|Flag of the Bushatli dynasty (1796).]]\n\nSouth of the Shkumbini River, the mostly peasant Tosks lived in compact villages under elected rulers. Some Tosks living in settlements high in the mountains maintained their independence and often escaped payment of taxes. The Tosks of the lowlands, however, were easy for the Ottoman authorities to control. The Albanian tribal system disappeared there, and the Ottomans imposed a system of military fiefs under which the sultan granted soldiers and cavalrymen temporary landholdings, or timars, in exchange for military service. By the 18th century, many military fiefs had effectively become the hereditary landholdings of economically and politically powerful families who squeezed wealth from their hard-strapped Christian and Muslim tenant farmers. The beys, like the clan chiefs of the northern mountains, became virtually independent rulers in their own provinces, had their own military contingents, and often waged war against each other to increase their landholdings and power. The [[Sublime Porte]] attempted to press a divide-and-rule policy to keep the local beys from uniting and posing a threat to Ottoman rule itself, but with little success.<ref name = \"Ottoman Rule\" />\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Turkish guns 1750-1800.jpg|thumb|left|[[Janissary]] guns from the year 1826, during the [[Auspicious Incident]].]]\nOttoman-Albanian relations worsened in the year 1826 during the reign of [[Mahmud II]], he had instigated the notorious [[Auspicious Incident]] and the turmoil that followed caused the violent dissolution of the [[Janissary]], [[Dev\u015firme]] and the entire Balkan Muslim leadership in [[Rumelia]] causing a new wave of revolts and instability in the gradually weakening [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nAfter crushing the Bushatis and Ali Pasha, the [[Sublime Porte]] introduced a series of reforms, known as the [[tanzimat]], which were aimed at strengthening the empire by reining in fractious pashas. The ''timars'' officially became large individual landholdings, especially in the lowlands. In 1835, the Sublime Porte divided the Albanian-populated lands into the ''[[vilayet]]s'' of Janina and [[Rumelia]] and dispatched officials from Constantinople to administer them. This provoked a [[Albanian Revolt of 1843\u20131844|series of revolts]] in 1843\u20131844, but they were suppressed by the Ottoman army.\n\nAfter 1865, the central authorities redivided the Albanian lands between the ''vilayets'' of [[Scutari Vilayet|Scutari]], [[Janina Vilayet|Janina]], and [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]]. The reforms angered the highland Albanian chieftains, who found their privileges reduced with no apparent compensation, and the authorities eventually abandoned efforts to control them. Ottoman troops crushed local rebellions in the lowlands, however, and conditions there remained bleak. The religious division of the northern Albanian tribes brought them into opposition. The Muslim northern Albanian tribes participated in the Ottoman campaigns against Christian Albanian tribes, such as in 1876 when they devastated the territory populated by the Mirdit\u00eb Catholics.<ref name=\"Vickers1999\">{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=Miranda|title=The Albanians: A Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC&pg=PA29|year=1999|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-541-9|page=30}}</ref> Large numbers of Tosks emigrated to join sizable Albanian \u00e9migr\u00e9 communities in Romania, Egypt, [[Bulgaria]], Constantinople, southern Italy, and later the United States.<ref name = \"Ottoman Albanians\" />\n\n==Against the Young Turks==\n{{Further|Albanian National Awakening#1911 Highlanders Uprising}}\n[[Image:Albanian vilayet.jpg|thumb|The 4 Ottoman vilayets ([[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Scutari Vilayet|Scutari]], [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Janina Vilayet|Janina]]), proposed to form the Albanian Vilayet.]]\n[[File:Flag of Albanian Provisional Government (Jun-Nov 1912).svg|thumb|left|Flag used during the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and by early 20th century Albanian rebels<ref name=Elsie2010>{{harvnb|Elsie|2010|loc=\"Flag, Albanian\", p. 140: \"The eagle was a common heraldic symbol for many Albanian dynasties in the Late Middle Ages and came to be a symbol of the Albanians in general.

In July 1908, a month after a Young Turk rebellion in Macedonia supported by an Albanian uprising in [[Kosovo]] and [[Vardar Macedonia]] escalated into widespread insurrection and mutiny within the imperial army, Sultan Abd\u00fcl Hamid II agreed to demands by the Young Turks to restore constitutional rule. Many Albanians participated in the Young Turks uprising, hoping that it would gain their people autonomy within the empire. The Young Turks lifted the Ottoman ban on Albanian-language schools and on writing the Albanian language. As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting in [[Manastir]] (present day town of [[Bitola]]) in 1908 chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. The Young Turks, however, were set on maintaining the empire and not interested in making concessions to the myriad nationalist groups within its borders. After securing the abdication of Abd\u00fcl Hamid II in April 1909, the new authorities levied taxes, outlawed guerrilla groups and nationalist societies, and attempted to extend Constantinople's control over the northern Albanian mountain men. In addition, the Young Turks legalized the [[bastinado]], or beating with a stick, even for misdemeanors, banned carrying rifles, and denied the existence of an Albanian nationality. The new government also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians' unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet.\n\nThe Albanians refused to submit to the Young Turks' campaign to \"Ottomanize\" them by force. [[Albanian Revolt of 1910|New Albanian uprisings]] began in Kosovo and the northern mountains in early April 1910. Ottoman forces quashed these rebellions after three months, outlawed Albanian organizations, disarmed entire regions, and closed down schools and publications. Montenegro, preparing to grab Albanian-populated lands for itself, supported a 1911 uprising by the mountain tribes against the Young Turks regime that grew into a widespread revolt. Unable to control the Albanians by force, the Ottoman government granted concessions on schools, military recruitment, and taxation and sanctioned the use of the Latin script for the Albanian language. The government refused, however, to unite the four Albanian-inhabited vilayets into one, [[Albanian vilayet]].\n\n==Governing structure==\nAdministratively, the Ottomans divided the Albanian-inhabited lands among a number of districts, or ''[[vilayet]]s''.

Iwaskiw|year= 1994|title=Albania: A Country Study (\"Albanians under Ottoman Rule\")|url=http://countrystudies.us/albania/18.htm |accessdate=9 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nBy 1479, the entire country, except for [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Ulcinj]] and [[Bar (Montenegro)|Bar]], was under Ottoman suzerainty. Prominent ''viziers'' and ''pashas'' hailed from Albania, and were appointed to their posts long before the majority of Albanians professed Islam.\n\n===Administrative===\n[[File:Amadeo Preziosi Albanians Mercenaries in the Ottoman Army.jpg|thumb|190px|Albanian mercenaries in the Ottoman Army in the year 1857.]]\n\n: ''For details of'' : [[State organisation of the Ottoman Empire|State Organization]]\nThe Ottoman sultan considered himself God's agent on Earth, the leader of a religious\u2014not a national\u2014state whose purpose was to defend and propagate Islam. Non-Muslims paid extra taxes and held an inferior status, but they could retain their old religion and a large measure of local autonomy. By converting to Islam, individuals among the conquered could elevate themselves to the privileged stratum of society. In the early years of the empire, all Ottoman high officials were the sultan's bondsmen the children of Christian subjects chosen in childhood for their promise, converted to Islam, and educated to serve. Some were selected from prisoners of war, others sent as gifts, and still others obtained through devshirme, the tribute of children levied in the Ottoman Empire's Balkan lands. Many of the best fighters in the sultan's elite guard, the [[Janissary|janissaries]], were conscripted as young boys from Christian Albanian families, and high-ranking Ottoman officials often had Albanian bodyguards.<ref name = \"Ottoman Rule\" />\n\n===Taxation===\nAccording to historian Zija Shkodra, Albania was developed as much as the rest of the Balkans {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. In the mountains north of the Shkumbini River, Geg herders maintained their self-governing society base on clans. An association of clans was called a [[bajrak]].\n\nTaxes on the northern tribes were difficult if not impossible for the Ottomans to collect because of the rough terrain and fierceness of the Albanian highlanders. Some mountain tribes succeeded in defending their independence through the centuries of Ottoman rule, engaging in intermittent guerrilla warfare with the Ottomans, who never deemed it worthwhile to subjugate them.\n\nUntil recent times, Geg clan chiefs, or bajraktars, exercised patriarchal powers, arranged marriages, mediated quarrels, and meted out punishments. The tribesmen of the northern Albanian mountains recognized no law but the Code of [[Lek\u00eb Dukagjini]] ([[Kanuni i Lek\u00eb Dukagjinit]]), a collection of tribal laws transcribed in the 14th century by a Roman Catholic priest. The code regulates a variety of subjects, including blood vengeance. Even today, many Albanian highlanders regard the canon as the supreme law of the land.<ref name = \"Ottoman Rule\" />\n\n===Religion===\n{{Details|Millet (Ottoman Empire)}}\n[[File:Arnavut Abdurrahman Abdi Pascha.jpg|thumb|The Albanian, [[Abdurrahman Abdi Arnavut]] was one of the most important Ottoman commanders during the [[Great Turkish War|War of the Holy League]].]]\n\nFive centuries of Ottoman rule grouped the Albanian people along religious, regional, and tribal lines. In the early 17th century, however, Albanians converted to Islam in large numbers. Within a century, the Muslim Albanian community was the largest religious community in the country. Albanians in this time were divided into two distinct tribal and dialectal groupings: the [[Geg]]s and [[Tosk]]s (see [[Albanian language]]). In the rugged northern mountains, Geg shepherds lived in a tribal society often completely independent of Ottoman rule. In the south, peasant Muslim and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Tosks worked the land for Muslim [[bey]]s, provincial rulers who frequently revolted against the sultan's authority.\n\nIn the early 17th century, many Albanian converts to Islam migrated elsewhere within the Ottoman Empire and found careers in the Ottoman military and government. Some attained powerful positions in the Ottoman administration. About thirty Albanians rose to the position of grand [[vizier]], chief deputy to the sultan himself. In the second half of the 17th century, the Albanian [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family|K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc]] family provided four grand viziers, who fought against corruption, temporarily shored up eroding central government control over rapacious local beys, and won several military victories.\n\nAs early as the 18th century, a mystic Islamic sect, the [[Bektashi]] [[dervishes]], spread into the empire's Albanian-populated lands. Probably founded in the late 13th century in [[Anatolia]], Bektashism became the janissaries' official faith in the late 16th century. The Bektashi sect contains features quite distinct from normative Islam and emphasizes man as a reflection of the Divine. Women, unveiled, participate in Bektashi ceremonies on an equal basis, and the celebrants use wine despite the ban on alcohol in most Islamic interpretations of the [[Sharia]]. The Bektashis became the largest religious group in southern Albania after the sultan disbanded the janissaries in 1826. Bektashi leaders played key roles in the Albanian nationalist movement of the late 19th century and were to a great degree responsible for the Albanians' traditional tolerance of religious differences.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Ottoman sultans tried in vain to shore up their collapsing empire by introducing a series of reforms aimed at reining in recalcitrant local officials and dousing the fires of nationalism among its myriad peoples. The power of nationalism, however, proved too strong to counteract.\n\n==Albanian nationalism==\n{{Main|Albanian National Awakening}}\n{{expand section|date=September 2015}}\nAs a result of contacts maintained between the Tosks and their relatives living or returning from abroad, foreign ideas began to seep into Albania.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Literature==\n*{{cite book|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press (The Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group Incorporated)|year=2010|isbn=0-8108-6188-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC|ref=harv}}\n\n{{History of Ottoman}}\n{{Albania topics}}\n\n{{commons category|Ottoman Albania}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Ottoman Albania}}\n[[Category:Ottoman Albania| ]]\n[[Category:Islam in Albania]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1443-1479 \u2192 1443\u20131479 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania_under_the_Ottoman_Empire"}

This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other [[suspension bridge types]], this type often is constructed without [[falsework]].\n\nThe suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or [[canyon]] edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or their own [[truss bridge|trusswork]]. In the latter case, there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.\n\n==History==\n [[File:Manhattan_Bridge_2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Manhattan Bridge]], connecting [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] in New York City, opened in 1909 and is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges; its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world.]]\n{{For|bridges where the deck follows the suspenders|simple suspension bridge}}\nThe earliest suspension bridges were ropes slung across a chasm, with a deck possibly at the same level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a [[catenary arch|catenary]] shape.\n\n===Precursor===\nThe [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[siddha]] and bridge-builder [[Thangtong Gyalpo]] originated the use of [[wrought iron|iron]] chains in his version of [[simple suspension bridge]]s. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern [[Bhutan]].

Since almost all the force on the pillars is vertically downwards, and the bridge is also stabilized by the main cables, the [[column|pillars]] can be made quite slender, as on the [[Severn Bridge]], on the Wales-England border.\n\n{{wide image|Severn bridge-panoramic.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|The slender lines of the [[Severn Bridge]]}}\n\nIn a suspended deck bridge, cables suspended via towers hold up the road deck. The weight is transferred by the cables to the towers, which in turn transfer the weight to the ground.\n\n[[File: Comparison catenary parabola.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Comparison of a catenary (black dotted curve) and a parabola (red solid curve) with the same span and sag. \n{{hidden top|title=More details}}\nThe catenary represents the profile of a simple suspension bridge or the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its deck and hangers have negligible mass compared to its cable. The parabola represents the profile of the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its cable and hangers have negligible mass compared to its deck. The profile of the cable of a real suspension bridge with the same span and sag lies between the two curves.\n{{hidden bottom}}\n]]\n\nAssuming a negligible weight as compared to the weight of the deck and vehicles being supported, the main cables of a suspension bridge will form a [[parabola]] (very similar to a [[catenary]], the form the unloaded cables take before the deck is added). One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, that makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a [[cable-stayed bridge]] in which the deck is in compression.\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File: Suspension bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A suspension bridge can be made out of simple materials such as wood and common wire rope.]]\n\n*Longer main spans are achievable than with any other type of bridge.\n*Less material may be required than other bridge types, even at spans they can achieve, leading to a reduced construction cost.\n*Except for installation of the initial temporary cables, little or no access from below is required during construction and so a waterway can remain open while the bridge is built above.\n*They may be better able to withstand earthquake movements than heavier and more rigid bridges.\n*Bridge decks can have deck sections replaced in order to widen traffic lanes for larger vehicles or add additions width for separated cycling/pedestrian paths.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n*Considerable stiffness or aerodynamic profiling may be required to prevent the bridge deck vibrating under high winds.\n*The relatively low deck stiffness compared to other (non-suspension) types of bridges makes it more difficult to carry [[Passenger rail terminology#Heavy rail|heavy rail]] traffic in which high concentrated [[Structural load#Types of loads|live loads]] occur.\n*Some access below may be required during construction to lift the initial cables or to lift deck units. That access can often be avoided in [[cable-stayed bridge]] construction.\n\n==Variations==\n===Underspanned===\n[[File:Micklewood-bridge.png|thumb|Micklewood Bridge as illustrated by Charles Drewry, 1832]]\n[[File:Squibb Park Bridge uncut jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Squibb Park Bridge]], [[Brooklyn]], built 2013]]\n[[File:Uk bristol csbchains.jpg|thumb|[[Eyebar]] chain cables of [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]]]]\n[[File:Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Yichang Bridge]], a plate deck suspension bridge, over the [[Yangtze River]] in China]]\nIn an underspanned suspension bridge, the main cables hang entirely below the bridge deck, but are still anchored into the ground in a similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]];<ref name=\"Peters\"/> James Smith's Micklewood Bridge;<ref name=\"Drewry\">{{cite book |title=A Memoir of Suspension Bridges: Comprising The History Of Their Origin And Progress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR1 |last=Drewry |first=Charles Stewart |year=1832 |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green & Longman |location=London |access-date=13 June 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616213647/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR1 |archive-date=16 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and a proposal by [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] for a bridge over the River Almond near [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"Drewry\"/>\n\n[[Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct]] (begun 1847) consists of three sections supported by cables.\nThe timber structure essentially hides the cables; and from a quick view, it is not immediately apparent that it is even a suspension bridge.\n\n===Suspension cable types===\nThe main suspension cables in older bridges were often made from a chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables are made from multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because the failure of a few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or [[eyebar]] can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] over the [[Ohio River]].) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.\n\n====Suspender cable terminations====\nPoured sockets are used to make a high strength, permanent cable termination. They are created by inserting the suspender wire rope (at the bridge deck supports) into the narrow end of a conical cavity which is oriented in-line with the intended direction of strain. The individual wires are splayed out inside the cone or 'capel', and the cone is then filled with molten lead-antimony-tin (Pb80Sb15Sn5) solder.<ref>T R Barnard (1959). \"Winding Ropes and Guide Ropes:\"   Mechanical Engineering. Coal Mining Series (2nd ed.). London: Virtue. pp. 374\u2013375.</ref>\n\n===Deck structure types===\nMost suspension bridges have open truss structures to support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]] bridge collapse. In the 1960s, developments in bridge aerodynamics allowed the re-introduction of plate structures as shallow [[box girders]], first seen on the [[Severn bridge]] built 1961\u20136. In the picture of the [[Yichang Bridge]], note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.\n\n== Forces ==\nThree kinds of forces operate on any bridge: the [[Structural load#Dead load|dead]] load, the [[Structural load#Live load, imposed loads, transient load|live]] load, and the [[structural load#Environmental loads|dynamic]] load. Dead load refers to the weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a tendency to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.\n\n===Use other than road and rail===\n[[File: Cable-suspended footbridge at DFW terminal D.JPG|left|thumb|Cable-suspended footbridge at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas Fort Worth Airport]] Terminal D]]\nThe principles of suspension used on a large scale also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove less expensive and seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An example of this is the [[Nescio Bridge]] in the Netherlands, and the Roebling designed 1904 Riegelsville suspension pedestrian bridge across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.<ref>As exists with signage re the history.</ref>\n\nWhere such a bridge spans a gap between two buildings, there is no need to construct special towers, as the buildings can anchor the cables. Cable suspension may also be augmented by the inherent stiffness of a structure that has much in common with a [[tubular bridge]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Construction sequence (wire strand cable type)==\n[[File:Little Belt Bridge2.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Little Belt Bridge (1970)|Little Belt]] suspension bridge in [[Denmark]] was opened in 1970.]]\n[[File:Manhattan Bridge Construction 1909.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manhattan Bridge]] in New York City with deck under construction from the towers outward.]]\n[[File:Golden Gate Bridge architecture 10.jpg|thumb|right|Suspender cables and suspender cable band on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in San Francisco. Main cable diameter is {{convert|36|in|mm}}, and suspender cable diameter is {{convert|3.5|in|mm}}.]]\n[[File:Lions' Gate Bridge 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lions' Gate Bridge]] with deck under construction from the span's center]]\n\nTypical suspension bridges are constructed using a sequence generally described as follows. Depending on length and size, construction may take anywhere between a year and a half (construction on the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge took only 19 months) up to as long as a decade (the Akashi-Kaiky\u014d Bridge's construction began in May 1986 and was opened in May 1998 \u2013 a total of twelve years).\n#Where the towers are founded on underwater piers, [[Caisson (engineering)|'' caissons'']] are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the [[bedrock]] is too deep to be exposed by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an [[active fault]], and this has been implemented on the foundations of the [[cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] [[Rio-Antirio bridge]].) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.\n#Where the towers are founded on dry land, deep foundation excavation or pilings are used.\n#From the tower foundation, towers of single or multiple columns are erected using high-strength reinforced concrete, stonework, or steel. Concrete is used most frequently in modern suspension bridge construction due to the high cost of steel.\n#Large devices called ''saddles'', which will carry the main suspension cables, are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, they can also be manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the main cables to shift under construction and normal loads.\n#'' Anchorages'' are constructed, usually in tandem with the towers, to resist the tension of the cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually anchored in good quality rock but may consist of massive reinforced concrete deadweights within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open ''eyebolts'' enclosed within a secure space.\n#Temporary suspended walkways, called ''catwalks'', are then erected using a set of guide wires hoisted into place via winches positioned atop the towers. These catwalks follow the curve set by bridge designers for the main cables, in a path mathematically described as a [[catenary]] arc. Typical catwalks are usually between eight and ten feet wide and are constructed using wire grate and wood slats.\n#Gantries are placed upon the catwalks, which will support the main cable spinning reels. Then,  cables attached to winches are installed, and in turn, the main cable spinning devices are installed.\n#High strength wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge galvanized steel wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed over an open anchor [[eyebar]]. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a \"cable strand\" is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, the shape of the main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross-section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.\n#At specific points along the main cable (each being the exact distance horizontally in relation to the next) devices called \"cable bands\" are installed to carry steel wire ropes called ''Suspender cables.'' Each suspender cable is engineered and cut to precise lengths, and are looped over the cable bands. In some bridges, where the towers are close to or on the shore, the suspender cables may be applied only to the central span. Early suspender cables were fitted with zinc jewels and a set of steel washers, which formed the support for the deck. Modern suspender cables carry a shackle-type fitting.\n#Special lifting hoists attached to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of the bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means.  Otherwise, a traveling [[cantilever]] derrick may be used to extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the deck structure extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force in the center of the span. Upon completion of the deck, the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a [[parabola]], while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended \u2013 usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.\n#With the completion of the primary structure various details such as lighting, handrails, finish painting and paving is installed or completed.\n\n==Longest spans==\n{{Main|List of longest suspension bridge spans}}\nSuspension bridges are typically ranked by the length of their main span.

The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s.<ref>[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf Chakzampa Thangtong Gyalpo \u2013 Architect, Philosopher, and Iron Chain Bridge Builder] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140525105817/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf |date=25 May 2014 }} by Manfred Gerner.

This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other [[suspension bridge types]], this type often is constructed without [[falsework]].\n\nThe suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or [[canyon]] edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or their own [[truss bridge|trusswork]]. In the latter case, there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.\n\n==History==\n [[File:Manhattan_Bridge_2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Manhattan Bridge]], connecting [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] in New York City, opened in 1909 and is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges; its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world.]]\n{{For|bridges where the deck follows the suspenders|simple suspension bridge}}\nThe earliest suspension bridges were ropes slung across a chasm, with a deck possibly at the same level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a [[catenary arch|catenary]] shape.\n\n===Precursor===\nThe [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[siddha]] and bridge-builder [[Thangtong Gyalpo]] originated the use of [[wrought iron|iron]] chains in his version of [[simple suspension bridge]]s. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern [[Bhutan]].

Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The [[stress (mechanics)|stress points]] that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains.

The weight is transferred by the cables to the towers, which in turn transfer the weight to the ground.\n\n[[File: Comparison catenary parabola.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Comparison of a catenary (black dotted curve) and a parabola (red solid curve) with the same span and sag. \n{{hidden top|title=More details}}\nThe catenary represents the profile of a simple suspension bridge or the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its deck and hangers have negligible mass compared to its cable. The parabola represents the profile of the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its cable and hangers have negligible mass compared to its deck. The profile of the cable of a real suspension bridge with the same span and sag lies between the two curves.\n{{hidden bottom}}\n]]\n\nAssuming a negligible weight as compared to the weight of the deck and vehicles being supported, the main cables of a suspension bridge will form a [[parabola]] (very similar to a [[catenary]], the form the unloaded cables take before the deck is added). One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, that makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a [[cable-stayed bridge]] in which the deck is in compression.\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File: Suspension bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A suspension bridge can be made out of simple materials such as wood and common wire rope.]]\n\n*Longer main spans are achievable than with any other type of bridge.\n*Less material may be required than other bridge types, even at spans they can achieve, leading to a reduced construction cost.\n*Except for installation of the initial temporary cables, little or no access from below is required during construction and so a waterway can remain open while the bridge is built above.\n*They may be better able to withstand earthquake movements than heavier and more rigid bridges.\n*Bridge decks can have deck sections replaced in order to widen traffic lanes for larger vehicles or add additions width for separated cycling/pedestrian paths.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n*Considerable stiffness or aerodynamic profiling may be required to prevent the bridge deck vibrating under high winds.\n*The relatively low deck stiffness compared to other (non-suspension) types of bridges makes it more difficult to carry [[Passenger rail terminology#Heavy rail|heavy rail]] traffic in which high concentrated [[Structural load#Types of loads|live loads]] occur.\n*Some access below may be required during construction to lift the initial cables or to lift deck units. That access can often be avoided in [[cable-stayed bridge]] construction.\n\n==Variations==\n===Underspanned===\n[[File:Micklewood-bridge.png|thumb|Micklewood Bridge as illustrated by Charles Drewry, 1832]]\n[[File:Squibb Park Bridge uncut jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Squibb Park Bridge]], [[Brooklyn]], built 2013]]\n[[File:Uk bristol csbchains.jpg|thumb|[[Eyebar]] chain cables of [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]]]]\n[[File:Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Yichang Bridge]], a plate deck suspension bridge, over the [[Yangtze River]] in China]]\nIn an underspanned suspension bridge, the main cables hang entirely below the bridge deck, but are still anchored into the ground in a similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]];<ref name=\"Peters\"/> James Smith's Micklewood Bridge;<ref name=\"Drewry\">{{cite book |title=A Memoir of Suspension Bridges: Comprising The History Of Their Origin And Progress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR1 |last=Drewry |first=Charles Stewart |year=1832 |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green & Longman |location=London |access-date=13 June 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616213647/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR1 |archive-date=16 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and a proposal by [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] for a bridge over the River Almond near [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"Drewry\"/>\n\n[[Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct]] (begun 1847) consists of three sections supported by cables.\nThe timber structure essentially hides the cables; and from a quick view, it is not immediately apparent that it is even a suspension bridge.\n\n===Suspension cable types===\nThe main suspension cables in older bridges were often made from a chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables are made from multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because the failure of a few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or [[eyebar]] can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] over the [[Ohio River]].) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.\n\n====Suspender cable terminations====\nPoured sockets are used to make a high strength, permanent cable termination. They are created by inserting the suspender wire rope (at the bridge deck supports) into the narrow end of a conical cavity which is oriented in-line with the intended direction of strain. The individual wires are splayed out inside the cone or 'capel', and the cone is then filled with molten lead-antimony-tin (Pb80Sb15Sn5) solder.<ref>T R Barnard (1959). \"Winding Ropes and Guide Ropes:\"   Mechanical Engineering. Coal Mining Series (2nd ed.). London: Virtue. pp. 374\u2013375.</ref>\n\n===Deck structure types===\nMost suspension bridges have open truss structures to support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]] bridge collapse. In the 1960s, developments in bridge aerodynamics allowed the re-introduction of plate structures as shallow [[box girders]], first seen on the [[Severn bridge]] built 1961\u20136. In the picture of the [[Yichang Bridge]], note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.\n\n== Forces ==\nThree kinds of forces operate on any bridge: the [[Structural load#Dead load|dead]] load, the [[Structural load#Live load, imposed loads, transient load|live]] load, and the [[structural load#Environmental loads|dynamic]] load. Dead load refers to the weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a tendency to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.\n\n===Use other than road and rail===\n[[File: Cable-suspended footbridge at DFW terminal D.JPG|left|thumb|Cable-suspended footbridge at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas Fort Worth Airport]] Terminal D]]\nThe principles of suspension used on a large scale also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove less expensive and seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An example of this is the [[Nescio Bridge]] in the Netherlands, and the Roebling designed 1904 Riegelsville suspension pedestrian bridge across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.<ref>As exists with signage re the history.</ref>\n\nWhere such a bridge spans a gap between two buildings, there is no need to construct special towers, as the buildings can anchor the cables. Cable suspension may also be augmented by the inherent stiffness of a structure that has much in common with a [[tubular bridge]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Construction sequence (wire strand cable type)==\n[[File:Little Belt Bridge2.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Little Belt Bridge (1970)|Little Belt]] suspension bridge in [[Denmark]] was opened in 1970.]]\n[[File:Manhattan Bridge Construction 1909.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manhattan Bridge]] in New York City with deck under construction from the towers outward.]]\n[[File:Golden Gate Bridge architecture 10.jpg|thumb|right|Suspender cables and suspender cable band on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in San Francisco. Main cable diameter is {{convert|36|in|mm}}, and suspender cable diameter is {{convert|3.5|in|mm}}.]]\n[[File:Lions' Gate Bridge 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lions' Gate Bridge]] with deck under construction from the span's center]]\n\nTypical suspension bridges are constructed using a sequence generally described as follows. Depending on length and size, construction may take anywhere between a year and a half (construction on the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge took only 19 months) up to as long as a decade (the Akashi-Kaiky\u014d Bridge's construction began in May 1986 and was opened in May 1998 \u2013 a total of twelve years).\n#Where the towers are founded on underwater piers, [[Caisson (engineering)|'' caissons'']] are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the [[bedrock]] is too deep to be exposed by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an [[active fault]], and this has been implemented on the foundations of the [[cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] [[Rio-Antirio bridge]].) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.\n#Where the towers are founded on dry land, deep foundation excavation or pilings are used.\n#From the tower foundation, towers of single or multiple columns are erected using high-strength reinforced concrete, stonework, or steel. Concrete is used most frequently in modern suspension bridge construction due to the high cost of steel.\n#Large devices called ''saddles'', which will carry the main suspension cables, are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, they can also be manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the main cables to shift under construction and normal loads.\n#'' Anchorages'' are constructed, usually in tandem with the towers, to resist the tension of the cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually anchored in good quality rock but may consist of massive reinforced concrete deadweights within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open ''eyebolts'' enclosed within a secure space.\n#Temporary suspended walkways, called ''catwalks'', are then erected using a set of guide wires hoisted into place via winches positioned atop the towers. These catwalks follow the curve set by bridge designers for the main cables, in a path mathematically described as a [[catenary]] arc. Typical catwalks are usually between eight and ten feet wide and are constructed using wire grate and wood slats.\n#Gantries are placed upon the catwalks, which will support the main cable spinning reels. Then,  cables attached to winches are installed, and in turn, the main cable spinning devices are installed.\n#High strength wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge galvanized steel wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed over an open anchor [[eyebar]]. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a \"cable strand\" is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, the shape of the main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross-section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.\n#At specific points along the main cable (each being the exact distance horizontally in relation to the next) devices called \"cable bands\" are installed to carry steel wire ropes called ''Suspender cables.'' Each suspender cable is engineered and cut to precise lengths, and are looped over the cable bands. In some bridges, where the towers are close to or on the shore, the suspender cables may be applied only to the central span. Early suspender cables were fitted with zinc jewels and a set of steel washers, which formed the support for the deck. Modern suspender cables carry a shackle-type fitting.\n#Special lifting hoists attached to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of the bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means.  Otherwise, a traveling [[cantilever]] derrick may be used to extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the deck structure extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force in the center of the span. Upon completion of the deck, the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a [[parabola]], while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended \u2013 usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.\n#With the completion of the primary structure various details such as lighting, handrails, finish painting and paving is installed or completed.\n\n==Longest spans==\n{{Main|List of longest suspension bridge spans}}\nSuspension bridges are typically ranked by the length of their main span.

Alanya's greatest political importance came in the [[Middle Ages]], with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] under the rule of [[Kayqubad I|Alaeddin Kayqubad I]], from whom the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city's landmarks, such as the [[K\u0131z\u0131l Kule]] (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and [[Alanya Castle]].\n\nThe [[Mediterranean climate]], natural attractions, and historic heritage make Alanya a popular destination for tourism, and responsible for nine percent of [[Tourism in Turkey|Turkey's tourism sector]] and thirty percent of [[foreign purchases of real estate in Turkey]]. Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population.
