Under [[Mir Naseer Khan I]] in 1758, who accepted the Afghan paramountcy, the boundaries of Kalat stretched up to [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] in the east and [[Bandar Abbas]] in the west. However, in November 1839, the British invaded Kalat and killed the Khan and his followers. Afterwards, the British influence in the region gradually grew. In 1869, the British Political Agent Robert Sandeman ended up mediating a dispute between the Khan of Kalat and the Sardars of Balochistan, and established the British primacy in the region. The tribal areas of Marri, Bugti, Khetran and Chaghi were brought under the direct administration of a British Agent, eventually to become the [[Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan]]. [[Las Bela (princely state)|Lasbela]] and [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]] were declared Special Areas with a different political system. The remaining areas of [[Sarawan]], [[Jhalawan]], [[Kacchi (Kalat)|Kacchi]] and [[Makran]] were retained as the Khanate of Kalat, supervised by a Political Agent of Kalat.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nIn the 20th century, the educated Baloch middle class harboured hopes of an independent Balochistan free of the British. They formed a nationalist movement [[Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochistan]] in 1931. One of their first campaigns was to fight for the accession of [[Azam Jan of Kalat|Azam Jan]] as the Khan of Kalat and a constitutional government to be established under him. They were successful in establishing Azam Jan as the Khan but the new Khan sided with the Sardars and turned his back on the Anjuman. His successor [[Mir Ahmad Yar Khan]] was more sympathetic to Anjuman but he was averse to upsetting his relations with the British. The Anujman, transformed into the [[Kalat State National Party]] (KSNP), continued to fight for independence from the British. It was declared illegal by the Khanate in 1939 and its active leaders and activists were exiled. This paved the way for the formation of new political parties, Balochistan Muslim League allied to the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in June 1939 and Anjuman-i-Watan allied to the [[Indian National Congress]] in the same year.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=55\u201358}}\n\nDuring British rule Balochistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India . The Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the period 1927-1947 strived to introduce reforms in Balochistan to bring it on par with other provinces of British India.\n\nDuring the Pakistan Movement, public opinion in Balochistan, at least in Quetta and other small towns, was overwhelmingly in favour of Pakistan. The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province\u2019s inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan. Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State. The representatives of Kalat argued that Kalat, as per the treaty of 1876,  was an independent and sovereign state and not an Indian state. Mountbatten accepted this position only for the purpose of negotiation. Although state of Kalat has always been a princely state. Thus, Mountbatten confined the topic of discussion to the leased areas of Quetta, Nushki, Nasirabad and Bolan. He explained that Pakistan rejected Kalat\u2019s claims that these areas should be returned to Kalat.\n\nPakistan's position was that it would inherit all treaty obligations incurred by India to the foreign states. Kalat argued that the leases clearly stated that the other party besides Kalat was the British Government alone. Kalat argued that it was a personal agreement and there was no provision that the leases to the British would be inherited by others. Therefore, since the agreement was between Kalat and the British Government, Pakistan could not be the latter's successor party.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nPakistan did not agree that the agreement was personal as personal agreements by nature implied that only a particular person was involved. Mountbatten also said that according to international law, treaties such as the one being discussed were inherited by successors and not invalidated by a transfer of power. Mountbatten also suggested that in case there was no agreement the matter could be put before an Arbitral Tribunal.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nKalat wished to have further discussions on the matter. Kalat also argued that in case of a vote in the leased areas between joining Kalat and joining Pakistan then the vote would go in favour of the former. Pakistan did not agree that the vote would have such a result.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nKalat also expressed its deepest desire to remain on friendly terms with Pakistan and stated that it understood that Jinnah, who was anxious for a correct decision, wanted more time to study the issues between Kalat and Pakistan. Mountbatten, however, suggested that Jinnah not be brought into the discussions.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nMountbatten insisted that Kalat and Pakistan sign a standstill agreement, which both countries did. The Standstill Agreement also stipulated that both parties would discuss as soon as possible about their relationship concerning Defence and External Affairs.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}} According to the Article I, 'The Government of Pakistan agrees that Kalat is an independent State, being quite different in status from other States of India'. However, the Article IV stated:\n{{quote|a [[standstill agreement (India)|standstill agreement]] will be made between Pakistan and Kalat by which Pakistan shall stand committed to all the responsibilities agreements signed by Kalat and the British Government from 1839 to 1947 and by this, Pakistan shall be the legal, constitutional and political successor of the British.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|p=59}}}}\n\nThrough this agreement, the [[British Paramountcy]] was effectively transferred to Pakistan.\n\nHowever, without making any agreement with Pakistan and in violation of the Standstill Agreement the Khan of Kalat declared independence, to Jinnah's shock. Later on, the ruler of Kalat unconditionally signed an Instrument of Accession with Pakistan on 27 March 1948, contrary to the wishes of his state's legislature.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\n===First conflict===\nBalochistan contained a [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|Chief Commissioner's province]] and four [[princely state]]s under the British Raj.

Tension continued to grow amid consistent political disorder and instability at the federal level. The federal government tasked the Pakistan Army with building several new bases in key areas of Balochistan. Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led like-minded militants into guerrilla warfare from 1963 to 1969 by creating their own insurgent bases, spread out over {{convert|45000|mi|km}} of land, from the [[Mengal]] tribal area in the south to the [[Marri-Bugti Country|Marri]] and [[Bugti]] tribal areas in the north. Their goal was to force Pakistan to share revenue generated from the [[Sui gas fields]] with the tribal leaders. The insurgents bombed railway tracks and ambushed convoys.

Under [[Mir Naseer Khan I]] in 1758, who accepted the Afghan paramountcy, the boundaries of Kalat stretched up to [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] in the east and [[Bandar Abbas]] in the west. However, in November 1839, the British invaded Kalat and killed the Khan and his followers. Afterwards, the British influence in the region gradually grew. In 1869, the British Political Agent Robert Sandeman ended up mediating a dispute between the Khan of Kalat and the Sardars of Balochistan, and established the British primacy in the region. The tribal areas of Marri, Bugti, Khetran and Chaghi were brought under the direct administration of a British Agent, eventually to become the [[Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan]]. [[Las Bela (princely state)|Lasbela]] and [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]] were declared Special Areas with a different political system. The remaining areas of [[Sarawan]], [[Jhalawan]], [[Kacchi (Kalat)|Kacchi]] and [[Makran]] were retained as the Khanate of Kalat, supervised by a Political Agent of Kalat.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nIn the 20th century, the educated Baloch middle class harboured hopes of an independent Balochistan free of the British. They formed a nationalist movement [[Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochistan]] in 1931. One of their first campaigns was to fight for the accession of [[Azam Jan of Kalat|Azam Jan]] as the Khan of Kalat and a constitutional government to be established under him. They were successful in establishing Azam Jan as the Khan but the new Khan sided with the Sardars and turned his back on the Anjuman. His successor [[Mir Ahmad Yar Khan]] was more sympathetic to Anjuman but he was averse to upsetting his relations with the British. The Anujman, transformed into the [[Kalat State National Party]] (KSNP), continued to fight for independence from the British. It was declared illegal by the Khanate in 1939 and its active leaders and activists were exiled. This paved the way for the formation of new political parties, Balochistan Muslim League allied to the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in June 1939 and Anjuman-i-Watan allied to the [[Indian National Congress]] in the same year.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=55\u201358}}\n\nDuring British rule Balochistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India . The Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the period 1927-1947 strived to introduce reforms in Balochistan to bring it on par with other provinces of British India.\n\nDuring the Pakistan Movement, public opinion in Balochistan, at least in Quetta and other small towns, was overwhelmingly in favour of Pakistan. The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province\u2019s inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan. Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State. The representatives of Kalat argued that Kalat, as per the treaty of 1876,  was an independent and sovereign state and not an Indian state. Mountbatten accepted this position only for the purpose of negotiation. Although state of Kalat has always been a princely state. Thus, Mountbatten confined the topic of discussion to the leased areas of Quetta, Nushki, Nasirabad and Bolan. He explained that Pakistan rejected Kalat\u2019s claims that these areas should be returned to Kalat.\n\nPakistan's position was that it would inherit all treaty obligations incurred by India to the foreign states. Kalat argued that the leases clearly stated that the other party besides Kalat was the British Government alone. Kalat argued that it was a personal agreement and there was no provision that the leases to the British would be inherited by others. Therefore, since the agreement was between Kalat and the British Government, Pakistan could not be the latter's successor party.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nPakistan did not agree that the agreement was personal as personal agreements by nature implied that only a particular person was involved. Mountbatten also said that according to international law, treaties such as the one being discussed were inherited by successors and not invalidated by a transfer of power. Mountbatten also suggested that in case there was no agreement the matter could be put before an Arbitral Tribunal.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nKalat wished to have further discussions on the matter. Kalat also argued that in case of a vote in the leased areas between joining Kalat and joining Pakistan then the vote would go in favour of the former.

A parallel town for workers at Gwadar is being built close to the old one to segregate Balochs from the growing influx of outsiders. Government officials illegally sold much of the land around Gwadar, making massive profits at the expense of local Balochs.

Mir Suleiman Dawood claims that the people in Balochistan remain deeply resentful of Pakistan's policies in the region and he, apart from other, rather militant, Baloch nationalist organisations have openly called for India's assistance in Balochistan's separation from Pakistan. On 12 August 2009, Khan of Kalat Mir Suleiman Dawood declared himself ruler of Balochistan and formally made announcement of a Council for Independent Balochistan.

Paliwal further claims that, like Pakistan and India, Iraq and Iran were also bitter rivals. As a result, Pakistan and Iran had developed closer relations with each other. Likewise, India and Iraq also had developed similar relations. Arming Baloch insurgents on Iranian and Pakistani side was in the interest both Iraq and India.

Paliwal claims that even if Indian intelligence agencies deny direct support to Baloch insurgents, it was unlikely that they remained aloof from unfolding dynamics. [[Atul Khare]], who had observed these events on regular basis, confirmed that India had contacts with Baloch militants. India had given (limited) protection to sons and grandsons of Baloch leaders as well as Akbar Bugti.

During one of such campaigns in 1072, Alp Arslan was fatally wounded and died only a few days later. After that, Malik-Shah was crowned as the new sultan of the empire, however, Malik-Shah did not access the throne peacefully, and had to fight his uncle [[Qavurt]], who claimed the throne. Although Malik-Shah was the nominal head of the Seljuk state, Nizam al-Mulk held near absolute power during his reign.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gibb|first=H. A.

According to the 12th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] historian [[Muhammad bin Ali Rawandi]], Malik-Shah had fair skin, was tall and somewhat bulky.{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}} In 1064, Malik-Shah, only 9 years old by then, along with [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the Persian ''[[vizier]]'' of the Empire,{{sfn|Luther|1985|pp=895\u2013898}} took part in Alp Arslan\u2019s campaign in the [[Caucasus]]. The same year, Malik-Shah was married to [[Terken Khatun (wife of Malik-Shah I)|Terken Khatun]], the daughter of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanid]] khan [[Ibrahim Tamghach-Khan]].{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}} In 1066, Alp Arslan arranged a ceremony near [[Merv]], where he appointed Malik-Shah as his heir and also granted him Isfahan as a [[fief]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=61}}{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}}\n\nIn 1071, Malik-Shah took part in the [[Syria]]n campaign of his father, and stayed in [[Aleppo]] when his father fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]].{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}} In 1072, Malik-Shah and Nizam al-Mulk accompanied Alp-Arslan during his campaign in [[Transoxiana]] against the Karakhanids. However, Alp-Arslan was badly wounded during his expedition, and Malik-Shah shortly took over the army. Alp-Arslan died some days later, and Malik-Shah was declared as the new ''sultan'' of the empire.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Malik-Shah I.jpg|thumb|300px|Malik-Shah I seated on his throne, miniature from the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' of [[Rashid al-Din Hamadani]]]]\n[[File:Alp Arslan we M\u00e4lik \u015ea.jpg|thumb|Monument to Malik-Shah I and Alp Arslan in [[Ashgabat]], [[Turkmenistan]]]]\nHowever, right after Malik-Shah accession, his uncle [[Qavurt]] claimed the throne for himself and sent Malik-Shah a message which said: \"I am the eldest brother, and you are a youthful son; I have the greater right to my brother Alp-Arslan's inheritance.\" Malik-Shah then replied by sending the following message: \"A brother does not inherit when there is a son.\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=88}} This message enraged Qavurt, who thereafter occupied Isfahan. In 1073 a [[Battle of Kerj Abu Dulaf|battle]] took place near [[Hamadan]], which lasted three days. Qavurt was accompanied by his seven sons, and his army consisted of [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], while the army of Malik-Shah consisted of ''[[ghilman|ghulam]]s'' (\"military slaves\") and contingents of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] troops.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=88}}\n\nDuring the battle, the Turks of Malik-Shah's army mutinied against him, but he nevertheless managed to defeat and capture Qavurt.{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|pp=88-89}} Qavurt then begged for mercy and in return promised to retire to [[Oman]]. However, Nizam al-Mulk declined the offer, claiming that sparing him was an indication of weakness. After some time, Qavurt was strangled to death with a bowstring, while two of his sons were blinded. After having dealt with that problem, Malik-Shah appointed [[Qutlugh-Tegin]] as the governor of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Sav-Tegin]] as the governor of [[Kerman]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=89}} Malik-Shah then turned his attention towards the Karakhanids, who had after the death of Alp-Arslan invaded [[Tukharistan]], which was ruled by Malik-Shah's brother Ayaz, who was unable to repel the Karakhanids and was killed by them. Malik-Shah eventually managed to repel the Karakhanids and captured [[Tirmidh]], giving Sav-Tegin the key of the city. Malik-Shah then appointed his other brother [[Shihab al-Din Tekish]] as the ruler of Tukharistan and [[Balkh]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|pp=90-91}} During the same period, the [[Ghaznavid]] ruler [[Ibrahim of Ghazna|Ibrahim]] was seizing Seljuq territory in northern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], but was defeated by Malik-Shah, who then made peace with the latter and gave his daughter [[Gawhar Khatun]] in marriage to Ibrahim's son [[Mas'ud III]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2002|p=179}}{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=94}}\n\nIn 1074, Malik-Shah ordered the Turkic warlord Arghar to restore what he had destroyed during his raids in the territory of the [[Shirvanshah]] [[Fariburz I]].{{sfn|Minorsky|1958|p=40}} During the same year, he appointed Qavurt's son Rukn al-Dawla Sultan-Shah as the ruler of Kerman.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=89}} One year later, Malik-Shah sent an army under Sav-Tegin to [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], which was ruled by the [[Shaddadid]] ruler [[Al-Fadl III bin al-Fadl II|Fadlun III]].

The situation within the Seljuq lands was further complicated by the beginning of the [[First Crusade]], which detached large portions of Syria and Palestine from Muslim control in 1098 and 1099.

In every age, and more especially in Asia, the thirst of power has inspired the same passions, and occasioned the same disorders; but, from the long series of civil war, it would not be easy to extract a sentiment more pure and magnanimous than is contained in the saying of the Turkish prince. On the eve of the battle, he performed his devotions at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza. As the sultan rose from the ground, he asked his vizier Nizam, who had knelt beside him, what had been the object of his secret petition: \"That your arms may be crowned with victory,\" was the prudent, and most probably the sincere, answer of the minister. \"For my part,\" replied the generous Malek, \"I implored the Lord of Hosts that he would take from me my life and crown, if my brother be more worthy than myself to reign over the Moslems.\" The favourable judgment of heaven was ratified by the caliph; and for the first time, the sacred title of Commander of the Faithful was communicated to a Barbarian. But this Barbarian, by his personal merit, and the extent of his empire, was the greatest prince of his age.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', New York: The Modern Library, n.d. v. 3, p. 406.</ref>}}\n\n==Personality==\nMalik-Shah displayed substantial interest in science, art and literature<ref name=\"science\">{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Malik-Sh\u0101h |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Malik-Shah |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>.

During one of such campaigns in 1072, Alp Arslan was fatally wounded and died only a few days later. After that, Malik-Shah was crowned as the new sultan of the empire, however, Malik-Shah did not access the throne peacefully, and had to fight his uncle [[Qavurt]], who claimed the throne. Although Malik-Shah was the nominal head of the Seljuk state, Nizam al-Mulk held near absolute power during his reign.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gibb|first=H. A. R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. 8|year=1960\u20131985|publisher=Brill |location=Leiden|pages=70}}</ref> Malik-Shah spent the rest of his reign waging war against the [[Karakhanids]] on the eastern side, and establishing order in the [[Caucasus]].\n\nMalik-Shah's death to this day remains under dispute; according to some scholars, he was poisoned by Abbasid caliph [[al-Muqtadi]], while others say that he was poisoned by the supporters of Nizam al-Mulk.\n\n== Etymology ==\nAlthough he was known by several names, he was mostly known as \"Malik-Shah\", a combination of the Arabic word [[malik]] (king) and the Persian word [[shah]] (which also means king).\n\n== Early life ==\nMalik-Shah was born on 16 August 1055 and spent his youth in [[Isfahan]]. According to the 12th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] historian [[Muhammad bin Ali Rawandi]], Malik-Shah had fair skin, was tall and somewhat bulky.{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}} In 1064, Malik-Shah, only 9 years old by then, along with [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the Persian ''[[vizier]]'' of the Empire,{{sfn|Luther|1985|pp=895\u2013898}} took part in Alp Arslan\u2019s campaign in the [[Caucasus]]. The same year, Malik-Shah was married to [[Terken Khatun (wife of Malik-Shah I)|Terken Khatun]], the daughter of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanid]] khan [[Ibrahim Tamghach-Khan]].{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}} In 1066, Alp Arslan arranged a ceremony near [[Merv]], where he appointed Malik-Shah as his heir and also granted him Isfahan as a [[fief]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=61}}{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}}\n\nIn 1071, Malik-Shah took part in the [[Syria]]n campaign of his father, and stayed in [[Aleppo]] when his father fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]].{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}} In 1072, Malik-Shah and Nizam al-Mulk accompanied Alp-Arslan during his campaign in [[Transoxiana]] against the Karakhanids. However, Alp-Arslan was badly wounded during his expedition, and Malik-Shah shortly took over the army. Alp-Arslan died some days later, and Malik-Shah was declared as the new ''sultan'' of the empire.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Malik-Shah I.jpg|thumb|300px|Malik-Shah I seated on his throne, miniature from the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' of [[Rashid al-Din Hamadani]]]]\n[[File:Alp Arslan we M\u00e4lik \u015ea.jpg|thumb|Monument to Malik-Shah I and Alp Arslan in [[Ashgabat]], [[Turkmenistan]]]]\nHowever, right after Malik-Shah accession, his uncle [[Qavurt]] claimed the throne for himself and sent Malik-Shah a message which said: \"I am the eldest brother, and you are a youthful son; I have the greater right to my brother Alp-Arslan's inheritance.\" Malik-Shah then replied by sending the following message: \"A brother does not inherit when there is a son.\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=88}} This message enraged Qavurt, who thereafter occupied Isfahan. In 1073 a [[Battle of Kerj Abu Dulaf|battle]] took place near [[Hamadan]], which lasted three days. Qavurt was accompanied by his seven sons, and his army consisted of [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], while the army of Malik-Shah consisted of ''[[ghilman|ghulam]]s'' (\"military slaves\") and contingents of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] troops.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=88}}\n\nDuring the battle, the Turks of Malik-Shah's army mutinied against him, but he nevertheless managed to defeat and capture Qavurt.{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|pp=88-89}} Qavurt then begged for mercy and in return promised to retire to [[Oman]]. However, Nizam al-Mulk declined the offer, claiming that sparing him was an indication of weakness. After some time, Qavurt was strangled to death with a bowstring, while two of his sons were blinded. After having dealt with that problem, Malik-Shah appointed [[Qutlugh-Tegin]] as the governor of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Sav-Tegin]] as the governor of [[Kerman]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=89}} Malik-Shah then turned his attention towards the Karakhanids, who had after the death of Alp-Arslan invaded [[Tukharistan]], which was ruled by Malik-Shah's brother Ayaz, who was unable to repel the Karakhanids and was killed by them. Malik-Shah eventually managed to repel the Karakhanids and captured [[Tirmidh]], giving Sav-Tegin the key of the city. Malik-Shah then appointed his other brother [[Shihab al-Din Tekish]] as the ruler of Tukharistan and [[Balkh]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|pp=90-91}} During the same period, the [[Ghaznavid]] ruler [[Ibrahim of Ghazna|Ibrahim]] was seizing Seljuq territory in northern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], but was defeated by Malik-Shah, who then made peace with the latter and gave his daughter [[Gawhar Khatun]] in marriage to Ibrahim's son [[Mas'ud III]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2002|p=179}}{{sfn|Durand-Gu\u00e9dy|2012}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=94}}\n\nIn 1074, Malik-Shah ordered the Turkic warlord Arghar to restore what he had destroyed during his raids in the territory of the [[Shirvanshah]] [[Fariburz I]].{{sfn|Minorsky|1958|p=40}} During the same year, he appointed Qavurt's son Rukn al-Dawla Sultan-Shah as the ruler of Kerman.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=89}} One year later, Malik-Shah sent an army under Sav-Tegin to [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], which was ruled by the [[Shaddadid]] ruler [[Al-Fadl III bin al-Fadl II|Fadlun III]]. Sav-Tegin managed to easily conquer the region, thus ending Shaddadid rule.

The situation within the Seljuq lands was further complicated by the beginning of the [[First Crusade]], which detached large portions of Syria and Palestine from Muslim control in 1098 and 1099. The success of the First Crusade is at least in part attributable to the political confusion which resulted from Malik-Shah's death.<ref>[[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], ''The Oxford History of the Crusades'', (Oxford University Press, 2002), 213.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n;Consorts\nMalik-Shah had three known consorts:\n*Terken Khatun, daughter of Tamghach Khan Ibrahim;\n*Zubaida Khatun, daughter of Yakuti;\n*Taj-ud-din Safariyya Khatun, a concubine.\n\n;Sons\nMalik-Shah had seven sons:\n*Dawud - with Terken Khatun;\n*Abu al-Qasim - with Terken Khatun;\n*[[Mahmud I of Great Seljuk|Mahmud I]] - with Terken Khatun;\n*[[Barkiyaruq]] - with Zubaida Khatun;\n*[[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I Tapar]] - with Safariyya Khatun;\n*[[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] - with Safariyya Khatun;\n*A son who died in childhood - with Safariyya Khatun.\n\n;Daughters\nMalik-Shah had seven daughters:\n*Mah-i-mulk Khatun - with Terken Khatun, married to Caliph [[al-Muqtadi]];\n*Sitara Khatun - with Safariyya Khatun, married to Gharchasp, son of Ali bin Faramarz;\n*Ismah Khatun, married to Caliph [[Al-Mustazhir]];\n*[[Gawhar Khatun]], married to Sultan [[Mas'ud III]];\n*Terken Khatun - with Safariyya Khatun, married to Arslan Khan Muhammad, son of Sulaiman;\n*Another daughter - with Safariyya Khatun, married to Mardavij, son of Ali;\n*Another daughter with Safariyya Khatun, married to Najm al-Daula, son of Shahriyar bin Qaim.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe 18th century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] wrote of him:\n{{quote|On his father's death the inheritance was disputed by an uncle, a cousin, and a brother: they drew their cimeters, and assembled their followers; and the triple victory of Malek Shah established his own reputation and the right of primogeniture. In every age, and more especially in Asia, the thirst of power has inspired the same passions, and occasioned the same disorders; but, from the long series of civil war, it would not be easy to extract a sentiment more pure and magnanimous than is contained in the saying of the Turkish prince. On the eve of the battle, he performed his devotions at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza. As the sultan rose from the ground, he asked his vizier Nizam, who had knelt beside him, what had been the object of his secret petition: \"That your arms may be crowned with victory,\" was the prudent, and most probably the sincere, answer of the minister. \"For my part,\" replied the generous Malek, \"I implored the Lord of Hosts that he would take from me my life and crown, if my brother be more worthy than myself to reign over the Moslems.\" The favourable judgment of heaven was ratified by the caliph; and for the first time, the sacred title of Commander of the Faithful was communicated to a Barbarian. But this Barbarian, by his personal merit, and the extent of his empire, was the greatest prince of his age.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', New York: The Modern Library, n.d. v. 3, p. 406.</ref>}}\n\n==Personality==\nMalik-Shah displayed substantial interest in science, art and literature<ref name=\"science\">{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Malik-Sh\u0101h |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Malik-Shah |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>.

He thought highly of the art of architecture as well, as he enjoyed building new and splendid mosques in his capital, [[Isfahan]].

Thyroglobulin levels may be tested regularly for a few weeks or months following the removal of the thyroid.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/thyroglobulin/|title=Thyroglobulin: MedlinePlus Lab Test Information|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> After thyroglobulin levels become undetectable (following thyroidectomy), levels can be serially monitored.{{what?|date=April 2016}}  \n\nA subsequent elevation of the thyroglobulin level is an indication of recurrence of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma.

Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs.
