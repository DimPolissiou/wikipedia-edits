The integumentary system includes [[hair]], [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], [[feathers]], [[Hoof|hooves]], and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]]. It has a variety of additional functions; it may serve to waterproof, and protect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate [[Core temperature|body temperature]], and is the attachment site for [[sensory receptor]]s to detect pain, sensation, pressure, and temperature. In most land vertebrates with significant exposure to sunlight, the integumentary system also provides for [[vitamin D]] synthesis.\n\n== Skin ==\nThe skin is the largest organ of the body. In humans, it accounts for about 12 to 15 percent of total body weight and covers 1.5-2m<sup>2</sup> of surface area.<ref>Martini & Nath: \"Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology\" 8th Edition, pp.158, Pearson Education, 2009</ref>\n[[File:Integumentary system.jpg|thumb|263x263px|3D still showing integumentary system.]]\nThe [[human skin]] (integument) is composed of at least two major layers of tissue: the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and [[dermis]]. (The hypodermis or subcutaneous layer is not part of the skin{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.) The epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to the external environment. It is separated from the dermis by the basement membrane. The epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to the skin. The deepest layer of epidermis also contains nerve endings. Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue.<ref name=\"aging skin\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-1-structure-of-skin-and-introduction/ The Ageing Skin - Structure of Skin]</ref>  The deepest layer, the hypodermis, is primarily made up of [[adipose tissue]]. Substantial collagen bundles anchor the dermis to the hypodermis in a way that permits most areas of the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue layers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Rebecca|title=Integument|url=http://www.anatomyone.com/a/integument/|work=AnatomyOne|publisher=Amirsys, Inc|accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>\n\n===Epidermis===\n{{Main|Epidermis (skin)}}\n[[File:Normal Epidermis and Dermis with Intradermal Nevus 10x.JPG|thumb|left|Epidermis and dermis of human skin]]\nThe epidermis is the top layer of skin made up of [[epithelial cells]]. It contains blood vessels. Its main functions are protection, absorption of nutrients, and homeostasis. In structure, it consists of a keratinized stratified [[squamous epithelium]]; four types of cells: [[keratinocytes]], [[melanocytes]], [[Merkel cells]], and [[Langerhans cells]]. The major cell of the epidermis is the keratinocyte, which produces [[keratin]], a fibrous protein that aids in skin protection. An overwhelming amount of keratin can cause disease by giving rise to eruptions from the skin that will protrude outwards and lead to infection. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Keratin is also a waterproofing protein.  Millions of dead keratinocytes rub off daily. The majority of the skin on the body is keratinized. The only skin on the body that is non-keratinized is the lining of mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow water to \"stay\" atop the structure.\n\nThe protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form [[fingernail]]s. Nails grow from a thin area called the [[Matrix (nail)|nail matrix]] at an average  of 1&nbsp;mm per week. The [[lunula (anatomy)|lunula]] is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, lighter in color as it mixes with the matrix cells. Also, the stratum corneum is the top part of the epidermis.\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n===Dermis===\n\n{{Main|Dermis}}\nThe dermis is the middle layer of skin, composed of dense irregular connective tissue and [[Loose connective tissue|areolar connective tissue]] such as a collagen with [[elastin]] arranged in a diffusely bundled and woven pattern. The dermis has two layers. One is the papillary layer which is the superficial layer and consists of the areolar connective tissue. The other is the reticular layer which is the deep layer of the dermis and consists of the dense irregular connective tissue. These layers serve to give elasticity to the integument, allowing stretching and conferring flexibility, while also resisting distortions, wrinkling, and sagging.<ref name=\"aging skin\"/> The dermal layer provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. Many [[chromatophores]] are also stored in this layer, as are the bases of integumental structures such as [[hair]], [[feathers]], and [[glands]].\n\n==Hypodermis==\n\n{{Main|Hypodermis}}\nThe hypodermis, otherwise known as the subcutaneous layer, is a layer beneath the skin. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibers. It is essentially composed of a type of cell known as adipocytes specialized in accumulating and storing fats. These cells are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.\n\nThe hypodermis acts as an energy reserve. The fats contained in the adipocytes can be put back into circulation, via the venous route, during intense effort or when there is a lack of energy-providing substances, and are then transformed into energy. The hypodermis participates, passively at least, in thermoregulation since fat is a heat insulator.\n\n==Functions==\nThe integumentary system has multiple roles in [[maintaining the body's equilibrium|homeostasis]]. All body systems work in an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential to the function of the body.  The skin has an important job of protecting the body and acts as the body's first line of defense against infection, temperature change, and other challenges to homeostasis. Functions include:\n\n*Protect the body's internal living [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s and organs\n*Protect against invasion by [[Infection|infectious]] organisms\n*Protect the body from [[dehydration]]\n*Protect the body against [[Weather|abrupt changes]] in [[temperature]], maintain [[homeostasis]]\n*Help [[Excretion|excrete]] waste materials through [[perspiration]]\n*Act as a receptor for touch, pressure, pain, heat, and cold (see [[Somatosensory system]])\n*Protect the body against [[sunburn]]s by secreting melanin\n*Generate [[vitamin D]] through exposure to [[ultraviolet]] [[light]]\n*Store [[water]], [[fat]], glucose, vitamin D\n*Maintenance of the body form\n*Formation of new cells from stratum germinativum to repair minor injuries\n*Protect from [[UV]] rays.\n*Regulates body temperature\n\nIt distinguishes, separates, and protects the organism from its surroundings. Small-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats [[Respiration (physiology)|respire]] using the outer layer (integument).

He was baptised at [[St Margaret Lothbury|St Margaret's Lothbury]], London on 25 March 1605.\n\nIn 1625 Jermyn was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]], and was re-elected MP for the seat in 1626.<ref name=Willis>{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229\u2013239}}</ref> He was MP for [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] in 1628. He won the favour of [[Henrietta Maria of France]], Queen consort of [[Charles I of England]] whose vice-chamberlain he became in 1628, and [[Master of the Horse]] in 1639.\n\nIn April 1640, Jermyn was elected MP for [[Corfe Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Corfe Castle]] in the [[Short Parliament]] together with his brother [[Thomas Jermyn (died 1659)|Thomas]].<ref name=Willis/> The brothers were both elected MPs for [[Bury St Edmunds]] in the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640 and were active and ardent [[Cavalier|Royalist]]s. Jermyn took a prominent part in the [[First Army Plot]] of 1641, and on its discovery fled to [[France]]. Returning to the [[Kingdom of England]] in 1643, he resumed his personal attendance on the queen. He was raised to the peerage as '''[[Baron Jermyn]]''' of St Edmundsbury on 6 September, ostensibly so that, should he fall into Parliamentarian hands, he would be beheaded, and not hanged, drawn and quartered. He accompanied [[Henrietta Maria]] in 1644 to France, where he continued to act as her secretary.\n\nAlso in 1643, Jermyn was made governor of [[Jersey]], whence he conducted the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] to [[Paris]]. When [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] went to [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]], Jermyn remained in Paris with Henrietta Maria, who persuaded her son to create him '''[[Earl of St Albans]]''' in 1660. Gossip which the historian [[Henry Hallam|Hallam]] accepted as authentic, but which is supported by no real evidence, asserted that Jermyn was secretly married to the widow of Charles I. It has further been rumoured that he may have been the true father of at least one of her children, even perhaps of Charles II himself: for example, the Domestic State Papers for 13 August 1660 contain a report by Capt. Francis Robinson of Nathaniel Angelo, a Windsor clergyman, asserting that 'all the royal children were Jermyn's bastards'.\n\nAt the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] St Albans became [[Lord Chamberlain]], and received other appointments. He supported the policy of friendship with France, and he contributed largely to the close secret understanding between Charles II and [[Louis XIV of France]],  arranging the preliminaries of the [[Treaty of Dover]] in 1669.\n[[File:Henry Jermyn, Earl of St Albans Green Plaque.jpg|thumb|City of Westminster Green Plaque for Henry Jermyn, Earl of St Albans (1605-1684), located in Duke of York Street, London SW1]]\nIn the early 1660s he obtained a grant of land in [[London]] north of [[St. James's Palace|St James's Palace]], building [[St. James's Square|St James's Square]] and its surrounding streets, including [[Jermyn Street]], and also St Albans market, on a site afterwards cleared for the construction of [[Regent Street]] and [[Waterloo Place]]. It was a grand design in itself, and from its inspiration grew the whole of the West End of London, so much so that the Survey of London (volume 29) acknowledges Henry Jermyn as the 'Father of the West End'.\n\nHe was a friend and patron of [[Abraham Cowley]] and [[Sir William Davenant]]. Although accused of having 'dissolute morals', he was really no more or less 'moral' than most other men of his time. He was  much addicted to [[gambling]], which was a very popular pastime in his era.\n\nSt Albans died in St James Square in January 1684.

After seeing her for the first time, Michael and his bodyguards inquire about her to Signor Vitelli, a local [[tavern]] keeper to try and find out who she is. After describing her in detail, Vitelli angrily says he does not know her and leaves. When Michael's bodyguards realize that the girl is Signor Vitelli's daughter, they both ask Michael to leave, but Michael, speaking through his bodyguard and interpreter Fabrizio, soon gains Signor Vitelli's respect by introducing himself and apologizing. Michael asks and receives Signor Vitelli's permission to court Apollonia under the [[Chaperone (social)|chaperonage]] of her family. After a brief [[courtship]], they are married.\n\nSoon afterward, however, Apollonia is killed by a [[car bomb]] intended for Michael. The attack was set up by Fabrizio, who had betrayed Michael to Corleone family enemies back in Michael's native New York City. In an unfortunate twist of fate, she unknowingly puts herself in danger when she tries to impress Michael by showing him that she taught herself how to drive, which was uncommon for Sicilian women. In the book, she is pregnant at the time of her death, but this detail is not specified in the film. The explosion is powerful enough to throw Michael off his feet and knock him unconscious. The local Mafia chieftain, Don Tommasino, an old friend of Michael's father Vito, moves Michael to a hospital. Michael regains consciousness a few days later, whereupon Don Tommasino informs Michael of his wife's death.

They marry and have two children. However, in ''The Godfather Part III'', Kay mentions Michael's first marriage when she and Michael visit Sicily together. Michael also tells his daughter [[Mary Corleone]] that she bears a resemblance to his first wife Apollonia.\n\nIn the novel, Michael avenges Apollonia's death. Fabrizio is found running a pizza parlor in Buffalo, New York under the alias of Fred Vincent. He is shot in the chest by an assassin who walks into the pizza parlor.

This scene was never released, although publicity photos were distributed of Al Pacino, who portrayed Michael, firing a shotgun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/media/rm645044224/nm0000199|title= Photos of Al Pacino|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/03/15/the-anniversary-you-cant-refuse-40-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-godfather/#deleted-scene-1-michael-shoots-his-wifes-killer|title=The Anniversary You Can't Refuse: 40 Things You Didn't Know About The Godfather - Deleted Scene No. 1: Michael Shoots His Wife\u2019s Killer|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Cruz, Gilbert|date=2012-03-15|accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> A scene was filmed for Part II in which Michael is informed that Fabrizio has been found.

When Sollozzo learns Corleone survived, he sends agents to the hospital for another attempt after he has Captain McCluskey ([[Sterling Hayden]]), a New York City police captain on Sollozzo's payroll, arrest Don Corleone's personal guards at the hospital and removes the police officers stationed outside the Don's hospital room. The assassination attempt fails after Vito's youngest son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] arrives, and finding all the guards gone, suspects another assassination attempt is about to happen. He moves his father to another room, then tricks the would-be assassins into believing guards are still protecting his father. Captain McCluskey arrives and confronts Michael, punching him and breaking his jaw. Hagen arrives shortly afterwards with guards legally licensed to carry weapons; McCluskey, unable to arrest them without raising suspicions, backs down and leaves.\n\nSoon after, Sollozzo seeks a meeting with Michael to resolve the hostilities, although at Michael's urging, the Corleones view this as an opportunity to kill Sollozzo, which would, of necessity, also involve killing McCluskey.  Michael successfully convinces [[Sonny Corleone]], [[Tom Hagen]] and other leaders of the Family that the usual strict [[Mafia]] prohibition against killing police for fear of bringing down the retribution of the authorities should not apply in this case, since McCluskey is \"a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop, a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him\" and says that this would be \"a terrific story\" to be given to newspaper people on the Corleone Family payroll after the fact.\n\nUnder McCluskey's personal protection, Sollozzo meets with Michael in a Bronx restaurant. Although Michael is frisked before the meeting, a revolver had been planted behind the overhead tank of a toilet in the restaurant's lavatory. (The Corleones were able to do this only because they found out in advance where the meeting would take place - because McCluskey was required by police regulations to leave an address where he could be reached that night and a cop in his precinct who was being paid off by the Corleones told Sonny where McCluskey would be that evening). Michael excuses himself to go to the bathroom, and retrieves the revolver. When he returns, he draws the gun and shoots Sollozzo in the forehead, killing him instantly, and kills McCluskey with two shots moments later.\n\nAlthough the double murder, including that of a police captain, brings an official crackdown on organized crime, the subsequent leak of information about McCluskey's criminal links to Sollozzo - as Michael correctly predicted - gets wide coverage in the newspapers and takes some of the heat off.\n\n===Johnny Ola===\nJohnny Ola is a fictional character in ''The Godfather Part II''. He is portrayed by [[Dominic Chianese]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20078/The-Godfather-Part-II/cast|title=The Godfather, Part II (1974)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref>\n\nJohnny Ola is a mobster and right-hand man to Jewish mobster [[Hyman Roth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/blog/2011/07/postscript_to_g.html|title=Postscript to G.D.

Ola is Sicilian but speaks American English with a New York accent. Ola is part of Roth's plan to assassinate [[Michael Corleone]] at his home at [[Lake Tahoe]], with unwitting help from Michael's brother [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]]. When Michael asks if Fredo and Johnny had ever met, they deny knowing each other. Later, however, Fredo carelessly reveals that he and Ola had visited a nightclub together in [[Havana]]. Michael overhears the conversation and realizes that Fredo is the traitor within the family. Michael sends his bodyguard Bussetta to kill Ola and Roth. Bussetta strangles Ola, but Roth gets away.\n\n===Carlo Rizzi===\n{{main|Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)}}\n\n=== Louie Russo ===\nLuigi \"Louie\" Russo is a fictional character in [[Mark Winegardner|Mark Winegardner's]] ''[[The Godfather Returns]]''. Russo serves as the Don of the [[Chicago Outfit]] from 1955 to 1961.\n\nLouie Russo and his brother, Willy, were 'made' under [[Al Capone]]. His brother was one of the men sent to kill [[Vito Corleone]] during the [[Castellammarese War]] (mentioned in ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''), although he was eventually killed by [[Luca Brasi]].\n\nRusso holds a grudge against the Corleones for years for his brother's death, at one point attempting (unsuccessfully) to have Vito's son [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] killed. After [[Michael Corleone]] becomes Don in 1955, however, Russo tricks him into believing that the bad blood between them is over. Under Russo, the Chicago mob expands into the New York area and interferes with the Corleones' [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] casinos. Russo unsuccessfully conspires with Vincent Forlenza and Nick Geraci to kill Michael Corleone, in the process indirectly duping Fredo into betraying his brother to [[Hyman Roth]].\n\nIn June 1961, he invites [[Tom Hagen]] to his supper club/gambling house in rural [[Illinois]] with the intention of killing him. He, Hagen, a rower, and two Russo ''[[Soldato|soldatos]]'' go out on a gondola in his man-made lake. On the course of the trip, as part of Michael's revenge, Hagen strangles one ''soldato'' while the rower hits Russo and the other ''soldato'' with his oar. Hagen then personally kills Russo on his boat, with Russo's own gun, and dumps the bodies in the lake.\n\nIn his appearances in ''The Godfather Returns'', Russo is portrayed as a cruel, vindictive man whose methods of retribution are particularly vicious, even by [[American Mafia|Mafia]] standards; in the sequel ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]'', Tom Hagen describes Russo as \"a sick man, in ways I don't like to think about.\" Following an assassination attempt years before, in which his eyes are permanently damaged, he wears large black sunglasses to shield them from the light. When he inadvertently shows his uncovered eyes to Tom Hagen after his glasses are knocked off, Hagen notes that they are red with a green ring in the middle. The novel reveals that Russo is estranged from his [[gay]] son, but still uses him as a source of information on [[The closet|closeted]] rivals for purposes of [[blackmail]] and gamesmanship with the other families.\n\n===Hyman Roth===\n{{main|Hyman Roth}}\n\n===Virgil Sollozzo===\nVirgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's novel ''The Godfather''. He is portrayed by [[Al Lettieri]] in the film adaptation of the same name.\n\nIn 1945, [[heroin]] kingpin Virgil Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his operation. Sollozzo is backed by the rival Tattaglia family, and wants Vito's political influence and legal protection. Vito declines, believing the politicians and judges on his payroll would turn against him if he engaged in [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. During the meeting, Sonny expresses interest in the deal. After the meeting, Vito castigates his son for letting an outsider know what he was thinking. During [[Christmas]], as Vito crosses a street to buy oranges from a vendor, Sollozzo's hitmen emerge with guns drawn. Vito runs for his [[Cadillac]], but is shot five times. Fredo, who had been accompanying Vito, drops his gun and is unable to return fire as the assassins escape.\n\nVito survives, and Sollozzo makes a second assassination attempt at the hospital. [[Captain McCluskey|Mark McCluskey]]\u2014a corrupt police captain on Sollozzo's payroll\u2014has removed Vito's bodyguards, leaving him unprotected. However, Michael arrives moments before the imminent attack. Realizing his father is in danger, Michael and a nurse move Vito to another room. Michael affirms his loyalty at Vito's bedside.\n\nWhile Vito recovers, Sonny serves as acting head of the family. Michael, knowing his father will never be safe while Sollozzo lives, convinces Sonny that he can murder Sollozzo and McCluskey. Michael kills both men and is smuggled to Sicily under the protection of Vito's friend and business partner Don Tommasino. The deaths of Sollozzo and McCluskey ignite a war between the Corleone and the Tattaglia families, with the other New York families backing the latter. After Sonny is killed by Barzini's men, Vito resumes control and brokers a peace accord among the families, during which he realizes that Barzini masterminded the attempt on his life and Sonny's murder.\n\n===Joey Zasa===\nJoey Zasa is a fictional character and antagonist appearing in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. He was portrayed by [[Joe Mantegna]]. He is based on a composite of three real [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] members: [[Joseph Colombo]], [[Joe Gallo]] and [[John Gotti]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Perrotta|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/who-is-joey-zasa-based-on|title=Q: Who is \"The Godfather: Part III\" character Joey Zasa based on?|website=Screenprism|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}M</ref>\n\nZasa is a longtime member of Corleone ''[[caporegime]]'' [[Peter Clemenza]]'s regime. Following the retirement of Ritchie Nobilio, who succeeded [[Frank Pentangeli]] ([[Michael V. Gazzo]]) after the events of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Zasa assumes control over the [[Corleone family]] business in [[New York City]] with approval from the [[The Commission (Mafia)|Commission]] and [[Michael Corleone]] ([[Al Pacino]]). Zasa is feared and, to a certain degree, respected among his peers in the New York underworld for his business acumen and utter ruthlessness. However, his flamboyance and hunger for publicity earns Michael's displeasure, especially during the 1970s when it attracts unwanted public attention to Michael's criminal past when he is attempting to rehabilitate his public image. Michael especially disapproves of Zasa's eagerness to enter the drug trade, and distances himself from him.\n\nIn ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', Zasa first appears at a reception honoring Michael. He gets into an argument with one of his soldiers, [[Vincent Mancini]] ([[Andy Garc\u00eda]]), the illegitimate son of [[Sonny Corleone]]. Zasa calls Vincent a bastard in Michael's presence, prompting the enraged young man to attack Zasa. Zasa subsequently hires two assassins to kill Vincent, but Vincent quickly kills both.\n\nLater in the film, Zasa participates in a plot to have Michael assassinated during a meeting with the various [[Don (mafia)|Don]]s in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. During the meeting, Michael insults Zasa, prompting him to storm out; moments later, a helicopter containing gunmen hovers above the room and guns down nearly everyone inside. Michael escapes, but nearly every other Don is killed.  The survivors make deals with Zasa. \n\nSeveral days later, Michael's sister Connie ([[Talia Shire]]) gives clearance for Vincent to kill Zasa before he can take another run at Michael.  Vincent assassinates Zasa in [[Bensonhurst]] during a street festival. Vincent's men and Michael's personal assassin [[Al Neri]] (disguised as members of the church procession) kill Zasa's bodyguards, while Vincent (disguised as an [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[mounted police|Mounted Patrol]] officer) shoots Zasa in the back three times as he attempts to escape.\n\n==Other characters==\n===Amerigo Bonasera===\nAmerigo Bonasera is a fictional character created by [[Mario Puzo]] who appears in his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[The Godfather|1972 film adaptation]]. Though he is not a major character, he plays a vital role in revealing the merciful side of main character [[Vito Corleone]]. The novel opens with the words: \"Amerigo Bonasera sat at New York Criminal Court...\". The film also starts with his famous line, \"I believe in America. America has made my fortune.\"\n\nBonasera is a proud [[Italian-American]] [[undertaker]] who tends to keep away from the [[Corleone family]], knowing they are involved with [[the Mafia]], though [[Carmella Corleone|Don Corleone's wife]] is a [[godparent|godmother]] to Bonasera's daughter. His daughter is brutally beaten by her boyfriend and his friend for refusing to have sex after they had plied her with whiskey. The men escape any serious penalty because they are from wealthy, politically connected families.\n\nDesperate, Bonasera decides to go to Don Corleone on the day of his daughter's wedding to ask him to kill the young men; according to tradition, a [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] never refuses a favor on the day of his daughter's wedding. His proposition angers Don Corleone, who reprimands him for asking for a favor without showing the proper respect, and for seeking the attackers' deaths when his daughter was alive and would recover. Nevertheless, Vito agrees to grant a favor in return for Bonasera's \"friendship\" and the respectful address of \"Godfather\". Vito Corleone also gently reprimands Bonasera for attempting to seek justice through the courts [[Omert\u00e0|instead of coming to him first]].\n\nVito hands the job to [[Peter Clemenza]] with explicit instructions that his men aren't to get \"carried away\" and accidentally kill anyone. The next evening, Paulie Gatto and two other members of his crew give the men a brutal beating that puts them in the hospital for months. Bonasera sends his thanks to Vito through Corleone family ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Tom Hagen]]. Though feeling safer now that he has Don Corleone on his side, Bonasera begins dreading the day Corleone asks him a favor; he has a nightmare of the Don ordering him to bury the bodies of two men he has just killed.\n\nLater in the film, Hagen calls on Bonasera to finally pay back the favor. Initially terrified, Bonasera is relieved when Vito Corleone comes to his funeral parlor with the corpse of his eldest son, [[Sonny Corleone]], who has been gunned down by the [[Barzini family]]. A heartbroken Vito merely requests that Bonasera repair the extensive physical damage so that Sonny's mother can have an open casket. Bonasera is seen one final time at Vito Corleone's funeral; the novel states he had fulfilled all obligations and satisfied their friendship by preparing Sonny's body for burial.\n\nIn the 1972 film, Bonasera is played by Salvatore Corsitto (1913\u20131999).\n\nIn [[The Godfather (2006 video game)|the 2006 video game adaptation]], [[Aldo Trapani]], instead of Clemenza, is ordered to punish the two perpetrators, who are found in the graveyard outside Bonasera's funeral home harassing Bonasera's daughter. He attacks the assailants, knocking them out and leaving one in an open grave.\n\n===Cardinal Lamberto===\n{{main|Cardinal Lamberto}}\n\n===Lucy Mancini===\nLucy Mancini is a fictional character in [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]''. She was portrayed by [[Jeannie Linero]] and appears in ''The Godfather'' and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20076/The-Godfather/cast|title=The Godfather (1972)|newspaper=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref> \n\nShe is one of the childhood friends of [[Vito Corleone]]'s children, particularly his daughter, [[Connie Corleone]]. She is the [[maid of honor]] at Connie's wedding. Lucy has sex with Vito's son [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] at the wedding and begins an extramarital affair with him. The novel and the films diverge in their treatments of Lucy's fate after Sonny's death.\n\nIn the novel, Lucy is a fairly important supporting character, with several chapters dedicated to her story.  After Sonny's death, Vito's ''[[consigliere]]'', [[Tom Hagen]] sends Lucy to [[Las Vegas]]. She is given a small interest (five and later ten \"points\") in one of the family's hotels, primarily so that she can keep an eye on Vito's middle son, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], who is learning the hotel and casino business. She also serves as a shareholder-of-record who has no criminal record: several such owners are necessary for a valid [[gaming license]]. On paper she is a millionaire, although she does not vote her shares in the casinos. Eventually, Lucy establishes a new life in Las Vegas, and becomes largely independent of the Corleone clan. She is lonely, however, and occasionally pines for Sonny: while never having loved him or even truly known him, she misses him as a lover, and cannot achieve sexual satisfaction with anyone else. That changes when she meets and falls in love with surgeon Dr. Jules Segal. He explains that her difficulty in reaching [[orgasm]] is caused by a [[Loose Vagina|loose vagina]], which commonly results from multiple childbirths. In Lucy's case, this appears to be [[congenital]] and can be remedied with simple vaginal surgery. After Segal's colleague in [[Los Angeles]] performs the surgery, Lucy is able to enjoy sex again, and she and Jules presumably are happily married.\n\nIn Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations, Lucy's role is minimal.  She is seen as a young woman in ''[[The Godfather]]'', but her character is not featured after Sonny's death. She makes no appearance in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', she is present in a manner inconsistent with her fate as described in ''The Godfather'' novel. Lucy is the mother of Sonny's illegitimate son, [[Vincent Corleone|Vincent]], who eventually succeeds [[Michael Corleone]] as the head of the Corleone crime family.  She appears briefly as a guest in the party scene at the beginning of the film when Michael invites Vincent to join the family for a group photo. In Puzo's original novel, Sonny does not impregnate her.\n\n===Danny Shea===\n{{main|Danny Shea (The Godfather)}}\n\n===Mickey Shea===\n{{main|Mickey Shea}}\n\n===Billy Van Arsdale===\n{{main|Billy Van Arsdale}}\n\n===Aldo Trapani===\n{{main|Aldo Trapani}}\n\n===Albert Volpe===\n{{main|Albert Volpe}}\n\n==The Five Families==\nThe Five Families are five major Mafia [[Crime family|crime families]] in the novel and film ''[[The Godfather]]''.

The attack was set up by Fabrizio, who had betrayed Michael to Corleone family enemies back in Michael's native New York City. In an unfortunate twist of fate, she unknowingly puts herself in danger when she tries to impress Michael by showing him that she taught herself how to drive, which was uncommon for Sicilian women. In the book, she is pregnant at the time of her death, but this detail is not specified in the film. The explosion is powerful enough to throw Michael off his feet and knock him unconscious. The local Mafia chieftain, Don Tommasino, an old friend of Michael's father Vito, moves Michael to a hospital. Michael regains consciousness a few days later, whereupon Don Tommasino informs Michael of his wife's death. After returning to the United States, Michael reconnects with his previous girlfriend, Kay Adams, but does not tell her that he had been married while he was living in Sicily. They marry and have two children. However, in ''The Godfather Part III'', Kay mentions Michael's first marriage when she and Michael visit Sicily together. Michael also tells his daughter [[Mary Corleone]] that she bears a resemblance to his first wife Apollonia.\n\nIn the novel, Michael avenges Apollonia's death. Fabrizio is found running a pizza parlor in Buffalo, New York under the alias of Fred Vincent. He is shot in the chest by an assassin who walks into the pizza parlor. The assassin then tells him \"Michael Corleone sends his regards\", before shooting him again in the head. In a deleted scene from the film's script, Michael himself kills Fabrizio with a shotgun. This scene was never released, although publicity photos were distributed of Al Pacino, who portrayed Michael, firing a shotgun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/media/rm645044224/nm0000199|title= Photos of Al Pacino|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/03/15/the-anniversary-you-cant-refuse-40-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-godfather/#deleted-scene-1-michael-shoots-his-wifes-killer|title=The Anniversary You Can't Refuse: 40 Things You Didn't Know About The Godfather - Deleted Scene No. 1: Michael Shoots His Wife\u2019s Killer|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Cruz, Gilbert|date=2012-03-15|accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> A scene was filmed for Part II in which Michael is informed that Fabrizio has been found.

When Sollozzo learns Corleone survived, he sends agents to the hospital for another attempt after he has Captain McCluskey ([[Sterling Hayden]]), a New York City police captain on Sollozzo's payroll, arrest Don Corleone's personal guards at the hospital and removes the police officers stationed outside the Don's hospital room. The assassination attempt fails after Vito's youngest son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] arrives, and finding all the guards gone, suspects another assassination attempt is about to happen. He moves his father to another room, then tricks the would-be assassins into believing guards are still protecting his father. Captain McCluskey arrives and confronts Michael, punching him and breaking his jaw. Hagen arrives shortly afterwards with guards legally licensed to carry weapons; McCluskey, unable to arrest them without raising suspicions, backs down and leaves.\n\nSoon after, Sollozzo seeks a meeting with Michael to resolve the hostilities, although at Michael's urging, the Corleones view this as an opportunity to kill Sollozzo, which would, of necessity, also involve killing McCluskey.  Michael successfully convinces [[Sonny Corleone]], [[Tom Hagen]] and other leaders of the Family that the usual strict [[Mafia]] prohibition against killing police for fear of bringing down the retribution of the authorities should not apply in this case, since McCluskey is \"a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop, a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him\" and says that this would be \"a terrific story\" to be given to newspaper people on the Corleone Family payroll after the fact.\n\nUnder McCluskey's personal protection, Sollozzo meets with Michael in a Bronx restaurant. Although Michael is frisked before the meeting, a revolver had been planted behind the overhead tank of a toilet in the restaurant's lavatory. (The Corleones were able to do this only because they found out in advance where the meeting would take place - because McCluskey was required by police regulations to leave an address where he could be reached that night and a cop in his precinct who was being paid off by the Corleones told Sonny where McCluskey would be that evening). Michael excuses himself to go to the bathroom, and retrieves the revolver. When he returns, he draws the gun and shoots Sollozzo in the forehead, killing him instantly, and kills McCluskey with two shots moments later.\n\nAlthough the double murder, including that of a police captain, brings an official crackdown on organized crime, the subsequent leak of information about McCluskey's criminal links to Sollozzo - as Michael correctly predicted - gets wide coverage in the newspapers and takes some of the heat off.\n\n===Johnny Ola===\nJohnny Ola is a fictional character in ''The Godfather Part II''. He is portrayed by [[Dominic Chianese]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20078/The-Godfather-Part-II/cast|title=The Godfather, Part II (1974)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref>\n\nJohnny Ola is a mobster and right-hand man to Jewish mobster [[Hyman Roth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/blog/2011/07/postscript_to_g.html|title=Postscript to G.D.

Ola is Sicilian but speaks American English with a New York accent. Ola is part of Roth's plan to assassinate [[Michael Corleone]] at his home at [[Lake Tahoe]], with unwitting help from Michael's brother [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]]. When Michael asks if Fredo and Johnny had ever met, they deny knowing each other. Later, however, Fredo carelessly reveals that he and Ola had visited a nightclub together in [[Havana]]. Michael overhears the conversation and realizes that Fredo is the traitor within the family. Michael sends his bodyguard Bussetta to kill Ola and Roth. Bussetta strangles Ola, but Roth gets away.\n\n===Carlo Rizzi===\n{{main|Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)}}\n\n=== Louie Russo ===\nLuigi \"Louie\" Russo is a fictional character in [[Mark Winegardner|Mark Winegardner's]] ''[[The Godfather Returns]]''. Russo serves as the Don of the [[Chicago Outfit]] from 1955 to 1961.\n\nLouie Russo and his brother, Willy, were 'made' under [[Al Capone]]. His brother was one of the men sent to kill [[Vito Corleone]] during the [[Castellammarese War]] (mentioned in ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''), although he was eventually killed by [[Luca Brasi]].\n\nRusso holds a grudge against the Corleones for years for his brother's death, at one point attempting (unsuccessfully) to have Vito's son [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] killed. After [[Michael Corleone]] becomes Don in 1955, however, Russo tricks him into believing that the bad blood between them is over. Under Russo, the Chicago mob expands into the New York area and interferes with the Corleones' [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] casinos. Russo unsuccessfully conspires with Vincent Forlenza and Nick Geraci to kill Michael Corleone, in the process indirectly duping Fredo into betraying his brother to [[Hyman Roth]].\n\nIn June 1961, he invites [[Tom Hagen]] to his supper club/gambling house in rural [[Illinois]] with the intention of killing him. He, Hagen, a rower, and two Russo ''[[Soldato|soldatos]]'' go out on a gondola in his man-made lake. On the course of the trip, as part of Michael's revenge, Hagen strangles one ''soldato'' while the rower hits Russo and the other ''soldato'' with his oar. Hagen then personally kills Russo on his boat, with Russo's own gun, and dumps the bodies in the lake.\n\nIn his appearances in ''The Godfather Returns'', Russo is portrayed as a cruel, vindictive man whose methods of retribution are particularly vicious, even by [[American Mafia|Mafia]] standards; in the sequel ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]'', Tom Hagen describes Russo as \"a sick man, in ways I don't like to think about.\" Following an assassination attempt years before, in which his eyes are permanently damaged, he wears large black sunglasses to shield them from the light. When he inadvertently shows his uncovered eyes to Tom Hagen after his glasses are knocked off, Hagen notes that they are red with a green ring in the middle. The novel reveals that Russo is estranged from his [[gay]] son, but still uses him as a source of information on [[The closet|closeted]] rivals for purposes of [[blackmail]] and gamesmanship with the other families.\n\n===Hyman Roth===\n{{main|Hyman Roth}}\n\n===Virgil Sollozzo===\nVirgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's novel ''The Godfather''. He is portrayed by [[Al Lettieri]] in the film adaptation of the same name.\n\nIn 1945, [[heroin]] kingpin Virgil Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his operation. Sollozzo is backed by the rival Tattaglia family, and wants Vito's political influence and legal protection. Vito declines, believing the politicians and judges on his payroll would turn against him if he engaged in [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. During the meeting, Sonny expresses interest in the deal. After the meeting, Vito castigates his son for letting an outsider know what he was thinking. During [[Christmas]], as Vito crosses a street to buy oranges from a vendor, Sollozzo's hitmen emerge with guns drawn. Vito runs for his [[Cadillac]], but is shot five times. Fredo, who had been accompanying Vito, drops his gun and is unable to return fire as the assassins escape.\n\nVito survives, and Sollozzo makes a second assassination attempt at the hospital. [[Captain McCluskey|Mark McCluskey]]\u2014a corrupt police captain on Sollozzo's payroll\u2014has removed Vito's bodyguards, leaving him unprotected. However, Michael arrives moments before the imminent attack. Realizing his father is in danger, Michael and a nurse move Vito to another room. Michael affirms his loyalty at Vito's bedside.\n\nWhile Vito recovers, Sonny serves as acting head of the family. Michael, knowing his father will never be safe while Sollozzo lives, convinces Sonny that he can murder Sollozzo and McCluskey. Michael kills both men and is smuggled to Sicily under the protection of Vito's friend and business partner Don Tommasino. The deaths of Sollozzo and McCluskey ignite a war between the Corleone and the Tattaglia families, with the other New York families backing the latter. After Sonny is killed by Barzini's men, Vito resumes control and brokers a peace accord among the families, during which he realizes that Barzini masterminded the attempt on his life and Sonny's murder.\n\n===Joey Zasa===\nJoey Zasa is a fictional character and antagonist appearing in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. He was portrayed by [[Joe Mantegna]]. He is based on a composite of three real [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] members: [[Joseph Colombo]], [[Joe Gallo]] and [[John Gotti]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Perrotta|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/who-is-joey-zasa-based-on|title=Q: Who is \"The Godfather: Part III\" character Joey Zasa based on?|website=Screenprism|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}M</ref>\n\nZasa is a longtime member of Corleone ''[[caporegime]]'' [[Peter Clemenza]]'s regime. Following the retirement of Ritchie Nobilio, who succeeded [[Frank Pentangeli]] ([[Michael V. Gazzo]]) after the events of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Zasa assumes control over the [[Corleone family]] business in [[New York City]] with approval from the [[The Commission (Mafia)|Commission]] and [[Michael Corleone]] ([[Al Pacino]]). Zasa is feared and, to a certain degree, respected among his peers in the New York underworld for his business acumen and utter ruthlessness. However, his flamboyance and hunger for publicity earns Michael's displeasure, especially during the 1970s when it attracts unwanted public attention to Michael's criminal past when he is attempting to rehabilitate his public image. Michael especially disapproves of Zasa's eagerness to enter the drug trade, and distances himself from him.\n\nIn ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', Zasa first appears at a reception honoring Michael. He gets into an argument with one of his soldiers, [[Vincent Mancini]] ([[Andy Garc\u00eda]]), the illegitimate son of [[Sonny Corleone]]. Zasa calls Vincent a bastard in Michael's presence, prompting the enraged young man to attack Zasa. Zasa subsequently hires two assassins to kill Vincent, but Vincent quickly kills both.\n\nLater in the film, Zasa participates in a plot to have Michael assassinated during a meeting with the various [[Don (mafia)|Don]]s in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. During the meeting, Michael insults Zasa, prompting him to storm out; moments later, a helicopter containing gunmen hovers above the room and guns down nearly everyone inside. Michael escapes, but nearly every other Don is killed.  The survivors make deals with Zasa. \n\nSeveral days later, Michael's sister Connie ([[Talia Shire]]) gives clearance for Vincent to kill Zasa before he can take another run at Michael.  Vincent assassinates Zasa in [[Bensonhurst]] during a street festival. Vincent's men and Michael's personal assassin [[Al Neri]] (disguised as members of the church procession) kill Zasa's bodyguards, while Vincent (disguised as an [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[mounted police|Mounted Patrol]] officer) shoots Zasa in the back three times as he attempts to escape.\n\n==Other characters==\n===Amerigo Bonasera===\nAmerigo Bonasera is a fictional character created by [[Mario Puzo]] who appears in his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[The Godfather|1972 film adaptation]]. Though he is not a major character, he plays a vital role in revealing the merciful side of main character [[Vito Corleone]]. The novel opens with the words: \"Amerigo Bonasera sat at New York Criminal Court...\". The film also starts with his famous line, \"I believe in America. America has made my fortune.\"\n\nBonasera is a proud [[Italian-American]] [[undertaker]] who tends to keep away from the [[Corleone family]], knowing they are involved with [[the Mafia]], though [[Carmella Corleone|Don Corleone's wife]] is a [[godparent|godmother]] to Bonasera's daughter. His daughter is brutally beaten by her boyfriend and his friend for refusing to have sex after they had plied her with whiskey. The men escape any serious penalty because they are from wealthy, politically connected families.\n\nDesperate, Bonasera decides to go to Don Corleone on the day of his daughter's wedding to ask him to kill the young men; according to tradition, a [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] never refuses a favor on the day of his daughter's wedding. His proposition angers Don Corleone, who reprimands him for asking for a favor without showing the proper respect, and for seeking the attackers' deaths when his daughter was alive and would recover. Nevertheless, Vito agrees to grant a favor in return for Bonasera's \"friendship\" and the respectful address of \"Godfather\". Vito Corleone also gently reprimands Bonasera for attempting to seek justice through the courts [[Omert\u00e0|instead of coming to him first]].\n\nVito hands the job to [[Peter Clemenza]] with explicit instructions that his men aren't to get \"carried away\" and accidentally kill anyone. The next evening, Paulie Gatto and two other members of his crew give the men a brutal beating that puts them in the hospital for months. Bonasera sends his thanks to Vito through Corleone family ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Tom Hagen]]. Though feeling safer now that he has Don Corleone on his side, Bonasera begins dreading the day Corleone asks him a favor; he has a nightmare of the Don ordering him to bury the bodies of two men he has just killed.\n\nLater in the film, Hagen calls on Bonasera to finally pay back the favor. Initially terrified, Bonasera is relieved when Vito Corleone comes to his funeral parlor with the corpse of his eldest son, [[Sonny Corleone]], who has been gunned down by the [[Barzini family]]. A heartbroken Vito merely requests that Bonasera repair the extensive physical damage so that Sonny's mother can have an open casket. Bonasera is seen one final time at Vito Corleone's funeral; the novel states he had fulfilled all obligations and satisfied their friendship by preparing Sonny's body for burial.\n\nIn the 1972 film, Bonasera is played by Salvatore Corsitto (1913\u20131999).\n\nIn [[The Godfather (2006 video game)|the 2006 video game adaptation]], [[Aldo Trapani]], instead of Clemenza, is ordered to punish the two perpetrators, who are found in the graveyard outside Bonasera's funeral home harassing Bonasera's daughter. He attacks the assailants, knocking them out and leaving one in an open grave.\n\n===Cardinal Lamberto===\n{{main|Cardinal Lamberto}}\n\n===Lucy Mancini===\nLucy Mancini is a fictional character in [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]''. She was portrayed by [[Jeannie Linero]] and appears in ''The Godfather'' and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20076/The-Godfather/cast|title=The Godfather (1972)|newspaper=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref> \n\nShe is one of the childhood friends of [[Vito Corleone]]'s children, particularly his daughter, [[Connie Corleone]]. She is the [[maid of honor]] at Connie's wedding. Lucy has sex with Vito's son [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] at the wedding and begins an extramarital affair with him. The novel and the films diverge in their treatments of Lucy's fate after Sonny's death.\n\nIn the novel, Lucy is a fairly important supporting character, with several chapters dedicated to her story.  After Sonny's death, Vito's ''[[consigliere]]'', [[Tom Hagen]] sends Lucy to [[Las Vegas]]. She is given a small interest (five and later ten \"points\") in one of the family's hotels, primarily so that she can keep an eye on Vito's middle son, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], who is learning the hotel and casino business. She also serves as a shareholder-of-record who has no criminal record: several such owners are necessary for a valid [[gaming license]]. On paper she is a millionaire, although she does not vote her shares in the casinos. Eventually, Lucy establishes a new life in Las Vegas, and becomes largely independent of the Corleone clan. She is lonely, however, and occasionally pines for Sonny: while never having loved him or even truly known him, she misses him as a lover, and cannot achieve sexual satisfaction with anyone else. That changes when she meets and falls in love with surgeon Dr. Jules Segal. He explains that her difficulty in reaching [[orgasm]] is caused by a [[Loose Vagina|loose vagina]], which commonly results from multiple childbirths. In Lucy's case, this appears to be [[congenital]] and can be remedied with simple vaginal surgery. After Segal's colleague in [[Los Angeles]] performs the surgery, Lucy is able to enjoy sex again, and she and Jules presumably are happily married.\n\nIn Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations, Lucy's role is minimal.  She is seen as a young woman in ''[[The Godfather]]'', but her character is not featured after Sonny's death. She makes no appearance in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', she is present in a manner inconsistent with her fate as described in ''The Godfather'' novel. Lucy is the mother of Sonny's illegitimate son, [[Vincent Corleone|Vincent]], who eventually succeeds [[Michael Corleone]] as the head of the Corleone crime family.  She appears briefly as a guest in the party scene at the beginning of the film when Michael invites Vincent to join the family for a group photo. In Puzo's original novel, Sonny does not impregnate her.\n\n===Danny Shea===\n{{main|Danny Shea (The Godfather)}}\n\n===Mickey Shea===\n{{main|Mickey Shea}}\n\n===Billy Van Arsdale===\n{{main|Billy Van Arsdale}}\n\n===Aldo Trapani===\n{{main|Aldo Trapani}}\n\n===Albert Volpe===\n{{main|Albert Volpe}}\n\n==The Five Families==\nThe Five Families are five major Mafia [[Crime family|crime families]] in the novel and film ''[[The Godfather]]''.

Incubators are coldly logical, with emotion considered an illness, so Madoka can understand the process. Desperately clinging to the hope that there may still be a way to save Sayaka, Ky\u014dko asks Madoka to help her try to reach Sayaka's human feelings and to obtain her Soul Gem from the witch. As the two enter the portal to confront the witch, Ky\u014dko takes the majority of its attacks while Madoka tries to reach Sayaka with words. However, when Sayaka ends up attacking Madoka as well, Ky\u014dko has Homura get Madoka to safety while she sacrifices herself to destroy Sayaka. Kyubey, who knew there was no way of saving Sayaka, taunts Homura and says that with Ky\u014dko gone she will not be able to stop Walpurgisnacht without Madoka becoming a magical girl.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = I Won't Rely on Anyone Anymore\n| TranslitTitle       = M\u014d Dare ni mo Tayoranai\n| NativeTitle         = \u3082\u3046\u8ab0\u306b\u3082\u983c\u3089\u306a\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Y\u016bki Yase\n| Aux1                = Kuroe Mura\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|11}}<ref name=\"WN-March\">{{cite web|url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/68 |script-title=ja:\u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973\u307e\u3069\u304b\u2606\u30de\u30ae\u30ab |publisher=Web Newtype |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x5BBQR3L?url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/68 |archivedate=March 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = The episode looks at an alternate timeline in which Homura is a shy transfer student who makes friends with the cheerful Madoka. Lacking confidence in herself as she had been in hospital for the past six months, Homura is attacked by a witch but is rescued by Madoka and Mami, both of whom are magical girls. When both Madoka and Mami are killed in the battle against Walpurgisnacht, Homura makes a contract with Kyubey to send her back in time so that she can protect Madoka. She joins Madoka and Mami and learns how to use her magical powers for combat, stopping time whilst using stolen firearms and explosives. However, after the battle against Walpurgisnacht, Homura witnesses Madoka transforming into a witch and realizes Kyubey had been deceiving everyone. She attempts to tell the others during the next time loop, but they do not believe her until Sayaka becomes a witch and the remaining magical girls are forced to kill her. After the battle, Mami kills Ky\u014dko and turns her gun on Homura in an attempt to prevent them from becoming witches. Madoka stops Mami with deadly force, leaving just her and Homura to face Walpurgisnacht. With their Soul Gems depleted, Madoka uses her last Grief Seed on Homura, begging her to return to the past to keep her from being fooled by Kyubey. She then asks Homura to kill her before she turns into a witch. Returning to the past with a colder personality, Homura attempts to keep Kyubey from making contact with Madoka in the first place and decides to fight against the witches herself. This ultimately fails and she continues to travel through multiple timelines in the hope of saving Madoka.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = The Only Thing I Have Left to Guide Me\n| TranslitTitle       = Saigo ni Nokotta Michishirube\n| NativeTitle         = \u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u6b8b\u3063\u305f\u9053\u3057\u308b\u3079\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Kotono Watanabe\n| Aux1                = [[Buriki]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|4|21}}<ref name=\"madokaresume\" />\n| ShortSummary        = Kyubey reveals to Homura that the reason Madoka has the potential to become such a powerful witch is because Homura's constant trips through time to try and save Madoka have resulted in her becoming the centerpoint of countless timelines, as the potential of a magical girl is determined by the relative effect of their role on fate. After Sayaka's funeral, Kyubey shows Madoka the history of magical girls and how it has shaped civilization, causing extreme distress to Madoka. Madoka's mother, Junko, grows concerned about her and feels her daughter is hiding something from her. Madoka goes to see Homura who unconvincingly reassures her that she can handle Walpurgisnacht and finally reveals the truth about herself. As a storm hits the city and the citizens take shelter, Homura stands alone to face Walpurgisnacht, but despite her best efforts she is overwhelmed and is eventually defeated. When Madoka hears from Kyubey that Homura may turn into a witch if the latter loses hope of saving her, Madoka prepares to go and find her. Although Junko tries to stop her, Madoka convinces her that she is doing what she believes is the right thing. As Homura begins to lose hope and is on the verge of becoming a witch, Madoka arrives with Kyubey, announcing that she plans to make her wish.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = My Very Best Friend\n| TranslitTitle       = Watashi no, Saik\u014d no Tomodachi\n| NativeTitle         = \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u3001\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u53cb\u9054\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Yukihiro Miyamoto\n| Aux1                = [[Ume Aoki]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|4|21}}<ref name=\"madokaresume\" />\n| ShortSummary        = Madoka makes the decision to become a magical girl and wishes to prevent all witches from coming into existence.

Later that day Madoka joins Sayaka on patrol, where they find a witch's familiar, but it escapes when Sayaka's attacks are blocked by Ky\u014dko, who only cares about collecting Grief Seeds from mature witches. Ky\u014dko's selfishness angers Sayaka, and the two magical girls clash violently, with Madoka unable to do anything to stop them.

Before the battle can begin Madoka arrives and throws Sayaka's Soul Gem, the source of her magic energy, off the bridge in the hope of stopping the fight. Sayaka suddenly drops lifeless, shocking both Madoka and Ky\u014dko. Kyubey reveals that as part of the contract, the Soul Gem literally contains the magical girl's soul, while their body is a shell that can only be controlled within 100 metres of the Soul Gem.

The next day, Madoka asks Homura about the meaning behind Kyubey's actions and why she never told them. Ky\u014dko talks with Sayaka, taking her to a church which belonged to her father before he was excommunicated for his controversial beliefs. She explains how she made a contract with Kyubey so that people would listen to her father's sermons, but when he found out about her wish he broke down and killed himself and his family, leaving Ky\u014dko alone. Sayaka apologizes to Ky\u014dko but refuses to listen to her advice to live for herself. The next day, Ky\u014dsuke returns to school, but Sayaka avoids talking to him. Hitomi confronts her about it and reveals she is also in love with Ky\u014dsuke, giving Sayaka one day to confess to him before she does. Sayaka breaks down in front of Madoka, believing that she can never be with Ky\u014dsuke as she feels she is no longer human.

Sayaka does not return home that night and just watches as Hitomi confesses to Ky\u014dsuke the next day, sending her further into despair. Homura approaches her and tries to offer a Grief Seed, but Sayaka rejects it again as she does not trust her. Homura prepares to kill Sayaka to spare Madoka from the suffering of watching Sayaka's downfall, but Ky\u014dko intervenes, helping Sayaka escape. Kyubey coerces Madoka into making a wish to save Sayaka, but Homura shoots him before she can do so. She breaks down before Madoka and tells her not to be so self-sacrificing.

Ky\u014dko finds Sayaka, who is implied to have just killed two men on the train. Sayaka admits her stupidity before her Soul Gem, which has turned completely dark, shatters, and transforms into a Grief Seed. Elsewhere, Kyubey muses that as a \"woman\" who has yet to mature is called a \"girl\", it follows that \"magical girl\" (\u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973) is an equalivalent term to \"witch\" (\u9b54\u5973).\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 09\n| Title               = I'd Never Allow That to Happen\n| TranslitTitle       = Sonna no, Atashi ga Yurusanai\n| NativeTitle         = \u305d\u3093\u306a\u306e\u3001\u3042\u305f\u3057\u304c\u8a31\u3055\u306a\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Masahiro Mukai\n| Aux1                = Namaniku ATK\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|4}}<ref name=\"ANC-February\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = As a witch appears before Ky\u014dko, Homura arrives and uses her time manipulation to help Ky\u014dko escape, bringing Sayaka's body to Madoka. Homura reveals that the witch was actually Sayaka, whose Soul Gem had transformed into a Grief Seed as a result of becoming too tainted with despair. Later that night Kyubey appears before Madoka again explaining that his race, known as Incubators, choose girls in their teens and raise them to become witches in order to obtain powerful energy from the transition from hope to despair in an effort to prevent the [[heat death of the universe]]. Incubators are coldly logical, with emotion considered an illness, so Madoka can understand the process. Desperately clinging to the hope that there may still be a way to save Sayaka, Ky\u014dko asks Madoka to help her try to reach Sayaka's human feelings and to obtain her Soul Gem from the witch. As the two enter the portal to confront the witch, Ky\u014dko takes the majority of its attacks while Madoka tries to reach Sayaka with words. However, when Sayaka ends up attacking Madoka as well, Ky\u014dko has Homura get Madoka to safety while she sacrifices herself to destroy Sayaka.

Lacking confidence in herself as she had been in hospital for the past six months, Homura is attacked by a witch but is rescued by Madoka and Mami, both of whom are magical girls. When both Madoka and Mami are killed in the battle against Walpurgisnacht, Homura makes a contract with Kyubey to send her back in time so that she can protect Madoka. She joins Madoka and Mami and learns how to use her magical powers for combat, stopping time whilst using stolen firearms and explosives. However, after the battle against Walpurgisnacht, Homura witnesses Madoka transforming into a witch and realizes Kyubey had been deceiving everyone. She attempts to tell the others during the next time loop, but they do not believe her until Sayaka becomes a witch and the remaining magical girls are forced to kill her. After the battle, Mami kills Ky\u014dko and turns her gun on Homura in an attempt to prevent them from becoming witches. Madoka stops Mami with deadly force, leaving just her and Homura to face Walpurgisnacht. With their Soul Gems depleted, Madoka uses her last Grief Seed on Homura, begging her to return to the past to keep her from being fooled by Kyubey. She then asks Homura to kill her before she turns into a witch. Returning to the past with a colder personality, Homura attempts to keep Kyubey from making contact with Madoka in the first place and decides to fight against the witches herself. This ultimately fails and she continues to travel through multiple timelines in the hope of saving Madoka.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = The Only Thing I Have Left to Guide Me\n| TranslitTitle       = Saigo ni Nokotta Michishirube\n| NativeTitle         = \u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u6b8b\u3063\u305f\u9053\u3057\u308b\u3079\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Kotono Watanabe\n| Aux1                = [[Buriki]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|4|21}}<ref name=\"madokaresume\" />\n| ShortSummary        = Kyubey reveals to Homura that the reason Madoka has the potential to become such a powerful witch is because Homura's constant trips through time to try and save Madoka have resulted in her becoming the centerpoint of countless timelines, as the potential of a magical girl is determined by the relative effect of their role on fate. After Sayaka's funeral, Kyubey shows Madoka the history of magical girls and how it has shaped civilization, causing extreme distress to Madoka. Madoka's mother, Junko, grows concerned about her and feels her daughter is hiding something from her. Madoka goes to see Homura who unconvincingly reassures her that she can handle Walpurgisnacht and finally reveals the truth about herself. As a storm hits the city and the citizens take shelter, Homura stands alone to face Walpurgisnacht, but despite her best efforts she is overwhelmed and is eventually defeated. When Madoka hears from Kyubey that Homura may turn into a witch if the latter loses hope of saving her, Madoka prepares to go and find her. Although Junko tries to stop her, Madoka convinces her that she is doing what she believes is the right thing. As Homura begins to lose hope and is on the verge of becoming a witch, Madoka arrives with Kyubey, announcing that she plans to make her wish.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = My Very Best Friend\n| TranslitTitle       = Watashi no, Saik\u014d no Tomodachi\n| NativeTitle         = \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u3001\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u53cb\u9054\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Yukihiro Miyamoto\n| Aux1                = [[Ume Aoki]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|4|21}}<ref name=\"madokaresume\" />\n| ShortSummary        = Madoka makes the decision to become a magical girl and wishes to prevent all witches from coming into existence.
