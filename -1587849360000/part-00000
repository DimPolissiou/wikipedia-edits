She was the daughter of the novelist and lyricist [[Archibald Thomas Pechey]] and Bijou Sortain Hancock.\n\nCradock was born at her maternal grandparents' house, 33 Fairlop Road, Leytonstone. The birth was formally registered in London, in the district of [[West Ham]].<ref>GRO Register of Births: June Qtr, 1909, Phyllis Nan S. Pechey, at W. Ham, vol 4a, page 369</ref>\n\nAs a child, Cradock lived with her family at Fairlop Road, with her maternal grandparents. A plaque (with her name misspelled) can be found at Fairwood Court, Fairlop Road, London E11: \"Fanny Craddock 1909\u20131994. On this site until 1930 stood a house called Apthorp, birthplace of the famous TV cookery expert Fanny Craddock; born Phyllis Pechey.\"\n\nHer birthplace was named after Apthorp Villa, in Weston, Somerset, where her grandfather Charles Hancock had been born. Cradock's parents did not manage their money well; her mother, Bijou, spent extravagantly, and her father, Archibald, had sizeable gambling debts, many run up in [[Nice]]. In attempting to keep their creditors at bay, the family moved around the country, going to [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] in Kent, then to [[Swanage]] in Dorset and on to [[Bournemouth]] in [[Dorset]], where Archibald's brother, Richard Francis Pechey (1872\u20131963), had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1912.<ref>Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1923, page 1173-74</ref> Whilst in Bournemouth the 15-year-old Fanny attended Bournemouth High School (now Talbot Heath School).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/snapshotsofthepast/8489059.Bournemouth__a_town_with_so_much_character_/ |title=Bournemouth: a town with so much character! (From Bournemouth Echo) |publisher=Bournemouthecho.co.uk |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nArchibald moved the family again to [[Wroxham]] in Norfolk, c. 1927, where his creditors caught up with him and by 1930 he was appearing in Norfolk's bankruptcy court faced with debts of \u00a33,500. Cradock began the next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling cleaning products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop.\n\n==Culinary career==\nCradock's fortunes began to change when she started work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of [[Auguste Escoffier]]. She later wrote passionately about the change from ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' to ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.\n\nFanny and Johnnie Cradock began writing a column under the pen name of \"Bon Viveur\"<ref>The Cradocks were still using this byline at the end of their ''Telegraph'' career (Daily Telegraph Cooks' Book, London, W. H. Allen, 1978 {{ISBN|0-491-02472-X}}</ref> which appeared in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1950 to 1955. This sparked a theatre career, with the pair turning theatres into restaurants. Cradock would cook vast dishes that were served to the audience. They became known for their roast turkey, complete with stuffed head, tail feathers and wings. Complete with French accents, their act was one of a drunken hen-pecked husband and a domineering wife. At this time, they were known as Major and Mrs Cradock. She also wrote books under the names Frances Dale, Bon Viveur, Susan Leigh and Phyllis Cradock.\n\n==TV personality==\nIn 1955 Cradock recorded a pilot for what became a very successful [[BBC]] television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving a detailed account of every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, \"You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now.\" Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included \"This won't break you\", \"This is perfectly economical\", and \"This won't stretch your purse\". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying \"But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4JFoyshIAM |title=Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas- Christmas Cakes part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs time went by, however, her food began to seem outdated, with her love of the [[piping bag]] and [[food coloring|vegetable dyes]]. As she grew older, she applied more and more make-up and wore vast [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] ballgowns on screen. Cradock had always included relatives and friends in her television shows. Johnnie suffered a minor heart attack in the early 1970s and was replaced with the daughter of a friend, Jayne. Another assistant was Sarah, and there was a series of young men who didn't last very long.\nThroughout her television career the Cradocks also worked for the British Gas Council, appearing at trade shows such as the Ideal Home Exhibition and making many \"infomercials,\" instructing cooks, usually newlywed women, on how to use gas cookers for basic dishes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T89IoUN43s |title=Kitchen Magic - Fanny Cradock (1963) Gas Council film NEW TRANSFER |publisher=YouTube |date=24 January 2015 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Despite the BBC's ban on advertising, Cradock used only gas stoves in her television shows and often stated that she \"hated\" electric stoves and ovens.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6i4IdtC4w |title=Fanny Cradock on TV-am \u2013 1985 |publisher=YouTube |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nHer series ''Fanny Cradock Cooks for Christmas'' is the only one of several she made to have survived in the TV archives and to have been repeated in recent years, on the UK digital television channels [[BBC4]], [[Good Food]] and [[Food Network|Food Network UK]], usually in the run-up to Christmas.

Troake was to organise a three-course Foyle's Literary Lunch at the Devonshire Hotel in honour of the former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], with [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and other dignitaries in attendance, and asked Fanny Cradock, by then a [[tax exile]] in Ireland, along with chef Eugene Kaufeler, actor and gourmet [[Robert Morley]], nutritionist Magnus Pyke and many other experts Troake admired to advise her.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/18e2f08ab23d45db8e4632e48f7d1e70 |title=The Big Time: 3: Gwen Troake 's Banquet |publisher=BBC One London |date=11 November 1976 |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe result brought the end of Fanny Cradock's television career.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/3340924/Fanny-Cradock-a-Christmas-cracker.html |title=Fanny Cradock - a Christmas cracker |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2017-02-27|last1=Ellis |first1=Clive }}</ref> Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with a lemon jelly-and-cornstarch fortified [[bramble]] sauce and coffee cream dessert with rum.  Her idea was that with seafood, water fowl and rum, the meal had a nautical \"theme,\" which would appeal to Mr Heath\u2019s love of sailing and also be an appropriate salute to the former Admiral Mountbatten.  Cradock, grimacing and acting as if on the verge of gagging, told Troake that her menu was far too rich and she would \"never in a million years\" serve a seafood cocktail before a duck. She appeared not to be familiar with the term \"bramble,\" and when told it meant a blackberry, was horrified that it would be paired with a savoury duck, remonstrated that a sauce like that should be brushed on flan.  She derisively declared that the jam in it was \"too English\" and that the [[English people|English]] had never had a cuisine, erroneously claimed that \"[[Yorkshire pudding]] came from [[Burgundy]]\". While accepting that Troake's dessert was delicious, she insisted that it was not suitable, as it was \"too sickly\" served after the sweetly-sauced, rich duck, countering Troake's numerous objections with \"Yes, dear, but now you're among professionals.\"\n\nFanny suggested that unless Troake were to serve salad and cheese afterward, as is done in France, then she should use small almond pastry barquettes filled with a palate-cleansing fruit sorbet with spun sugar sails - equally suitable for the naval theme. Troake kept insisting that she liked her signature coffee pudding with \"nautical\" rum in it, while Cradock appealed to her to think of her diners' taste buds and stomachs, and try to achieve a balance in her menu.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW-2fclfRpI |title=Fanny Cradock on The Big Time |publisher=YouTube |date=Jan 30, 2008|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Unfortunately, the replacement dessert was not executed properly, and Morley said he felt that Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.\n\nThe public were incensed at her eye-rolling rudeness and condescension, and felt that Fanny Cradock had ruined Troake's special day.

When she appeared on the television chat show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' with [[Danny La Rue]] and it was revealed to her that La Rue was actually a female impersonator, she stormed off the set.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/sep/10/broadcasting.uknews | title=Secret drugs menu of TV chef Fanny | publisher=The Guardian | date=10 September 2006 | accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> Her final [[BBC]] appearance and her final television appearance was in early 1988 on ''Windmill'' presented by Chris Serle.\n\n==Personal life==\nCradock married four times, twice bigamously.

Evans, in Sheppey,  Kent, vol 2a, page 2368a</ref> Cradock married as \"Phyllis Nan Primrose Pechey\"; \"Primrose Pechey\" was a form passed down her father's side.

Evans, mmn = Primrose-Pechey or Pechey</ref> who was adopted by his grandparents. Thanks to Johnnie Cradock, Peter later became a [[sous-chef]] at the [[Dorchester Hotel]].\n\nBy July of the following year Cradock had become pregnant again, and married the baby's father Arthur William Chapman on 23 July.<ref>Marriage: 1928, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. V. Evans & Arthur W. Chapman, in Norwich, Norfolk, vol 4b, page 316</ref> For this marriage Cradock gave her name as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Vernon Evans.\"\n\nThe couple had a son Christopher,<ref>GRO Register of Births: SEP 1929 4b 422 DOWNHAM \u2013 Christopher A. J. Chapman, mmn = Primrose-Pechey</ref> but their marriage lasted less than a year before they separated. Cradock left her son Christopher and husband Arthur for a new life in Central London. Christopher was brought up in Norfolk by his father, an aunt and grandmother, although he made contact with Fanny in his adult life. Arthur Chapman became a Catholic and so would not give Fanny the divorce she later requested, as it was against the teachings of the Catholic Church. He was given only a single line in Fanny's autobiography.\n\nCradock married again on 26 September 1939, as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Chapman\"; her husband this time was Gregory Holden-Dye, a daredevil minor racing driver, driving Bentleys at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey.<ref>Marriage: 1939, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. Chapman & Gregory L. E. Holden-Dye, in Fulham, London, vol 1a, page 1615</ref> The marriage lasted only eight weeks, and produced no children, as she had soon met the love of her life  Johnnie Cradock. Gregory's mother had expressed a low opinion of Fanny, and ended up as a loathsome character in Fanny's first novel ''Scorpion's Suicide''. Cradock later concluded that as Arthur Chapman had not granted her a divorce, her marriage to Gregory was not lawful, and so never publicised it.\n\nJohn Whitby Cradock was a major in the [[Royal Artillery]] who was already married with four children. He soon left his wife, Ethel, and children to be with Fanny. Unable to marry Johnnie, because of Arthur's refusal to get divorced, she changed her surname to Cradock by deed poll in 1942. When she was misinformed that Arthur had died, she married Johnnie on 7 May 1977.<ref>Marriage: 1977, June Qtr, Phyllis Chapman & John Cradock, in Surrey South Western, vol 17, page 1154</ref> (Arthur actually lived until 1978.) For this marriage Cradock went with a pared down version of her name (\"Phyllis Chapman\"), and the then 68-year-old recorded her age as 55 on the marriage certificate, even though she had a son who was nearly fifty.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/livesandtimes/Fanny-Cradock.2809175.jp |title=Fanny Cradock - People - Scotsman.com |publisher=Heritage.scotsman.com |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nShe died following a stroke on 27 December 1994; the cause of death was cited as 'cerebrovascular atherosclerosis'.

The BBC published her recipes and suggestions for dinner-parties in a series of booklets, consolidating her reputation as the foremost celebrity chef of her day.<ref>\u2018Giving a Dinner Party\u2019 (Publications/British Broadcasting Corporation) by Fanny Cradock and Johnnie Cradock (Jun 1969)</ref>\n\n[[Marguerite Patten]] has described Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war. [[Brian Turner (chef)|Brian Turner]] has said that he respects Fanny's career and [[Delia Smith]] has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks' television programmes. Others are less complimentary and in the BBC series ''The Way We Cooked'' in an episode dedicated to Cradock and [[Graham Kerr]], [[Keith Floyd]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]], amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill. Despite their extravagant appearance and eccentricity, her recipes were extremely widely used and her [[cookery]] books sold in record numbers. In the third series of ''[[The F Word (TV series)|The F Word]]'', [[Gordon Ramsay]] held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock.\n\n==Media portrayals==\nFanny Cradock's husky voice and theatrical style was ripe for mimicry, such as [[Betty Marsden]]'s 'Fanny Haddock' in two BBC Radio comedy shows, ''[[Beyond our Ken]]'' (1958\u201364) and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1964\u201368). Fanny and Johnnie were also parodied by ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' and on ''[[Benny Hill]]'', with Benny as Fanny and [[Bob Todd]] as an invariably drunk Johnnie.\n\nCradock's life has also been the subject of the plays ''Doughnuts Like Fanny's'' by [[Julia Darling]] and ''Fear of Fanny'' by Brian Fillis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodhallagency.com/index.php?art_id=000432 |title=The Knight Hall Agency Limited |publisher=Rodhallagency.com |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> After a successful run by the Leeds Library Theatre Company, touring the United Kingdom in October and November 2003, ''Fear of Fanny'' was turned into a television drama starring [[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Julia Davis]] and featuring [[Hayley Atwell]].

She was the daughter of the novelist and lyricist [[Archibald Thomas Pechey]] and Bijou Sortain Hancock.\n\nCradock was born at her maternal grandparents' house, 33 Fairlop Road, Leytonstone. The birth was formally registered in London, in the district of [[West Ham]].<ref>GRO Register of Births: June Qtr, 1909, Phyllis Nan S. Pechey, at W. Ham, vol 4a, page 369</ref>\n\nAs a child, Cradock lived with her family at Fairlop Road, with her maternal grandparents. A plaque (with her name misspelled) can be found at Fairwood Court, Fairlop Road, London E11: \"Fanny Craddock 1909\u20131994. On this site until 1930 stood a house called Apthorp, birthplace of the famous TV cookery expert Fanny Craddock; born Phyllis Pechey.\"\n\nHer birthplace was named after Apthorp Villa, in Weston, Somerset, where her grandfather Charles Hancock had been born. Cradock's parents did not manage their money well; her mother, Bijou, spent extravagantly, and her father, Archibald, had sizeable gambling debts, many run up in [[Nice]]. In attempting to keep their creditors at bay, the family moved around the country, going to [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] in Kent, then to [[Swanage]] in Dorset and on to [[Bournemouth]] in [[Dorset]], where Archibald's brother, Richard Francis Pechey (1872\u20131963), had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1912.<ref>Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1923, page 1173-74</ref> Whilst in Bournemouth the 15-year-old Fanny attended Bournemouth High School (now Talbot Heath School).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/snapshotsofthepast/8489059.Bournemouth__a_town_with_so_much_character_/ |title=Bournemouth: a town with so much character!

Cradock began the next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling cleaning products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop.\n\n==Culinary career==\nCradock's fortunes began to change when she started work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of [[Auguste Escoffier]]. She later wrote passionately about the change from ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' to ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.\n\nFanny and Johnnie Cradock began writing a column under the pen name of \"Bon Viveur\"<ref>The Cradocks were still using this byline at the end of their ''Telegraph'' career (Daily Telegraph Cooks' Book, London, W.

Cradock would cook vast dishes that were served to the audience. They became known for their roast turkey, complete with stuffed head, tail feathers and wings. Complete with French accents, their act was one of a drunken hen-pecked husband and a domineering wife. At this time, they were known as Major and Mrs Cradock. She also wrote books under the names Frances Dale, Bon Viveur, Susan Leigh and Phyllis Cradock.\n\n==TV personality==\nIn 1955 Cradock recorded a pilot for what became a very successful [[BBC]] television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving a detailed account of every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, \"You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now.\" Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included \"This won't break you\", \"This is perfectly economical\", and \"This won't stretch your purse\". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying \"But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4JFoyshIAM |title=Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas- Christmas Cakes part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs time went by, however, her food began to seem outdated, with her love of the [[piping bag]] and [[food coloring|vegetable dyes]]. As she grew older, she applied more and more make-up and wore vast [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] ballgowns on screen. Cradock had always included relatives and friends in her television shows. Johnnie suffered a minor heart attack in the early 1970s and was replaced with the daughter of a friend, Jayne. Another assistant was Sarah, and there was a series of young men who didn't last very long.\nThroughout her television career the Cradocks also worked for the British Gas Council, appearing at trade shows such as the Ideal Home Exhibition and making many \"infomercials,\" instructing cooks, usually newlywed women, on how to use gas cookers for basic dishes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T89IoUN43s |title=Kitchen Magic - Fanny Cradock (1963) Gas Council film NEW TRANSFER |publisher=YouTube |date=24 January 2015 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> Despite the BBC's ban on advertising, Cradock used only gas stoves in her television shows and often stated that she \"hated\" electric stoves and ovens.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng6i4IdtC4w |title=Fanny Cradock on TV-am \u2013 1985 |publisher=YouTube |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nHer series ''Fanny Cradock Cooks for Christmas'' is the only one of several she made to have survived in the TV archives and to have been repeated in recent years, on the UK digital television channels [[BBC4]], [[Good Food]] and [[Food Network|Food Network UK]], usually in the run-up to Christmas.

Troake was to organise a three-course Foyle's Literary Lunch at the Devonshire Hotel in honour of the former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], with [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and other dignitaries in attendance, and asked Fanny Cradock, by then a [[tax exile]] in Ireland, along with chef Eugene Kaufeler, actor and gourmet [[Robert Morley]], nutritionist Magnus Pyke and many other experts Troake admired to advise her.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/18e2f08ab23d45db8e4632e48f7d1e70 |title=The Big Time: 3: Gwen Troake 's Banquet |publisher=BBC One London |date=11 November 1976 |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe result brought the end of Fanny Cradock's television career.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/3340924/Fanny-Cradock-a-Christmas-cracker.html |title=Fanny Cradock - a Christmas cracker |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2017-02-27|last1=Ellis |first1=Clive }}</ref> Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with a lemon jelly-and-cornstarch fortified [[bramble]] sauce and coffee cream dessert with rum.  Her idea was that with seafood, water fowl and rum, the meal had a nautical \"theme,\" which would appeal to Mr Heath\u2019s love of sailing and also be an appropriate salute to the former Admiral Mountbatten.  Cradock, grimacing and acting as if on the verge of gagging, told Troake that her menu was far too rich and she would \"never in a million years\" serve a seafood cocktail before a duck. She appeared not to be familiar with the term \"bramble,\" and when told it meant a blackberry, was horrified that it would be paired with a savoury duck, remonstrated that a sauce like that should be brushed on flan.  She derisively declared that the jam in it was \"too English\" and that the [[English people|English]] had never had a cuisine, erroneously claimed that \"[[Yorkshire pudding]] came from [[Burgundy]]\". While accepting that Troake's dessert was delicious, she insisted that it was not suitable, as it was \"too sickly\" served after the sweetly-sauced, rich duck, countering Troake's numerous objections with \"Yes, dear, but now you're among professionals.\"\n\nFanny suggested that unless Troake were to serve salad and cheese afterward, as is done in France, then she should use small almond pastry barquettes filled with a palate-cleansing fruit sorbet with spun sugar sails - equally suitable for the naval theme. Troake kept insisting that she liked her signature coffee pudding with \"nautical\" rum in it, while Cradock appealed to her to think of her diners' taste buds and stomachs, and try to achieve a balance in her menu.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW-2fclfRpI |title=Fanny Cradock on The Big Time |publisher=YouTube |date=Jan 30, 2008|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> Unfortunately, the replacement dessert was not executed properly, and Morley said he felt that Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.\n\nThe public were incensed at her eye-rolling rudeness and condescension, and felt that Fanny Cradock had ruined Troake's special day.

Thanks to Johnnie Cradock, Peter later became a [[sous-chef]] at the [[Dorchester Hotel]].\n\nBy July of the following year Cradock had become pregnant again, and married the baby's father Arthur William Chapman on 23 July.<ref>Marriage: 1928, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. V. Evans & Arthur W. Chapman, in Norwich, Norfolk, vol 4b, page 316</ref> For this marriage Cradock gave her name as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Vernon Evans.\"\n\nThe couple had a son Christopher,<ref>GRO Register of Births: SEP 1929 4b 422 DOWNHAM \u2013 Christopher A. J. Chapman, mmn = Primrose-Pechey</ref> but their marriage lasted less than a year before they separated. Cradock left her son Christopher and husband Arthur for a new life in Central London. Christopher was brought up in Norfolk by his father, an aunt and grandmother, although he made contact with Fanny in his adult life. Arthur Chapman became a Catholic and so would not give Fanny the divorce she later requested, as it was against the teachings of the Catholic Church. He was given only a single line in Fanny's autobiography.\n\nCradock married again on 26 September 1939, as \"Phyllis Nan Sortain Chapman\"; her husband this time was Gregory Holden-Dye, a daredevil minor racing driver, driving Bentleys at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey.<ref>Marriage: 1939, September Qtr, Phyllis N. S. Chapman & Gregory L. E. Holden-Dye, in Fulham, London, vol 1a, page 1615</ref> The marriage lasted only eight weeks, and produced no children, as she had soon met the love of her life  Johnnie Cradock. Gregory's mother had expressed a low opinion of Fanny, and ended up as a loathsome character in Fanny's first novel ''Scorpion's Suicide''. Cradock later concluded that as Arthur Chapman had not granted her a divorce, her marriage to Gregory was not lawful, and so never publicised it.\n\nJohn Whitby Cradock was a major in the [[Royal Artillery]] who was already married with four children. He soon left his wife, Ethel, and children to be with Fanny. Unable to marry Johnnie, because of Arthur's refusal to get divorced, she changed her surname to Cradock by deed poll in 1942. When she was misinformed that Arthur had died, she married Johnnie on 7 May 1977.<ref>Marriage: 1977, June Qtr, Phyllis Chapman & John Cradock, in Surrey South Western, vol 17, page 1154</ref> (Arthur actually lived until 1978.)

The story and characters are modeled after those featured in the classic Chinese literature, [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]. However, certain story elements, as well as the names of the Three Kingdoms themselves, are fictionalized.\n\nThere are three chapters under this title, entitled '''Fuuun Gouketsu Hen''', '''Eiyuu Gekitotsu Hen''' and '''Senjin Kettou Hen'''. It also has a side story, '''Sangokuden Gaiden Buyuu Gekitou Roku'''.\n\n== Outline ==\n\"BB Senshi\" is a 20th anniversary commemorative work with the motif of \"[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]].\" The various mobile suits{{Clarify|reason=|date=June 2019}} become \"actors (\u6f14\u8005)\" to take on the roles of various characters of Chinese literature. This further emphasizes Sangokuden as \"a performance of Romance of the Three Kingdoms by the SD Gundams.\" The usual name \"\u9811\u99c4\u7121 (Gundam)\" used in the \"Sengokuden\" series has been replaced with the katakana \"\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0 (Gundam)\". The warring states world view closely resembles that of the \"Sengokuden\" series. Certain aspects of the \"actors\" taking on the roles resemble the mobile suits they were originally based on.\n\nIn \"Mirisha\", the stage of \"Sangokuden\", there exist 130 scrolls of historical text. In the current time they are called \"G Chronicle (G\u8a18)\". It reveals that \"Mirisha\" was the country \"Abram\" (from the \"Sengokuden\" series) in the past and the first emperor is \"Hakuryuu Taitei\" from [[Shin SD Sengokuden Densetsu no Daishougun Hen]] however this crossover was not explained in the main story. (Therefore, it could probably mean this is another \"Abram\" of a parallel world like that of [[SD Gundam Force Emaki Musharetsuden|Musharetsuden]])<ref>Stated in Hobby Japan July issue 2007.</ref>\n\nThe series was announced to be released in a number of territories, including Japan, Korea, America and Australia.<ref>http://hobby-midori-apron.com/img-ap/47-hobby/P5171579.MOV</ref> However, as of 2009 only releases in Asian regions have followed. A range of related merchandise has been produced including modelling tools, snack foods and orange juice.\n\nWhilst the series is still ongoing, a new Sengokuden model kit series has been announced to begin in July 2009. The kits will be remolded from kits released for [[SD Gundam Force Emaki Musharetsuden]], based on previous designs which have styled these Gundams after famous historical samurai. It is currently unknown if related fiction will be produced for these kits or if they will crossover into Sangokuden.\n\n== Story ==\n* '''Gathering of the Heroes Chapter'''\nIt was the times of war in the continent of Mirisha, a time where the three kingdoms of Shou, Gou and Giga struggle for power and authority. Before the three countries become established, the rebellion of the Yellow Scarves has allowed Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) to seize control over the government, he killed Reitei (Han Ling Di) the emperor of that time and stole the \"Gyokuji (\u7389\u74bd)\", then promoted himself to Prime Minister spreading tyranny through the land. But a year after, the anti-Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) spirits are on the rise because of the discovery of Reitei's (Han Lin Di's) assassination, Enshuu (Shou/Shu Kingdom) was quick on gathering troops and with Sousou (Cao Cao) on board the anti-Toutaku  alliance is formed. Heroes from all over gather under the anti-Toutaku banner, including Ryuubi's (Liu Bei's) Yuushu Resistance. The anti-Toutaku allied forces fought against the Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) Troops at the Korou Fortress (Hu Lao Guan) which is just outside Rakuyou.\n\nThis chapter parallels the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and the [[Battle of Hulao Pass]].\n\n*'''Clash of the Heroes Chapter'''\nThe anti-Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) alliance was disbanded after the defeat of Toutaku, the heroes each return to their homeland, expanding their territory and causing conflicts. With the death of Sonken Zephyranthes (Sun Jian), his son Sonsaku (Sun Ce) is aiming to stabilize the situation in Koto. Sousou (Cao Cao) has clashed with the Hero of Kahoku, Enshou (Yuan Shao). Ryuubi (Liu Bei) has travelled far from his homeland Yuushu to Keishuu to seek help from the famous strategist, Koumei (Kong Ming).\n\nThis chapter parallels the [[Battle of Guandu]] and the events eventually leading to the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n*'''Battle of the War Gods'''\nThe battle of Red Cliff ended with the victory of Ryuubi (Liu Bei) and Sonken (Sun Quan) army, the land is split into three kingdoms&nbsp;\u2013 Shou, Giga and Gou. But there is no news of the missing Sousou (Cao Cao) and Ryuubi (Liu Bei). On the empty throne of Shou is the Ryuuteiken and ascending the throne of Giga is son of Sousou (Cao Cao), Souhi (Cao Pi). Souhi leads Giga to a campaign to conquer the land westwards. On the barren lands of Seiryou stands one man, Bachou (Ma Chao), burning with flames of revenge. The Giga Troops are said to be dark zombies with burning red eyes and are impossible to kill. Later in the series, the god of war, Shuu, returns.\n\nThis chapter parallels the events after the formation of the Three Kingdoms themselves.\n\n*'''Side Story: Heroic Clash Chronicles'''\nAs time gradually progress towards the Red Cliff Battle, a whistling lone warrior wanders Mirisha. The warrior bearing the same name as the past ruler of So \"Kouseki\" encounters other warriors at various places, often engaging in clashes with them.

Although in official numbering these kits began with BB 300, Bandai was only up to BB 295 at time of release and so BB 296\u2013299 were retroactively released. Since that time every subsequent BB Senshi release has been a Sangokuden release, with the exception of SD versions of Gundam Exia, 00 Gundam, 00 Raiser, Gundam Exia Repair II and 0 Gundam from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 00]]''.\n\nThe kits utilise a gimmick used by many past BB Senshi lines&nbsp;\u2013 armour changing. The majority of the kits are built on the same basic figure design, allowing them to swap at least headwear, shoulder armour and backpacks/capes. Some characters can also swap further elements such as chest and skirt armour. However, so far this has been limited to the initial three kits. The figures utilise ball joints, to allow poeseability and to swap out limbs due to the popular Japanese hobby of SD customisation. As further part of this, many of the characters have individualised pre-posed hands. Starting with Ryofu Tallgeese, the kits were also issued with 'neutral' hands to use as an alternative to the specifically posed ones. A related feature was most kits eventually being issued with optional secondary eye stickers to represent features such as [[Char Aznable]]-style sunglasses or a character's aiming ability. This eventually led to a full sheet of such optional stickers being given away as a promotional item.\n\nA number of recolours have been released. In December 2007, Bandai released a three kit set of Ryuubi (Liu Bei), Chouhi and Kan-u cast in transparent plastic. This was followed in April 2008 with a similar set of Sousou and Shibai, December 2008 with Koumei (Kong Ming) and Choun and March 2009 with Sonken and Shuuyu (in contrast to the other re-releases, Shuuyu is metallic gold plated instead of transparent plastic). These multi-kit boxsets also come with large diorama cards featuring CGI-generated backdrops from the ''Sengokuden'' universe. Of special note is that Chou-Un is missing his Hieisen steed from his initial release.\n\nA limited metallic 'special coating' Ryuubi (Liu Bei) was a hobby show exclusive. The first collected manga volume also had a prize draw, with 100 pieces of silver-plated Ryuubi Gundam kits as prizes. A metallic red recolour of Sazabi released in March 2009 was the first such kit to be included in the storyline, explained as a new colour schemed adopted by the character in the epilogue of the second chapter.\n\nA recoloured two kit set of Koumei (Kong Ming) and Shuuyu was released as a tie into a ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' feature film adaptation ''Red Cliff''. The kits use gold, brown and white colours to copy the costumes seen in the film. The diorama card included features screenshots from ''Red Cliff'' (specifically of Cao Cao's navy at different stages) rather than the usual backdrops.\n\nAdditional model kits and add on accessories have also been made available, often as contest prizes. These include:\n*A human scale replica of the Imperial Seal\n*Energy effect parts for character's weapons\n*'Grunt' GM and Zaku troops (the GM versions have since received a Japanese retail release, containing one GM troop from each of the three main kingdoms in each set)\n*A golden miniature dragon that can convert into weapons and armour.\n\nA B-Club kit was also produced of the character Sonshoukou Gerbera. The model can be built in two possible poses, wielding either her bow or glaive. A BB Senshi version of the character was released in May 2009.\n\nA new 'Sangokuden Sidestory' line will begin in late 2009, focussing on the children of the main cast. Controversially, the kits in this line will be remolds/recolours of much older existing kits, lacking the scale and art style of all previous Sangokuden kits. In partial response to this, the last two kits in the series were given two pairs of new leg parts- one pair for the included kit and the second to add to earlier kits in the line.\n\nAt the 'Gunpla Expo 2009', [[Bandai]] officially unveiled both HG 1/100 Scale versions of Kan-u Gundam and Chouhi Gundam. The release dates of the two were still unannounced.\n\n=== List of Model Kits ===\n\n:'''Chapter I.

Some of the kits will include extra pieces, like the Shin Ryuuteiken (\u771f\u30fb\u9f8d\u5e1d\u5263) for Ryuubi (Liu Bei). Although most of the kits are minor variants of the previous BB Senshi releases (generally in terms of colour), they do not have the usual BB Senshi numbering and are instead treated as a separate series. This same format was used for model kits released for the previous SD television series, [[Superior Defender Gundam Force|SD Gundam Force]]. In addition to new characters and gimmicks, Bandai also introduced new engineering concepts to address key criticisms much as they did with the 'Sidestory' line. The shoulder armour pieces of Shin Ryuusou Ryuubi, Raisou Chouhi and Ougasou Kan-u are all designed to be removed as one construct, as opposed to splitting into multiple pieces. This concept addresses the problem of pieces breaking on occasion when attempting to remove them after construction.\n\nIn the list below, the new model kits are in '''bold''':\n\n*001. Shin Ryuubi Gundam: \u771f \u5289\u5099 ([[Liu Bei]]) (comes with Shin Ryuuteiken)\n*002.

The story and characters are modeled after those featured in the classic Chinese literature, [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]. However, certain story elements, as well as the names of the Three Kingdoms themselves, are fictionalized.\n\nThere are three chapters under this title, entitled '''Fuuun Gouketsu Hen''', '''Eiyuu Gekitotsu Hen''' and '''Senjin Kettou Hen'''. It also has a side story, '''Sangokuden Gaiden Buyuu Gekitou Roku'''.\n\n== Outline ==\n\"BB Senshi\" is a 20th anniversary commemorative work with the motif of \"[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]].\" The various mobile suits{{Clarify|reason=|date=June 2019}} become \"actors (\u6f14\u8005)\" to take on the roles of various characters of Chinese literature. This further emphasizes Sangokuden as \"a performance of Romance of the Three Kingdoms by the SD Gundams.\" The usual name \"\u9811\u99c4\u7121 (Gundam)\" used in the \"Sengokuden\" series has been replaced with the katakana \"\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0 (Gundam)\". The warring states world view closely resembles that of the \"Sengokuden\" series. Certain aspects of the \"actors\" taking on the roles resemble the mobile suits they were originally based on.\n\nIn \"Mirisha\", the stage of \"Sangokuden\", there exist 130 scrolls of historical text. In the current time they are called \"G Chronicle (G\u8a18)\". It reveals that \"Mirisha\" was the country \"Abram\" (from the \"Sengokuden\" series) in the past and the first emperor is \"Hakuryuu Taitei\" from [[Shin SD Sengokuden Densetsu no Daishougun Hen]] however this crossover was not explained in the main story. (Therefore, it could probably mean this is another \"Abram\" of a parallel world like that of [[SD Gundam Force Emaki Musharetsuden|Musharetsuden]])<ref>Stated in Hobby Japan July issue 2007.</ref>\n\nThe series was announced to be released in a number of territories, including Japan, Korea, America and Australia.<ref>http://hobby-midori-apron.com/img-ap/47-hobby/P5171579.MOV</ref> However, as of 2009 only releases in Asian regions have followed. A range of related merchandise has been produced including modelling tools, snack foods and orange juice.\n\nWhilst the series is still ongoing, a new Sengokuden model kit series has been announced to begin in July 2009. The kits will be remolded from kits released for [[SD Gundam Force Emaki Musharetsuden]], based on previous designs which have styled these Gundams after famous historical samurai. It is currently unknown if related fiction will be produced for these kits or if they will crossover into Sangokuden.\n\n== Story ==\n* '''Gathering of the Heroes Chapter'''\nIt was the times of war in the continent of Mirisha, a time where the three kingdoms of Shou, Gou and Giga struggle for power and authority. Before the three countries become established, the rebellion of the Yellow Scarves has allowed Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) to seize control over the government, he killed Reitei (Han Ling Di) the emperor of that time and stole the \"Gyokuji (\u7389\u74bd)\", then promoted himself to Prime Minister spreading tyranny through the land. But a year after, the anti-Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) spirits are on the rise because of the discovery of Reitei's (Han Lin Di's) assassination, Enshuu (Shou/Shu Kingdom) was quick on gathering troops and with Sousou (Cao Cao) on board the anti-Toutaku  alliance is formed. Heroes from all over gather under the anti-Toutaku banner, including Ryuubi's (Liu Bei's) Yuushu Resistance. The anti-Toutaku allied forces fought against the Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) Troops at the Korou Fortress (Hu Lao Guan) which is just outside Rakuyou.\n\nThis chapter parallels the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and the [[Battle of Hulao Pass]].\n\n*'''Clash of the Heroes Chapter'''\nThe anti-Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) alliance was disbanded after the defeat of Toutaku, the heroes each return to their homeland, expanding their territory and causing conflicts. With the death of Sonken Zephyranthes (Sun Jian), his son Sonsaku (Sun Ce) is aiming to stabilize the situation in Koto. Sousou (Cao Cao) has clashed with the Hero of Kahoku, Enshou (Yuan Shao). Ryuubi (Liu Bei) has travelled far from his homeland Yuushu to Keishuu to seek help from the famous strategist, Koumei (Kong Ming).\n\nThis chapter parallels the [[Battle of Guandu]] and the events eventually leading to the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n*'''Battle of the War Gods'''\nThe battle of Red Cliff ended with the victory of Ryuubi (Liu Bei) and Sonken (Sun Quan) army, the land is split into three kingdoms&nbsp;\u2013 Shou, Giga and Gou. But there is no news of the missing Sousou (Cao Cao) and Ryuubi (Liu Bei). On the empty throne of Shou is the Ryuuteiken and ascending the throne of Giga is son of Sousou (Cao Cao), Souhi (Cao Pi). Souhi leads Giga to a campaign to conquer the land westwards. On the barren lands of Seiryou stands one man, Bachou (Ma Chao), burning with flames of revenge. The Giga Troops are said to be dark zombies with burning red eyes and are impossible to kill. Later in the series, the god of war, Shuu, returns.\n\nThis chapter parallels the events after the formation of the Three Kingdoms themselves.\n\n*'''Side Story: Heroic Clash Chronicles'''\nAs time gradually progress towards the Red Cliff Battle, a whistling lone warrior wanders Mirisha. The warrior bearing the same name as the past ruler of So \"Kouseki\" encounters other warriors at various places, often engaging in clashes with them. And now after many struggles he finally arrive at his homeland Kishuu, the land soon to be the battlefield of the Red Cliffs and the land last known as \"So\"...\n\nThe stories of the heroes not touched on in the main story, told in 12 episodes through the manga in the instruction sheet of the model kits in the series. The key character of this side story is Kouseki Turn-X (Xiang Yu).\n\nThe story is set before the Battle of the Red Cliffs and parallels the [[Chu\u2013Han contention]].\n\n*'''Brave Battle Warriors'''\nBBW, to some extent, can be considered as the fourth part of Sangokuden, and is played out in anime and plamodel series. Storywise, it follows the past series but with the addition of more details like Sousou's attempt to assassinate Toutaku. With the anime as the main story, the plamodel series serves as a digest for the parts involving the character. Even though both series are on the same timeline, there are exceptions where the anime vary from the plamodel series. There are also characters original to the anime.\n\n*'''Brave Battle Warriors Genesis'''\nThe manga serialization in Gundam Ace. It focus on episodes not shown in the anime's main story.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Shou [\u7fd4] (Yuushuu Resistance [\u5e7d\u5dde\u7fa9\u52c7\u8ecd]) ===\nAn army formed by sworn brothers Ryuubi (Liu Bei), Chouhi (Zhang Fei) and Kan-u (Guan Yu).

Although in official numbering these kits began with BB 300, Bandai was only up to BB 295 at time of release and so BB 296\u2013299 were retroactively released. Since that time every subsequent BB Senshi release has been a Sangokuden release, with the exception of SD versions of Gundam Exia, 00 Gundam, 00 Raiser, Gundam Exia Repair II and 0 Gundam from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 00]]''.\n\nThe kits utilise a gimmick used by many past BB Senshi lines&nbsp;\u2013 armour changing. The majority of the kits are built on the same basic figure design, allowing them to swap at least headwear, shoulder armour and backpacks/capes. Some characters can also swap further elements such as chest and skirt armour. However, so far this has been limited to the initial three kits. The figures utilise ball joints, to allow poeseability and to swap out limbs due to the popular Japanese hobby of SD customisation. As further part of this, many of the characters have individualised pre-posed hands. Starting with Ryofu Tallgeese, the kits were also issued with 'neutral' hands to use as an alternative to the specifically posed ones. A related feature was most kits eventually being issued with optional secondary eye stickers to represent features such as [[Char Aznable]]-style sunglasses or a character's aiming ability. This eventually led to a full sheet of such optional stickers being given away as a promotional item.\n\nA number of recolours have been released. In December 2007, Bandai released a three kit set of Ryuubi (Liu Bei), Chouhi and Kan-u cast in transparent plastic. This was followed in April 2008 with a similar set of Sousou and Shibai, December 2008 with Koumei (Kong Ming) and Choun and March 2009 with Sonken and Shuuyu (in contrast to the other re-releases, Shuuyu is metallic gold plated instead of transparent plastic). These multi-kit boxsets also come with large diorama cards featuring CGI-generated backdrops from the ''Sengokuden'' universe. Of special note is that Chou-Un is missing his Hieisen steed from his initial release.\n\nA limited metallic 'special coating' Ryuubi (Liu Bei) was a hobby show exclusive. The first collected manga volume also had a prize draw, with 100 pieces of silver-plated Ryuubi Gundam kits as prizes. A metallic red recolour of Sazabi released in March 2009 was the first such kit to be included in the storyline, explained as a new colour schemed adopted by the character in the epilogue of the second chapter.\n\nA recoloured two kit set of Koumei (Kong Ming) and Shuuyu was released as a tie into a ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' feature film adaptation ''Red Cliff''. The kits use gold, brown and white colours to copy the costumes seen in the film. The diorama card included features screenshots from ''Red Cliff'' (specifically of Cao Cao's navy at different stages) rather than the usual backdrops.\n\nAdditional model kits and add on accessories have also been made available, often as contest prizes. These include:\n*A human scale replica of the Imperial Seal\n*Energy effect parts for character's weapons\n*'Grunt' GM and Zaku troops (the GM versions have since received a Japanese retail release, containing one GM troop from each of the three main kingdoms in each set)\n*A golden miniature dragon that can convert into weapons and armour.\n\nA B-Club kit was also produced of the character Sonshoukou Gerbera. The model can be built in two possible poses, wielding either her bow or glaive. A BB Senshi version of the character was released in May 2009.\n\nA new 'Sangokuden Sidestory' line will begin in late 2009, focussing on the children of the main cast. Controversially, the kits in this line will be remolds/recolours of much older existing kits, lacking the scale and art style of all previous Sangokuden kits. In partial response to this, the last two kits in the series were given two pairs of new leg parts- one pair for the included kit and the second to add to earlier kits in the line.\n\nAt the 'Gunpla Expo 2009', [[Bandai]] officially unveiled both HG 1/100 Scale versions of Kan-u Gundam and Chouhi Gundam. The release dates of the two were still unannounced.\n\n=== List of Model Kits ===\n\n:'''Chapter I.

Some of the kits will include extra pieces, like the Shin Ryuuteiken (\u771f\u30fb\u9f8d\u5e1d\u5263) for Ryuubi (Liu Bei). Although most of the kits are minor variants of the previous BB Senshi releases (generally in terms of colour), they do not have the usual BB Senshi numbering and are instead treated as a separate series. This same format was used for model kits released for the previous SD television series, [[Superior Defender Gundam Force|SD Gundam Force]]. In addition to new characters and gimmicks, Bandai also introduced new engineering concepts to address key criticisms much as they did with the 'Sidestory' line. The shoulder armour pieces of Shin Ryuusou Ryuubi, Raisou Chouhi and Ougasou Kan-u are all designed to be removed as one construct, as opposed to splitting into multiple pieces. This concept addresses the problem of pieces breaking on occasion when attempting to remove them after construction.\n\nIn the list below, the new model kits are in '''bold''':\n\n*001.

The first units were released in 1992, with a 4.6-liter [[Ford Modular engine|Modular]] V8 engine and either a [[Ford AOD transmission|Ford AOD/AOD-E]] or a [[Ford 4R70W transmission|Ford 4R70W]], which were both 4-speed automatic transmissions.\n\nAlthough the Crown Victoria did have police versions back in 1979 up to 1991, the car never used the Police Interceptor moniker. Those older versions, including fleet and taxi, were known as \"P72\" in production code. 1992 was the first year the Police Interceptor name was ever used, with these known as the ''Crown Victoria P71''.\n\nThroughout 1993 to 1995, many restyles had come in. The car was updated with a front chrome grille, and also included a reflector strip between the taillights. The license plate location was moved to the rear trunk for 1995.\n\nIn the years 1994-1995, 140 of the P71 cars had entered Russia, serving for the [[Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety (Russia)|Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety]] (known under its abbreviation \u0413\u0410\u0418, GAI in English), which is a Russian [[law enforcement agency]], part of the [[police]].

The car also went through many changes during its 13-year generation.\n\nFor 1998, the P71 police package adopted many chrome areas for the car. For 1999, a chrome-trimmed gloss black rear fascia, unpainted door handle trim, black bumper strips, and a gloss black slatted grille were introduced. The new \"Street Appearance Package\", intended to make the Police Interceptor look like a P73 model, was introduced as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.p71owners.com|title=Police Interceptor Information|publisher=p71owners.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Unmarked police cruiser with lights.jpg|thumb|An unmarked Crown Vic Police Interceptor in [[Toronto]] in 2014]]\n\nFor 2000, the rear fascia and tail-lights lost the chrome trim, and the gloss black grille was put away for a flat black slatted grille. Further changes were made in 2001, including taking off all trim on the plastic bumper pieces and a new honeycomb-style grille, replacing the slat-style grille, which is found on previous standard Crown Victorias and CVPIs. Power adjustable pedals also became an option during that year, as many officers had been joining departments with different kinds of heights. They also relocated the rear window defrost switch from the left side of the dash to the direct left of the HVAC controls. For the year 2003, interior door panels and seats were freshened, with side-impact airbags becoming an option. The suspension, brakes, steering, and frame all were redesigned for the 2003 model year. Wheels had a different offset, and the cassette player was eliminated for the 2004 year.\n\nIn 2006, the front fascia was revised with a new \"honeycomb\" grille, and the instrument panel was redesigned with a new message center and digital odometer/trip meter. New seventeen-inch (17\") plastic wheel covers were introduced for the P71, and a new steering wheel design was also introduced.\n\n2011 was the final [[model year]] for the [[Ford Crown Victoria]] Police Interceptor, as [[St. Thomas Assembly]], where the [[Ford Panther platform]] cars were produced, would close, and all three Panther Platform cars would be discontinued. The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor would be replaced by the [[Ford Taurus]]-based [[Ford Police Interceptor Sedan]] for the 2013 [[model year]], and a [[Ford Explorer]]-based [[Ford Police Interceptor Utility]] would also be introduced.\n\n== Taurus (2012-2019) ==\nTo replace the Crown Victoria, Ford used the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|sixth generation Taurus]] and the [[Ford Explorer|fifth and sixth generation Ford Explorer]].

The license plate location was moved to the rear trunk for 1995.\n\nIn the years 1994-1995, 140 of the P71 cars had entered Russia, serving for the [[Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety (Russia)|Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety]] (known under its abbreviation \u0413\u0410\u0418, GAI in English), which is a Russian [[law enforcement agency]], part of the [[police]]. They were operated by the [[Russia]]n [[Highway patrol|Traffic Patrol]], known in Russia as DPS, and the cars worked as highway patrol units around the greater [[Moscow]] area until the 2010s, being one of the most powerful vehicles used by the DPS.<ref name=\"dps\">''Ford Crown Victoria DPS GAI'', \"Avtomobil Na Sluzhbie\", Nr. 59, DeAgostini, 2014, ISSN 2223-0440, p.10-14 {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n=== Second generation (1998-2011) ===\n[[File:Ford Crown Victoria police.jpg|left|thumb|([[Prince William County Police Department]]) The second generation Crown Victoria came out in 1998, with updated technology and new parts.]]\nThe Crown Victoria was restyled for the 1998 year, taking the conservative styling of the [[Mercury Grand Marquis]]. The car also went through many changes during its 13-year generation.\n\nFor 1998, the P71 police package adopted many chrome areas for the car. For 1999, a chrome-trimmed gloss black rear fascia, unpainted door handle trim, black bumper strips, and a gloss black slatted grille were introduced. The new \"Street Appearance Package\", intended to make the Police Interceptor look like a P73 model, was introduced as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.p71owners.com|title=Police Interceptor Information|publisher=p71owners.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Unmarked police cruiser with lights.jpg|thumb|An unmarked Crown Vic Police Interceptor in [[Toronto]] in 2014]]\n\nFor 2000, the rear fascia and tail-lights lost the chrome trim, and the gloss black grille was put away for a flat black slatted grille. Further changes were made in 2001, including taking off all trim on the plastic bumper pieces and a new honeycomb-style grille, replacing the slat-style grille, which is found on previous standard Crown Victorias and CVPIs. Power adjustable pedals also became an option during that year, as many officers had been joining departments with different kinds of heights. They also relocated the rear window defrost switch from the left side of the dash to the direct left of the HVAC controls. For the year 2003, interior door panels and seats were freshened, with side-impact airbags becoming an option. The suspension, brakes, steering, and frame all were redesigned for the 2003 model year. Wheels had a different offset, and the cassette player was eliminated for the 2004 year.\n\nIn 2006, the front fascia was revised with a new \"honeycomb\" grille, and the instrument panel was redesigned with a new message center and digital odometer/trip meter. New seventeen-inch (17\") plastic wheel covers were introduced for the P71, and a new steering wheel design was also introduced.\n\n2011 was the final [[model year]] for the [[Ford Crown Victoria]] Police Interceptor, as [[St. Thomas Assembly]], where the [[Ford Panther platform]] cars were produced, would close, and all three Panther Platform cars would be discontinued. The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor would be replaced by the [[Ford Taurus]]-based [[Ford Police Interceptor Sedan]] for the 2013 [[model year]], and a [[Ford Explorer]]-based [[Ford Police Interceptor Utility]] would also be introduced.\n\n== Taurus (2012-2019) ==\nTo replace the Crown Victoria, Ford used the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|sixth generation Taurus]] and the [[Ford Explorer|fifth and sixth generation Ford Explorer]]. The names for both cars were instead the \"Police Interceptor Sedan\" and \"Police Interceptor Utility,\" in lieu of Taurus or Explorer. The [[Ford Police Interceptor Sedan]] was discontinued after the 2019 [[model year]].\n\n=== Ford Police Interceptor Sedan ===\n{{Main|Ford Police Interceptor Sedan}}\n[[File:Canada Day 2015 on Saint Catherine Street - 066.jpg|left|thumb|([[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]) The [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Police Interceptor Sedan]] was one of two cars to replace the Crown Victoria.

In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced.

Its benefits include the ability to make precise cuts with limited blood loss. Electrosurgical devices are frequently used during surgical operations helping to prevent blood loss in hospital operating rooms or in outpatient procedures.<ref name=McCauley2003/>\n\nIn electrosurgical procedures, the tissue is heated by an [[electric current]]. Although electrical devices that create a heated probe may be used for the [[cauterization]] of tissue in some applications, electrosurgery refers to a different method than [[electrocautery]]. Electrocautery uses [[heat conduction]] from a probe heated to a high temperature by a direct electrical current (much in the manner of a soldering iron). This may be accomplished by direct current from dry-cells in a penlight-type device.\n\nElectrosurgery, by contrast, uses radio frequency (RF) alternating current to heat the tissue by RF induced intracellular oscillation of ionized molecules that result in an elevation of intracellular temperature. When the intracellular temperature reaches 60 degrees C, instantaneous cell death occurs. If tissue is heated to 60\u201399 degrees C, the simultaneous processes of tissue desiccation (dehydration) and protein coagulation occur. If the intracellular temperature rapidly reaches 100 degrees C, the intracellular contents undergo a liquid to gas conversion, massive volumetric expansion, and resulting explosive vaporization.\n\nAppropriately applied with electrosurgical forceps, desiccation and coagulation result in the occlusion of blood vessels and halting of bleeding. While the process is technically a process of ''electrocoagulation'', the term \"electrocautery\" is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. The process of vaporization can be used to ablate tissue targets, or, by linear extension, used to transect or cut tissue. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high voltage current to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated. The continued application of current to this high impedance tissue results in resistive heating and the achievement of very high temperatures\u2014enough to cause breakdown of the organic molecules to sugars and even carbon, thus the dark textures from carbonization of tissue.\n\n[[Diathermy]] is used by some as a synonym for electrosurgery but in other contexts [[diathermy]] means [[dielectric heating]], produced by rotation of molecular dipoles in a high frequency electromagnetic field. This effect is most widely used in [[microwave oven]]s or some tissue ablative devices which operate at gigahertz frequencies. Lower frequencies, allowing for deeper penetration, are used in industrial processes.\n\nRF electrosurgery is commonly used in virtually all surgical disciplines including dermatological, gynecological, cardiac, plastic, ocular, spine, ENT, maxillofacial, orthopedic, urological, neuro- and general surgical procedures as well as certain dental procedures.\n\nRF electrosurgery is performed using a RF electrosurgical generator (also referred to as an electrosurgical unit or ESU) and a handpiece including one or two electrodes\u2014a monopolar or bipolar instrument. All RF electrosurgery is bipolar so the difference between monopolar and bipolar instruments is that monopolar instruments comprise only one electrode while bipolar instruments include both electrodes in their design.\n\nThe monopolar instrument called an \"active electrode\" when energized, requires the application of another monopolar instrument called a \"dispersive electrode\" elsewhere on the patient's body that functions to 'defocus' or disperse the RF current thereby preventing thermal injury to the underlying tissue. This dispersive electrode is frequently and mistakenly called a \"ground pad\" or \"neutral electrode\". However virtually all currently available RF electrosurgical systems are designed to function with isolated circuits\u2014the dispersive electrode is directly attached to the ESU, not to \"ground\". The same electrical current is transmitted across both the dispersive electrode and the active electrode, so it is not \"neutral\". The term \"return electrode\" is also technically incorrect since alternating electrical currents refer to alternating polarity, a circumstance that results in bidirectional flow across both electrodes in the circuit.\n\nBipolar instruments generally are designed with two \"active\" electrodes, such as a forceps for sealing blood vessels. However, the bipolar instrument can be designed such that one electrode is dispersive. The main advantage of bipolar instruments is that the only part of the patient included in the circuit is that which is between the two electrodes, a circumstance that eliminates the risk of current diversion and related adverse events. However, except for those devices designed to function in fluid, it is difficult to vaporize or cut tissue with bipolar instruments.\n\n== Electrical stimulation of neural and muscle cells ==\n[[Neural]] and [[muscle]] cells are electrically-excitable, i.e. they can be stimulated by electric current. In human patients such stimulation may cause acute pain, muscle spasms, and even [[cardiac arrest]]. Sensitivity of the nerve and muscle cells to electric field is due to the [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s present in their [[cell membrane]]s. Stimulation threshold does not vary much at low frequencies (so called [[rheobase]]-constant level). However, the threshold starts increasing with decreasing duration of a pulse (or a cycle) when it drops below a characteristic minimum (so called [[chronaxie]]). Typically, [[chronaxie]] of neural cells is in the range of 0.1\u201310 ms, so the sensitivity to electrical stimulation (inverse of the stimulation threshold) decreases with increasing frequency in the kHz range and above. (Note that frequency of the alternating electric current is an inverse of the duration of a single cycle).\nTo minimize the effects of muscle and neural stimulation, electrosurgical equipment typically operates in the [[radio frequency]] (RF) range of 100&nbsp;kHz to 5&nbsp;MHz.\n\nOperation at higher frequencies also helps minimizing the amount of hydrogen and oxygen generated by [[electrolysis of water]]. This is especially important consideration for applications in liquid medium in closed compartments, where generation of gas bubbles may interfere with the procedure. For example, bubbles produced during an operation inside an eye may obscure a field of view.\n\n== Common electrode configurations for devices with isolated circuits ==\nThere are several commonly used ''electrode configurations'' or circuit topologies:\n\nWith \"bipolar\" instruments the current is applied to the patient using a pair of similarly-sized electrodes. For example, special [[forceps]], with one tine connected to one pole of the RF generator and the other tine connected to the other pole of the generator. When a piece of tissue is held by the forceps, the RF alternating polarity electrical current oscillates between the two forceps tines, heating the intervening tissue by the previously described synchronous oscillation of intracellular ions.\n\nIn ''monopolar'' configuration the patient is attached to the dispersive electrode, a relatively large metal plate or a flexible metalized plastic pad which is connected to the RF generator or electrosurgical unit (ESU). The surgeon uses a pointed or blade shaped electrode called the \"active electrode\" to make contact with the tissue and exert a tissue effect...vaporization, and its linear propagation called electrosurgical cutting, or the combination of desiccation and protein coagulation used to seal blood vessels for the purpose of Hemostasis. The electric current oscillates between the active electrode and the dispersive electrode with the entire patient interposed between the two. Since the concentration of the RF current reduces with distance from the active electrode the [[electric current#Current density|current density]] rapidly (quadratically) decreases. Since the rate of tissue heating is proportional to the square of current density, the heating occurs in a very localized region, only near the portion of the electrode, usually the tip, near to or in contact with the target tissue.\n\nOn an extremity such as a finger, there is limited cross-sectional area to disperse the current, a circumstance which might result in higher current density and some heating throughout the volume of the extremity.\n\nAnother bipolar instrument is characterized with both electrodes on the same design, but the dispersive electrode is much larger than the active one. Since current density is higher in front of the smaller electrode, the heating and associated tissue effects take place only (or primarily) in front of the active electrode, and exact position of the dispersive electrode on tissue is not critical. Sometimes such configuration is called ''sesquipolar'', even though the origin of this term in Latin (''sesqui'') means a ratio of 1.5.<ref>US Patent 3987795. Electrosurgical devices having sesquipolar electrode structures incorporated therein\n</ref>\n\n=== Dedicated non-grounded machines without a dispersive electrode===\n\n{{main|Hyfrecator}}\n\nRelatively low-powered high frequency electrosurgery can be performed on conscious outpatients with no grounded machines without a dispersive electrode .<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.schuco.co.uk/pdfs/information%20fq/simple%20guide.pdf |title=see page 6 |access-date=2006-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023622/http://www.schuco.co.uk/pdfs/information%20fq/simple%20guide.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Operating at low currents with no dispersive electrode is possible because, at the medium RF frequencies (usually 100 \u2013 500&nbsp;kHz) that the machines generate, the self-[[capacitance]] of the patient's body (which is between the patient's body and the machine's ground) is large enough to allow the resulting [[displacement current]] to act as a virtual \"circuit completion path.\"\n\nOne example of such a machine is called a [[hyfrecator]]. This term began in 1940 as a Birtcher Corporation brand name Hyfrecator for \"'''Hi'''gh '''Fre'''quency Eradi'''cator'''\", but now serves generically to describe a general class of single-electrode, non-isolated (earth-referenced) low-powered electrosurgical machines intended mainly for office use. An accidental circuit completion path through an earth-ground creates the danger of a burn at a site far away from the probe electrode, and for this reason single-electrode devices are used only on conscious patients who would be aware of such complications, and only on carefully insulated tables.\n\nIn such a setting, hyfrecators are not used to cut tissue, but to destroy relatively small lesions, and also to stop bleeding in surgical incisions made by blade instruments under local anesthesia.\n\n== Electrosurgical modalities ==\n\nIn '''cutting mode''' electrode touches the tissue, and sufficiently high power density is applied to vaporize its water content. Since water vapor is not conductive under normal circumstances, electric current cannot flow through the vapor layer. Energy delivery beyond the vaporization threshold can continue if sufficiently high voltage is applied (> +/-200 V)<ref name=mechanisms>{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = On Mechanisms of Interaction in Electrosurgery | url = | journal = New Journal of Physics | volume = 10 | issue = 12| page = 123022 | doi=10.1088/1367-2630/10/12/123022| last1 = Palanker | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Vankov | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Jayaraman | first3 = Pradeep | bibcode = 2008NJPh...10l3022P | doi-access = free }}</ref> to ionize vapor and convert it into a conductive plasma. Vapor and fragments of the overheated tissue are ejected, forming a crater.<ref name=cellular/> Electrode surfaces intended to be used for cutting often feature a finer wire or wire loop, as opposed to a more flat blade with a rounded surface.\n\nCoagulation is performed using waveforms with lower average power, generating heat insufficient for explosive vaporization, but producing a thermal coagulum instead.\n\nElectrosurgical [[desiccation]] occurs when the electrode touches the tissue open to air, and the amount of generated heat is lower than that required for cutting. The tissue surface and some of the tissue more deep to the probe dries out and forms a coagulum (a dry patch of dead tissue). This technique may be used for treating nodules under the skin where minimal damage to the skin surface is desired.\n\nIn [[fulguration]] mode, the electrode is held away from the tissue, so that when the air gap between the electrode and the tissue is ionized, an [[electric arc]] discharge develops. In this approach, the burning to the tissue is more superficial, because the current is spread over the tissue area larger than the tip of electrode.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20021001/1259.html Electrosurgery for the Skin.

See illustration.]</ref> Under these conditions, superficial skin charring or carbonization is seen over a wider area than when operating in contact with the probe, and this technique is therefore used for very superficial or protrusive lesions such as skin tags. Ionization of an air gap requires voltage in the kV range.\n\nBesides the thermal effects in tissue, the electric field can produce pores in the cellular membranes \u2013 a phenomenon called [[electroporation]]. This effect may affect cells beyond the range of thermal damage.\n\n===Wet field electrosurgery===\n\nThere are wet and dry field electrosurgical devices. Wet field devices operate in a saline solution, or in an open wound. Heating is as a result of an alternating current that passes between two electrodes. Heating is usually greatest where the current density is highest. Therefore, it is usually the smallest or sharpest electrode that generates the most heat.\n\n'''Cut/Coag''' Most wet field electrosurgical systems operate in two modes: \"Cut\" causes a small area of tissue to be vaporized, and \"Coag\" causes the tissue to \"dry\" (in the sense of bleeding being stopped). \"Dried\" tissues are killed (and will later slough or be replaced by fibrotic tissue) but they are temporarily physically intact after electrosurgical application. The depth of tissue death is typically a few millimeters near the contact of the electrode.\n\n'''Cut''' If the voltage level is high enough, the heat generated can create a vapour pocket. The vapour pocket typically reaches temperatures of approximately 400 degrees Celsius, which vaporizes and explodes a small section of soft tissue, resulting in an incision.\n\n'''Coag''' When the system is operating in \"coag mode\" the voltage output is usually higher than in cut mode. Tissue remains grossly intact, but cells are destroyed at the point of contact, and smaller vessels are destroyed and sealed, stopping capillary and small-arterial bleeding.\n\n== Electrosurgical waveforms ==\nDifferent [[waveform]]s can be used for different electrosurgical procedures. For cutting, a continuous single frequency [[sine wave]] is often employed. Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of [[interstitial fluid]]. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak)<ref name=mechanisms/> the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting.<ref name=mechanisms/> In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone at the edges of the lesion. Open circuit voltage in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300\u201310,000 V peak-to-peak.\n\nHigher precision can be achieved with pulsed waveforms.<ref name=mechanisms/><ref name=cellular>{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = Electrosurgery with Cellular Precision | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 838\u2013841 | doi=10.1109/tbme.2007.914539| last1 = Palanker | first1 = D.V. | last2 = Vankov | first2 = A. | last3 = Huie | first3 = P. }}</ref> Using bursts of several tens of microseconds in duration the tissue can be cut, while the size of the heat diffusion zone does not exceed the cellular scale. Heat accumulation during repetitive application of bursts can also be avoided if sufficient delay is provided between the bursts, allowing the tissue to cool down.<ref name=cellular/>\nThe proportion of ON time to OFF time can be varied to allow control of the heating rate. A related parameter, [[duty cycle]], is defined as the ratio of the ON time to the period (the time of a single ON-OFF cycle). In the terminology of [[electrical engineering]], the process of altering this ratio to achieve an average amplitude, instead of altering the amplitude directly is called [[pulse-width modulation]].\n\nFor coagulation, the average power is typically reduced below the threshold of cutting. Typically, sine wave is turned on and off in rapid succession. The overall effect is a slower heating process, which causes tissue to coagulate. In simple coagulation/cutting mode machines, the lower duty cycle typical of coagulation mode is usually heard by the ear as a ''lower frequency'' and a rougher tone than the higher frequency tone typical of cutting mode with the same equipment.\n\nMany modern electrosurgical generators provide sophisticated wave forms with power adjusted in real time, based on changes of the tissue impedance.\n\n== Prevention of unintended harm ==\n;Burns\nFor the high power surgical uses during anesthesia the ''monopolar modality'' relies on a good electrical contact between a large area of the body (Typically at least the entire back of the patient) and the return electrode or pad (also known as dispersive pad or patient plate). Severe burns (3rd degree) can occur if the contact with the return electrode is insufficient, or when a patient comes into contact with metal objects serving as an unintended (capacitative) leakage path to Earth/Ground.\n\nTo prevent unintended burns, the skin is cleaned and a conductive gel is used to enhance the contact with the return electrode. Proper electrical grounding practices must be followed in the electrical wiring of the building. It is also recommended to use a modern ElectroSurgical Unit that includes a return electrode monitoring system that continuously tests for reliable and safe patient contact. These systems interrogate the impedance of a split or dual-pad return electrode and will alarm out, disabling further generator output in case of fault. Prior generators relied on single pad return electrodes and thus had no means of verifying safe patient connection. Return electrodes should always have full contact with the skin and be placed on the same side of the body and close to the body part where the procedure is occurring.\n\nIf there is any metal in the body of the patient, the return electrode is placed on the opposite side of the body from the metal and be placed between the metal and the operation site. This prevents current from passing selectively through metal on the way to the return electrode. For example, for a patient who has had a right sided hip replacement who is scheduled for surgery, the return electrode is placed on the left side of the body on the lateral side of the lower abdomen, which places the return electrode between the location of the metal and the surgical site and on the opposite side from the metal. If there is metal on both sides of the body, the return electrode is placed between the metal and the procedure site when possible. Common return electrode locations include lateral portions of the outer thighs, abdomen, back, or shoulder blades.<ref name=McCauley2003/>\n\nThe use of the bipolar option does not require the placement of a return electrode because the current only passes between tines of the forceps or other bipolar output device.\n\nElectrosurgery should only be performed by a physician who has received specific training in this field and who is familiar with the techniques used to prevent burns.\n\n;Smoke toxicity\nConcerns have also been raised regarding the toxicity of [[surgical smoke]] produced by electrosurgery. This has been shown to contain chemicals which may cause harm by inhalation by the patients, surgeon or operating theatre staff.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21898022 | doi=10.1007/s00464-011-1872-1 | volume=26 | issue=2 | title=A single-blind controlled study of electrocautery and ultrasonic scalpel smoke plumes in laparoscopic surgery | date=February 2012 |vauthors=Fitzgerald JE, Malik M, Ahmed I | journal=Surg Endosc | pages=337\u201342}}</ref><ref>Karjalainen M, Kontunen A, Saari S, R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 T, Lekkala J, Roine A, et al.

Its benefits include the ability to make precise cuts with limited blood loss. Electrosurgical devices are frequently used during surgical operations helping to prevent blood loss in hospital operating rooms or in outpatient procedures.<ref name=McCauley2003/>\n\nIn electrosurgical procedures, the tissue is heated by an [[electric current]]. Although electrical devices that create a heated probe may be used for the [[cauterization]] of tissue in some applications, electrosurgery refers to a different method than [[electrocautery]]. Electrocautery uses [[heat conduction]] from a probe heated to a high temperature by a direct electrical current (much in the manner of a soldering iron). This may be accomplished by direct current from dry-cells in a penlight-type device.\n\nElectrosurgery, by contrast, uses radio frequency (RF) alternating current to heat the tissue by RF induced intracellular oscillation of ionized molecules that result in an elevation of intracellular temperature. When the intracellular temperature reaches 60 degrees C, instantaneous cell death occurs. If tissue is heated to 60\u201399 degrees C, the simultaneous processes of tissue desiccation (dehydration) and protein coagulation occur. If the intracellular temperature rapidly reaches 100 degrees C, the intracellular contents undergo a liquid to gas conversion, massive volumetric expansion, and resulting explosive vaporization.\n\nAppropriately applied with electrosurgical forceps, desiccation and coagulation result in the occlusion of blood vessels and halting of bleeding. While the process is technically a process of ''electrocoagulation'', the term \"electrocautery\" is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. The process of vaporization can be used to ablate tissue targets, or, by linear extension, used to transect or cut tissue. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high voltage current to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated. The continued application of current to this highly impedant tissue results in resistive heating and the achievement of very high temperatures\u2014enough to cause breakdown of the organic molecules to sugars and even carbon, thus the dark textures from carbonization of tissue.\n\n[[Diathermy]] is used by some as a synonym for electrosurgery but in other contexts [[diathermy]] means [[dielectric heating]], produced by rotation of molecular dipoles in a high frequency electromagnetic field. This effect is most widely used in [[microwave oven]]s or some tissue ablative devices which operate at gigahertz frequencies. Lower frequencies, allowing for deeper penetration, are used in industrial processes.\n\nRF electrosurgery is commonly used in virtually all surgical disciplines including dermatological, gynecological, cardiac, plastic, ocular, spine, ENT, maxillofacial, orthopedic, urological, neuro- and general surgical procedures as well as certain dental procedures.\n\nRF electrosurgery is performed using a RF electrosurgical generator (also referred to as an electrosurgical unit or ESU) and a handpiece including one or two electrodes\u2014a monopolar or bipolar instrument. All RF electrosurgery is bipolar so the difference between monopolar and bipolar instruments is that monopolar instruments comprise only one electrode while bipolar instruments include both electrodes in their design.\n\nThe monopolar instrument called an \"active electrode\" when energized, requires the application of another monopolar instrument called a \"dispersive electrode\" elsewhere on the patient's body that functions to 'defocus' or disperse the RF current thereby preventing thermal injury to the underlying tissue. This dispersive electrode is frequently and mistakenly called a \"ground pad\" or \"neutral electrode\". However virtually all currently available RF electrosurgical systems are designed to function with isolated circuits\u2014the dispersive electrode is directly attached to the ESU, not to \"ground\". The same electrical current is transmitted across both the dispersive electrode and the active electrode, so it is not \"neutral\". The term \"return electrode\" is also technically incorrect since alternating electrical currents refer to alternating polarity, a circumstance that results in bidirectional flow across both electrodes in the circuit.\n\nBipolar instruments generally are designed with two \"active\" electrodes, such as a forceps for sealing blood vessels. However, the bipolar instrument can be designed such that one electrode is dispersive. The main advantage of bipolar instruments is that the only part of the patient included in the circuit is that which is between the two electrodes, a circumstance that eliminates the risk of current diversion and related adverse events. However, except for those devices designed to function in fluid, it is difficult to vaporize or cut tissue with bipolar instruments.\n\n== Electrical stimulation of neural and muscle cells ==\n[[Neural]] and [[muscle]] cells are electrically-excitable, i.e. they can be stimulated by electric current. In human patients such stimulation may cause acute pain, muscle spasms, and even [[cardiac arrest]]. Sensitivity of the nerve and muscle cells to electric field is due to the [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s present in their [[cell membrane]]s. Stimulation threshold does not vary much at low frequencies (so called [[rheobase]]-constant level). However, the threshold starts increasing with decreasing duration of a pulse (or a cycle) when it drops below a characteristic minimum (so called [[chronaxie]]). Typically, [[chronaxie]] of neural cells is in the range of 0.1\u201310 ms, so the sensitivity to electrical stimulation (inverse of the stimulation threshold) decreases with increasing frequency in the kHz range and above. (Note that frequency of the alternating electric current is an inverse of the duration of a single cycle).\nTo minimize the effects of muscle and neural stimulation, electrosurgical equipment typically operates in the [[radio frequency]] (RF) range of 100&nbsp;kHz to 5&nbsp;MHz.\n\nOperation at higher frequencies also helps minimizing the amount of hydrogen and oxygen generated by [[electrolysis of water]]. This is especially important consideration for applications in liquid medium in closed compartments, where generation of gas bubbles may interfere with the procedure. For example, bubbles produced during an operation inside an eye may obscure a field of view.\n\n== Common electrode configurations for devices with isolated circuits ==\nThere are several commonly used ''electrode configurations'' or circuit topologies:\n\nWith \"bipolar\" instruments the current is applied to the patient using a pair of similarly-sized electrodes. For example, special [[forceps]], with one tine connected to one pole of the RF generator and the other tine connected to the other pole of the generator. When a piece of tissue is held by the forceps, the RF alternating polarity electrical current oscillates between the two forceps tines, heating the intervening tissue by the previously described synchronous oscillation of intracellular ions.\n\nIn ''monopolar'' configuration the patient is attached to the dispersive electrode, a relatively large metal plate or a flexible metalized plastic pad which is connected to the RF generator or electrosurgical unit (ESU). The surgeon uses a pointed or blade shaped electrode called the \"active electrode\" to make contact with the tissue and exert a tissue effect...vaporization, and its linear propagation called electrosurgical cutting, or the combination of desiccation and protein coagulation used to seal blood vessels for the purpose of Hemostasis. The electric current oscillates between the active electrode and the dispersive electrode with the entire patient interposed between the two. Since the concentration of the RF current reduces with distance from the active electrode the [[electric current#Current density|current density]] rapidly (quadratically) decreases. Since the rate of tissue heating is proportional to the square of current density, the heating occurs in a very localized region, only near the portion of the electrode, usually the tip, near to or in contact with the target tissue.\n\nOn an extremity such as a finger, there is limited cross-sectional area to disperse the current, a circumstance which might result in higher current density and some heating throughout the volume of the extremity.\n\nAnother bipolar instrument is characterized with both electrodes on the same design, but the dispersive electrode is much larger than the active one. Since current density is higher in front of the smaller electrode, the heating and associated tissue effects take place only (or primarily) in front of the active electrode, and exact position of the dispersive electrode on tissue is not critical. Sometimes such configuration is called ''sesquipolar'', even though the origin of this term in Latin (''sesqui'') means a ratio of 1.5.<ref>US Patent 3987795. Electrosurgical devices having sesquipolar electrode structures incorporated therein\n</ref>\n\n=== Dedicated non-grounded machines without a dispersive electrode===\n\n{{main|Hyfrecator}}\n\nRelatively low-powered high frequency electrosurgery can be performed on conscious outpatients with no grounded machines without a dispersive electrode .<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.schuco.co.uk/pdfs/information%20fq/simple%20guide.pdf |title=see page 6 |access-date=2006-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023622/http://www.schuco.co.uk/pdfs/information%20fq/simple%20guide.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Operating at low currents with no dispersive electrode is possible because, at the medium RF frequencies (usually 100 \u2013 500&nbsp;kHz) that the machines generate, the self-[[capacitance]] of the patient's body (which is between the patient's body and the machine's ground) is large enough to allow the resulting [[displacement current]] to act as a virtual \"circuit completion path.\"\n\nOne example of such a machine is called a [[hyfrecator]]. This term began in 1940 as a Birtcher Corporation brand name Hyfrecator for \"'''Hi'''gh '''Fre'''quency Eradi'''cator'''\", but now serves generically to describe a general class of single-electrode, non-isolated (earth-referenced) low-powered electrosurgical machines intended mainly for office use. An accidental circuit completion path through an earth-ground creates the danger of a burn at a site far away from the probe electrode, and for this reason single-electrode devices are used only on conscious patients who would be aware of such complications, and only on carefully insulated tables.\n\nIn such a setting, hyfrecators are not used to cut tissue, but to destroy relatively small lesions, and also to stop bleeding in surgical incisions made by blade instruments under local anesthesia.\n\n== Electrosurgical modalities ==\n\nIn '''cutting mode''' electrode touches the tissue, and sufficiently high power density is applied to vaporize its water content. Since water vapor is not conductive under normal circumstances, electric current cannot flow through the vapor layer. Energy delivery beyond the vaporization threshold can continue if sufficiently high voltage is applied (> +/-200 V)<ref name=mechanisms>{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = On Mechanisms of Interaction in Electrosurgery | url = | journal = New Journal of Physics | volume = 10 | issue = 12| page = 123022 | doi=10.1088/1367-2630/10/12/123022| last1 = Palanker | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Vankov | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Jayaraman | first3 = Pradeep | bibcode = 2008NJPh...10l3022P | doi-access = free }}</ref> to ionize vapor and convert it into a conductive plasma. Vapor and fragments of the overheated tissue are ejected, forming a crater.<ref name=cellular/> Electrode surfaces intended to be used for cutting often feature a finer wire or wire loop, as opposed to a more flat blade with a rounded surface.\n\nCoagulation is performed using waveforms with lower average power, generating heat insufficient for explosive vaporization, but producing a thermal coagulum instead.\n\nElectrosurgical [[desiccation]] occurs when the electrode touches the tissue open to air, and the amount of generated heat is lower than that required for cutting. The tissue surface and some of the tissue more deep to the probe dries out and forms a coagulum (a dry patch of dead tissue). This technique may be used for treating nodules under the skin where minimal damage to the skin surface is desired.\n\nIn [[fulguration]] mode, the electrode is held away from the tissue, so that when the air gap between the electrode and the tissue is ionized, an [[electric arc]] discharge develops. In this approach, the burning to the tissue is more superficial, because the current is spread over the tissue area larger than the tip of electrode.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20021001/1259.html Electrosurgery for the Skin.

See illustration.]</ref> Under these conditions, superficial skin charring or carbonization is seen over a wider area than when operating in contact with the probe, and this technique is therefore used for very superficial or protrusive lesions such as skin tags. Ionization of an air gap requires voltage in the kV range.\n\nBesides the thermal effects in tissue, the electric field can produce pores in the cellular membranes \u2013 a phenomenon called [[electroporation]]. This effect may affect cells beyond the range of thermal damage.\n\n===Wet field electrosurgery===\n\nThere are wet and dry field electrosurgical devices. Wet field devices operate in a saline solution, or in an open wound. Heating is as a result of an alternating current that passes between two electrodes. Heating is usually greatest where the current density is highest. Therefore, it is usually the smallest or sharpest electrode that generates the most heat.\n\n'''Cut/Coag''' Most wet field electrosurgical systems operate in two modes: \"Cut\" causes a small area of tissue to be vaporized, and \"Coag\" causes the tissue to \"dry\" (in the sense of bleeding being stopped). \"Dried\" tissues are killed (and will later slough or be replaced by fibrotic tissue) but they are temporarily physically intact after electrosurgical application. The depth of tissue death is typically a few millimeters near the contact of the electrode.\n\n'''Cut''' If the voltage level is high enough, the heat generated can create a vapour pocket. The vapour pocket typically reaches temperatures of approximately 400 degrees Celsius, which vaporizes and explodes a small section of soft tissue, resulting in an incision.\n\n'''Coag''' When the system is operating in \"coag mode\" the voltage output is usually higher than in cut mode. Tissue remains grossly intact, but cells are destroyed at the point of contact, and smaller vessels are destroyed and sealed, stopping capillary and small-arterial bleeding.\n\n== Electrosurgical waveforms ==\nDifferent [[waveform]]s can be used for different electrosurgical procedures. For cutting, a continuous single frequency [[sine wave]] is often employed. Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of [[interstitial fluid]]. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak)<ref name=mechanisms/> the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting.<ref name=mechanisms/> In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone at the edges of the lesion. Open circuit voltage in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300\u201310,000 V peak-to-peak.\n\nHigher precision can be achieved with pulsed waveforms.<ref name=mechanisms/><ref name=cellular>{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = Electrosurgery with Cellular Precision | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 838\u2013841 | doi=10.1109/tbme.2007.914539| last1 = Palanker | first1 = D.V. | last2 = Vankov | first2 = A. | last3 = Huie | first3 = P. }}</ref> Using bursts of several tens of microseconds in duration the tissue can be cut, while the size of the heat diffusion zone does not exceed the cellular scale. Heat accumulation during repetitive application of bursts can also be avoided if sufficient delay is provided between the bursts, allowing the tissue to cool down.<ref name=cellular/>\nThe proportion of ON time to OFF time can be varied to allow control of the heating rate. A related parameter, [[duty cycle]], is defined as the ratio of the ON time to the period (the time of a single ON-OFF cycle). In the terminology of [[electrical engineering]], the process of altering this ratio to achieve an average amplitude, instead of altering the amplitude directly is called [[pulse-width modulation]].\n\nFor coagulation, the average power is typically reduced below the threshold of cutting. Typically, sine wave is turned on and off in rapid succession. The overall effect is a slower heating process, which causes tissue to coagulate. In simple coagulation/cutting mode machines, the lower duty cycle typical of coagulation mode is usually heard by the ear as a ''lower frequency'' and a rougher tone than the higher frequency tone typical of cutting mode with the same equipment.\n\nMany modern electrosurgical generators provide sophisticated wave forms with power adjusted in real time, based on changes of the tissue impedance.\n\n== Prevention of unintended harm ==\n;Burns\nFor the high power surgical uses during anesthesia the ''monopolar modality'' relies on a good electrical contact between a large area of the body (Typically at least the entire back of the patient) and the return electrode or pad (also known as dispersive pad or patient plate). Severe burns (3rd degree) can occur if the contact with the return electrode is insufficient, or when a patient comes into contact with metal objects serving as an unintended (capacitative) leakage path to Earth/Ground.\n\nTo prevent unintended burns, the skin is cleaned and a conductive gel is used to enhance the contact with the return electrode. Proper electrical grounding practices must be followed in the electrical wiring of the building. It is also recommended to use a modern ElectroSurgical Unit that includes a return electrode monitoring system that continuously tests for reliable and safe patient contact. These systems interrogate the impedance of a split or dual-pad return electrode and will alarm out, disabling further generator output in case of fault. Prior generators relied on single pad return electrodes and thus had no means of verifying safe patient connection. Return electrodes should always have full contact with the skin and be placed on the same side of the body and close to the body part where the procedure is occurring.\n\nIf there is any metal in the body of the patient, the return electrode is placed on the opposite side of the body from the metal and be placed between the metal and the operation site. This prevents current from passing selectively through metal on the way to the return electrode. For example, for a patient who has had a right sided hip replacement who is scheduled for surgery, the return electrode is placed on the left side of the body on the lateral side of the lower abdomen, which places the return electrode between the location of the metal and the surgical site and on the opposite side from the metal. If there is metal on both sides of the body, the return electrode is placed between the metal and the procedure site when possible. Common return electrode locations include lateral portions of the outer thighs, abdomen, back, or shoulder blades.<ref name=McCauley2003/>\n\nThe use of the bipolar option does not require the placement of a return electrode because the current only passes between tines of the forceps or other bipolar output device.\n\nElectrosurgery should only be performed by a physician who has received specific training in this field and who is familiar with the techniques used to prevent burns.\n\n;Smoke toxicity\nConcerns have also been raised regarding the toxicity of [[surgical smoke]] produced by electrosurgery. This has been shown to contain chemicals which may cause harm by inhalation by the patients, surgeon or operating theatre staff.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21898022 | doi=10.1007/s00464-011-1872-1 | volume=26 | issue=2 | title=A single-blind controlled study of electrocautery and ultrasonic scalpel smoke plumes in laparoscopic surgery | date=February 2012 |vauthors=Fitzgerald JE, Malik M, Ahmed I | journal=Surg Endosc | pages=337\u201342}}</ref><ref>Karjalainen M, Kontunen A, Saari S, R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 T, Lekkala J, Roine A, et al.

When Thales did not meet this deadline Edmonton gave Thales a \"notice of default\".  On September 13, 2018, Edmonton announced Thales had promised the signalling system would be fully functional by December 2018.<ref name=thestar2018-09-13/>  Edmonton also announced there was a backup plan, to keep the route functioning, if Thales failed to deliver.\n\nIn April 2019, the City of Edmonton terminated its contract with Thales, and is actively seeking other options to complete the line and bring it up to full service. According to testing completed in December 2018, the Thales signalling system could not keep trains on schedule, and caused trains to stop unexpectedly.
