Aside from recording the village's name the book also shows that the area was an established manor before [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] times, paying a very large amount of tax in comparison to its size, saying; 'Settone : Gamel had 1 manor of 4 carucates for geld and 2 ploughs can be there'.<ref name=\"E 31/2/2/4211\">{{cite book|title=299r Great Domesday Book|year=1086|location=The National Archives, Kew|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=D7311180}}</ref> The quote then continues: 'Now Nigel has it of the Count of Mortain,and it is waste', which is a reference to the land being subsequently seized and laid waste by [[William the Conqueror]] during his [[scorched earth]] campaign to [[The Harrying of the North|end dissent in the north]]. The dramatic effect of this action can be seen in the value of the land, which fell from \u00a340 per year to only \u00a31 per year in the period to 1086 following William's campaign.<ref>{{OpenDomesday|OS=SE7841|name=seaton-ross|display=Seaton Ross|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe village gave its name to the newly installed ruling family, the Seatons, who held the land for a time until they had their property seized as a result of their support of the Scots during the reign of [[Edward I]], and tenure was passed to Edmund de Mauley as a reward for his support of the king.<ref name=\"Bulmer\"/> The village was passed by descent to the [[Baron de Ros|de Ros family]], who owned much land in the area including that of the nearby villages of [[Storwood]] and [[Melbourne, East Riding of Yorkshire|Melbourne]],<ref>{{cite web|editor-first=K J |editor-last=Allison |first=A P |last=Baggs|first2= G H R |last2=Kent|first3= J D |last3=Purdy|title=Thornton|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=23024|work=A History of the County of York East Riding: Volume 3: Ouse and Derwent wapentake, and part of Harthill wapentake|publisher=Victoria County History|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> and the village came to be referred to as 'Seaton Ross' for the first time.

There is also a memorial outside the village dedicated to the crews of the 109 aircraft that were lost from the airfield.\n\nThe airfield ceased operations in 1945 and stopped flights in 1946, it is now owned by York Raceway who host drag events on the old runways throughout the summer.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|title=Gazetteer &mdash; A\u2013Z of Towns Villages and Hamlets|year=2006|publisher=East Riding of Yorkshire Council|page=10<!--|accessdate=11 February 2011-->}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Seaton Ross}}\n\n{{Portalbar|Yorkshire|England|United Kingdom}}\n{{East Yorkshire|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in the East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes in the East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n", "name_user": "Indoreli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaton_Ross"}
