While the [[Scottish Cup]] includes all the teams within the SPFL, the competition is run and organised by the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\n==Background==\nA [[Scottish football league system]] was first created in 1890, when the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) was formed. Traditionally the league had a two divisional structure (Divisions One and Two) between which clubs were [[promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]] at the end of each season. By the mid-1970s, this organisation was perceived to be stagnant, and it was decided to split into a three divisional structure: [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] (formerly Division One), [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] (formerly Division Two) and a newly added [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This system came into force for the [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376]] season. This setup continued until the [[1994\u201395 in Scottish football|1994\u201395]] season, when a four divisional structure was introduced, along with a new [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], with all four divisions consisting of ten clubs.\n\nOn 8 September 1997, the Premier Division clubs decided to split from the Scottish Football League and form the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL), following the example of the [[English Premier League]].<ref name=\"121218 plan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22132504 |title=Scottish clubs set for vote on league reconstruction proposals |publisher=BBC |first=Chris |last=McLaughlin |date=14 April 2013 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> This decision was fuelled by a desire by the top clubs in Scotland to control more of the revenue generated by the game and to negotiate its contracts with sponsors and broadcasters.<ref name=\"121218 plan\"/> SFL revenues had been divided proportionally between clubs in all four divisions.

While the [[Scottish Cup]] includes all the teams within the SPFL, the competition is run and organised by the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\n==Background==\nA [[Scottish football league system]] was first created in 1890, when the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) was formed. Traditionally the league had a two divisional structure (Divisions One and Two) between which clubs were [[promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]] at the end of each season. By the mid-1970s, this organisation was perceived to be stagnant, and it was decided to split into a three divisional structure: [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] (formerly Division One), [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] (formerly Division Two) and a newly added [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This system came into force for the [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376]] season. This setup continued until the [[1994\u201395 in Scottish football|1994\u201395]] season, when a four divisional structure was introduced, along with a new [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], with all four divisions consisting of ten clubs.\n\nOn 8 September 1997, the Premier Division clubs decided to split from the Scottish Football League and form the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL), following the example of the [[English Premier League]].<ref name=\"121218 plan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22132504 |title=Scottish clubs set for vote on league reconstruction proposals |publisher=BBC |first=Chris |last=McLaughlin |date=14 April 2013 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> This decision was fuelled by a desire by the top clubs in Scotland to control more of the revenue generated by the game and to negotiate its contracts with sponsors and broadcasters.<ref name=\"121218 plan\"/> SFL revenues had been divided proportionally between clubs in all four divisions.

Sickles felt the slightly higher ground forward of his placement by Meade was better ground to defend and pushed units forward several hundred yards. This put him in a situation where there was a significant gap between his left flank and Sykes' V Corps right flank. This gap made the holding of the federal line a close-run thing. The 17th as part of Birney's Division was pushed forward to occupy the stone wall at the western edge of the Wheat Field abutting the woods there. Only the intervention of the V Corps saved the II Corps from annihilation. 17th Maine saw hot and heavy action being attacked from two sides. Seven of the color bearers were shot down before the order to retreat back to Cemetery Ridge was given.
