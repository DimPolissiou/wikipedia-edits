He was sold to West Bromwich Albion a year later and was their top scorer with nine league goals in 1985-86, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated in bottom place with just 4 wins in the league. He was then sold to Manchester City, and was unable to prevent their relegation the following season, although he did help them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in his second campaign there. He was nicknamed \"Imre Banana\" by the City fans, following the [[inflatable banana]] craze which the club's fans helped start that season.\n\nHe left [[Maine Road]] to sign for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] for a second time in the summer of 1988, and spent two seasons there, before they were relegated to the Second Division and he was sold to newly promoted [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. He spent three seasons at [[Elland Road]], but rarely played after his [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91]] first season there, and did not make enough appearances in [[1991-92 in English football|1991-92]] to earn a league title medal. He had loan spells at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] before dropping down two divisions to sign for [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in the summer of 1993.\n\nHe spent two seasons at [[Millmoor]], scoring 25 Division Two goals, before brief spells at [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. He called time on his professional career in 1995 when he became player-manager of non-league [[Matlock Town F.C.|Matlock Town]], where he spent two years.\n\nIn 1984, he was approached by the Hungarian FA as to his willingness to play for Hungary, but he turned them down, pointing out that they already had good strikers and attacking midfielders.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.leeds-fans.org.uk/leeds/history/77.html\n|title=Leeds United: Season 1991 - 1992: Division One\n|publisher=leeds-fans.org.uk\n|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Post-retirement==\n\nHe became a fully licensed [[FIFA]] Agent in March 2004 and provides commentary on games for both [[PA Sport]] (for the [[Football Live]] project) and [[BBC Radio Sheffield]].<ref name=hattersheroes/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n\n{{Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

[[football in England]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\nBorn in [[Paddington]], Varadi started out in [[non-league football]] with [[Letchworth F.C.|Letchworth]] before joining [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1978, shortly before his nineteenth birthday.<ref name=\"hattersheroes\">{{cite book\n  | title=Hatters Heroes\n  | publisher=Roger Wash\n  | first= Roger\n  | last= Wash\n

appearances in the colours of any team he played for.\n\nFrom Sheffield United, he moved on to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Sheffield Wednesday

enough games to earn a winner's medal. He was also part of the Sheffield Wednesday side that won promotion to the First Division in 1984, after 14 years away. He was sold to West Bromwich Albion a year later and was their top scorer with nine league goals in 1985-86, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated in bottom place with just 4 wins in the league. He was then sold to Manchester City, and was unable to prevent their relegation the following season, although he did help them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in his second campaign there. He was nicknamed \"Imre Banana\" by the City fans, following the [[inflatable banana]] craze which the club's fans helped start that season.\n\nHe left [[Maine Road]] to sign for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] for a second time in the summer of 1988, and spent two seasons there, before they were relegated to the Second Division and he was sold to newly promoted [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. He spent three seasons at [[Elland Road]], but rarely played after his [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91]] first season there, and did not make enough appearances in [[1991-92 in English football|1991-92]] to earn a league title medal. He had loan spells at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] before dropping down two divisions to sign for [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in the summer of 1993.\n\nHe spent two seasons at [[Millmoor]], scoring 25 Division Two goals, before brief spells at [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. He called time on his professional career in 1995 when he became player-manager of non-league [[Matlock Town F.C.|Matlock Town]], where he spent two years.\n\nIn 1984, he was approached by the Hungarian FA as to his willingness to play for Hungary, but he turned them down, pointing out that they already had good strikers and attacking midfielders.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.leeds-fans.org.uk/leeds/history/77.html\n|title=Leeds United: Season 1991 - 1992: Division One\n|publisher=leeds-fans.org.uk\n|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Post-retirement==\n\nHe became a fully licensed [[FIFA]] Agent in March 2004 and provides commentary on games for both [[PA Sport]] (for the [[Football Live]] project) and [[BBC Radio Sheffield]].<ref name=hattersheroes/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n\n{{Sheffield Wednesday F.C.
