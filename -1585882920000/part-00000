Severe allergic reactions to ''Pterois'' venom include [[chest pain]], severe breathing difficulties, a drop in [[blood pressure]], swelling of the tongue, sweating, runny nose, or slurred speech.

Researchers hope to discover what moderates lionfish populations in the Indo-Pacific and apply this information to control the invasive populations, without introducing additional invasive species.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}  \n\nThere are two new trap designs that have been introduced to help with deep water control of the lionfish. The traps are low and vertical and remain open the entire time of deployment. The vertical relief of the trap attracts lionfish which makes it easier to catch them. These new traps are good for catching lionfish without affecting the native species that are ecologically, recreationally, and commercially important to the surrounding areas. These traps are more beneficial than older traps because they limit the potential of catching non-invasive creatures, they have bait that is only appealing to lionfish, they guarantee a catch, and they are easy to transport. <ref>(JB)https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/science/conservation/lionfish-trap-guide.html</ref>\n\nRigorous and repeated removal of lionfish from invaded waters could potentially control the exponential expansion of the lionfish in invaded waters.<ref name=a /> A 2010 study showed effective maintenance would require the monthly harvest of at least 27% of the adult population.

This could ultimately lead to reef deterioration and could negatively influence Atlantic [[trophic cascade]].<ref name=m /> Lionfish have already been shown to overpopulate reef areas and display aggressive tendencies, forcing native species to move to waters where conditions might be less than desirable.<ref name=a />\n\nLionfish could be reducing Atlantic reef diversity by up to 80%.<ref name=\"n\"/> In July 2011, lionfish were reported for the first time in the [[Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary]] off the coast of Louisiana.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.wdsu.com/news/28781108/detail.html|title=Lionfish Invasion Reaches Gulf Marine Sanctuary|date=2011|work=|access-date=|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sanctuary officials said they believe the species will be a permanent fixture, but hope to monitor and possibly limit their presence.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSince lionfish thrive so well in the Atlantic and the Caribbean due to nutrient-rich waters and lack of predators, the species has spread tremendously.

NOAA has research foci include investigating biotechnical solutions for control of the population, and understanding how the larvae are dispersed.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Another important area of study is what controls the population in its native area. Researchers hope to discover what moderates lionfish populations in the Indo-Pacific and apply this information to control the invasive populations, without introducing additional invasive species.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}  \n\nThere are two new trap designs that have been introduced to help with deep water control of the lionfish. The traps are low and vertical and remain open the entire time of deployment. The vertical relief of the trap attracts lionfish which makes it easier to catch them. These new traps are good for catching lionfish without affecting the native species that are ecologically, recreationally, and commercially important to the surrounding areas. These traps are more beneficial than older traps because they limit the potential of catching non-invasive creatures, they have bait that is only appealing to lionfish, they guarantee a catch, and they are easy to transport. <ref>(JB)https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/science/conservation/lionfish-trap-guide.html</ref>\n\nRigorous and repeated removal of lionfish from invaded waters could potentially control the exponential expansion of the lionfish in invaded waters.<ref name=a /> A 2010 study showed effective maintenance would require the monthly harvest of at least 27% of the adult population.

Types of democracy can cluster around values. For example, some like direct democracy, electronic democracy, participatory democracy, real democracy, deliberative democracy, and pure democracy strive to allow people to participate equally and directly in protest, discussion, decision-making, or other acts of politics. Different types of democracy - like representative democracy - strive for indirect participation as this procedural approach to collective \nself-governance is still widely considered the only means for the more or less stable democratic functioning of mass societies.<ref name=\"JHUPress\">Larry Jay Diamond, Marc F.
