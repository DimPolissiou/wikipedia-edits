In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]), \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\". The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019. Among the [[List of awards and nominations received by Sia|accolades]] received by Sia are nearly a dozen [[ARIA Awards]], 9 [[Grammy Award]] nominations, and an [[MTV Video Music Award]].<ref name=ARIA2014>{{cite web| url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/40788/Chet-Faker-and-Violent-Soho-lead-20sheeran14-ARIA-nominations|title=Chet Faker and Violent Soholead 2014 ARIA nominations|publisher=fasterlouder|accessdate=5 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===1975\u20131997: Early life and career beginnings===\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in [[Adelaide]], South Australia.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]), \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\". The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019.

His appointment as chairman (mayor) of Ikwo Local Government shot him into the political lime light and he has continued to be a proponent of youth development in his state. Ogbuewu who until August 2010 was a member of the ruling [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP) sought his former party's gubernatorial ticket in 2007 against incumbent governor of Ebonyi State, Chief [[Martin Elechi]] but lost. He later vied for the PDP national chairmanship position but was not successful.

''Nigeria in Pictures''. Page 71</ref> and is the last born of his mother Oginyi Nchita. His father was a traditionalist who specialized in native herbal treatment as well as being a reputable hunter. A one time monogamist, Ambassador Ogbuewu now has seven children from two wives. The first four (3 boys and a girl) are from his first wife, Mrs. Eunice Ebin Ogbuewu. Eunice, a native of Etung Local Government Area in Cross River State was legally married to Ogbuewu for 22+ years before their separation. Frank Ogbuewu is currently married to his second wife, Mrs. Rebbecca Ogbuewu, a native of Ezza LGA with whom he currently has 3 children.\n\n==Political career==\nOgbuewu's venture into politics came as a surprise to both his family and friends. A former immigration officer, Frank Ogbuewu retired from civil service as an Assistant Superintendent of Immigration. While in retirement, he registered as a member of the defunct [[National Republican Convention]] (N. R. C) party to enable him run for political office. His first attempt was the local government chairmanship position in his county. Ogbuewu took his campaign to every nook and cranny of his LGA but his efforts were soon stopped as the electoral process was circumvented by the then military administration of late General Sani Abacha in 1993. In 1994, Ogbuewu was later appointed as chairman caretaker committee for his Local Government Area, Ikwo. The tenure lasted for two years. After the death of General Sani Abacha and the appointment of General Abdulsalami Alhaji Abubakar (rtd) as Nigeria's military head of state, registration of new political parties commenced and elections were scheduled to be held in Nigeria for a civilian hand over. Ogbuewu registered as a member of the defunct All People's Party to contest the gubernatorial election but lost in the primaries to Chief Ogbonnaya Onu, current Chairman of the All Nigeria People's Party. Ogbuewu was to later join the People Democratic Party (PDP) and was instrumental to the successful election of Dr. Sam Egwu as the first governor of the young state. In 1999, Frank Ogbuewu was nominated for an ambassadorial position which was ratified by the senate. He was tasked with re-opening Nigeria's embassy in Greece which had been shut down for quite some time. Frank Ogbuewu served as Nigeria's Ambassador to Greece from 1999-2003.\n\n[[Image:Delivering form.JPG|thumb|left|Ambassador Ogbuewu at APGA's Secetariat delivering his Gubernatorial expression form and meeting with APGA's Chairman, Chief Umeh]]\nIn 2003, the Obasanjo administration recalled him back to Nigeria to head the ministry of Culture and Tourism. In 2006, Ambassador Ogbuewu resigned his position as Nigeria's minister of culture and tourism to contest the gubernatorial election being held in 2007 in Ebonyi State under the umbrella of the People Democratic Party (PDP). The gubernatorial primaries which had about thirteen (13) PDP aspirants including the current governor, Chief Martin Elechi ended up being a contest between just two individuals. It is on record that Ogbuewu was the only candidate who refused to step down and accept a sole candidacy of Chief Elechi at the primaries held in the township stadium, Abakaliki. Ogbuewu lost the primaries as he polled just over 580 votes compared to Elechi's over 2000 delegate votes. In 2008 after an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid, Ambassador Ogbuewu expressed interest in the Peoples Democratic Party's national chairmanship position that was zoned to the south eastern states of Abia, Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra and Enugu. Notable politicians like Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, former Senate President Pius Anyim and Ex-Governor of Ebonyi State, Dr. Sam Egwu also indicated interest in the position. Ebonyi State seemed to be the favoured state of all the five South Eastern State but the state governor was not disposed to the candidacy of any of the aspirants from his state.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of people from Ebonyi State]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ogbuewu, Frank Nchita}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Ebonyi State]]\n[[Category:Igbo politicians]]\n[[Category:People's Democratic Party (Nigeria) politicians]]\n[[Category:Federal ministers of Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Mayors of places in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Nigeria to Greece]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Politician\n|name                   = Frank Nchita Ogbuewu\n|image                  = Ambassador Ogbuewu.jpg|Ambassador Ogbuewu\n|order                  = Politician \n|headquarters           = No. 19 Onitsha Street, [[Abakaliki]], [[Ebonyi State]]\n|term_start1            = \n|term_end1              = \n|successor1             = \n|birth_date             = {{birth date and age|1953|12|12|df=y}}\n|birth_place            = [[Abina - Amagu, Ikwo LGA, Ebonyi State]], [[Nigeria]]\n|death_date             = \n|Educational background = BSc.

Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the '''Peddie Institute''' in honor of philanthropist and politician [[Thomas B. Peddie]], who gave the school $25,000 ($500,000 in 2015 dollars). In 1923 the school was formally renamed The Peddie School, which is as it remained until 2005 when the school was renamed Peddie School and the present logo was created.<ref>[http://www.peddie.org/Page/About-Us/History--Traditions History], The Peddie School.

Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the '''Peddie Institute''' in honor of philanthropist and politician [[Thomas B. Peddie]], who gave the school $25,000 ($500,000 in 2015 dollars). In 1923 the school was formally renamed The Peddie School, which is as it remained until 2005 when the school was renamed Peddie School and the present logo was created.<ref>[http://www.peddie.org/Page/About-Us/History--Traditions History], The Peddie School. Accessed October 10, 2019.</ref>\n\nPeddie remained coeducational until 1908, when, for social and economic reasons, it decided to admit boys only. This was reversed in the early 1970s, and girls were readmitted. Today, the school is coeducational and non-denominational.\n\nIn 1993, former [[Ambassador]] [[Walter Annenberg]] (Class of 1927) gave $100 million to Peddie, the largest donation ever made to a U.S. secondary school at the time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/us/publisher-gives-365-million-to-4-schools.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"Publisher Gives $365 Million To 4 Schools\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 20, 1993.</ref>\n\nWhile previous generous gifts by Annenberg helped the school build a library, dormitories, an athletic center, and a science center, the legendary gift of $100 million was made to see Peddie become accessible to all. This endowment was not earmarked for new buildings, but for financial aid.

Boston's [[Bruce Hurst]] dominated the Mets with his looping curve and forkball, allowing only four hits over eight innings, and getting [[Ray Knight]] to ground into an inning-ending double play in the bottom of the sixth inning. New York's [[Ron Darling]] was equally effective, yielding only an unearned run in the seventh inning when Mets second baseman [[Tim Teufel]] committed an error. Red Sox closer [[Calvin Schiraldi]] walked [[Darryl Strawberry]] to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning, giving Mets fans visions of a rally. However, Schiraldi got Knight to force Strawberry at second base, and got [[Wally Backman]] to fly out to left field. With two outs, [[Danny Heep]] pinch hit for weak-hitting shortstop [[Rafael Santana]]. Schiraldi worked him to a 2\u20132 count, and got Heep to swing at the last pitch for a strikeout and a save.\n\nMets legend [[Tom Seaver]], as a member of the Red Sox, got a large standing ovation from the Shea Stadium fans during the Game&nbsp;1 introductions.

The Red Sox scored first in the top of the third inning, following a leadoff walk to [[Spike Owen]], when [[Keith Hernandez]] fielded a Clemens bunt, but threw it away trying to catch Owen at second base. [[Wade Boggs]] then drove in Owen with a double, [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] drove in Clemens with a single, and [[Bill Buckner]] drove in Boggs with a single to give the Sox a 3\u20130 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Mets had on second and third base for [[Wally Backman]], who grounded up the middle, plating [[Rafael Santana]]. Hernandez then grounded out, allowing Gooden to score and bring the Mets within one run. \n\nIn the top of the fourth inning, [[Dave Henderson]], the hero of the [[1986 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], drove the second pitch from Gooden to left-center field for a home run. [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] followed with a two-run home run in the top of the fifth inning, bringing the score to 6\u20132. Although Clemens had a comfortable lead going into the bottom of the fifth, he was pulled in favor of [[Steve Crawford (baseball)|Steve Crawford]] after facing three batters, leaving runners on first and third. Crawford promptly gave up a single to [[Gary Carter]] that scored Backman, cutting the deficit to three runs. Crawford struck out [[Darryl Strawberry]] and got [[Danny Heep]] to ground out, but this left Clemens with a [[no decision]].\n\nGooden was relieved by [[Rick Aguilera]] in the sixth inning. Aguilera loaded the bases in the seventh, and after consecutive RBI singles by Henderson and Owen, was pulled in favor of [[Jesse Orosco]], who shut down the Red Sox over the next two innings.\n\nThe Red Sox were not done, however. Facing [[Sid Fernandez]], pitching in relief with runners on first and second base in the ninth inning, Boggs drove in Henderson with a double to make the score 9\u20133. The Mets were unable to recover from this deficit, and took the loss, giving Boston a 2\u20130 advantage heading to [[Fenway Park]].\n\n===Game 3===\n[[File:Bob Ojeda 1986.jpg|thumb|155px|[[Bob Ojeda]]]]\n\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Tuesday, October 21, 1986\n|Time=8:30{{nbsp}}pm (ET)\n|Location=[[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]\n|Road='''New York'''|RoadAbr=NYM\n|R1=4|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=2|R8=1|R9=0|RR=7|RH=13|RE=0\n|Home=Boston|HomeAbr=BOS\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=1|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=1|HH=5|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Bob Ojeda]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Oil Can Boyd]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Lenny Dykstra]] (1)|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nThe Mets started well when [[Lenny Dykstra]] led off the game with a home run. After two singles, [[Gary Carter]] followed with an RBI double, and [[Danny Heep]] drove in two runners with a single to give the Mets a 4\u20130 lead in the first inning. After the rocky start, Red Sox starter [[Oil Can Boyd]] settled down, but [[Bob Ojeda]] pitched well and Boston was unable to overcome their early deficit. In his first at bat of the World Series, Boston's [[Don Baylor]] almost homered in the second inning but hit the [[Green Monster]], resulting in a double.\n\nOjeda gave up an RBI single to [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] in the bottom of the third inning, but this would be the only Boston run of the game. Carter drove in two runners with a bases-loaded single in the seventh inning, and [[Ray Knight]] drove in [[Darryl Strawberry]], who had singled and moved to third on two wild pitches, with a double in the eighth inning off of [[Joe Sambito]].

The Mets tied the score in the fifth inning on a single from [[Ray Knight]] and a run-scoring double play by [[Danny Heep]], in his last at-bat as a Met. An error by Knight led to Barrett scoring in the seventh to give Boston a 3\u20132 lead.\n\nIn the top of the eighth, the Red Sox had [[Dave Henderson]] on second with one out. Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] sent rookie [[Mike Greenwell]] to pinch hit for Roger Clemens in an effort to match Greenwell, a left-handed batter, against the Mets' dominant short-relief man [[Roger McDowell]] even as righty slugger [[Don Baylor]] sat on the bench; Greenwell struck out and the Sox scored no runs that inning. It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute this. Clemens said to [[Bob Costas]] on an [[MLB Network]] program concerning the 1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens \"begged out\" of the game. At the time of the move, McNamara had closer [[Calvin Schiraldi]] throwing in the bullpen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">^ 1986: A Postseason To Remember, MLB Network, 2011</ref>\n\n[[File:1978 Boston Red Sox Photocards Bob Stanley.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Bob Stanley (baseball player)|Bob Stanley]]]]\n[[File:Bill Buckner of the Boston Red Sox.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Bill Buckner]]]]\n\nMcNamara called upon Schiraldi in the bottom of the eighth inning for a potential two-inning save. [[Lee Mazzilli]], pinch hitting for [[Jesse Orosco]], who had recorded the final out of the eighth, led off the inning with a single. [[Lenny Dykstra]] then reached on an attempted sacrifice to put two runners on. [[Wally Backman]] followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, and Schiraldi intentionally walked [[Keith Hernandez]] to load the bases for [[Gary Carter]]. Schiraldi ran up a 3-0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie the game. With Dykstra now on third, [[Darryl Strawberry]] stood in with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run, but flied out to end the inning.\n\nNeither team scored in the ninth. In the top of the tenth inning, Henderson and [[Spike Owen]] were due to lead off the inning for Boston, with the pitcher's spot due third. Henderson hit [[Rick Aguilera]]'s second pitch of the inning out of the park for a 4-3 Boston lead. Aguilera struck Owen out, and McNamara elected to send Schiraldi to bat where he too struck out. Aguilera then gave up a double to [[Wade Boggs]] and a single to Barrett, which scored another run and gave Boston a 5-3 lead.\n\nSchiraldi returned to the mound for his third inning of work to face the Mets' 2-3-4 hitters in the tenth. He retired Backman on a fly to left and [[Keith Hernandez]] on a fly to center, and the Red Sox were one out away from their first championship in 68 years. After his out, Hernandez went into the clubhouse and undressed and watched the remainder of the game on a clubhouse TV. Because of a mistake by the scoreboard operator, the words \"Congratulations Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions\" briefly flashed on the scoreboard.<ref>Deane, Bill, ''Baseball Myths: Debating, Debunking, and Disproving Tales from the Diamond'' 174 (2012).</ref>\n\nCarter was the next batter, with the pitcher's spot due next if he was able to reach base. The veteran catcher came through with a single to keep the inning alive, but the Mets needed a pinch hitter for Aguilera. Mets manager [[Davey Johnson]] had to send someone to find his intended pinch hitter, rookie utility man [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]]. Mitchell had gone into the clubhouse after Hernandez recorded the second out, allegedly to book a flight home for later that night, and had to put his uniform back on in order to bat.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite the rush, the rookie utility man came through with a single of his own, advancing Carter to second and putting the tying runs on base.\n\nThis brought Knight to the plate with a chance to drive in his second run of the night. After being brought to his final strike with the first two pitches from Schiraldi, Knight singled on the next pitch, scoring Carter from second with the first run the Mets needed and advancing Mitchell to third with the tying run.\n\nWith [[Mookie Wilson]] batting and the winning run now on base, McNamara brought in [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]], who had yet to allow an earned run in the series. With the count at 2-2 after six pitches, Stanley threw a breaking ball that swerved inside and skipped in front of Wilson, who fell in the batter's box trying to avoid the ball. From his knees, Wilson signaled to Mitchell to break for home and the rookie scored the tying run without a throw. Knight moved into scoring position on the pitch. Knight took a very large lead and caught the eye of second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]], who called several times to his pitcher to make a pickoff throw. Stanley never heard Barrett as he focused squarely on Wilson, and the noise made by the sellout crowd at Shea Stadium made it nearly impossible to hear anything.\n\nOn the tenth pitch of the at-bat,<ref name=\"ESPN miracle\">{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Mark|title=This date in '86: The miracle ofGame 6|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/mets/post/_/id/36038/this-date-in-86-miracle-at-shea|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=15 August 2015|date=5 November 2013}}</ref> Stanley finally got Wilson to put the ball in play, forcing a ground ball to first base. Veteran first baseman [[Bill Buckner]], who was playing on the lip of the infield to protect against a hit through the first-second base hole, moved over to the foul line to try to field the ball, but it rolled between his legs and into right field. Knight rounded third and scored without a play, and the Mets tied the series at three with their 6-5 victory.\n\nIn the 2011 [[ESPN Films]] documentary ''Catching Hell'', Buckner explained how, years after the event, he realized from watching a television replay how he had missed the ball. He said, when he played in the field, he liked to wear a very loose glove \u2014 ''i.e.'', one that was floppy. When he moved to his left to try to field Wilson's grounder and then stopped, the momentum of the leftward-moving loose glove caused the glove to close. The ball then went just past the right side of the glove.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlPf3CjsJ9Q Catching Hell].  From [[YouTube]].

The [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] had been brought into the Red Sox clubhouse along with several bottles of champagne, and Bob Costas was to preside over the presentation. However, after Stanley's wild pitch in the bottom of the tenth, everything was quickly struck and removed from the room before the Red Sox returned.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Costas later recalled the removal of all the equipment for the postgame celebration as being \"like a scene change in a Broadway musical. In, out, gone, not a trace.\"\n\nIn 2011, MLB Network ranked this as the third greatest game of the preceding fifty years.<ref name=\"MLB's 20 Greatest Games\">{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/network/games_airdates/|title=MLB's 20 Greatest Games|accessdate=November 26, 2011|publisher=MLB}}</ref>\n\n===Game 7===\n[[File:Ray Knight 1986.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ray Knight]]]]\n\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Monday, October 27, 1986\n|Time=8:25{{nbsp}}pm (ET)\n|Location=Shea Stadium in Queens, New York\n|Road=Boston|RoadAbr=BOS\n|R1=0|R2=3|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=2|R9=0|RR=5|RH=9|RE=0\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYM\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=3|H7=3|H8=2|H9=X|HR=8|HH=10|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Roger McDowell]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Calvin Schiraldi]] (0\u20132)|SV=[[Jesse Orosco]] (2)\n|RoadHR=[[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] (2), [[Rich Gedman]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Ray Knight]] (1), [[Darryl Strawberry]] (1)\n|}}\n\nThe seventh and deciding game of the series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, a drenching rainstorm left the field at Shea Stadium unplayable and the game was postponed to the following night.\n\nThe scheduled pitching matchup was to have pitted [[Ron Darling]] for the Mets against [[Oil Can Boyd]] for the Red Sox. Darling had already made two starts, losing Game 1 and winning Game 4. Boyd had started Game 3 and lost after struggling early, giving up four first inning runs.\n\nThe postponement, however, gave Red Sox manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] another option. Unlike the Mets, who had been using a three-man rotation, the Red Sox had used four starters. Since the rainout extended the series by a day, Game 1 and 5 starter [[Bruce Hurst]] received an extra day of rest and would be available to start with three days having passed. Since Hurst had done so well to that point &mdash; after all, he was set to be named World Series MVP before the Mets rallied to win Game 6 &mdash; McNamara chose him over Boyd to start Game 7.\n\nAfter Boyd received word he was not starting the final game of the series, he went down into the visitors' clubhouse and remained in there alone for some time. McNamara dispatched pitching coach [[Bill Fischer (baseball)|Bill Fischer]] to find Boyd, and Fischer discovered that Boyd had consumed a great deal of alcohol and was in no condition to function much less play. Fischer moved Boyd into the manager's office where he locked the door and left him for the entire game.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/sports/baseball/former-red-sox-manager-john-mcnamara-recalls-final-out-that-wasnt-to-be.html|title=For McNamara, a Final Out That Wasn\u2019t Meant to Be|date=November 8, 2011|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nBoston got to Darling early, recording three runs in the second inning. [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] and [[Rich Gedman]] hit back to back home runs to lead the inning off and with two out, [[Wade Boggs]] drove in [[Dave Henderson]] with a single for a 3\u20130 Red Sox lead. Darling did not pitch as well as he had earlier in the series and was pulled in the fourth inning with two outs and a runner in scoring position. [[Sid Fernandez]] came in and after walking Boggs, he was able to retire [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] on a fly ball to right field. Fernandez then retired the side in order in the fifth and sixth.\n\nStill trailing 3\u20130 and having only one hit to show for their outing so far, the New York bats came alive in the bottom of the sixth against Hurst. With one out, pinch hitter [[Lee Mazzilli]] and [[Mookie Wilson]] recorded back-to-back hits and [[Tim Teufel]] drew a walk to load the bases. [[Keith Hernandez]] singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and [[Gary Carter]] followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. [[Wally Backman]] pinch-ran for Teufel and scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait to see if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw to [[Spike Owen]]. Hernandez argued with right field umpire [[Dale Ford]], claiming that his delay in ruling on Evans' play caused him to wait too long before advancing. Hurst retired [[Darryl Strawberry]] for the third out.\n\n[[Roger McDowell]] came in to replace Fernandez in the seventh. The first batter was [[Tony Armas]], who pinch hit for Hurst and thus ended his night. After striking him out, McDowell induced Boggs and Barrett to ground out to end the inning. The Red Sox now needed to make a pitching change, and with Boyd in no condition to pitch the bullpen was short-staffed and McNamara called on [[Calvin Schiraldi]], his closer who had lost the previous game after pitching {{frac|2|2|3}} innings, to face [[Ray Knight]], [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]], and [[Rafael Santana]], with the pitcher's spot due up fourth. Knight greeted Schiraldi with a solo home run to give the Mets their first lead of the game. [[Lenny Dykstra]] came in to bat for Mitchell and followed with a single and advanced to second on a wild pitch. Santana then singled to score Dykstra, and after McDowell bunted Santana to second McNamara called on [[Joe Sambito]] to face Wilson. After giving Wilson a free pass, Sambito then walked Backman to load the bases for Hernandez. The Mets' captain hit a fly ball to center field that was deep enough to score Santana and advance Wilson to third. [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]], who allowed the game-winning play in Game 6, was then brought in to face Carter and got him to ground out, but the Mets were now ahead 6-3.\n\nHaving only one base runner since the third inning, the Red Sox rallied in the top of the eighth. [[Bill Buckner]] led off with a single. [[Jim Rice]] followed with one, and Evans hit a double after that to drive Buckner and Rice in and cut the lead to one. [[Davey Johnson]] brought in [[Jesse Orosco]] to try and stop the rally with the tying run now in scoring position. Orosco retired Gedman on a lineout, struck Henderson out, and induced a groundout to pinch hitter [[Don Baylor]] to strand Evans in scoring position. McNamara brought in [[Al Nipper]], who started and lost Game 4, to pitch the bottom half. [[Darryl Strawberry]] led off with a home run to make the score 7-5. Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot, and Orosco helped his cause by initially squaring to bunt, then swinging and singling to center to drive in Knight. [[Steve Crawford (baseball)|Steve Crawford]] then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning.\n\nWith a three run lead, Orosco took the hill for the ninth facing the top of the Red Sox order. [[Ed Romero]], who replaced [[Spike Owen]] at shortstop, was retired on a foul pop. Boggs then grounded out to Backman at second, leaving Marty Barrett as the last hope for the Red Sox. Orosco worked a 2-2 count before getting Barrett to swing and miss to end the game and the Series, with the Mets taking the deciding game 8-5. The win went to McDowell, with Schiraldi taking his second consecutive loss. Orosco recorded his second save.\n\nAfter the game Knight was named the [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series MVP]].\n\n==Composite line score==\n1986 World Series '''(4\u20133): [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] (N.L.)''' beat [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] (A.L.)\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]]'''\n|R1=4|R2=0|R3=2|R4=3|R5=3|R6=3|R7=7|R8=6|R9=1|R10=3|RR=32|RH=65|RE=5\n|Home='''[[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]'''\n|H1=1|H2=5|H3=5|H4=1|H5=4|H6=0|H7=4|H8=4|H9=1|H10=2|HR=27|HH=69|HE=4\n|TotalAttendance=321,774 |AveAttendance=45,967\n|WinPlayerShare=$986,254 |LosePlayerShare=$974,986<ref name=\"wsshares\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml|title=World Series Gate Receipts and Player Shares|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090502011628/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml| archivedate=May 2, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Broadcast==\nGame 6 did not end until 12:32&nbsp;a.m. Eastern, causing the first and only cancellation of an episode of NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the show's history.

In another episode from the same year, Doug and [[Danny Heffernan|his cousin Danny]] bring up the Series while revisiting their high school years.\n\nIn the ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' episode \"Mister Softee\", Bill Buckner appears as a guest star and mocks his famous 1986 mishap by missing a crucial catch of a Mookie Wilson-signed baseball. As the episode concludes, he redeems himself by catching a baby thrown from a burning building.\n\nIn 2001, playwright David Kruh had his play ''Curse of the Bambino'' premiere at the Boston Lyric Stage.<ref>http://www.bambinomusical.com/DavidKruh.htm</ref> After the 2004 World Series it was rewritten with a happier ending.\n\nIn [[Ron Darling]]'s book, ''108 Stitches'', he claims that during Game 3.

Boston's [[Bruce Hurst]] dominated the Mets with his looping curve and forkball, allowing only four hits over eight innings, and getting [[Ray Knight]] to ground into an inning-ending double play in the bottom of the sixth inning. New York's [[Ron Darling]] was equally effective, yielding only an unearned run in the seventh inning when Mets second baseman [[Tim Teufel]] committed an error. Red Sox closer [[Calvin Schiraldi]] walked [[Darryl Strawberry]] to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning, giving Mets fans visions of a rally. However, Schiraldi got Knight to force Strawberry at second base, and got [[Wally Backman]] to fly out to left field. With two outs, [[Danny Heep]] pinch hit for weak-hitting shortstop [[Rafael Santana]]. Schiraldi worked him to a 2\u20132 count, and got Heep to swing at the last pitch for a strikeout and a save.\n\nMets legend [[Tom Seaver]], as a member of the Red Sox, got a large standing ovation from the Shea Stadium fans during the Game&nbsp;1 introductions.

The Red Sox scored first in the top of the third inning, following a leadoff walk to [[Spike Owen]], when [[Keith Hernandez]] fielded a Clemens bunt, but threw it away trying to catch Owen at second base. [[Wade Boggs]] then drove in Owen with a double, [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] drove in Clemens with a single, and [[Bill Buckner]] drove in Boggs with a single to give the Sox a 3\u20130 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Mets had on second and third base for [[Wally Backman]], who grounded up the middle, plating [[Rafael Santana]]. Hernandez then grounded out, allowing Gooden to score and bring the Mets within one run. \n\nIn the top of the fourth inning, [[Dave Henderson]], the hero of the [[1986 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], drove the second pitch from Gooden to left-center field for a home run. [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] followed with a two-run home run in the top of the fifth inning, bringing the score to 6\u20132. Although Clemens had a comfortable lead going into the bottom of the fifth, he was pulled in favor of [[Steve Crawford (baseball)|Steve Crawford]] after facing three batters, leaving runners on first and third. Crawford promptly gave up a single to [[Gary Carter]] that scored Backman, cutting the deficit to three runs. Crawford struck out [[Darryl Strawberry]] and got [[Danny Heep]] to ground out, but this left Clemens with a [[no decision]].\n\nGooden was relieved by [[Rick Aguilera]] in the sixth inning. Aguilera loaded the bases in the seventh, and after consecutive RBI singles by Henderson and Owen, was pulled in favor of [[Jesse Orosco]], who shut down the Red Sox over the next two innings.\n\nThe Red Sox were not done, however. Facing [[Sid Fernandez]], pitching in relief with runners on first and second base in the ninth inning, Boggs drove in Henderson with a double to make the score 9\u20133.

The Mets tied the score in the fifth inning on a single from [[Ray Knight]] and a run-scoring double play by [[Danny Heep]], in his last at-bat as a Met. An error by Knight led to Barrett scoring in the seventh to give Boston a 3\u20132 lead.\n\nIn the top of the eighth, the Red Sox had [[Dave Henderson]] on second with one out. Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] sent rookie [[Mike Greenwell]] to pinch hit for Roger Clemens in an effort to match Greenwell, a left-handed batter, against the Mets' dominant short-relief man [[Roger McDowell]] even as righty slugger [[Don Baylor]] sat on the bench; Greenwell struck out and the Sox scored no runs that inning. It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute this. Clemens said to [[Bob Costas]] on an [[MLB Network]] program concerning the 1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens \"begged out\" of the game. At the time of the move, McNamara had closer [[Calvin Schiraldi]] throwing in the bullpen.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">^ 1986: A Postseason To Remember, MLB Network, 2011</ref>\n\n[[File:1978 Boston Red Sox Photocards Bob Stanley.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Bob Stanley]]]]\n[[File:Bill Buckner of the Boston Red Sox.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Bill Buckner]]]]\n\nMcNamara called upon Schiraldi in the bottom of the eighth inning for a potential two-inning save. [[Lee Mazzilli]], pinch hitting for [[Jesse Orosco]], who had recorded the final out of the eighth, led off the inning with a single. [[Lenny Dykstra]] then reached on an attempted sacrifice to put two runners on. [[Wally Backman]] followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, and Schiraldi intentionally walked [[Keith Hernandez]] to load the bases for [[Gary Carter]]. Schiraldi ran up a 3-0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie the game. With Dykstra now on third, [[Darryl Strawberry]] stood in with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run, but flied out to end the inning.\n\nNeither team scored in the ninth. In the top of the tenth inning, Henderson and [[Spike Owen]] were due to lead off the inning for Boston, with the pitcher's spot due third. Henderson hit [[Rick Aguilera]]'s second pitch of the inning out of the park for a 4-3 Boston lead. Aguilera struck Owen out, and McNamara elected to send Schiraldi to bat where he too struck out. Aguilera then gave up a double to [[Wade Boggs]] and a single to Barrett, which scored another run and gave Boston a 5-3 lead.\n\nSchiraldi returned to the mound for his third inning of work to face the Mets' 2-3-4 hitters in the tenth. He retired Backman on a fly to left and [[Keith Hernandez]] on a fly to center, and the Red Sox were one out away from their first championship in 68 years. After his out, Hernandez went into the clubhouse and undressed and watched the remainder of the game on a clubhouse TV. Because of a mistake by the scoreboard operator, the words \"Congratulations Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions\" briefly flashed on the scoreboard.<ref>Deane, Bill, ''Baseball Myths: Debating, Debunking, and Disproving Tales from the Diamond'' 174 (2012).</ref>\n\nCarter was the next batter, with the pitcher's spot due next if he was able to reach base. The veteran catcher came through with a single to keep the inning alive, but the Mets needed a pinch hitter for Aguilera. Mets manager [[Davey Johnson]] had to send someone to find his intended pinch hitter, rookie utility man [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]]. Mitchell had gone into the clubhouse after Hernandez recorded the second out, allegedly to book a flight home for later that night, and had to put his uniform back on in order to bat.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite the rush, the rookie utility man came through with a single of his own, advancing Carter to second and putting the tying runs on base.\n\nThis brought Knight to the plate with a chance to drive in his second run of the night. After being brought to his final strike with the first two pitches from Schiraldi, Knight singled on the next pitch, scoring Carter from second with the first run the Mets needed and advancing Mitchell to third with the tying run.\n\nWith [[Mookie Wilson]] batting and the winning run now on base, McNamara brought in [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]], who had yet to allow an earned run in the series. With the count at 2-2 after six pitches, Stanley threw a breaking ball that swerved inside and skipped in front of Wilson, who fell in the batter's box trying to avoid the ball. From his knees, Wilson signaled to Mitchell to break for home and the rookie scored the tying run without a throw. Knight moved into scoring position on the pitch. Knight took a very large lead and caught the eye of second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]], who called several times to his pitcher to make a pickoff throw. Stanley never heard Barrett as he focused squarely on Wilson, and the noise made by the sellout crowd at Shea Stadium made it nearly impossible to hear anything.\n\nOn the tenth pitch of the at-bat,<ref name=\"ESPN miracle\">{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Mark|title=This date in '86: The miracle ofGame 6|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/mets/post/_/id/36038/this-date-in-86-miracle-at-shea|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=15 August 2015|date=5 November 2013}}</ref> Stanley finally got Wilson to put the ball in play, forcing a ground ball to first base. Veteran first baseman [[Bill Buckner]], who was playing on the lip of the infield to protect against a hit through the first-second base hole, moved over to the foul line to try to field the ball, but it rolled between his legs and into right field. Knight rounded third and scored without a play, and the Mets tied the series at three with their 6-5 victory.\n\nIn the 2011 [[ESPN Films]] documentary ''Catching Hell'', Buckner explained how, years after the event, he realized from watching a television replay how he had missed the ball. He said, when he played in the field, he liked to wear a very loose glove \u2014 ''i.e.'', one that was floppy. When he moved to his left to try to field Wilson's grounder and then stopped, the momentum of the leftward-moving loose glove caused the glove to close. The ball then went just past the right side of the glove.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlPf3CjsJ9Q Catching Hell].  From [[YouTube]].

The [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] had been brought into the Red Sox clubhouse along with several bottles of champagne, and Bob Costas was to preside over the presentation. However, after Stanley's wild pitch in the bottom of the tenth, everything was quickly struck and removed from the room before the Red Sox returned.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Costas later recalled the removal of all the equipment for the postgame celebration as being \"like a scene change in a Broadway musical. In, out, gone, not a trace.\"\n\nIn 2011, MLB Network ranked this as the third greatest game of the preceding fifty years.<ref name=\"MLB's 20 Greatest Games\">{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/network/games_airdates/|title=MLB's 20 Greatest Games|accessdate=November 26, 2011|publisher=MLB}}</ref>\n\n===Game 7===\n[[File:Ray Knight 1986.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ray Knight]]]]\n\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Monday, October 27, 1986\n|Time=8:25{{nbsp}}pm (ET)\n|Location=Shea Stadium in Queens, New York\n|Road=Boston|RoadAbr=BOS\n|R1=0|R2=3|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=2|R9=0|RR=5|RH=9|RE=0\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYM\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=3|H7=3|H8=2|H9=X|HR=8|HH=10|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Roger McDowell]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Calvin Schiraldi]] (0\u20132)|SV=[[Jesse Orosco]] (2)\n|RoadHR=[[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] (2), [[Rich Gedman]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Ray Knight]] (1), [[Darryl Strawberry]] (1)\n|}}\n\nThe seventh and deciding game of the series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, a drenching rainstorm left the field at Shea Stadium unplayable and the game was postponed to the following night.\n\nThe scheduled pitching matchup was to have pitted [[Ron Darling]] for the Mets against [[Oil Can Boyd]] for the Red Sox. Darling had already made two starts, losing Game 1 and winning Game 4. Boyd had started Game 3 and lost after struggling early, giving up four first inning runs.\n\nThe postponement, however, gave Red Sox manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] another option. Unlike the Mets, who had been using a three-man rotation, the Red Sox had used four starters. Since the rainout extended the series by a day, Game 1 and 5 starter [[Bruce Hurst]] received an extra day of rest and would be available to start with three days having passed. Since Hurst had done so well to that point &mdash; after all, he was set to be named World Series MVP before the Mets rallied to win Game 6 &mdash; McNamara chose him over Boyd to start Game 7.\n\nAfter Boyd received word he was not starting the final game of the series, he went down into the visitors' clubhouse and remained in there alone for some time. McNamara dispatched pitching coach [[Bill Fischer (baseball)|Bill Fischer]] to find Boyd, and Fischer discovered that Boyd had consumed a great deal of alcohol and was in no condition to function much less play. Fischer moved Boyd into the manager's office where he locked the door and left him for the entire game.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/sports/baseball/former-red-sox-manager-john-mcnamara-recalls-final-out-that-wasnt-to-be.html|title=For McNamara, a Final Out That Wasn\u2019t Meant to Be|date=November 8, 2011|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nBoston got to Darling early, recording three runs in the second inning. [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] and [[Rich Gedman]] hit back to back home runs to lead the inning off and with two out, [[Wade Boggs]] drove in [[Dave Henderson]] with a single for a 3\u20130 Red Sox lead. Darling did not pitch as well as he had earlier in the series and was pulled in the fourth inning with two outs and a runner in scoring position. [[Sid Fernandez]] came in and after walking Boggs, he was able to retire [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] on a fly ball to right field. Fernandez then retired the side in order in the fifth and sixth.\n\nStill trailing 3\u20130 and having only one hit to show for their outing so far, the New York bats came alive in the bottom of the sixth against Hurst. With one out, pinch hitter [[Lee Mazzilli]] and [[Mookie Wilson]] recorded back-to-back hits and [[Tim Teufel]] drew a walk to load the bases. [[Keith Hernandez]] singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and [[Gary Carter]] followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. [[Wally Backman]] pinch-ran for Teufel and scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait to see if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw to [[Spike Owen]]. Hernandez argued with right field umpire [[Dale Ford]], claiming that his delay in ruling on Evans' play caused him to wait too long before advancing. Hurst retired [[Darryl Strawberry]] for the third out.\n\n[[Roger McDowell]] came in to replace Fernandez in the seventh. The first batter was [[Tony Armas]], who pinch hit for Hurst and thus ended his night. After striking him out, McDowell induced Boggs and Barrett to ground out to end the inning. The Red Sox now needed to make a pitching change, and with Boyd in no condition to pitch the bullpen was short-staffed and McNamara called on [[Calvin Schiraldi]], his closer who had lost the previous game after pitching {{frac|2|2|3}} innings, to face [[Ray Knight]], [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]], and [[Rafael Santana]], with the pitcher's spot due up fourth. Knight greeted Schiraldi with a solo home run to give the Mets their first lead of the game. [[Lenny Dykstra]] came in to bat for Mitchell and followed with a single and advanced to second on a wild pitch. Santana then singled to score Dykstra, and after McDowell bunted Santana to second McNamara called on [[Joe Sambito]] to face Wilson. After giving Wilson a free pass, Sambito then walked Backman to load the bases for Hernandez. The Mets' captain hit a fly ball to center field that was deep enough to score Santana and advance Wilson to third. [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]], who allowed the game-winning play in Game 6, was then brought in to face Carter and got him to ground out, but the Mets were now ahead 6-3.\n\nHaving only one base runner since the third inning, the Red Sox rallied in the top of the eighth. [[Bill Buckner]] led off with a single. [[Jim Rice]] followed with one, and Evans hit a double after that to drive Buckner and Rice in and cut the lead to one. [[Davey Johnson]] brought in [[Jesse Orosco]] to try and stop the rally with the tying run now in scoring position. Orosco retired Gedman on a lineout, struck Henderson out, and induced a groundout to pinch hitter [[Don Baylor]] to strand Evans in scoring position. McNamara brought in [[Al Nipper]], who started and lost Game 4, to pitch the bottom half. [[Darryl Strawberry]] led off with a home run to make the score 7-5. Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot, and Orosco helped his cause by initially squaring to bunt, then swinging and singling to center to drive in Knight. [[Steve Crawford (baseball)|Steve Crawford]] then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning.\n\nWith a three run lead, Orosco took the hill for the ninth facing the top of the Red Sox order. [[Ed Romero]], who replaced [[Spike Owen]] at shortstop, was retired on a foul pop. Boggs then grounded out to Backman at second, leaving Marty Barrett as the last hope for the Red Sox. Orosco worked a 2-2 count before getting Barrett to swing and miss to end the game and the Series, with the Mets taking the deciding game 8-5. The win went to McDowell, with Schiraldi taking his second consecutive loss. Orosco recorded his second save.\n\nAfter the game Knight was named the [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series MVP]].\n\n==Composite line score==\n1986 World Series '''(4\u20133): [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] (N.L.)''' beat [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] (A.L.)\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]]'''\n|R1=4|R2=0|R3=2|R4=3|R5=3|R6=3|R7=7|R8=6|R9=1|R10=3|RR=32|RH=65|RE=5\n|Home='''[[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]'''\n|H1=1|H2=5|H3=5|H4=1|H5=4|H6=0|H7=4|H8=4|H9=1|H10=2|HR=27|HH=69|HE=4\n|TotalAttendance=321,774 |AveAttendance=45,967\n|WinPlayerShare=$986,254 |LosePlayerShare=$974,986<ref name=\"wsshares\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml|title=World Series Gate Receipts and Player Shares|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090502011628/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml| archivedate=May 2, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Broadcast==\nGame 6 did not end until 12:32&nbsp;a.m. Eastern, causing the first and only cancellation of an episode of NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the show's history.

He tells the story of his life to a visiting priest.\n\nAt fifteen, the death of Victor's mother leaves him in sole control of the Frankenstein estate. He agrees to continue to pay a monthly allowance to his impoverished Aunt Sophia and his young cousin Elizabeth. Soon afterwards, he engages scientist Dr. Paul Krempe to tutor him. After two years of intense study, Victor and Paul begin collaborating on scientific experiments. One night, after a successful experiment in which they bring a dead puppy back to life, Victor suggests that they create a perfect human being from body parts. Paul assists Victor at first, but eventually withdraws, unable to tolerate the continued scavenging of human remains, particularly after Victor's fianc\u00e9e\u2014his now grown-up cousin Elizabeth\u2014comes to live with them.\n\nFrankenstein assembles his creation with a robber's corpse found on a gibbet and both hands and eyes purchased from charnel house workers. For the brain, Victor seeks out an aging and distinguished professor so that the monster can have a sharp mind and the accumulation of a lifetime of knowledge. He invites the professor to his house in the guise of a friendly visit, but pushes him off the top of a staircase, killing him in what appears to others to be an accident. After the professor is buried, Victor proceeds to the vault and removes his brain. Paul attempts to stop him, and the brain is damaged in the ensuing scuffle. Paul also tries to persuade Elizabeth to leave the house, as he has before, but she refuses.\n\nWith all of the parts assembled, Victor brings the creature to life. Unfortunately, the creature's damaged brain leaves it violent and psychotic, without the professor's intelligence. Frankenstein locks up the creature, but it escapes and kills an old blind man it encounters in the woods. After Paul shoots the creature in the head with a shotgun, he and Victor bury it in the woods. However, after Paul leaves town, Frankenstein digs up and revives the creature. Justine, with whom Victor has been having an affair, claims she is pregnant by him and threatens to tell the authorities about his strange experiments if he refuses to marry her, prompting him to have her killed by the creature.\n\nPaul returns to the house at Elizabeth's invitation the evening before she and Victor are to be married. Victor shows him the revived creature, and Paul threatens to report Victor to the authorities. The creature escapes and attacks Elizabeth, but Victor saves her and hesitantly kills the creature. \n\nThe priest does not believe Victor's story. When Paul and Elizabeth visit, Victor begs Paul to testify that it was the creature who killed Justine, but he refuses and denies all knowledge of the experiment. After Paul and Elizabeth leave, Victor is taken to the guillotine and executed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Cushing]] as [[Victor Frankenstein]]\n** [[Melvyn Hayes]] as Young Victor \n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|the Creature]]\n* [[Hazel Court]] as [[Elizabeth Lavenza|Elizabeth]]\n** Sally Walsh as Young Elizabeth\n* [[Robert Urquhart (actor)|Robert Urquhart]] as [[Paul Krempe|Dr. Paul Krempe]]\n* [[Valerie Gaunt]] as Justine\n* [[Noel Hood]] as Aunt Sophia\n* [[Paul Hardtmuth]] as Professor Bernstein\n* Fred Johnson as Grandpa\n* Alex Gallier as Priest\n* Claude Kingston as Little Boy\n* Michael Mulcaster as Warder\n* Andrew Leigh as Burgomaster\n* Ann Blake as Wife\n* Middleton Woods as Lecturer\n* Raymond Ray as Uncle\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\nProducer [[Max Rosenberg]] originally approached [[Michael Carreras]] at Hammer Films with a deal to produce ''Frankenstein and the Monster'' (Rosenberg claims that he came up with the title) from a script by [[Milton Subotsky]]. Later, both men were cut out of their profit participation making only a $5000 fee for bringing the production to Hammer.<ref>Interview with Max Rosenberg for the Blu-ray of \"Asylum\", December 2017</ref> Rosenberg and Subotsky later established [[Amicus Films]], Hammer's main rival in the production of horror films during the 1960s.\n\nScreenwriter Jimmy Sangster, who adapted Mary Shelley's novel for Hammer, never mentioned seeing Subotsky's script or being aware of Rosenberg's involvement. Sangster had worked as a production manager and said that he was keenly aware of production costs and kept the budget in mind when writing the script. Sangster said that his awareness of cost influenced him to not write scenes involving the villagers storming the castle that was typically seen in the Universal horror films \"because we couldn't afford it\". Sangster in an interview with film historian Jonathan Rigby indicated that he hadn't seen any of the Frankenstein films that Universal made. He just adapted the book \"the way I saw it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historyproject.org.uk/interview/jimmy-sangster|title=The British Entertainment History Project - Jimmy Sangster -|website=historyproject.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nPeter Cushing, who was then best known for his many high-profile roles in British television, had his first lead part in a movie with this film. Meanwhile, Christopher Lee's casting resulted largely from his height (6' 5\"), though Hammer had earlier considered the even taller (6 '7\") [[Bernard Bresslaw]] for the role. [[Universal Horror|Universal]] fought hard to prevent Hammer from duplicating aspects of their [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film]], and so it was down to make-up artist [[Phil Leakey]] to design a new look for the creature bearing no resemblance to the [[Boris Karloff]] original created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]].

a distinctive brand of [[Gothic horror|Gothic]] cinema.<ref name=\"Sinclair McKay 2007\">Sinclair McKay (2007)'' A Thing of Unspeakable Horror: The History of Hammer Films''</ref> \n\nThe film was

(actor)|Robert Urquhart]].<ref name=bfi/> Professor Patricia MacCormac called it the \"first really gory horror film, showing blood and guts in colour.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Frankenstein: Behind the

execution for the murder of his maid Justine. He tells the story of his life to a visiting priest.\n\nAt fifteen, the death of Victor's mother leaves him in sole control of the Frankenstein estate. He agrees to continue to pay a monthly allowance to his impoverished Aunt Sophia and his young cousin Elizabeth. Soon afterwards, he engages scientist Dr. Paul Krempe to tutor him. After two years of intense study, Victor and Paul begin collaborating on scientific experiments. One night, after a successful experiment in which they bring a dead puppy back to life, Victor suggests that they create a perfect human being from body parts. Paul assists Victor at first, but eventually withdraws, unable to tolerate the continued scavenging of human remains, particularly after Victor's fianc\u00e9e\u2014his now grown-up cousin Elizabeth\u2014comes to live with them.\n\nFrankenstein assembles his creation with a robber's corpse found on a gibbet and both hands and eyes purchased from charnel house workers. For the brain, Victor seeks out an aging and distinguished professor so that the monster can have a sharp mind and the accumulation of a lifetime of knowledge. He invites the professor to his house in the guise of a friendly visit, but pushes him off the top of a staircase, killing him in what appears to others to be an accident. After the professor is buried, Victor proceeds to the vault and removes his brain. Paul attempts to stop him, and the brain is damaged in the ensuing scuffle. Paul also tries to persuade Elizabeth to leave the house, as he has before, but she refuses.\n\nWith all of the parts assembled, Victor brings the creature to life. Unfortunately, the creature's damaged brain leaves it violent and psychotic, without the professor's intelligence. Frankenstein locks up the creature, but it escapes and kills an old blind man it encounters in the woods. After Paul shoots the creature in the head with a shotgun, he and Victor bury it in the woods. However, after Paul leaves town, Frankenstein digs up and revives the creature. Justine, with whom Victor has been having an affair, claims she is pregnant by him and threatens to tell the authorities about his strange experiments if he refuses to marry her, prompting him to have her killed by the creature.\n\nPaul returns to the house at Elizabeth's invitation the evening before she and Victor are to be married. Victor shows him the revived creature, and Paul threatens to report Victor to the authorities. The creature escapes and attacks Elizabeth, but Victor saves her and hesitantly kills the creature. \n\nThe priest does not believe Victor's story. When Paul and Elizabeth visit, Victor begs Paul to testify that it was the creature who killed Justine, but he refuses and denies all knowledge of the experiment. After Paul and Elizabeth leave, Victor is taken to the guillotine and executed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Cushing]] as [[Victor Frankenstein]]\n** [[Melvyn Hayes]] as Young Victor \n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|the Creature]]\n* [[Hazel Court]] as [[Elizabeth Lavenza|Elizabeth]]\n** Sally Walsh as Young Elizabeth\n* [[Robert Urquhart (actor)|Robert Urquhart]] as [[Paul Krempe|Dr. Paul Krempe]]\n* [[Valerie Gaunt]] as Justine\n* [[Noel Hood]] as Aunt Sophia\n* [[Paul Hardtmuth]] as Professor Bernstein\n* Fred Johnson as Grandpa\n* Alex Gallier as Priest\n* Claude Kingston as Little Boy\n* Michael Mulcaster as Warder\n* Andrew Leigh as Burgomaster\n* Ann Blake as Wife\n* Middleton Woods as Lecturer\n* Raymond Ray as Uncle\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\nProducer [[Max Rosenberg]] originally approached [[Michael Carreras]] at Hammer Films with a deal to produce ''Frankenstein and the Monster'' (Rosenberg claims that he came up with the title) from a script by [[Milton Subotsky]]. Later, both men were cut out of their profit participation making only a $5000 fee for bringing the production to Hammer.<ref>Interview with Max Rosenberg for the Blu-ray of \"Asylum\", December 2017</ref> Rosenberg and Subotsky later established [[Amicus Films]], Hammer's main rival in the production of horror films during the 1960s.\n\nScreenwriter Jimmy Sangster, who adapted Mary Shelley's novel for Hammer, never mentioned seeing Subotsky's script or being aware of Rosenberg's involvement. Sangster had worked as a production manager and said that he was keenly aware of production costs and kept the budget in mind when writing the script. Sangster said that his awareness of cost influenced him to not write scenes involving the villagers storming the castle that was typically seen in the Universal horror films \"because we couldn't afford it\". Sangster in an interview with film historian Jonathan Rigby indicated that he hadn't seen any of the Frankenstein films that Universal made. He just adapted the book \"the way I saw it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historyproject.org.uk/interview/jimmy-sangster|title=The British Entertainment History Project - Jimmy Sangster -|website=historyproject.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nPeter Cushing, who was then best known for his many high-profile roles in British television, had his first lead part in a movie with this film. Meanwhile, Christopher Lee's casting resulted largely from his height (6' 5\"), though Hammer had earlier considered the even taller (6 '7\") [[Bernard Bresslaw]] for the role. [[Universal Horror|Universal]] fought hard to prevent Hammer from duplicating aspects of their [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film]], and so it was down to make-up artist [[Phil Leakey]] to design a new look for the creature bearing no resemblance to the [[Boris Karloff]] original created by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]. Production of ''The Curse of Frankenstein'' began, with an investment of \u00a365,000, on 19 November 1956 at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] with a scene showing Baron Frankenstein cutting down a highwayman from a wayside gibbet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rigby, Jonathan|title=English Gothic: A Century of Horror Cinema|publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Ltd|year=2000|isbn=1-903111-01-3}}</ref> The film opened at the [[London Pavilion]] on 2 May 1957 with an [[X certificate]] from the censors.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n''The Curse of Frankenstein'' premiered in London on May 2, 1957 at Warner Theatre in Leicester Square.{{sfn|Fellner|2019|p=76}} It received a general released in the United Kingdom on May 20, 1957 where it was distributed by [[Warner Brothers]] and supported by the film ''[[Woman of Rome]]''.{{sfn|Fellner|2019|p=76}} The film was reissued in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s where it was distributed by Rank/Universal International where it was a double feature with ''[[The Mummy (1959 film)|The Mummy]]''.{{sfn|Fellner|2019|p=76}} The film was released in the United States on July 20, 1957 where it was distributed by Warner Bros and released with the film ''[[X the Unknown]]''.{{sfn|Fellner|2019|p=76}} It was reissued in the United States on December 16, 1964 where it was released with ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Fellner|2019|p=76}}\n\nThe film was remastered in the open matte aspect ratio of [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|1.37:1]] for its 2013 release on Blu-ray.
