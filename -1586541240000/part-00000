Though Rogers and Barnes have appeared in media dating to the 1940s, [[Fan labor|fan works]] depicting a romantic or sexual relationship between the characters grew substantially in popularity in the 2010s following their appearances in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Several individuals associated with Marvel, including Winter Soldier co-creator [[Ed Brubaker]], Barnes' actor [[Sebastian Stan]], and MCU director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]], have commented positively on Stucky. Critics and commentators have used the popularity of Stucky in [[fandom]] to remark on a range of topics, including the lack of LGBT characters in [[superhero films]] and the nature of fandom on [[social media]].\n\n==Background==\n===Marvel Comics===\n[[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and [[Bucky Barnes]] first appeared in ''[[Captain America#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 (March 1941), which establishes Rogers as Captain America and Barnes as his teenaged [[sidekick]]. Barnes would be killed in 1948 and would not re-appear until [[Captain America (vol. 5)|''Captain America'' (vol. 5)]] in 2005, where the character is [[comic book death|brought back from supposed death]] as the Winter Soldier, a brainwashed assassin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Richard |title=The American Superhero: Encyclopedia of Caped Crusaders in History |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-1440861239 |page=102}}</ref> As a result of Barnes' extended absence from comics, and Rogers' initial characterization as a much older [[paternal]] figure to Barnes, the emergence of Stucky as a phenomenon in [[fandom]] is a relatively recent development;<ref name=\"POLY1\"/> in pre-social media [[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]] fandom of the early 2000s, Rogers was most commonly depicted with [[Tony Stark]] ([[Iron Man]]), the pairing typically abbreviated as \"Stony\" or \"Superhusbands\".<ref name=\"POLY1\"/>{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.8}}\n\nWhile hero-and-sidekick relationships in comics are frequently interpreted as having a [[homoerotic]] subtext \u2014 an argument infamously made by [[Fredric Wertham]] in his 1954 book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', which asserted that [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]'s relationship promotes homosexuality and pederasty \u2014 in Marvel [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], the relationship between Rogers and Barnes is strictly platonic, and is not depicted as sexual or romantic.{{sfn|Gillen|2009|pp=109}} Regardless, Rogers and Barnes are consistently depicted in-canon as having a deep and meaningful personal bond, with some critics likening their relationship as wartime compatriots to [[Achilles and Patroclus]].{{sfn|Gillen|2009|pp=109}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe===\n{{See also|Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 120\n | image1 = Chris Evans - Captain America 2 press conference (cropped2).jpg\n | alt1 = Actor Chris Evans at a press conference in 2014.\n | image2 = Sebastian Stan by Gage Skidmore 2 (cropped).jpg\n | width2 = 120\n | alt2 = Actor Sebastian Stan at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2019.\n | footer = Actors [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] (left) and [[Sebastian Stan]] (right), who portray Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes, respectively, in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).\n}}\n\nThe popularity of Stucky as a ship in fandom rose substantially following the introduction of Rogers and Barnes to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU),<ref name=\"POLY1\"/> where they have jointly appeared in five films: ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).

These online communities are typically majority female, in contrast to the majority male mainstream comics fandom.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}} Fan works featuring Stucky cover a wide range of mediums, including [[fan art]], [[fanfiction]], and [[Vidding|fan videos]], and typically give prominence to emotional imagery and romantic subject material, as opposed to the action- and conflict-centered narratives of Marvel's comic and film source material.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}}{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=220}} Stucky fan works thus \"realize all the un-filmed narrative moments that fans want to see,\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} with depictions of Rogers' and Barnes' domestic life in 1940s New York \u2013 largely unexplored in canonical source material \u2013 being a common trope in Stucky fan works.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/> In lieu of canonical material than can be drawn from, these particular works often maintain a high degree of historical fidelity; ''Gay New York'', a sociological text by [[LGBT]] historian [[George Chauncey]], is noted as having been utilized by some fan creators to accurately depict aspects of [[LGBT history in New York#1900\u20131949|pre-war gay culture in New York City]], including real-life period-specific [[gay bar]]s that existed in Rogers' canonical Brooklyn neighborhood.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/>{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}}\n\nIn ''Captain America, Masculinity, and Violence: The Evolution of a National Icon'', author J. Richard Stevens argues that fans of Captain America use the character \"to reconstruct and reconfigure cultural significance in their own lives,\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=10}} noting that \"throughout the character's history, which contains messages from ultranationalist [[jingoism]] to a critique of the role of [[nationalism]] in the propagation of racism and terrorism, his narratives have provoked incredibly articulate responses.\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=2}} In the specific case of Stucky, Francesca Coppa argues that the fandom is a response to the unlikelihood of Marvel acknowledging a queer reading of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship in canon, and a desire by some fans to formulate what such an acknowledgement could look like.{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} Thus, Stucky represents both the [[objectification]] and [[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]] of Steve Rogers as character, \"with fans writing stories that flesh out his politics, his relationships past and present, his religion, and his sexuality.\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=223}} In this regard, Stucky as a phenomenon in [[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]] is notable in that it devotes significant focus to the characters' imagined homosexuality or bisexuality,{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}} in contrast to [[Slash fiction|slash fan works]] of the 1970s and 1980s that \"distanc[ed] beloved characters from the stereotypes and even the identity of gayness,\" opting to instead depict the characters as \"sharing a great, transcendent love that eliminated the boundaries of

Though Rogers and Barnes have appeared in media dating to the 1940s, [[Fan labor|fan works]] depicting a romantic or sexual relationship between the characters grew substantially in popularity in the 2010s following their appearances in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Several individuals associated with Marvel, including Winter Soldier co-creator [[Ed Brubaker]], Barnes' actor [[Sebastian Stan]], and MCU director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]], have commented positively on Stucky. Critics and commentators have used the popularity of Stucky in [[fandom]] to remark on a range of topics, including the lack of LGBT characters in [[superhero films]] and the nature of fandom on [[social media]].\n\n==Background==\n===Marvel Comics===\n[[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] and [[Bucky Barnes]] first appeared in ''[[Captain America#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 (March 1941), which establishes Rogers as Captain America and Barnes as his teenaged [[sidekick]]. Barnes would be killed in 1948 and would not re-appear until [[Captain America (vol. 5)|''Captain America'' (vol. 5)]] in 2005, where the character is [[comic book death|brought back from supposed death]] as the Winter Soldier, a brainwashed assassin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Richard |title=The American Superhero: Encyclopedia of Caped Crusaders in History |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-1440861239 |page=102}}</ref> As a result of Barnes' extended absence from comics, and Rogers' initial characterization as a much older [[paternal]] figure to Barnes, the emergence of Stucky as a phenomenon in [[fandom]] is a relatively recent development;<ref name=\"POLY1\"/> in pre-social media [[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]] fandom of the early 2000s, Rogers was most commonly depicted with [[Tony Stark]] ([[Iron Man]]), the pairing typically abbreviated as \"Stony\" or \"Superhusbands\".<ref name=\"POLY1\"/>{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.8}}\n\nWhile hero-and-sidekick relationships in comics are frequently interpreted as having a [[homoerotic]] subtext \u2014 an argument infamously made by [[Fredric Wertham]] in his 1954 book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', which asserted that [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]'s relationship promotes homosexuality and pederasty \u2014 in Marvel [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], the relationship between Rogers and Barnes is strictly platonic, and is not depicted as sexual or romantic.{{sfn|Gillen|2009|pp=109}} Regardless, Rogers and Barnes are consistently depicted in-canon as having a deep and meaningful personal bond, with some critics likening their relationship as wartime compatriots to [[Achilles and Patroclus]].{{sfn|Gillen|2009|pp=109}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe===\n{{See also|Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 120\n | image1 = Chris Evans - Captain America 2 press conference (cropped2).jpg\n | alt1 = Actor Chris Evans at a press conference in 2014.\n | image2 = Sebastian Stan by Gage Skidmore 2 (cropped).jpg\n | width2 = 120\n | alt2 = Actor Sebastian Stan at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2019.\n | footer = Actors [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] (left) and [[Sebastian Stan]] (right), who portray Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes, respectively, in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).\n}}\n\nThe popularity of Stucky as a ship in fandom rose substantially following the introduction of Rogers and Barnes to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU),<ref name=\"POLY1\"/> where they have jointly appeared in five films: ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). The films re-conceptualize the nature of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship, presenting them as same-age lifelong best friends,<ref name=\"POLY1\"/>{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.7}} and establish their bond as a key plot element and mutual character motivation.<ref name=\"DOT\"/><ref name=\"POLY2\"/> As a result, a fandom developed in reaction to a supposed homoerotic subtext to Rogers' and Barnes' relationship.<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"MTV\"/>\n\nAcross the ''Captain America'' trilogy of films, Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' notes that Rogers continually \"rebel[s] against authority for the sake of Bucky's wellbeing, escalating from disobeying orders in [[World War II]], to becoming an international fugitive in ''Civil War''.\"<ref name=\"DOT\"/> The relationship serves as the driving plot to ''The Winter Soldier'', where Barnes' memory of Rogers causes him to overcome his conditioning as a brainwashed assassin;<ref name=\"MTV\"/> Barnes recalls his identity through Rogers' declaration of \"I'm with you till the end of the line\", a phrase repeated by Rogers and Barnes throughout the series as an expression of kinship.<ref name=\"SR\"/> Their relationship is again a central plot element in ''Civil War'', as Rogers protects Barnes after he is wrongly accused of committing a terrorist act.<ref name=\"BEAST\"/> That film also develops [[Sharon Carter]] as a love interest for Rogers; writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Joanna Robinson called the development the \"one flaw in the otherwise great\" film, arguing that the film's kiss between Rogers and Carter exists primarily to \"put the nail in the coffin of speculation\" around a homoerotic interpretation of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship.<ref name=\"VF2\"/> While Rogers and Barnes appear in both ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', comparably less time is spent on developing their relationship,<ref name=\"BUSTLE\"/><ref name=\"CB1\"/> with Robinson and other critics hypothesizing that their interactions were minimized to build popularity for [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] ([[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]) as he assumes the mantle of Captain America, and to emphasize the canonical love story between Rogers and [[Peggy Carter]].<ref name=\"VF1\"/><ref name=\"DOG\"/><ref name=\"BEAT\"/>\n\n==Analysis and impact==\nStucky as a phenomenon in [[fandom]] emerged from online communities that produce [[Fan labor|fan works]]. These online communities are typically majority female, in contrast to the majority male mainstream comics fandom.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}} Fan works featuring Stucky cover a wide range of mediums, including [[fan art]], [[fanfiction]], and [[Vidding|fan videos]], and typically give prominence to emotional imagery and romantic subject material, as opposed to the action- and conflict-centered narratives of Marvel's comic and film source material.{{sfn|Coker|2013|pp=1.1}}{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=220}} Stucky fan works thus \"realize all the un-filmed narrative moments that fans want to see,\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} with depictions of Rogers' and Barnes' domestic life in 1940s New York \u2013 largely unexplored in canonical source material \u2013 being a common trope in Stucky fan works.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/> In lieu of canonical material than can be drawn from, these particular works often maintain a high degree of historical fidelity; ''Gay New York'', a sociological text by [[LGBT]] historian [[George Chauncey]], is noted as having been utilized by some fan creators to accurately depict aspects of [[LGBT history in New York#1900\u20131949|pre-war gay culture in New York City]], including real-life period-specific [[gay bar]]s that existed in Rogers' canonical Brooklyn neighborhood.<ref name=\"MARYSUE\"/>{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}}\n\nIn ''Captain America, Masculinity, and Violence: The Evolution of a National Icon'', author J. Richard Stevens argues that fans of Captain America use the character \"to reconstruct and reconfigure cultural significance in their own lives,\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=10}} noting that \"throughout the character's history, which contains messages from ultranationalist [[jingoism]] to a critique of the role of [[nationalism]] in the propagation of racism and terrorism, his narratives have provoked incredibly articulate responses.\"{{sfn|Stevens|2015|pp=2}} In the specific case of Stucky, Francesca Coppa argues that the fandom is a response to the unlikelihood of Marvel acknowledging a queer reading of Rogers' and Barnes' relationship in canon, and a desire by some fans to formulate what such an acknowledgement could look like.{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=226}} Thus, Stucky represents both the [[objectification]] and [[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]] of Steve Rogers as character, \"with fans writing stories that flesh out his politics, his relationships past and present, his religion, and his sexuality.\"{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=223}} In this regard, Stucky as a phenomenon in [[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]] is notable in that it devotes significant focus to the characters' imagined homosexuality or bisexuality,{{sfn|Coppa|2017|pp=224}} in contrast to [[Slash fiction|slash fan works]] of the 1970s and 1980s that \"distanc[ed] beloved characters from the stereotypes and even the identity of gayness,\" opting to instead depict the characters as \"sharing a great, transcendent love that eliminated the boundaries of

name=\"WAPO\"/><ref name=\"TIME\"/> While the hashtag was ostensibly organized around fans who wished to see Stucky made canon, both it and #GiveElsaAGirlfriend were also broadly concerned with the lack of LGBT characters in media properties owned by [[Disney]], of which Marvel is a subsidiary.<ref name=\"Crush\"/><ref name=\"IO9\"/> The LGBT rights organization [[GLAAD]] commented that the hashtag was \"a sign that audiences are eager for significant LGBT characters in their superhero movies.\"<ref name=\"AP\"/>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' cited #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend as an example of how social media has altered the dynamic between creators and audiences, as the medium increases both the visibility of fan discussions and the willingness of creators to respond to these discussions.<ref name=\"THR\"/> In the specific case of #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the campaign \"highlights demographic shifts that have yet to be reflected
