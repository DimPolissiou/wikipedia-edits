Rising from the ranks, during four decades of distinguished service (including 35 years on campaign) under [[Louis-Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]] and then [[Napoleon III]], he held every rank in the army from Fusilier to [[Marshal of France]]. He became renowned for his determination to lead from the front, for his impassive bearing under fire and for personal bravery verging on the foolhardy, which resulted in him being wounded on numerous occasions and having his horse shot from under him twice. From 1863 he was a [[Marshal of France]], and it was in this role that he surrendered the last organized French army to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] during the [[Franco-Prussian war]], during the [[Siege of Metz (1870)|siege of Metz]].\n\nSentenced to death by the government of the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]] following the war, his sentence was commuted to 20 years imprisonment in exile, from which he subsequently escaped. He eventually settled in [[Spain]] where aged 77, he died alone and impoverished in 1888. To the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] he remains a hero and to this day is honoured as one of their bravest soldiers.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHis father, General [[Pierre-Dominique Bazaine]], a polytechnic (promotion X1803), meritorious engineer of [[Napoleon I]] and director of the Institute of Communications Channels of the Russian Empire. Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine was born at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], on 13 February 1811, from an affair prior to his father's marriage, with Marie-Madeleine, Jos\u00e8phe dit M\u00e9lanie Vasseur. His elder brother [[Adolphe Bazaine-Vasseur|Pierre-Dominique Bazaine]] was a renowned engineer. Achille Bazaine conducted studies at the institute of Bader (or Barbet), then the college of Saint-Louis.\n\n== French Foreign Legion & Algeria ==\n\nWhile not passing the academic entry test of the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique|French Polytechnic School]] in 1830, he enlisted as a simple soldier ([[Private (rank)|private]]) on 28 March 1831 at the 37th Line Infantry Regiment ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:37e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne|37<sup>e</sup> r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne]]}}), and was promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Caporal]] ([[Corporal]]) on 8 July 1831. He was subsequently passed to Corporal Fourrier on 13 January 1832 and [[Ranks in the French Army|Segent]] ([[Sergeant]]) Fourrier (''fourrier'': non-commissioned officer responsible for stewardship) in July.\n\nWith this rank, he arrived to the [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|French Foreign Legion]] in August. He was designated as [[Sergeant major|Sergent-Major]], on 4 November, he attained the [[Epaulette]] on 2 November 1833 and on 22 July 1835, he was wounded in the battle of [[Battle of Macta|Macta]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Bataille de la Macta|la Macta]]}}) \nof fires to the wrist, and was promoted to the rank of [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant]] and received the knight order of the [[Legion d'honneur]].\n\nWith the Legion, he was ceded by [[Louis Philippe I]] to [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Queen Christine]] to combat the Carlists. Named immediately Spanish [[Ranks in the French Army|Captain]] at Foreign Title, he commanded a company of voltigeurs then was attached to the general staff headquarters of colonel Conrad. He was cited at the combats of Ponts ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Ponts (Espagne)|Ponts]]}}) in 1835, Larminar ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Larminar|Larminar]]}}) in 1836, Huesca ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Huesca|Huesca]]}}) in 1837 and the battle of Barbastro in 1837, where he dragged out the body of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Conrad from the hands of the enemy, despite a bullet wound to the right leg. He was then attached to colonel Cari\u00e8s de Senilhes, commissioner of the French government to the Army of Spain.\n\nIn 1838, he joined the 4th Light Infantry with his French rank of Lieutenant. On 20 October 1839, he was re-promoted to Captain in the Legion in [[French Algeria|Algeria]]. In 1840, he passed to the 8th Chasseurs \u00e0 Pied Battalion. He partook in a part to the expeditions in Miliana ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Miliana|Miliana]]}}) where he was cited, from [[Kabylie]] and [[Morocco]]. Promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de battaillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant]] \u2013 [[Major]]), on 10 March 1844, he was assigned to the 58th Line Infantry Regiment in quality as the Arab Bureau Chief of [[Tlemcen]]. He was promoted to officer order of the [[Legion d'honneur]] following the combat of Sidi Kafir, on 9 November 1845. Cited to the combat of Sidi Afis, on 24 March 1846, he passed to the 5th Line Infantry Regiment while still in charge of Arab relations, in 1847. He was cited at the combats of Afir for his contribution to the submission of [[Emir Abdelkader|AbdelKader]] in December. Promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]] on 11 April 1848, he was assigned to the 19th Light Infantry Regiment then went back to the 5th Line Infantry Regiment on 30 August in quality as superior commander of the place of [[Tlemcen]]. On 4 June 1850, he was designated as a colonel in the 55th Line Infantry Regiment ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:55e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne|55<sup>e</sup> de ligne]]}}) and Director of the Arba Affairs division of Oran.\n\nOn 4 February 1851, he was placed at the head of the [[1st Foreign Regiment|1st Regiment of the 1st Foreign Legion]] [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|1<sup>er</sup> R.E.L.E]], and the next month, he commanded the subdivision of Sidi bel Abes, a post which he occupied until 1854. During this commandment time, he married Maria Juaria Gregorio Tormo de la Soledad, on 12 June 1852.\n\n== Crimea and Italy ==\n\nOn 28 October 1854, he was admitted to the 1st section of officer generals with the rank of [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] and commanded two regiments of the Legion at the Army of the Orient. On 10 September 1855, he became the military commandant of [[Sevastopol]] and [[g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division]] on the next 22 September. During the [[Crimean War]], he was wounded and cited during the attack of the ''Quarantaine'', with a horse shot underneath him, the same day. In October, he won another citation, earning him the commander order the [[Legion d'honneur]] for the apprehension of the position of Kinbourn at the closing of [[Dniepr]], which he concluded in three days.\n\nThe way in which he conducted the left wing of the French forces in the final Allied assault on Sebastopol on 8 September 1855 (wounded, shell fragment in left hip, his horse killed under him), received acclaim of the highest order from the Allied Command and he was subsequently promoted to Major General (General de Division) on 22 September 1855 and selected from all the Allied Generals to assume the Governorship of Sebastopol.\n\nAt 44, this made him the youngest General in the French Army. In October 1855, Bazaine was chosen to give the ''coup de gr\u00e2ce''. With a mixed French and British Force, he sailed to [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Kinburn]] at the mouth of the Dnieper to attack the remaining Russian forces to the North of Sebastopol. He led a daring landing and seized the naval fortress with a frontal assault, an action for which he received particular praise: \"General Bazaine who commands that portion of the French Army now operating at the mouth of the Dnieper may be cited as presenting one of the most brilliant examples of the achievement of military distinction in the modern day\".<ref>Illustrated London News: 1855</ref> At Sebastopol, on 25 June 1856 he was invested by the British Commander in Chief, [[Lord Gough]], with the [[Order of the Bath]], for his conspicuous contribution to the Allied campaign during the Crimean War.\n\nUpon his return to France, he occupied the post of inspector of the infantry then commanded the 19th Infantry Division ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:19e division d'infanterie (France)|19<sup>e</sup> Division Militaire]]}}) at Bourges.\n\nCommander of the 3rd Infantry Division ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:3e division d'infanterie (France)|3<sup>e</sup> Division d'Infanterie]]}}) of the [[1st Army Corps (France)|1st Army Corps]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:1er corps d'arm\u00e9e (France)|1<sup>er</sup> Corps d'Arm\u00e9e]]}}) of [[Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers]], he was close to the combat line of [[Melegnano]], on 8 June 1859, and the [[Battle of Solferino]], on 24 June, during the conquest of the cemetery.\n\nActually, during that year in 1859, he commanded the Division in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Sardinian campaign]] against Austrian forces in [[Lombardy]]. He was wounded by a shell splinter in the head on 8 June, during the action at the [[Melegnano|Battle of Melegnano]]. He recovered to play a conspicuous part in the [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]], which he captured on 24 June 1859, despite being wounded again (bullet to the upper thigh) and having his horse shot from under him again, earning another citation.\n\n== Mexico ==\n[[File:Bazaine Disd\u00e9ri BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Francois Achille Bazaine in 1860.]]\n\nReturned to [[Paris]], he was designated as the general inspector of the 4th and 5th infantry arrondissements. The souvenir of Spain made him suggest to [[Napoleon III]] to lend the [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|French Foreign Legion]] to the new emperor in [[Mexico]]. This idea would become that of the Emperor.\n\nBazaine was later designated to be part of the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|expedition to Mexico]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:intervention fran\u00e7aise au Mexique|exp\u00e9dition du Mexique]]}}).\n\nCommandant of the 1st Infantry Division of [[Second French intervention in Mexico|expditionary corps to Mexico]] on 1 July 1862, his action was decisive during the siege of [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Puebla]] in 1863. He commanded with great distinction the First Division under [[Elie Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Forey|General (afterwards Marshal) Forey]] in the Mexican expedition in 1862, where he pursued the war with great vigour and success, driving President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] to the frontier. His decisive action was instrumental in the taking of the city of Puebla in 1863. As a consequence, he was cited and designated at the head of the expeditionary corps by replacing [[\u00c9lie Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Forey]]. He received a citation at the battle of San Lorenzo and the insignias of the [[Legion d'honneur|Grand-Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], on 2 July 1863. He was elevated to the dignity of [[Marshal of France]] and [[Senator]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:liste des s\u00e9nateurs du Second Empire|Senator of the Second Empire]]}}) of the [[Second French Empire]] by Imperial decree on 5 September 1864, the first Marshal who had started as a Legionnaire.<ref name=\"time.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802905-2,00.html|publisher=Time|date=26 July 1943|accessdate=22 September 2008|title=Bazaine and Retain}}</ref> He commanded in person the siege of [[Oaxaca de Juarez|Oaxaca]] in February 1865, following which, the Emperor complimented him while decorating him with the M\u00e9daille militaire, on 28 April 1865.\n\nHere as in 1870, two of Bazaine's nephews, Adolphe and [[George Albert Bazaine-Hayter|Albert Bazaine-Hayter]] served with their uncle as his [[aide-de-camp]]. The Marshal's African experience as a soldier and as an administrator stood him in good stead in dealing with the ''guerrilleros'' of the Ju\u00e1rez party, but he was less successful in his relations with Maximilian, with whose court the French headquarters was in constant strife.\n\nHis first wife died while he was in Mexico. While he was in Mexico, Bazaine got engaged then to Maria-Josefa Pedraza de la Pe\u00f1a y Barrag\u00e1n on 28 May 1865, then married her. [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] offered him the palace of Buena Vista.\n\nHis enemies whispered that he aimed to depose Maximilian and get the throne of Mexico for himself,<ref name=\"time.com\"/> or that he aspired to play the part of a [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Bernadotte]]. His marriage to a rich Mexican lady (Pepita de la Pe\u00f1a y Azcarate), whose family were supporters of Ju\u00e1rez, still further complicated his relations with the unfortunate emperor, and when at the close of the [[American Civil War]] the United States sent a powerful war-trained army to the Mexican frontier, Napoleon III commanded Bazaine to withdraw French forces and return to France. Bazaine skillfully conducted the retreat and embarkation at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] (1867).\n\nConsequently, his relations with Emperor Maximilian became tense. He was accused of dragging the expedition against the will of Napoleon III, a situation which provoked his repatriation. On 12 November 1867, he obtained the commandment of the [[3rd Army Corps (France)|3rd Army Corps]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:3e corps d'arm\u00e9e (France)|3<sup>e</sup> Corps d'Arm\u00e9e]]}}) at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], and the following year, he commanded the camp of [[Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne|Ch\u00e2lons]] then replaced [[Auguste Regnaud de Saint-Jean d'Ang\u00e9ly]] at the head of the [[Imperial Guard]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:LE G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL BAZAINE ATTAQUE LE FORT DE SAN-XAVIER LORS DU SI\u00c8GE DE PUEBLA par Jean-Adolphe Beauce 29 March 1863.png|General Bazaine (front centre) attacking the Fort San-Xavier during the Siege of Puebla on 29 March 1863, by Jean-Adolphe Beauce\nFile:Exp\u00e9dition du Mexique. \u2014 La population de Guadalajara se portant au devant du corps du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bazaine \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e dans la ville.

On the other hand, while he was presented with the occasion to destroy several enemy army corps following the [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:bataille de Mars-la-Tour|bataille de Mars-la-Tour]]}}), on 16 August, he decided, to the astonishment of his general staff headquarters to unfold his army of 180,000 men at [[Siege of Metz (1870)|Metz]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Si\u00e8ge de Metz (1870)|Metz]]}}), accordingly cutting himself from free France and his reserves. Two days later, at the eve of the [[Battle of Gravelotte|Battle of Saint-Privat]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:bataille de Saint-Privat|bataille de Saint-Privat]]}}), Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Certain de Canrobert]] requested urgently and for several times reinforcements from Bazaine, but did not obtain them. The latter had judged that Saint-Privat was not an important battle and refused to engage his reserve troops, which were numerous. No reinforcements were sent to the French troops which were engaged heroically in combat on the plateau and Bazaine didn't even appear on the field of battle.\n\nDirecting the only true organized armed force of France at that moment, he seemed to consider it mainly as a political tool and contemplated the various intrigues, notably with the [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress]], probably to restore the Empire torn since 4 September. He negotiated equally with the Germans the authorization of an exit of his army \u00ab pour sauver la France d'elle-m\u00eame \u00bb (to save France from itself), which meant from the republican push, as in revolutionary. It was during this stage that he vigorously opposed captain [[Louis Rossel]] who wanted to pursue the war and not betray his country (Rossel was the only officer to join since 19 March 1871 the [[Paris Commune]]).\n\nSince the [[Battle of Sedan|Fall of Sedan]], on 2 September, he represented the last hope in the French camp, Bazaine renounced to pursue combat and capitulated on 28 October. This surrender is often explained by the lack of motivation of Bazaine to defend a government which was corresponding less and less to his conservative ideas. However, Bazaine also presented the situation differently in a letter on 2 November 1870 in the ''Journal du Nord'' (Northern Journal): \"famine, the atmospheres brought down the arms of 63,000 real combatants which remained (the artillery no longer fixed and the cavalry demounted, all this after having eaten the majority of horses and searched the land in all directions to find rarely a weak provision to general privations).[...] Add to this dark painting more 20,000 sick or wounded to the point of absence of medicines and a torrential rain since 15 days now, flooding the camps and not allowing the men to rest because their small tents were the only shelter they had\".\n\nThe news of this surrender afflicted France, while general [[Louis-Jules Trochu]] couldn't even seem to loosen the German noose around [[Paris]] which was besieged. [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], gone to [[Tours]] in the hope to assemble a Liberation army, understood that his tentative was unworkable and accordingly launched a proclamation where he explicitly accused Bazaine of treason in his speech: \"Metz was capitulated. A general on who France was counting on, even after Mexico, just lifted from the Nation more than a 100,000 of its defenders. Marshal Bazaine has betrayed. He has made himself the agent of Sedan, the partner in crime with the invader, and, in the middle of the army which had the guard of, he simply delivered it, without even attempting a supreme effort, 120,000 combatants, 20,000 wounded, guns, cannons, the flags and the strongest citadels of France, Metz, virgin, to him, of foreign defilements\".\n\n=== \"Nous marchons \u00e0 un d\u00e9sastre\" ===\n\nIt is clear even at this early stage that Bazaine was acutely aware of his Army's shortcomings against the well known speed and menacing efficiency of the Prussian military machine, evidenced by his remark to a friend whilst boarding the train from Paris to Metz: \"''Nous marchons \u00e0 un d\u00e9sastre''.\" (\"We are walking into a disaster.\") He had absorbed certain lessons that were to become a vital part of French military thought. From the story of Waterloo he had learned that a line of resolute men on the defensive could again and again break an enemy attack. From Mexico he had watched Lee's dashing Confederates lose a war despite their commander's brilliance in attack. He had also learned that dramatic sorties were invaluable in North Africa but were risky against European armies. Finally, Bazaine saw with misgivings the Prussian invention all-steel [[Krupp]] breech-loading gun, which was to shape the future of artillery on the battlefield. He concluded at this time that for France defensive war is better than offensive war. \"It is better,\" he said, \"to conduct operations systematically (i.e., defensively), as in the Seventeenth Century.\"<ref name=\"time.com\"/>\n\n=== Takes over as Commander in Chief from Napoleon III ===\n\nBazaine took no part in the earlier battles, but after the defeats of Marshal MacMahon's French Forces at W\u00f6rth and Marshal Canrobert's at Forbach, [[Napoleon III]] (who was in increasingly poor health) was swift to give Bazaine the title of Commander-in-Chief of the French Army on 13 August 1870. At the time, Napoleon's choice was considered to be a wise one. It was widely believed by French politicians and soldiers alike, that if anyone was capable of saving France from the Prussian onslaught, it was \"notre glorieux Bazaine\" (\"our glorious Bazaine\"). He was the only remaining Marshal of France not to have suffered defeat at the hands of Prussian forces in the early weeks of the war. However, being the youngest of the French Marshals, Napoleon's choice was met with suspicion and jealousy by the older, socially superior Marshals. Hence it was with reluctance that he took up the chief command, and his tenure became the central act in the tragedy of 1870. He found the army in retreat, ill-equipped and numerically at a great disadvantage, and the generals and officers discouraged and distrustful of one another. Bazaine's solution was to bring back his army to [[Metz]]. The day after assuming command of the Army, on 14 August at [[Battle of Borny-Colombey|Borny]] he was badly wounded by a shell on the left shoulder, a fact which was to be excluded from his service roll presented at his Court Martial in 1873.\n\n=== Spicheren ===\nHow far his inaction was the cause of the disaster of [[Battle of Spicheren|Spicheren]] is a matter of dispute. The best that can be said of his conduct is that the traditions of warfare on a small scale and the mania for taking up \"strong positions,\" common to the French generals of 1870, were in Bazaine's own case emphasized by his personal dislike for the \"schoolmaster\" [[Charles Auguste Frossard|Frossard]], lately the Prince Imperial's tutor and now commander of the army corps posted at Spicheren. Frossard himself, the leader of the \"strong positions\" school, could only blame his own theories for the paralysis of the rest of the army, which left the corps at Spicheren to fight unsupported. Bazaine, indeed, when called upon for help, moved part of his corps forward, but only to \"take up strong positions,\" not to strike a blow on the battlefield.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt seems to be clearly established that the charges of [[treason]] had as yet no foundation in fact. Nor, indeed, can his unwillingness to leave the [[Moselle]] region, while there was yet time to slip past the advancing enemy, be considered even as proof of special incompetence. The resolution to stay in the neighbourhood of Metz was based on the knowledge that if the slow-moving French army ventured far out it would infallibly be headed off and brought to battle in the open by superior numbers. In \"strong positions\" close to his stronghold, however, Bazaine hoped that he could inflict damaging repulses and heavy slaughter on the ardent Germans, and in the main the result justified the expectation. The scheme was creditable, and even heroic, but the execution throughout all ranks, from the Marshal to the battalion commanders, fell far short of the idea. The minutely cautious methods of movement, which Algerian experience had evolved suitable enough for small African desert columns, which were liable to surprise rushes and ambushes, reduced the mobility of a large army, which had favourable marching conditions, to 5 miles a day as against the enemy's rate of 15. When, before he had finally decided to stay in Metz, Bazaine attempted halfheartedly to begin a retreat on [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]], the staff work and organization of the movement over the Moselle was so ineffective that when the German staff calculated that Bazaine was nearing Verdun, the French had in reality barely got their artillery and baggage trains through the town of Metz. Even on the battlefield the Marshal forbade the general staff to appear, and conducted the fighting by means of his personal orderly officers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n[[File:Marshal Bazaine with his personal staff officers in 1870.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bazaine and his staff officers including Colonel Willette and his nephews Capt Adolphe Bazaine-Hayter and [[George Albert Bazaine-Hayter|Lt George Bazaine-Hayter]] in 1870]]\n\n=== Mars-la-Tour ===\nAfter the cumbrous army had passed through Metz it encountered an isolated corps of the enemy near the village of [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour|Mars-la-Tour]], which was commanded by the brilliant leader [[Constantin von Alvensleben]], and promptly attacked the French. At almost every moment of the day victory was in Bazaine's hands. Two corps of the Germans fought all day for bare existence. But Bazaine had no confidence in his generals or his troops, and contented himself with inflicting severe losses on the most aggressive portions of the German army.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n=== Gravelotte and Sedan ===\nTwo days later, while the French actually retreated on Metz (taking seven hours to cover 5 to 6 miles) the masses of the Germans gathered in front of Bazaine's Army at [[Battle of Gravelotte|Gravelotte]], intercepting his communication with the interior of France. This Bazaine expected, and feeling certain that the Germans would sooner or later attack him in his chosen position, he made no attempt to interfere with their concentration. The great battle was fought, and having inflicted severe punishment on his assailants, Bazaine fell back within the entrenched camp of Metz. But although he made no appeals for help, the only remaining army of France, [[Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta|Marshal Mac-Mahon]]'s ''[[Army of Ch\u00e2lons]]'', moved to rescue Bazaine. Napoleon III followed close behind MacMahon's army in a carriage. When on 2 September 1870, MacMahon blundered into a German trap at [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]], the Emperor mounted a horse despite his pain, rode along the firing line for hours seeking death. It never found him. Napoleon III surrendered with 80,000 men.<ref name=\"time.com\"/> With Sedan the Second Empire collapsed, Napoleon III being taken as a prisoner of war.\n\n=== Siege of Metz ===\nThe Prussian army of 200,000 men now [[Siege of Metz (1870)|besieged the city of Metz]], where 3 French marshals, 50 generals, 135,000 men, and 600 guns were encircled. Bazaine attempted to break the siege at [[Battle of Noisseville|Noisseville]] on 31 August but the French were repulsed, losing 3,500 men in the attempt. There were supplies in Metz to last no more than a month, such that by early September the order was given for work horses to be slaughtered for food. By mid September, cavalry horses also began to be slaughtered. Without cavalry and horses to pull the guns, Bazaine's ability to mount effective attempts to break out rapidly diminished. On 7 October, hungry and immobilised, Bazaine dispatched two 40,000 man foraging parties along both banks of the Moselle, but the Prussian guns blew the French wagons off the road and the Prussian infantry cut swathes through the desperate French soldiers with [[Chassepot]]s captured at Sedan. Over 2,000 men were lost in this operation. Typhus and smallpox was spreading and by 10 October, it is estimated that 19,000 of the French troops in Metz were hospitalised. A further attempt was made to break the siege on 18 October at [[Battle of Bellevue|Bellevue]], but again the French troops were repulsed, with the loss of 1,250 men. The city was on its knees, the troops and inhabitants on the point of starvation.\n\n=== Diplomacy, then surrender ===\nAs commander of the only remaining organized army of France, Bazaine took it upon himself, perhaps justifiably, to control the country's destiny. He refused to recognise the new [[Government of National Defense|Government of National Defence]], formed following Napoleon's capture and the resulting collapse of his government, and instead engaged in a series of diplomatic negotiations with the Prussian high command and [[Empress Eugenie]] who with the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial]] had fled to [[Hastings]], England. The purport of these negotiations still remain to some extent obscure, but it is beyond question that he proposed with the permission of the Prussians to employ his army in \"saving France from herself\", perhaps to ignite a revolution against the government of the Third Republic. When considered in light of the fact that Bazaine had long been a known [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]], his actions were clearly designed to forge a way to restore the monarchy.\n\nThe scheme, however, collapsed and Bazaine surrendered the Army of the Rhine, who became prisoners of war to the number of 180,000. This surrender is often explained by Bazaine's lack of motivation to defend a government that corresponded less and less to his political ideals and the best interests of France, as he saw it.  A week's further resistance would have potentially enabled the levies of the National Defence government to crush the weak forces of the Germans on the [[Loire]] and to relieve Paris. But the army of [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828\u20131885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]], set free from the siege of Metz by Bazaine's surrender, hurried up in time to check and to defeat the great effort at [[Second Battle of Orleans (1870)|Orl\u00e9ans]].\n\n== Trial ==\n\n[[File:T-bazaine.jpg|right|thumb|Marshal Bazaine]]\n\n=== Prelude ===\n\nThe defection of Bazaine liberated the army besieged by Germans, and who hastened to [[Orleans]] to front face the initiative in progress of raising a Republican Army. It was then therefore easy to bear the moral weight of the defeat to Bazaine. In August 1873, he arrived at Paris, where an investigation was opened on the initiative of general [[Ernest Courtot de Cissey]]. The investigative board gave their advice which led to several accusations. Bazaine then requested that the case be presented to a war council. The royalists and the republicans held their ''bouc \u00e9missaire'' in order to weight all the responsibilities of a defeat to a bonapartiste and justify the [[French Third Republic|proclamation of the French Republic of 4 September 1870]], attempting to show the incapacity of the Emperor, by interposed person. Certain bonapartists, were not unhappy that Bazaine was being judged, blacking out accordingly the responsibilities of Napoleon III. Bazaine was then the ideal expiatory victim who was translated in front of a war council sitting at [[Grand Trianon]]. The [[Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Aumale|Duke of Aumale]], President, condemned him to death with military degradation for having capitulated in an open campaign, collaborated with the enemy and surrendered Metz before having exhausted all defense means available to the defendant. However, the same tribunal, which just condemned him, signed unanimously and sent to the [[List of Presidents of France|President of France]] (and the Minister of War) a request of mercy in regards to ''M. Marshal Bazaine''. His sentence was commuted then to 20 years in prison, without degradation ceremony, by the new President-Marshal [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|MacMahon]], who also was beaten at Sedan. This inspired Victor Hugo the following comment :  \u00ab Mac-Mahon absolves Bazaine. Sedan washes Metz. The idiot protects the traitor \u00bb.<ref>Victor Hugo, Choses vues 1870\u20131885, p. 321, Paris, Gallimard, 1972, total pages 529, {{ISBN|2-07-036141-1}}</ref>\n\nHe was incarcerated at a Fort. However, with the help of ex-Captain Doineau, Arab Bureaux, his aide de camp, lieutenant-colonel Henri-L\u00e9on Willette and his wife, who shared his captivity, he was able to escape in night of 9 and 10 August 1874 and went to Spain.\n\n=== Accusation of treason ===\n\nThe French nation could not rest with the thought that their military supremacy had been broken by the superiority of the Prusso-German armies; their defeats could have proceeded only from the treachery or incapacity of their leaders. The commanders who had surrendered the French fortresses to the enemy were subjected to a trial by court-martial under the presidency of [[Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers|Marshal Baraguey d'Hilliers]]. The majority of them were, on account of their proved incapacity or weakness, deprived of their military honours. Even Ulrich, the once celebrated commander of Strasbourg, whose name had been given to a street in Paris, was brought under the censure of the court-martial. But the chief blow fell upon the Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Bazaine, to whose \"treachery\" the whole misfortune of France was to be attributed.\n\nWhen Bazaine returned from captivity, aware that in his absence he had been put forward as a scapegoat by the new government of the Third Republic for France's defeat at the hands of the Prussians, he was keen to be given an opportunity to clear his name and put his version of events to the public. In 1872, Bazaine published his account of the events of 1870 in ''L'Arm\u00e9e du Rhin'' and formally requested and was granted a trial before a military court. For months he was retained a prisoner at the [[Grand Trianon]] in the Palace of Versailles with his wife and two youngest children, while preparations were made for the great court-martial spectacle, which started the following year on 6 October 1873 under the presidency of the [[Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Aumale|Duc D'Aumale]] in the Grand Trianon's Peristyle. <!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Bazaine and his young family in 1873 v1.jpg|left|thumb|Bazaine and his family under house arrest at Petit Trianon, Versailles 1873]] -->\n\nFor some time the Duke and his colleagues had been looking for a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid responsibility before history. Bazaine stated in his defence ''\"I have graven on my chest two words \u2013 [[Legion of Honour|Honneur et Patrie]]. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ\"''.<ref>Hugh McLeave: ''The Damned Die Hard'' (Page 81)</ref> Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. \"''I have read every word of the evidence [against Bazaine] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry''\" (New York Times correspondent).<ref name=\"New York Times: 12 December 1873\">New York Times: 12 December 1873</ref> A letter which [[Prince Frederick Charles]] wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless.  Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was \"''It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family''\". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death \u2014 [[Michel Ney|Ney]], by a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], and Bazaine, by an [[House of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]]. But, as though the judges themselves felt a twinge of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.\n\n=== Imprisonment and escape ===\n\nMacMahon, who was a fellow Foreign Legion Officer and had served in many campaigns alongside Bazaine, was visibly disgusted when he received the news of the Court's decision and was incensed by their attempt to pass responsibility to him.<ref name=\"New York Times: 12 December 1873\"/> The government wanted to banish Bazaine for life; MacMahon first proposed life imprisonment, though he softened and commuted the punishment of death to twenty years' imprisonment and remitted the disgrace of the formalities of a military degradation. Bazaine wrote to thank his fellow legionnaire, though he added, tongue in cheek, that he might have let his feelings run away with him. It was an academic concession for a man nearing sixty-three. Bazaine was incarcerated on the [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite]] and treated rather as an exile than as a convict. During the night of 10 August 1874, using parcel rope supplied by Angelo Hayter, (son of the Court Painter [[George Hayter|Sir George Hayter]]) and baggage straps which he knotted into a rope, the 63-year-old Marshal attached one end to his body and tied the other end to a gargoyle and climbed down the 300 foot cliffs to a boat which his wife had brought out from Cannes. They sailed to [[Genoa]] in Italy, and from there Bazaine came to London with his young family where he stayed for a time with his Hayter relations.\n\n== Later life ==\n\nBy midsummer 1875, Bazaine had settled in [[Madrid]], where he was treated with marked respect by the government of [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]], who were grateful for Bazaine's conspicuous bravery as a young Foreign Legion Officer in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist War]]. Queen Isabella had arranged lodgings for him and his family in the [[Calle Hortaleza]]. In these spartan rooms, he toiled slowly on his book ''Episodes de la guerre de 1870'' which was published in 1883, in which he recorded his defence against the 1873 accusation of treason. With his own means stripped of him, he had his eldest son's pay to depend upon besides the assistance of some well-known army men who were charitable to the old soldier.<ref>New York Times: 30 September 1888</ref>\n\nAs his years progressed, the numerous wounds Bazaine had received while serving France during his 40-year Army career caused the ex-marshal's health to deteriorate further each winter. The last years he spent alone. Pepita did not like Spain and took her daughter to Mexico. Pepita expected to receive compensation from the Mexican government for the loss of the couple's property. Meanwhile, Bazaine stayed in Spain with his two sons, could no longer pay his lodgings and moved to miserable rooms in the [[Calle de Atocha|Calle Atocha]]. He had to cook for himself, and allowed himself only one luxury: a few small cigars each week. On 20 September 1888, he was found dead in his lodgings. At seventy-seven, his heart had given out. He had never fully recovered from an infection he contracted during the harsh Madrid winter of 1887/8. Bazaine's remains were interred on 24 September 1888 in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid, his sons and [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez-Campos y Ant\u00f3n|Marshal Campos]] attending the funeral, his sword and epaulettes resting on his coffin.<ref>New York Times: 25 September 1888</ref> The officiating priest was a relative of his wife. French newspapers remained vitriolic in their reporting of the Marshal's passing \"Let his corpse be flung in to the first ditch. As for his memory, it is nailed forever to the pillory\".<ref>La Paris:  25 September 1888</ref> German papers refer to Bazaine kindly and repeat that he was wronged by his own people.\n\nIn the same year as Bazaine's death, Count d'Herrison published an account<ref>Comte d'H\u00e9risson, ''La L\u00e9gende de Metz'' (Paris, 1888)</ref> in defence of the Marshal's decisions during the Franco-Prussian war, which cast significant, verifiable doubt upon the characters and motivations of witnesses whose testimonies were key to the finding of the court that Bazaine was guilty of treason. Between 1904 and 1912, the French Court of Appeal lawyer [[\u00c9lie Peyron]] published several works in defence of Bazaine.<ref>\u00c9lie Peyron ''Bazaine fut-il un tra\u00eetre?'' (Paris, Picard 1904)</ref><ref>\u00c9lie Peyron ''Le cas de Bazaine'' (Paris, Stock, 1905)</ref><ref>\u00c9lie Peyron ''Bazaine devant ses juges'' (Paris, Stock, 1912)</ref>\n\n\"The [[Nobility|Duke]], [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] and [[List of Presidents of France|3rd President of France]] [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|de MacMahon]], survived Bazaine by five years; Paris gave President Marshal MacMahon a funeral that choked the wide boulevards for hours. The ''[[wikt:doyen|Doyen]]'' of Marshals [[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert|de Canrobert]], last of the [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] [[Marshal of France|Marshals]] of the [[Second French Empire]], was buried like a prince in 1895. The Foreign Legion, which has never felt obliged to accept the French view on anything, still honours Bazaine. In its museum there exists almost no trace of MacMahon, nor of Canrobert or of [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud|de Saint-Arnaud]]. Bazaine however has his own corner, adorned with his battered kepi, the bits and pieces of the harness he used at Rezonville and [[Gravelotte]], and the cross Conrad pinned on him after Macta. The Legion knows that courage is not a mask that a soldier can wear or discard at will\".<ref>Hugh McLeave; ''The Damned Die Hard'' (Page 83-84)</ref> To this day, the Legion annually pays tribute to Bazaine's courage while [[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res|de Chabri\u00e8res]], another [[Nobility|noble]], along with [[Rapha\u00ebl Vienot|Vienot]], have actually and had more than one regimental garrison named after them.\n\n== Decorations ==\n\nFor the accusations brought upon him, he was suspended of his rights to wear his French and Foreign decorations.\n\nFor the record and Memory, the decorations and distinctions which he earned formerly were:\n\n* [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Grand-Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], 2 July 1863 \n* [[M\u00e9daille Militaire]]\n* Commemorative Medals of [[Crimea Medal|Crimea]], [[Commemorative medal of the 1859 Italian Campaign|Italy]] and [[Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition|Mexico]] \n* Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]]\n* [[Old Military Order of Savoy|Knight Grand Cross of the Italian Order of Savoy]]\n* [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Grand Ciordon of the Order of L\u00e9opold of the Belgians]]\n* [[Order of the Lion and the Sun|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion and the Sun of Persia]]\n* [[Mexican Imperial Orders|Grand Cross of the Order of the Mexican Eagle]]\n* [[Mexican Imperial Orders|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of our Lady of Guadalupe]]\n* [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Knight of the Order of St. Ferdinand of Spain]]\n* [[Order of Charles III|Knight of the Order of Charles III of Spain]]\n* [[Order of Isabel the Catholic|Knight of the Order of Isabel the Catholic]]\n* Silver Medal of the [[Old Military Order of Savoy]]\n\nHe was cited 10 times for serving France and 4 times for serving Spain.\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Rapport du mar\u00e9chal Bazaine : Bataille de Rezonville.

Rising from the ranks, during four decades of distinguished service (including 35 years on campaign) under [[Louis-Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]] and then [[Napoleon III]], he held every rank in the army from Fusilier to [[Marshal of France]]. He became renowned for his determination to lead from the front, for his impassive bearing under fire and for personal bravery verging on the foolhardy, which resulted in him being wounded on numerous occasions and having his horse shot from under him twice. From 1863 he was a [[Marshal of France]], and it was in this role that he surrendered the last organized French army to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] during the [[Franco-Prussian war]], during the [[Siege of Metz (1870)|siege of Metz]].\n\nSentenced to death by the government of the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]] following the war, his sentence was commuted to 20 years imprisonment in exile, from which he subsequently escaped. He eventually settled in [[Spain]] where aged 77, he died alone and impoverished in 1888. To the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] he remains a hero and to this day is honoured as one of their bravest soldiers.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHis father, General [[Pierre-Dominique Bazaine]], a polytechnic (promotion X1803), meritorious engineer of [[Napoleon I]] and director of the Institute of Communications Channels of the Russian Empire. Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine was born at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], on 13 February 1811, from an affair prior to his father's marriage, with Marie-Madeleine, Jos\u00e8phe dit M\u00e9lanie Vasseur. His elder brother [[Adolphe Bazaine-Vasseur|Pierre-Dominique Bazaine]] was a renowned engineer. Achille Bazaine conducted studies at the institute of Bader (or Barbet), then the college of Saint-Louis.\n\n== French Foreign Legion & Algeria ==\n\nWhile not passing the academic entry test of the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique|French Polytechnic School]] in 1830, he enlisted as a simple soldier ([[Private (rank)|private]]) on 28 March 1831 at the 37th Line Infantry Regiment ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:37e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne|37<sup>e</sup> r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne]]}}), and was promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Caporal]] ([[Corporal]]) on 8 July 1831. He was subsequently passed to Corporal Fourrier on 13 January 1832 and [[Ranks in the French Army|Segent]] ([[Sergeant]]) Fourrier (''fourrier'': non-commissioned officer responsible for stewardship) in July.\n\nWith this rank, he arrived to the [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|French Foreign Legion]] in August. He was designated as [[Sergeant major|Sergent-Major]], on 4 November, he attained the [[Epaulette]] on 2 November 1833 and on 22 July 1835, he was wounded in the battle of [[Battle of Macta|Macta]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Bataille de la Macta|la Macta]]}}) \nof fires to the wrist, and was promoted to the rank of [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant]] and received the knight order of the [[Legion d'honneur]].\n\nWith the Legion, he was ceded by [[Louis Philippe I]] to [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Queen Christine]] to combat the Carlists. Named immediately Spanish [[Ranks in the French Army|Captain]] at Foreign Title, he commanded a company of voltigeurs then was attached to the general staff headquarters of colonel Conrad. He was cited at the combats of Ponts ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Ponts (Espagne)|Ponts]]}}) in 1835, Larminar ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Larminar|Larminar]]}}) in 1836, Huesca ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Huesca|Huesca]]}}) in 1837 and the battle of Barbastro in 1837, where he dragged out the body of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Conrad from the hands of the enemy, despite a bullet wound to the right leg. He was then attached to colonel Cari\u00e8s de Senilhes, commissioner of the French government to the Army of Spain.\n\nIn 1838, he joined the 4th Light Infantry with his French rank of Lieutenant. On 20 October 1839, he was re-promoted to Captain in the Legion in [[French Algeria|Algeria]]. In 1840, he passed to the 8th Chasseurs \u00e0 Pied Battalion. He partook in a part to the expeditions in Miliana ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Miliana|Miliana]]}}) where he was cited, from [[Kabylie]] and [[Morocco]]. Promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de battaillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant]] \u2013 [[Major]]), on 10 March 1844, he was assigned to the 58th Line Infantry Regiment in quality as the Arab Bureau Chief of [[Tlemcen]]. He was promoted to officer order of the [[Legion d'honneur]] following the combat of Sidi Kafir, on 9 November 1845. Cited to the combat of Sidi Afis, on 24 March 1846, he passed to the 5th Line Infantry Regiment while still in charge of Arab relations, in 1847. He was cited at the combats of Afir for his contribution to the submission of [[Emir Abdelkader|AbdelKader]] in December. Promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]] on 11 April 1848, he was assigned to the 19th Light Infantry Regiment then went back to the 5th Line Infantry Regiment on 30 August in quality as superior commander of the place of [[Tlemcen]]. On 4 June 1850, he was designated as a colonel in the 55th Line Infantry Regiment ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:55e r\u00e9giment d'infanterie de ligne|55<sup>e</sup> de ligne]]}}) and Director of the Arba Affairs division of Oran.\n\nOn 4 February 1851, he was placed at the head of the [[1st Foreign Regiment|1st Regiment of the 1st Foreign Legion]] [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|1<sup>er</sup> R.E.L.E]], and the next month, he commanded the subdivision of Sidi bel Abes, a post which he occupied until 1854. During this commandment time, he married Maria Juaria Gregorio Tormo de la Soledad, on 12 June 1852.\n\n== Crimea and Italy ==\n\nOn 28 October 1854, he was admitted to the 1st section of officer generals with the rank of [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] and commanded two regiments of the Legion at the Army of the Orient. On 10 September 1855, he became the military commandant of [[Sevastopol]] and [[g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division]] on the next 22 September. During the [[Crimean War]], he was wounded and cited during the attack of the ''Quarantaine'', with a horse shot underneath him, the same day. In October, he won another citation, earning him the commander order the [[Legion d'honneur]] for the apprehension of the position of Kinbourn at the closing of [[Dniepr]], which he concluded in three days.\n\nThe way in which he conducted the left wing of the French forces in the final Allied assault on Sebastopol on 8 September 1855 (wounded, shell fragment in left hip, his horse killed under him), received acclaim of the highest order from the Allied Command and he was subsequently promoted to Major General (General de Division) on 22 September 1855 and selected from all the Allied Generals to assume the Governorship of Sebastopol.\n\nAt 44, this made him the youngest General in the French Army. In October 1855, Bazaine was chosen to give the ''coup de gr\u00e2ce''. With a mixed French and British Force, he sailed to [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Kinburn]] at the mouth of the Dnieper to attack the remaining Russian forces to the North of Sebastopol. He led a daring landing and seized the naval fortress with a frontal assault, an action for which he received particular praise: \"General Bazaine who commands that portion of the French Army now operating at the mouth of the Dnieper may be cited as presenting one of the most brilliant examples of the achievement of military distinction in the modern day\".<ref>Illustrated London News: 1855</ref> At Sebastopol, on 25 June 1856 he was invested by the British Commander in Chief, [[Lord Gough]], with the [[Order of the Bath]], for his conspicuous contribution to the Allied campaign during the Crimean War.\n\nUpon his return to France, he occupied the post of inspector of the infantry then commanded the 19th Infantry Division ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:19e division d'infanterie (France)|19<sup>e</sup> Division Militaire]]}}) at Bourges.\n\nCommander of the 3rd Infantry Division ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:3e division d'infanterie (France)|3<sup>e</sup> Division d'Infanterie]]}}) of the [[1st Army Corps (France)|1st Army Corps]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:1er corps d'arm\u00e9e (France)|1<sup>er</sup> Corps d'Arm\u00e9e]]}}) of [[Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers]], he was close to the combat line of [[Melegnano]], on 8 June 1859, and the [[Battle of Solferino]], on 24 June, during the conquest of the cemetery.\n\nActually, during that year in 1859, he commanded the Division in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Sardinian campaign]] against Austrian forces in [[Lombardy]]. He was wounded by a shell splinter in the head on 8 June, during the action at the [[Melegnano|Battle of Melegnano]]. He recovered to play a conspicuous part in the [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]], which he captured on 24 June 1859, despite being wounded again (bullet to the upper thigh) and having his horse shot from under him again, earning another citation.\n\n== Mexico ==\n[[File:Bazaine Disd\u00e9ri BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Francois Achille Bazaine in 1860.]]\n\nReturned to [[Paris]], he was designated as the general inspector of the 4th and 5th infantry arrondissements. The souvenir of Spain made him suggest to [[Napoleon III]] to lend the [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|French Foreign Legion]] to the new emperor in [[Mexico]]. This idea would become that of the Emperor.\n\nBazaine was later designated to be part of the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|expedition to Mexico]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:intervention fran\u00e7aise au Mexique|exp\u00e9dition du Mexique]]}}).\n\nCommandant of the 1st Infantry Division of [[Second French intervention in Mexico|expditionary corps to Mexico]] on 1 July 1862, his action was decisive during the siege of [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Puebla]] in 1863. He commanded with great distinction the First Division under [[Elie Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Forey|General (afterwards Marshal) Forey]] in the Mexican expedition in 1862, where he pursued the war with great vigour and success, driving President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] to the frontier. His decisive action was instrumental in the taking of the city of Puebla in 1863. As a consequence, he was cited and designated at the head of the expeditionary corps by replacing [[\u00c9lie Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Forey]]. He received a citation at the battle of San Lorenzo and the insignias of the [[Legion d'honneur|Grand-Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], on 2 July 1863. He was elevated to the dignity of [[Marshal of France]] and [[Senator]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:liste des s\u00e9nateurs du Second Empire|Senator of the Second Empire]]}}) of the [[Second French Empire]] by Imperial decree on 5 September 1864, the first Marshal who had started as a Legionnaire.<ref name=\"time.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802905-2,00.html|publisher=Time|date=26 July 1943|accessdate=22 September 2008|title=Bazaine and Retain}}</ref> He commanded in person the siege of [[Oaxaca de Juarez|Oaxaca]] in February 1865, following which, the Emperor complimented him while decorating him with the M\u00e9daille militaire, on 28 April 1865.\n\nHere as in 1870, two of Bazaine's nephews, Adolphe and [[George Albert Bazaine-Hayter|Albert Bazaine-Hayter]] served with their uncle as his [[aide-de-camp]]. The Marshal's African experience as a soldier and as an administrator stood him in good stead in dealing with the ''guerrilleros'' of the Ju\u00e1rez party, but he was less successful in his relations with Maximilian, with whose court the French headquarters was in constant strife.\n\nHis first wife died while he was in Mexico. While he was in Mexico, Bazaine got engaged then to Maria-Josefa Pedraza de la Pe\u00f1a y Barrag\u00e1n on 28 May 1865, then married her. [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] offered him the palace of Buena Vista.\n\nHis enemies whispered that he aimed to depose Maximilian and get the throne of Mexico for himself,<ref name=\"time.com\"/> or that he aspired to play the part of a [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Bernadotte]]. His marriage to a rich Mexican lady (Pepita de la Pe\u00f1a y Azcarate), whose family were supporters of Ju\u00e1rez, still further complicated his relations with the unfortunate emperor, and when at the close of the [[American Civil War]] the United States sent a powerful war-trained army to the Mexican frontier, Napoleon III commanded Bazaine to withdraw French forces and return to France. Bazaine skillfully conducted the retreat and embarkation at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] (1867).\n\nConsequently, his relations with Emperor Maximilian became tense. He was accused of dragging the expedition against the will of Napoleon III, a situation which provoked his repatriation. On 12 November 1867, he obtained the commandment of the [[3rd Army Corps (France)|3rd Army Corps]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:3e corps d'arm\u00e9e (France)|3<sup>e</sup> Corps d'Arm\u00e9e]]}}) at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], and the following year, he commanded the camp of [[Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne|Ch\u00e2lons]] then replaced [[Auguste Regnaud de Saint-Jean d'Ang\u00e9ly]] at the head of the [[Imperial Guard]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:LE G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL BAZAINE ATTAQUE LE FORT DE SAN-XAVIER LORS DU SI\u00c8GE DE PUEBLA par Jean-Adolphe Beauce 29 March 1863.png|General Bazaine (front centre) attacking the Fort San-Xavier during the Siege of Puebla on 29 March 1863, by Jean-Adolphe Beauce\nFile:Exp\u00e9dition du Mexique. \u2014 La population de Guadalajara se portant au devant du corps du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bazaine \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e dans la ville.

On the other hand, while he was presented with the occasion to destroy several enemy army corps following the [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:bataille de Mars-la-Tour|bataille de Mars-la-Tour]]}}), on 16 August, he decided, to the astonishment of his general staff headquarters to unfold his army of 180,000 men at [[Siege of Metz (1870)|Metz]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Si\u00e8ge de Metz (1870)|Metz]]}}), accordingly cutting himself from free France and his reserves. Two days later, at the eve of the [[Battle of Gravelotte|Battle of Saint-Privat]] ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:bataille de Saint-Privat|bataille de Saint-Privat]]}}), Marshal [[Fran\u00e7ois Certain de Canrobert]] requested urgently and for several times reinforcements from Bazaine, but did not obtain them. The latter had judged that Saint-Privat was not an important battle and refused to engage his reserve troops, which were numerous. No reinforcements were sent to the French troops which were engaged heroically in combat on the plateau and Bazaine didn't even appear on the field of battle.\n\nDirecting the only true organized armed force of France at that moment, he seemed to consider it mainly as a political tool and contemplated the various intrigues, notably with the [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress]], probably to restore the Empire torn since 4 September. He negotiated equally with the Germans the authorization of an exit of his army \u00ab pour sauver la France d'elle-m\u00eame \u00bb (to save France from itself), which meant from the republican push, as in revolutionary. It was during this stage that he vigorously opposed captain [[Louis Rossel]] who wanted to pursue the war and not betray his country (Rossel was the only officer to join since 19 March 1871 the [[Paris Commune]]).\n\nSince the [[Battle of Sedan|Fall of Sedan]], on 2 September, he represented the last hope in the French camp, Bazaine renounced to pursue combat and capitulated on 28 October. This surrender is often explained by the lack of motivation of Bazaine to defend a government which was corresponding less and less to his conservative ideas. However, Bazaine also presented the situation differently in a letter on 2 November 1870 in the ''Journal du Nord'' (Northern Journal): \"famine, the atmospheres brought down the arms of 63,000 real combatants which remained (the artillery no longer fixed and the cavalry demounted, all this after having eaten the majority of horses and searched the land in all directions to find rarely a weak provision to general privations).[...] Add to this dark painting more 20,000 sick or wounded to the point of absence of medicines and a torrential rain since 15 days now, flooding the camps and not allowing the men to rest because their small tents were the only shelter they had\".\n\nThe news of this surrender afflicted France, while general [[Louis-Jules Trochu]] couldn't even seem to loosen the German noose around [[Paris]] which was besieged. [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], gone to [[Tours]] in the hope to assemble a Liberation army, understood that his tentative was unworkable and accordingly launched a proclamation where he explicitly accused Bazaine of treason in his speech: \"Metz was capitulated. A general on who France was counting on, even after Mexico, just lifted from the Nation more than a 100,000 of its defenders. Marshal Bazaine has betrayed. He has made himself the agent of Sedan, the partner in crime with the invader, and, in the middle of the army which had the guard of, he simply delivered it, without even attempting a supreme effort, 120,000 combatants, 20,000 wounded, guns, cannons, the flags and the strongest citadels of France, Metz, virgin, to him, of foreign defilements\".\n\n=== \"Nous marchons \u00e0 un d\u00e9sastre\" ===\n\nIt is clear even at this early stage that Bazaine was acutely aware of his Army's shortcomings against the well known speed and menacing efficiency of the Prussian military machine, evidenced by his remark to a friend whilst boarding the train from Paris to Metz: \"''Nous marchons \u00e0 un d\u00e9sastre''.\" (\"We are walking into a disaster.\") He had absorbed certain lessons that were to become a vital part of French military thought. From the story of Waterloo he had learned that a line of resolute men on the defensive could again and again break an enemy attack. From Mexico he had watched Lee's dashing Confederates lose a war despite their commander's brilliance in attack. He had also learned that dramatic sorties were invaluable in North Africa but were risky against European armies. Finally, Bazaine saw with misgivings the Prussian invention all-steel [[Krupp]] breech-loading gun, which was to shape the future of artillery on the battlefield. He concluded at this time that for France defensive war is better than offensive war. \"It is better,\" he said, \"to conduct operations systematically (i.e., defensively), as in the Seventeenth Century.\"<ref name=\"time.com\"/>\n\n=== Takes over as Commander in Chief from Napoleon III ===\n\nBazaine took no part in the earlier battles, but after the defeats of Marshal MacMahon's French Forces at W\u00f6rth and Marshal Canrobert's at Forbach, [[Napoleon III]] (who was in increasingly poor health) was swift to give Bazaine the title of Commander-in-Chief of the French Army on 13 August 1870. At the time, Napoleon's choice was considered to be a wise one. It was widely believed by French politicians and soldiers alike, that if anyone was capable of saving France from the Prussian onslaught, it was \"notre glorieux Bazaine\" (\"our glorious Bazaine\"). He was the only remaining Marshal of France not to have suffered defeat at the hands of Prussian forces in the early weeks of the war. However, being the youngest of the French Marshals, Napoleon's choice was met with suspicion and jealousy by the older, socially superior Marshals. Hence it was with reluctance that he took up the chief command, and his tenure became the central act in the tragedy of 1870. He found the army in retreat, ill-equipped and numerically at a great disadvantage, and the generals and officers discouraged and distrustful of one another. Bazaine's solution was to bring back his army to [[Metz]]. The day after assuming command of the Army, on 14 August at [[Battle of Borny-Colombey|Borny]] he was badly wounded by a shell on the left shoulder, a fact which was to be excluded from his service roll presented at his Court Martial in 1873.\n\n=== Spicheren ===\nHow far his inaction was the cause of the disaster of [[Battle of Spicheren|Spicheren]] is a matter of dispute. The best that can be said of his conduct is that the traditions of warfare on a small scale and the mania for taking up \"strong positions,\" common to the French generals of 1870, were in Bazaine's own case emphasized by his personal dislike for the \"schoolmaster\" [[Charles Auguste Frossard|Frossard]], lately the Prince Imperial's tutor and now commander of the army corps posted at Spicheren. Frossard himself, the leader of the \"strong positions\" school, could only blame his own theories for the paralysis of the rest of the army, which left the corps at Spicheren to fight unsupported. Bazaine, indeed, when called upon for help, moved part of his corps forward, but only to \"take up strong positions,\" not to strike a blow on the battlefield.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt seems to be clearly established that the charges of [[treason]] had as yet no foundation in fact. Nor, indeed, can his unwillingness to leave the [[Moselle]] region, while there was yet time to slip past the advancing enemy, be considered even as proof of special incompetence. The resolution to stay in the neighbourhood of Metz was based on the knowledge that if the slow-moving French army ventured far out it would infallibly be headed off and brought to battle in the open by superior numbers. In \"strong positions\" close to his stronghold, however, Bazaine hoped that he could inflict damaging repulses and heavy slaughter on the ardent Germans, and in the main the result justified the expectation. The scheme was creditable, and even heroic, but the execution throughout all ranks, from the Marshal to the battalion commanders, fell far short of the idea. The minutely cautious methods of movement, which Algerian experience had evolved suitable enough for small African desert columns, which were liable to surprise rushes and ambushes, reduced the mobility of a large army, which had favourable marching conditions, to 5 miles a day as against the enemy's rate of 15. When, before he had finally decided to stay in Metz, Bazaine attempted halfheartedly to begin a retreat on [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]], the staff work and organization of the movement over the Moselle was so ineffective that when the German staff calculated that Bazaine was nearing Verdun, the French had in reality barely got their artillery and baggage trains through the town of Metz. Even on the battlefield the Marshal forbade the general staff to appear, and conducted the fighting by means of his personal orderly officers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n[[File:Marshal Bazaine with his personal staff officers in 1870.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bazaine and his staff officers including Colonel Willette and his nephews Capt Adolphe Bazaine-Hayter and [[George Albert Bazaine-Hayter|Lt George Bazaine-Hayter]] in 1870]]\n\n=== Mars-la-Tour ===\nAfter the cumbrous army had passed through Metz it encountered an isolated corps of the enemy near the village of [[Battle of Mars-la-Tour|Mars-la-Tour]], which was commanded by the brilliant leader [[Constantin von Alvensleben]], and promptly attacked the French. At almost every moment of the day victory was in Bazaine's hands. Two corps of the Germans fought all day for bare existence. But Bazaine had no confidence in his generals or his troops, and contented himself with inflicting severe losses on the most aggressive portions of the German army.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n=== Gravelotte and Sedan ===\nTwo days later, while the French actually retreated on Metz (taking seven hours to cover 5 to 6 miles) the masses of the Germans gathered in front of Bazaine's Army at [[Battle of Gravelotte|Gravelotte]], intercepting his communication with the interior of France. This Bazaine expected, and feeling certain that the Germans would sooner or later attack him in his chosen position, he made no attempt to interfere with their concentration. The great battle was fought, and having inflicted severe punishment on his assailants, Bazaine fell back within the entrenched camp of Metz. But although he made no appeals for help, the only remaining army of France, [[Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta|Marshal Mac-Mahon]]'s ''[[Army of Ch\u00e2lons]]'', moved to rescue Bazaine. Napoleon III followed close behind MacMahon's army in a carriage. When on 2 September 1870, MacMahon blundered into a German trap at [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]], the Emperor mounted a horse despite his pain, rode along the firing line for hours seeking death. It never found him. Napoleon III surrendered with 80,000 men.<ref name=\"time.com\"/> With Sedan the Second Empire collapsed, Napoleon III being taken as a prisoner of war.\n\n=== Siege of Metz ===\nThe Prussian army of 200,000 men now [[Siege of Metz (1870)|besieged the city of Metz]], where 3 French marshals, 50 generals, 135,000 men, and 600 guns were encircled. Bazaine attempted to break the siege at [[Battle of Noisseville|Noisseville]] on 31 August but the French were repulsed, losing 3,500 men in the attempt. There were supplies in Metz to last no more than a month, such that by early September the order was given for work horses to be slaughtered for food. By mid September, cavalry horses also began to be slaughtered. Without cavalry and horses to pull the guns, Bazaine's ability to mount effective attempts to break out rapidly diminished. On 7 October, hungry and immobilised, Bazaine dispatched two 40,000 man foraging parties along both banks of the Moselle, but the Prussian guns blew the French wagons off the road and the Prussian infantry cut swathes through the desperate French soldiers with [[Chassepot]]s captured at Sedan. Over 2,000 men were lost in this operation. Typhus and smallpox was spreading and by 10 October, it is estimated that 19,000 of the French troops in Metz were hospitalised. A further attempt was made to break the siege on 18 October at [[Battle of Bellevue|Bellevue]], but again the French troops were repulsed, with the loss of 1,250 men. The city was on its knees, the troops and inhabitants on the point of starvation.\n\n=== Diplomacy, then surrender ===\nAs commander of the only remaining organized army of France, Bazaine took it upon himself, perhaps justifiably, to control the country's destiny. He refused to recognise the new [[Government of National Defense|Government of National Defence]], formed following Napoleon's capture and the resulting collapse of his government, and instead engaged in a series of diplomatic negotiations with the Prussian high command and [[Empress Eugenie]] who with the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial]] had fled to [[Hastings]], England. The purport of these negotiations still remain to some extent obscure, but it is beyond question that he proposed with the permission of the Prussians to employ his army in \"saving France from herself\", perhaps to ignite a revolution against the government of the Third Republic. When considered in light of the fact that Bazaine had long been a known [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]], his actions were clearly designed to forge a way to restore the monarchy.\n\nThe scheme, however, collapsed and Bazaine surrendered the Army of the Rhine, who became prisoners of war to the number of 180,000. This surrender is often explained by Bazaine's lack of motivation to defend a government that corresponded less and less to his political ideals and the best interests of France, as he saw it.  A week's further resistance would have potentially enabled the levies of the National Defence government to crush the weak forces of the Germans on the [[Loire]] and to relieve Paris. But the army of [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828\u20131885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]], set free from the siege of Metz by Bazaine's surrender, hurried up in time to check and to defeat the great effort at [[Second Battle of Orleans (1870)|Orl\u00e9ans]].\n\n== Trial ==\n\n[[File:T-bazaine.jpg|right|thumb|Marshal Bazaine]]\n\n=== Prelude ===\n\nThe defection of Bazaine liberated the army besieged by Germans, and who hastened to [[Orleans]] to front face the initiative in progress of raising a Republican Army. It was then therefore easy to bear the moral weight of the defeat to Bazaine. In August 1873, he arrived to Paris, where an investigation board procedure was opened on the initiative of general [[Ernest Courtot de Cissey]]. The investigative board gave their advice which led to several accusations. The defendant Bazaine requested then to be case presented in front of a war council. The royalists and the republicans held their ''bouc \u00e9missaire'' in order to weight all the responsibilities of a defeat to a bonapartiste and justify the [[French Third Republic|proclamation of the French Republic of 4 September 1870]], attempting to show the incapacity of the Emperor, by interposed person. Certain bonapartists, were not unhappy that Bazaine was being judged, blacking out accordingly the responsibilities of Napoleon III. Bazaine was then the ideal expiatory victim who was translated in front of a war council sitting at [[Grand Trianon]]. The [[Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Aumale|Duke of Aumale]], President, condemned him to death with military degradation for having capitulated in an open campaign, collaborated with the enemy and surrendered Metz before having exhausted all defense means available to the defendant. However, the same tribunal, which just condemned him, signed unanimously and sent to the [[List of Presidents of France|President of France]] (and the Minister of War) a request of mercy in regards to ''M. Marshal Bazaine''. His sentence was commuted then to 20 years in prison, without degradation ceremony, by the new President-Marshal [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|MacMahon]], who also was beaten at Sedan. This inspired Victor Hugo the following comment :  \u00ab Mac-Mahon absolves Bazaine. Sedan washes Metz. The idiot protects the traitor \u00bb.<ref>Victor Hugo, Choses vues 1870\u20131885, p. 321, Paris, Gallimard, 1972, total pages 529, {{ISBN|2-07-036141-1}}</ref>\n\nHe was incarcerated at a Fort. However, with the help of ex-Captain Doineau, Arab Bureaux, his aide de camp, lieutenant-colonel Henri-L\u00e9on Willette and his wife, who shared his captivity, he was able to escape in night of 9 and 10 August 1874 and went to Spain.\n\n=== Accusation of treason ===\n\nThe French nation could not rest with the thought that their military supremacy had been broken by the superiority of the Prusso-German armies; their defeats could have proceeded only from the treachery or incapacity of their leaders. The commanders who had surrendered the French fortresses to the enemy were subjected to a trial by court-martial under the presidency of [[Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers|Marshal Baraguey d'Hilliers]]. The majority of them were, on account of their proved incapacity or weakness, deprived of their military honours. Even Ulrich, the once celebrated commander of Strasbourg, whose name had been given to a street in Paris, was brought under the censure of the court-martial. But the chief blow fell upon the Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Bazaine, to whose \"treachery\" the whole misfortune of France was to be attributed.\n\nWhen Bazaine returned from captivity, aware that in his absence he had been put forward as a scapegoat by the new government of the Third Republic for France's defeat at the hands of the Prussians, he was keen to be given an opportunity to clear his name and put his version of events to the public. In 1872, Bazaine published his account of the events of 1870 in ''L'Arm\u00e9e du Rhin'' and formally requested and was granted a trial before a military court. For months he was retained a prisoner at the [[Grand Trianon]] in the Palace of Versailles with his wife and two youngest children, while preparations were made for the great court-martial spectacle, which started the following year on 6 October 1873 under the presidency of the [[Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Aumale|Duc D'Aumale]] in the Grand Trianon's Peristyle. <!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Bazaine and his young family in 1873 v1.jpg|left|thumb|Bazaine and his family under house arrest at Petit Trianon, Versailles 1873]] -->\n\nFor some time the Duke and his colleagues had been looking for a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid responsibility before history. Bazaine stated in his defence ''\"I have graven on my chest two words \u2013 [[Legion of Honour|Honneur et Patrie]]. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ\"''.<ref>Hugh McLeave: ''The Damned Die Hard'' (Page 81)</ref> Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. \"''I have read every word of the evidence [against Bazaine] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry''\" (New York Times correspondent).<ref name=\"New York Times: 12 December 1873\">New York Times: 12 December 1873</ref> A letter which [[Prince Frederick Charles]] wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless.  Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was \"''It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family''\". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death \u2014 [[Michel Ney|Ney]], by a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], and Bazaine, by an [[House of Orl\u00e9ans|Orl\u00e9ans]]. But, as though the judges themselves felt a twinge of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.\n\n=== Imprisonment and escape ===\n\nMacMahon, who was a fellow Foreign Legion Officer and had served in many campaigns alongside Bazaine, was visibly disgusted when he received the news of the Court's decision and was incensed by their attempt to pass responsibility to him.<ref name=\"New York Times: 12 December 1873\"/> The government wanted to banish Bazaine for life; MacMahon first proposed life imprisonment, though he softened and commuted the punishment of death to twenty years' imprisonment and remitted the disgrace of the formalities of a military degradation. Bazaine wrote to thank his fellow legionnaire, though he added, tongue in cheek, that he might have let his feelings run away with him. It was an academic concession for a man nearing sixty-three. Bazaine was incarcerated on the [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite]] and treated rather as an exile than as a convict. During the night of 10 August 1874, using parcel rope supplied by Angelo Hayter, (son of the Court Painter [[George Hayter|Sir George Hayter]]) and baggage straps which he knotted into a rope, the 63-year-old Marshal attached one end to his body and tied the other end to a gargoyle and climbed down the 300 foot cliffs to a boat which his wife had brought out from Cannes. They sailed to [[Genoa]] in Italy, and from there Bazaine came to London with his young family where he stayed for a time with his Hayter relations.\n\n== Later life ==\n\nBy midsummer 1875, Bazaine had settled in [[Madrid]], where he was treated with marked respect by the government of [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]], who were grateful for Bazaine's conspicuous bravery as a young Foreign Legion Officer in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist War]]. Queen Isabella had arranged lodgings for him and his family in the [[Calle Hortaleza]]. In these spartan rooms, he toiled slowly on his book ''Episodes de la guerre de 1870'' which was published in 1883, in which he recorded his defence against the 1873 accusation of treason. With his own means stripped of him, he had his eldest son's pay to depend upon besides the assistance of some well-known army men who were charitable to the old soldier.<ref>New York Times: 30 September 1888</ref>\n\nAs his years progressed, the numerous wounds Bazaine had received while serving France during his 40-year Army career caused the ex-marshal's health to deteriorate further each winter. The last years he spent alone. Pepita did not like Spain and took her daughter to Mexico. Pepita expected to receive compensation from the Mexican government for the loss of the couple's property. Meanwhile, Bazaine stayed in Spain with his two sons, could no longer pay his lodgings and moved to miserable rooms in the [[Calle de Atocha|Calle Atocha]]. He had to cook for himself, and allowed himself only one luxury: a few small cigars each week. On 20 September 1888, he was found dead in his lodgings. At seventy-seven, his heart had given out. He had never fully recovered from an infection he contracted during the harsh Madrid winter of 1887/8. Bazaine's remains were interred on 24 September 1888 in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid, his sons and [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez-Campos y Ant\u00f3n|Marshal Campos]] attending the funeral, his sword and epaulettes resting on his coffin.<ref>New York Times: 25 September 1888</ref> The officiating priest was a relative of his wife. French newspapers remained vitriolic in their reporting of the Marshal's passing \"Let his corpse be flung in to the first ditch. As for his memory, it is nailed forever to the pillory\".<ref>La Paris:  25 September 1888</ref> German papers refer to Bazaine kindly and repeat that he was wronged by his own people.\n\nIn the same year as Bazaine's death, Count d'Herrison published an account<ref>Comte d'H\u00e9risson, ''La L\u00e9gende de Metz'' (Paris, 1888)</ref> in defence of the Marshal's decisions during the Franco-Prussian war, which cast significant, verifiable doubt upon the characters and motivations of witnesses whose testimonies were key to the finding of the court that Bazaine was guilty of treason. Between 1904 and 1912, the French Court of Appeal lawyer [[\u00c9lie Peyron]] published several works in defence of Bazaine.<ref>\u00c9lie Peyron ''Bazaine fut-il un tra\u00eetre?'' (Paris, Picard 1904)</ref><ref>\u00c9lie Peyron ''Le cas de Bazaine'' (Paris, Stock, 1905)</ref><ref>\u00c9lie Peyron ''Bazaine devant ses juges'' (Paris, Stock, 1912)</ref>\n\n\"The [[Nobility|Duke]], [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] and [[List of Presidents of France|3rd President of France]] [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|de MacMahon]], survived Bazaine by five years; Paris gave President Marshal MacMahon a funeral that choked the wide boulevards for hours. The ''[[wikt:doyen|Doyen]]'' of Marshals [[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert|de Canrobert]], last of the [[Origins of the French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] [[Marshal of France|Marshals]] of the [[Second French Empire]], was buried like a prince in 1895. The Foreign Legion, which has never felt obliged to accept the French view on anything, still honours Bazaine. In its museum there exists almost no trace of MacMahon, nor of Canrobert or of [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud|de Saint-Arnaud]]. Bazaine however has his own corner, adorned with his battered kepi, the bits and pieces of the harness he used at Rezonville and [[Gravelotte]], and the cross Conrad pinned on him after Macta. The Legion knows that courage is not a mask that a soldier can wear or discard at will\".<ref>Hugh McLeave; ''The Damned Die Hard'' (Page 83-84)</ref> To this day, the Legion annually pays tribute to Bazaine's courage while [[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res|de Chabri\u00e8res]], another [[Nobility|noble]], along with [[Rapha\u00ebl Vienot|Vienot]], have actually and had more than one regimental garrison named after them.\n\n== Decorations ==\n\nFor the accusations brought upon him, he was suspended of his rights to wear his French and Foreign decorations.\n\nFor the record and Memory, the decorations and distinctions which he earned formerly were:\n\n* [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Grand-Croix of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]], 2 July 1863 \n* [[M\u00e9daille Militaire]]\n* Commemorative Medals of [[Crimea Medal|Crimea]], [[Commemorative medal of the 1859 Italian Campaign|Italy]] and [[Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition|Mexico]] \n* Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]]\n* [[Old Military Order of Savoy|Knight Grand Cross of the Italian Order of Savoy]]\n* [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Grand Ciordon of the Order of L\u00e9opold of the Belgians]]\n* [[Order of the Lion and the Sun|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion and the Sun of Persia]]\n* [[Mexican Imperial Orders|Grand Cross of the Order of the Mexican Eagle]]\n* [[Mexican Imperial Orders|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of our Lady of Guadalupe]]\n* [[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Knight of the Order of St. Ferdinand of Spain]]\n* [[Order of Charles III|Knight of the Order of Charles III of Spain]]\n* [[Order of Isabel the Catholic|Knight of the Order of Isabel the Catholic]]\n* Silver Medal of the [[Old Military Order of Savoy]]\n\nHe was cited 10 times for serving France and 4 times for serving Spain.\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Rapport du mar\u00e9chal Bazaine : Bataille de Rezonville.

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 on the [[Type 82 destroyer]]s and replaced Seaslug during the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}} On 16 March 1944 the first meeting of the \"Guided Anti-Aircraft Projectile Committee\", or GAP Committee, was held.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 [[fire-control system]] that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}} A contemporary [[British Army]] project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centred within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nIn December 1944, GAP put out a Naval Staff Target for a new anti-aircraft weapon,{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}} capable of attacking targets at altitudes up to {{convert|50,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and speeds of up to {{convert|700|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}} This project was briefly known as LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\",{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} but soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP,{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}} and then Seaslug. Efforts{{by whom|date=April 2020}} to change the name to \"Triumph\"{{why|date=April 2020}} failed.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile. It was flown to a location in front of the target and then cruised toward it until being triggered by the operator. Its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship, and thus did not meet the need for a longer-ranged weapon. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of LOPGAP.{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} Development was slowed by the [[Air Ministry]] who were opposed to the project as it might take resources away from jet fighter production{{efn-lr|For unclear reasons, considering they were also working on several missile designs of their own.}} and a lack of urgency on the part of both the Admiralty and [[Ministry of Supply]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of LOPGAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===Move to RAE===\nIn 1945 a new Guided Projectiles Establishment was set up under the Controller of Supplies (Air) and in 1946 development of all ongoing missile projects moved to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) new Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nDevelopment slowed further, and in July 1947 the Admiralty approached the [[Henry Tizard]] to see a more \"virile leadership\" of the program. Tizard called a meeting of the [[Defence Research Policy Committee]] (DRPC) and started a process of pushing through four key programs that were intended to enter service in 1957, Seaslug, a corresponding Army/Air Force missile known as [[Red Heathen (missile)|Red Heathen]], the [[Blue Boar (bomb)|Blue Boar]] [[television guidance]] [[glide bomb]], and the [[Fireflash#Red_Hawk|Red Hawk]] [[air-to-air missile]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nIn March 1948 a new report from the DRPC noted there was not enough manpower for all four projects, and put Seaslug at the bottom of the priority list, claiming air attack would be less likely than submarine in the event of war. They suggested the much longer ranged Red Heathen was more important. The Admiralty was of another opinion on the matter.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nThe Navy found an unlikely ally in the Army, who were concerned that Red Heathen was too difficult to move to in a single stage and suggested that Seaslug might be the basis for a more immediate medium-range weapon that could be used both on land and sea. The DPRC also began to have concerns about guiding Red Heathen at its {{convert|100000|yd|km|abbr=on}} maximum range. In September 1948 they agreed to develop Seaslug \"as a matter of insurance\", before further upgrading it in 1949 to \"top priority\".{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=195}} As a result of these changes, the program was seen as having two stages, Stage 1 would deliver missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s would have greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft.\n\n===Experimental systems===\nTwo test systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}} The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs experimental work progressed, the Ministry of Supply began forming an industry team to build production systems. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over convoys or fleets in the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the guidance wings. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the missile's small control surfaces to remain effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized groups became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]]. This version is based on the RAE's early GPV, and retains the rear-mounted boosters before they moved forward on the \"long round\".]]\nThere were two main variants of the Seaslug:\n\n===Mark 1 (GWS.1)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 1 was powered by the solid-fuel ''Foxhound'' (390&nbsp;kg fuel) sustainer motor{{efn-lr|There is a common error about a liquid-fuel sustainer on this model.}} and ''Gosling''(145&nbsp;kg) booster motors. It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets.

''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment.

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 on the [[Type 82 destroyer]]s and replaced Seaslug during the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}} On 16 March 1944 the first meeting of the \"Guided Anti-Aircraft Projectile Committee\", or GAP Committee, was held.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}} A contemporary [[British Army]] project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centred within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nIn December 1944, GAP put out a Naval Staff Target for a new anti-aircraft weapon,{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}} capable of attacking targets at altitudes up to {{convert|50,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and speeds of up to {{convert|700|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}} This project was briefly known as LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\",{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} but soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP,{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}} and then Seaslug. Efforts{{by whom|date=April 2020}} to change the name to \"Triumph\"{{why|date=April 2020}} failed.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile. It was flown to a location in front of the target and then cruised toward it until being triggered by the operator. Its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship, and thus did not meet the need for a longer-ranged weapon. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of LOPGAP.{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} Development was slowed by the [[Air Ministry]] who were opposed to the project as it might take resources away from jet fighter production{{efn-lr|For unclear reasons, considering they were also working on several missile designs of their own.}} and a lack of urgency on the part of both the Admiralty and [[Ministry of Supply]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of LOPGAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===Move to RAE===\nIn 1945 a new Guided Projectiles Establishment was set up under the Controller of Supplies (Air) and in 1946 development of all ongoing missile projects moved to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) new Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nDevelopment slowed further, and in July 1947 the Admiralty approached the [[Henry Tizard]] to see a more \"virile leadership\" of the program. Tizard called a meeting of the [[Defence Research Policy Committee]] (DRPC) and started a process of pushing through four key programs that were intended to enter service in 1957, Seaslug, a corresponding Army/Air Force missile known as [[Red Heathen (missile)|Red Heathen]], the [[Blue Boar (bomb)|Blue Boar]] [[television guidance]] [[glide bomb]], and the [[Fireflash#Red_Hawk|Red Hawk]] [[air-to-air missile]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nIn March 1948 a new report from the DRPC noted there was not enough manpower for all four projects, and put Seaslug at the bottom of the priority list, claiming air attack would be less likely than submarine in the event of war. They suggested the much longer ranged Red Heathen was more important. The Admiralty was of another opinion on the matter.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nThe Navy found an unlikely ally in the Army, who were concerned that Red Heathen was too difficult to move to in a single stage and suggested that Seaslug might be the basis for a more immediate medium-range weapon that could be used both on land and sea. The DPRC also began to have concerns about guiding Red Heathen at its {{convert|100000|yd|km|abbr=on}} maximum range. In September 1948 they agreed to develop Seaslug \"as a matter of insurance\", before further upgrading it in 1949 to \"top priority\".{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=195}} As a result of these changes, the program was seen as having two stages, Stage 1 would deliver missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s would have greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft.\n\n===Experimental systems===\nTwo test systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}} The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs experimental work progressed, the Ministry of Supply began forming an industry team to build production systems. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over convoys or fleets in the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the guidance wings. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the missile's small control surfaces to remain effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized groups became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]]. This version is based on the RAE's early GPV, and retains the rear-mounted boosters before they moved forward on the \"long round\".]]\nThere were two main variants of the Seaslug:\n\n===Mark 1 (GWS.1)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 1 was powered by the solid-fuel ''Foxhound'' (390&nbsp;kg fuel) sustainer motor{{efn-lr|There is a common error about a liquid-fuel sustainer on this model.}} and ''Gosling''(145&nbsp;kg) booster motors. It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets. One of the longest shots recorded was made by HMS ''Antrim'' against a target over {{convert|58,000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} away, with an impact at 34.500 with about 46 seconds flight time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/firings.html|title=Seaslug firing reports |work=Littlewars|publisher=S R Jenkins |date=27 September 2016}}</ref> The missile was capable to reach potentially aven higher altitude and longer range than nominally assested: even after the engine flameout (over 40 seconds after launch), it retained very high speeds, and one of them even surpassed {{convert|85,000|ft|abbr=on}} before being self-destructed, about one minute after the firing <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/whoops.html|title=Whoops -A firing that went slightly wrong! |date=6 June 2017 |work=Littlewars |publisher=S R Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nFor both Mark 1 and Mark 2 Sea Slug there were [[drill round]]s (painted blue) for the purpose of training and display rounds (painted red) which could be loaded onto the launcher for port visits and public relations.  \n\n\n===Nuclear variant (not built)===\nIn addition, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] variant was planned using a low-yield [[Nuclear fission#Fission bombs|fission]] warhead code-named ''Winkle''. ''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment. The magazine was positioned amidships and missiles were assembled in a central gallery forward of the magazine before being passed to the launcher on the quarterdeck. The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.\n\n===Chilean Navy===\nSome of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the [[Chilean Navy]]. The system was decommissioned after the rebuild of the four ships purchased by Chile in the early 1990s.\n\n===Former operators===\n* {{flag|Chile}}: [[Chilean Navy]]\n* {{UK}}: [[Royal Navy]]\n\n==Media appearance==\nA Seaslug system appears in the 1970 ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' TV series episode [[Destruction (UFO)|\"Destruction\"]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book\n|title= British Destroyers & Frigates: The Second World War & After\n|first= Norman |last=Friedman\n|publisher= Seaforth Publishing |date=2012\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|title=The Royal Navy, 1930-2000: Innovation and Defence\n|editor1-first=Richard \n|editor1-last=Harding \n|isbn=0714657107\n|date= 2005\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bw46M1qI9gM\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title= Fire across the desert: Woomera and the Anglo-Australian Joint Project, 1946-1980\n |date=1989\n |publisher= Australian Govt.

It was later replaced with a church. The clocktower is part of an earlier structure, built sometime prior to 1600. The church was reconstructed between 1656 and 1763.<ref>[https://www.organsparisaz4.vhhil.nl/St%20Nicolas%20Chardonnet.htm \"Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet\", The Organs of Paris]</ref>\nIn 1612, Adrien Bourdoise founded a seminary at Saint-Nicolas.\n\nIn the late 17th century noted [[harpsichord]]ist [[Jean-Nicolas Geoffroy]] (1633\u20131694) served as titular organist of the church.\n\nIn the 19th century the adjacent Mutualit\u00e9 site was occupied by a seminary. There, [[Ernest Renan]] studied under the direction of the [[Abb\u00e9 Dupanloup]], who attained celebrity in 1838 when he reconciled the notoriously amoral diplomat [[Talleyrand]], who had received the minor orders at Saint-Nicholas, to the church on his death-bed. (Dupanloup subsequently became [[Bishop of Orl\u00e9ans]] and a member of the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]'').\n\nThe painting, ''Le Bapt\u00eame du Christ'', is by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], who also decorated the ceiling.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v01YAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA385&dq=Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAxuT2za_iAhVtU98KHRjyCgU4ChDoAQg4MAI#v=onepage&q=Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet&f=false ''Galignani's New Paris Guide'', Thirteenth edition, 1838, p. 386]{{PD-notice}}</ref> \n\nSince 1905, the city of Paris, following the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law on the separation of Church and State]], claims ownership of the church but grants the Roman Catholic Church a free usage right.\n\n==1977 occupation and consequences==\nOn 27 February 1977, Monsignor [[Fran\u00e7ois Ducaud-Bourget]], an opponent of the [[Mass of Paul VI|post Vatican II Mass]], organised a meeting at the nearby Maubert Mutalit\u00e9 Lecture Hall.

A [[Chilean Americans|Chilean-American]], Fring is a major [[methamphetamine]] distributor in the [[Southwestern United States]] who uses several legitimate businesses, including a chain of successful fast food [[fried chicken restaurant]]s called Los Pollos Hermanos (The Chicken Brothers) and an [[industrial laundry]] facility called Lavanderia Brillante, as fronts for a vast drug operation. Fring maintains a positive public image; he is a [[boosterism|booster]] for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), befriending the special agent in charge and making large donations to the [[Albuquerque]] office's civic and charitable events. However, he is ruthless and Machiavellian in managing his vast drug empire. He employs a number of enforcers and has personally killed rivals and associates.<ref name=\"AMC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/gustavo-fring |title=Gustavo Fring |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |access-date=October 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nGustavo has a mysterious background, but is supposedly a native of [[Chile]]; he is sometimes referred to by cartel members as \"The Chilean\". In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Pi\u00f1ata (Better Call Saul)|Pi\u00f1ata]]\", Gus tells a comatose Hector a story about a [[coati]] that ate the fruit from a [[Pouteria lucuma|l\u00facuma]] tree Gus tended during his childhood in Chile.  In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Magic Man (Better Call Saul)|Magic Man]]\", Lalo Salamanca refers to a mysterious incident involving Gus which took place in [[Santiago]].

Seeking to expand their drug trade, they met with Mexican cartel leader [[Don Eladio Vuente]]. Eladio rejected their offer, preferring to continue to distribute cocaine, and accused them of disrespect for producing meth in his territory without his permission. [[Hector Salamanca]], one of Eladio's right-hand men, shot Max in the head and forced Gus to watch as Max bled into Eladio's swimming pool. Eladio spared Gus because of his unknown but apparently powerful connection to Chile, but forced him to cooperate with the cartel under Eladio's terms. Gus then moved to Albuquerque and began operating Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants throughout the southwestern United States, which he used to facilitate distribution of the cartel's drugs. While he remains outwardly loyal to the cartel, he spends the next 20 years nursing a grudge against Eladio and Hector and waiting for his chance at revenge. As shown in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Dedicado a Max]]\", at some point before or during the events of ''Better Call Saul'', Gus acquires a small villa just inside the Mexican border.  The villa serves as the residence for [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry_Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]], and Gus installs a fountain there which is dedicated to Max.\n\nGustavo Fring is established as an alias, as neither the DEA nor Gus' enforcer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] can find any records about him prior to his arrival in Mexico. In a flashback during the ''Breaking Bad'' episode \"[[One Minute (Breaking Bad)|One Minute]]\", Hector mockingly refers to him as \"Grand [[Generalissimo]]\", implying that Gus had a connection to the Pinochet regime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guffey |first1=Ensley F. |last2=Koontz |first2= K.

Gus may have also had a similar homosexual relationship with Peter Schuler, the CEO of Madrigal Electromotive, in Santiago at some point, as briefly mentioned in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[JMM (Better Call Saul)|JMM]]\".

Instead of killing Tuco, Mike arranges for Tuco to assault him in view of the police, leading to Tuco's arrest. Mike fears Hector will learn that Mike arranged for Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned that Hector will retaliate against Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike acts preemptively by preparing to assassinate Hector, but is interrupted at the last moment. Mike tracks this interruption to Gus, who explains that he wants to be the one to determine when Hector will die. However, Gus encourages Mike to continue to disrupt the trucks Hector uses to bring ice cream store supplies and drugs from Mexico and send cash back to the cartel.  After Mike disrupts two shipments without revealing his identity, Hector demands that Gus temporarily use his Los Pollos Hermanos trucks to ship both Hector's and Gus' drugs. Gus, who had wanted this result from the start, appears to reluctantly agree.  He later attempts to pay Mike, but Mike refuses the money.  Instead, he asks for assistance laundering the $250,000 he stole from one of Hector's trucks, which Gus provides by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive to hire Mike as a contracted security expert and pay him monthly consulting fees.\n\nWith the new transport agreement in place, Nacho and Arturo Colon arrive at the Los Pollos Hermanos warehouse and farm to pick up a drug shipment, and Nacho attempts to strong-arm his way into taking six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five.  When Gus' subordinate [[Tyrus Kitt]] calls Gus for guidance, Gus recognizes an opportunity to infiltrate the Salamanca organization and tells Tyrus to give Nacho the extra kilo.  Nacho fears that Hector will learn of his role in Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned about Hector's intent to take over Nacho's father's upholstery store for use as a front business.  He secretly swaps Hector's angina medication for a [[placebo]], hoping to induce a fatal heart attack.  At a meeting between Juan Bolsa, Gus, Hector and Nacho, Bolsa informs them that the use of Gus' trucks to move the drugs and cash for both organizations will be a permanent arrangement.  Hector's angry outburst leads to a stroke, and Gus calls for an ambulance while administering first aid that saves Hector's life, though he is comatose.  Nacho follows Mike's previous advice to switch the placebos for Hector's real medication so that foul play will not be suspected.  Gus appears to notice Nacho's actions, but says nothing.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nHector is rushed to the hospital, while Gus is summoned along with Nacho and Arturo to a meeting with Bolsa at the Los Pollos distribution plant, where Bolsa declares that until further notice, the Salamanca operation will continue with Nacho and Arturo in charge until Hector recovers. Suspicious of Nacho's behavior following Hector's stroke, Gus has Victor surveil Nacho, and Victor observes Nacho disposing of the placebo pills he switched with Hector's real medication.\n\nNot wanting to lose his revenge opportunity, Gus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Medical Center]] in Baltimore to oversee Hector's treatment. Upon reviewing Hector's medical records, Gus realizes there is no nitroglycerin in Hector's system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo make their next scheduled drug pickup, Arturo strong arms his way into taking an extra kilo, as Nacho did previously.  Arturo brags about his success as they leave, but Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo to death with a plastic bag, then uses his knowledge of Nacho's activities to blackmail Nacho into becoming a double agent.\n\nTyrus and [[Victor (Breaking Bad)|Victor]] stage a roadside shooting and car fire to make it appear as though Nacho and Arturo were attacked and the drugs they picked up stolen by a rival gang, the Espinosas, which also frames the Espionsas for the truck Mike hijacked while concealing his identity and covers up Nacho's new role as Gus' spy in the Salamanca organization. As part of the scheme, Victor shoots Nacho twice and leaves him on the side of the road near the car.  Nacho calls the Cousins for help and they burn the car, then take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera for emergency surgery that saves his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho's car to the Espinosas.  Nacho then falsely identifies the Espinosas as his attackers.  The Cousins kill everyone in the Espinosa compound and retrieve the \"stolen\" drugs, then leave for Mexico to escape police scrutiny.  Nacho sees that by getting the Salamancas to wipe out the Espinosas, Gus has expanded his drug territory, but he does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.\n\nA year later, Hector has recovered to the point where his mental faculties are sound, but his mobility is limited to the index finger of his right hand. Gus ends his specialized care, in effect trapping Hector's healed mind inside his unhealed body.  Hector's nephew Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in managing the family business. While he privately thanks Gus for coming to Hector's aid, he begins to surveil Gus' activities.\n\nGus plans for a secret \"superlab\" to be constructed under an industrial laundry Gus has purchased for the purpose, which will enable him to produce methamphetamine on the U.S. side of the border rather than relying on cartel cocaine from Mexico. Mike arranges for engineers to be interviewed for the job while Gus secretly looks on. The first candidate is rejected after he glibly assures Mike that the job will be easy and can be done without difficulty even under the constraints Gus requires.  The second candidate, [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], impresses Gus with his forthright analysis of the time, expense, and risk associated with the project, which he calls difficult but not impossible. Gus hires Werner to oversee construction of the lab.\n\nTo accomplish the project in secret, Gus buys a warehouse on the outskirts of the city in which he has long-term living quarters built for Werner and his German crew, who maintain secrecy by travelling from their quarters to the job site unseen, work only at night, and do no work above ground. When construction falls behind schedule, Werner effects an escape and plans to rendezvous with his wife.  Mike catches up to him and realizes that Werner inadvertently revealed some construction details to Lalo.  Gus informs Mike that Werner will have to be killed in order to protect the secret of the lab, and plans to send men to do it.  Mike says that since supervising Werner was his responsibility, he will carry out the execution, which he does by shooting Werner in the head.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to take cocaine of inferior quality when picking up the Salamanca's drugs at Los Pollos Hermanos.  Rumors of the \"stepped on\" product reach Nacho and Domingo, who report them to Lalo. Lalo confirms the impurity of the cocaine in a visit to Salamanca street dealers.  In a meeting with Lalo and Juan Bolsa, Gus falsely claims that Werner Ziegler was working under Mike's supervision to construct a chilling system for Gus's chicken farm, and that Werner fled after stealing cocaine.  Gus goes on to claim that in an effort to hide the loss, he replaced the stolen cocaine with locally produced methamphetamine.  The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's departure from Albuquerque, pursuit by Mike, and subsequent death.  Lalo accepts Gus's cover story and apology, but remains suspicious.  Juan reminds Lalo that Gus enjoys the trust of Don Eladio, and indicates that Lalo should let the matter drop.  Because Lalo remains suspicious, Gus shuts down construction of the underground meth lab and has Mike send Werner's workers home.  Gus offers to continue paying Mike during the delay, but Mike declines out of frustration over Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner.\n\nGus coerces Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho gains Lalo's trust, and after Domingo is arrested, Nacho and Lalo use Jimmy/Saul to secure Domingo's release from jail in exchange for the location of several of Gus' dead drops. Nacho reports the plan to Gus, who plans to cancel the drops, but Nacho advises that this will reveal a mole within the Salamanca organization. Gus agrees and on the night of the transfer he tensely waits as Victor and Diego make sure that the DEA and local police seize nearly a million dollars but find no leads to Gus.\n\nMike spends several weeks feeling depressed over Werner's death and drinks to excess. After he is injured by a local gang, Gus has him taken to a pueblo Gus owns just inside the Mexican border, which includes a fountain dedicated to Max. Dr. Barry Goodman tends to Mike's wounds and Mike stays to heal. Gus visits and asks Mike to join his organization, saying that he wants Mike with him because Mike understands his need for revenge.\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to report to Mike about his activities to undermine the Salamanca organization. Mike works under an assumed name to secretly point the police towards Lalo for the murder of Fred the money wire store clerk. Lalo is surrounded by police and arrested. In jail under an assumed name, Lalo contacts Nacho from jail and says he wants Nacho to burn down Gus's flagship Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide status reports to Peter Schuler, Madrigal's CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the status of the meth lab and Gus assures Peter he will get the plan back on track. When Gus returns home, he and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as the mole in the Salamanca organization by destroying Gus's restaurant. Gus wants Lalo released, so he has Mike provide Jimmy the details of his investigation into Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling him to win a motion to release Lalo on bail. Saul is coerced by Lalo to obtain the money, which goes awry when Saul is ambushed by gunmen. At Gus's behest, Mike tracks Saul, executes the gunmen, and he and Saul retain the money and return to Albuquerque. When they return, Gus is informed by Mike of the ambush and describes a tattoo worn by one of them. Gus identifies the tattoo as belonging to a Colombian man and suggests that the men were hired assassins, confirming this suspicion following a phone call with Bolsa whom he tells Mike is protecting Gus's interests. Mike asks Gus to release Nacho from their operation, arguing that Nacho held up his end that Gus should no longer use the life of Nacho's father (whom Gus threatened earlier), as leverage. Gus refuses, asserting that fear would be a more effective motivator as opposed to leniency.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWhen [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] seeks a buyer for his high-quality meth, [[Saul Goodman]] arranges a meeting with the unknown purchaser. Walt and his partner, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]), arrive at a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in the South Valley, but the buyer seemingly never shows up, with Jesse and Walt unaware that Gus, the restaurant manager, had been silently watching them. Walt realizes this later, and arranges a second meeting with only himself and Gus. Gus tells him that he is not interested in conducting business since Jesse was late and [[substance intoxication|high]] for the first meeting, and is thus potentially unreliable. Walt persuades Gus to reconsider his decision, promising that he will never have to deal with Jesse and that their product will earn him enormous returns.\n\nGus eventually agrees to purchase 38 pounds of Walt's meth for $1.2 million but only if it can be delivered within a limited time at a remote location. With Jesse unconscious after taking [[heroin]] with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]], Walt is forced to miss the birth of his daughter Holly to make the delivery. Shortly afterward, Gus is given a tour of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s [[Albuquerque]] field office, along with other local [[boosterism|boosters]]. While there, he discovers that Walt has [[lung cancer]] and that his brother-in-law, [[Hank Schrader]], is a DEA agent.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nGus is pleased with the quality of Walt's blue meth, and offers him $3 million for three months of his time to cook more in a high-tech \"superlab\" hidden under an industrial laundry that Gus owns. Walt initially refuses, but Gus eventually convinces Walt that he should cook for his family's financial security. Gus provides him [[Gale Boetticher]], the talented chemist who set up the superlab, to help cook, but Walt needs to placate Jesse after Hank assaults him, so he convinces Gus to bring Jesse back as his assistant. Gus informs the cartel that once Walt is done with his three months, they will be free to kill him. [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] are impatient and travel from Mexico to the US to carry out the murder, but Gus intervenes and points them to Hank, who actually killed Tuco. Gus anonymously warns Hank about the pending attack, enabling Hank to kill Marco and critically injure Leonel, despite becoming nearly paralyzed from the waist down. Gus uses his influence with the police to distract them at the hospital so Mike can fatally inject Leonel.\n\nThe attempt on Hank's life leads to a large-scale crackdown on the cartel, and Juan Bolsa is killed. Realizing his own life was at stake, Walt agrees to continue cooking in the superlab for an extended period for $15 million with Jesse aiding him, but Gus is still concerned about Jesse's loyalties. Jesse learns that drug dealers who work for Gus were responsible for the death of Tom\u00e1s, the young brother of Jesse's girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]. Before Jesse can kill them himself, Walt runs them over with his car and tells Jesse to flee. Walt explains to Gus that this was just a \"hiccup\" in their agreement. Gus agrees to overlook the matter but reinstates Gale as Walt's assistant, and privately tells Gale to learn all of Walt's methods so that he can take over from Walt. Walt realizes that Gus is trying to groom Gale as his replacement, meaning his life is at risk, so he secretly meets with Jesse and asks him to find out where Gale lives. Once Jesse finds Gale's apartment, Walt sets out to kill him, but Victor stops him and brings him to the lab, where Mike is waiting. Walt asks Mike to let him call Jesse and convince him to come to the lab, but instead Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale. Victor rushes to Gale's apartment, but Jesse arrives first and fatally shoots Gale.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nGus arrives at the lab, where Walt and Jesse have been secured by Victor and Mike.  Knowing he was recognized at Gale's apartment, Victor fears for his life and attempts to show his continued usefulness to Gus by beginning to cook meth, which he learned how to do while guarding Walt and Jesse.  Walt begs for Gus to spare them, but they are shocked when Gus slices open Victor's neck and lets him bleed to death in front of them. Gus calmly tells Walt and Jesse to get back to work, and increases oversight in the lab by installing security cameras and having Mike and Tyrus watch them while they work. Mike suggests to Gus that they may be able to drive a wedge between Walt and Jesse. Mike takes Jesse out of the lab to help pick up dead drops and carry out other tasks, and arranges for Jesse to foil a pre-planned attack on him, which boosts Jesse's confidence and increases his sense of loyalty to Mike and Gus. Gus is impressed by Jesse's mettle, and has Mike involve him in more work outside the lab. Worried about their safety, Walt gives Jesse a cigarette with a capsule of [[ricin]] hidden inside and tells him to poison Gus when he gets the chance, but Jesse does not follow through.\n\nGus arranges to meet with Don Eladio and the other cartel leaders to work out the differences that have caused the cartel to disrupt Gus' business and he brings Mike and Jesse with him. Jesse cooks a superior batch of meth and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico and work for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse.  During the party at Eladio's house to celebrate their rapprochement, Gus tricks Eladio and most of the other cartel leaders into drinking from a poisoned bottle of tequila. Gus takes the first drink to alleviate suspicion, but forces himself to vomit afterwards. During the fight that ensues after cartel leaders begin dying from the poison's effects, Jesse helps the ill Gus and wounded Mike escape, killing Hector's last living grandson, Joaquin Salamanca, in the process.  He brings them to Dr. Goodman's makeshift hospital Gus had previously arranged at his villa, where both receive treatment.  After recovering, Gus returns to Albuquerque and taunts Hector, telling him the cartel leaders are all dead, and that because of Joaquin's death, the Salamanca family line ends with Hector.  Jesse is no longer loyal to Walt and refuses to serve as his protector.  With the DEA beginning to connect Gale's death to Gus, Gus fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's family if he retaliates or informs.\n\nConsidering his life at risk, Walt attempts to kill Gus with a [[pipe bomb]] attached to his car, but Gus senses something amiss and walks away from the vehicle. Panicked, Walt recovers the bomb and hides at his home.  After unsuccessfully attempting to enlist Jesse in aiding him to kill Gus, Walt poisons Andrea's son Brock and convinces Jesse Gus is responsible.  Jesse agrees to help Walt and tells him about Gus' routine, including his visits to Hector at the nursing home.  Walt convinces Hector to help him by promising him final revenge on Gus. Hector pretends to have turned informant to the DEA.  Gus visits Hector to find out why he was at the DEA office.  Hector refuses to acknowledge Gus as Gus prepares to kill him with a lethal injection.  Before Gus administers the shot, Hector suddenly turns to face him, stares at him intently and repeatedly rings the bell on his wheelchair. Too late, Gus sees that the bell is attached to the detonator of Walt's pipe bomb, which Walt had installed on the underside of Hector's wheelchair. The resulting explosion kills Hector and Tyrus immediately. Gus appears uninjured as he calmly walks out of the room and adjusts his tie, but the scene slowly reveals that the explosion removed the right side of his face and head, and Gus falls to the floor and dies.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nThough Gus doesn't appear his death has numerous consequences. The continuing investigation into Gus' death reaches his restaurant business and the destroyed superlab, which Walt and Jesse burned after Gus died. Knowing that the security camera recordings stored on Gus' laptop can incriminate them, Walt, Jesse, and Mike use an electromagnet outside the police station to erase the laptop's hard drive while it is in the police evidence room.  The police recover the account numbers and access codes for the offshore accounts Gus previously set up to pay his employees for their silence and seize the accounts.  Mike, Walt, and Jesse partner in a new meth business, with Mike continuing to pay Gus' former employees out of his share of the profits in order to assure their continued silence.  When police successfully interdict these payments, Walt fears his identity will be exposed and attempts to obtain the employees' names from Mike so he can have them killed.

Fring maintains a positive public image; he is a [[boosterism|booster]] for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), befriending the special agent in charge and making large donations to the [[Albuquerque]] office's civic and charitable events. However, he is ruthless and Machiavellian in managing his vast drug empire. He employs a number of enforcers and has personally killed rivals and associates.<ref name=\"AMC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/gustavo-fring |title=Gustavo Fring |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |access-date=October 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nGustavo has a mysterious background, but is supposedly a native of [[Chile]]; he is sometimes referred to by cartel members as \"The Chilean\".

In the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Magic Man (Better Call Saul)|Magic Man]]\", Lalo Salamanca refers to a mysterious incident involving Gus which took place in [[Santiago]].

Seeking to expand their drug trade, they met with Mexican cartel leader [[Don Eladio Vuente]]. Eladio rejected their offer, preferring to continue to distribute cocaine, and accused them of disrespect for producing meth in his territory without his permission. [[Hector Salamanca]], one of Eladio's right-hand men, shot Max in the head and forced Gus to watch as Max bled into Eladio's swimming pool. Eladio spared Gus because of his unknown but apparently powerful connection to Chile, but forced him to cooperate with the cartel under Eladio's terms. Gus then moved to Albuquerque and began operating Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants throughout the southwestern United States, which he used to facilitate distribution of the cartel's drugs. While he remains outwardly loyal to the cartel, he spends the next 20 years nursing a grudge against Eladio and Hector and waiting for his chance at revenge. As shown in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[Dedicado a Max]]\", at some point before or during the events of ''Better Call Saul'', Gus acquires a small villa just inside the Mexican border.  The villa serves as the residence for [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry_Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]], and Gus installs a fountain there which is dedicated to Max.\n\nGustavo Fring is established as an alias, as neither the DEA nor Gus' enforcer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] can find any records about him prior to his arrival in Mexico. In a flashback during the ''Breaking Bad'' episode \"[[One Minute (Breaking Bad)|One Minute]]\", Hector mockingly refers to him as \"Grand [[Generalissimo]]\", implying that Gus had a connection to the Pinochet regime.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guffey |first1=Ensley F. |last2=Koontz |first2= K.

Gus may have also had a similar homosexual relationship with Peter Schuler, the CEO of Madrigal Electromotive, in Santiago at some point, as briefly mentioned in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode \"[[JMM (Better Call Saul)|JMM]]\".

Instead of killing Tuco, Mike arranges for Tuco to assault him in view of the police, leading to Tuco's arrest. Mike fears Hector will learn that Mike arranged for Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned that Hector will retaliate against Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike acts preemptively by preparing to assassinate Hector, but is interrupted at the last moment. Mike tracks this interruption to Gus, who explains that he wants to be the one to determine when Hector will die. However, Gus encourages Mike to continue to disrupt the trucks Hector uses to bring ice cream store supplies and drugs from Mexico and send cash back to the cartel.  After Mike disrupts two shipments without revealing his identity, Hector demands that Gus temporarily use his Los Pollos Hermanos trucks to ship both Hector's and Gus' drugs. Gus, who had wanted this result from the start, appears to reluctantly agree.  He later attempts to pay Mike, but Mike refuses the money.  Instead, he asks for assistance laundering the $250,000 he stole from one of Hector's trucks, which Gus provides by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive to hire Mike as a contracted security expert and pay him monthly consulting fees.\n\nWith the new transport agreement in place, Nacho and Arturo Colon arrive at the Los Pollos Hermanos warehouse and farm to pick up a drug shipment, and Nacho attempts to strong-arm his way into taking six kilos instead of the agreed-upon five.  When Gus' subordinate [[Tyrus Kitt]] calls Gus for guidance, Gus recognizes an opportunity to infiltrate the Salamanca organization and tells Tyrus to give Nacho the extra kilo.  Nacho fears that Hector will learn of his role in Tuco's imprisonment and is concerned about Hector's intent to take over Nacho's father's upholstery store for use as a front business.  He secretly swaps Hector's angina medication for a [[placebo]], hoping to induce a fatal heart attack.  At a meeting between Juan Bolsa, Gus, Hector and Nacho, Bolsa informs them that the use of Gus' trucks to move the drugs and cash for both organizations will be a permanent arrangement.  Hector's angry outburst leads to a stroke, and Gus calls for an ambulance while administering first aid that saves Hector's life, though he is comatose.  Nacho follows Mike's previous advice to switch the placebos for Hector's real medication so that foul play will not be suspected.  Gus appears to notice Nacho's actions, but says nothing.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nHector is rushed to the hospital, while Gus is summoned along with Nacho and Arturo to a meeting with Bolsa at the Los Pollos distribution plant, where Bolsa declares that until further notice, the Salamanca operation will continue with Nacho and Arturo in charge until Hector recovers. Suspicious of Nacho's behavior following Hector's stroke, Gus has Victor surveil Nacho, and Victor observes Nacho disposing of the placebo pills he switched with Hector's real medication.\n\nNot wanting to lose his revenge opportunity, Gus arranges for a specialist, Dr. Maureen Bruckner, to be flown in from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Medical Center]] in Baltimore to oversee Hector's treatment. Upon reviewing Hector's medical records, Gus realizes there is no nitroglycerin in Hector's system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo make their next scheduled drug pickup, Arturo strong arms his way into taking an extra kilo, as Nacho did previously.  Arturo brags about his success as they leave, but Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo to death with a plastic bag, then uses his knowledge of Nacho's activities to blackmail Nacho into becoming a double agent.\n\nTyrus and [[Victor (Breaking Bad)|Victor]] stage a roadside shooting and car fire to make it appear as though Nacho and Arturo were attacked and the drugs they picked up stolen by a rival gang, the Espinosas, which also frames the Espionsas for the truck Mike hijacked while concealing his identity and covers up Nacho's new role as Gus' spy in the Salamanca organization. As part of the scheme, Victor shoots Nacho twice and leaves him on the side of the road near the car.  Nacho calls the Cousins for help and they burn the car, then take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera for emergency surgery that saves his life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho's car to the Espinosas.  Nacho then falsely identifies the Espinosas as his attackers.  The Cousins kill everyone in the Espinosa compound and retrieve the \"stolen\" drugs, then leave for Mexico to escape police scrutiny.  Nacho sees that by getting the Salamancas to wipe out the Espinosas, Gus has expanded his drug territory, but he does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan.\n\nA year later, Hector has recovered to the point where his mental faculties are sound, but his mobility is limited to the index finger of his right hand. Gus ends his specialized care, in effect trapping Hector's healed mind inside his unhealed body.  Hector's nephew Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in managing the family business. While he privately thanks Gus for coming to Hector's aid, he begins to surveil Gus' activities.\n\nGus plans for a secret \"superlab\" to be constructed under an industrial laundry Gus has purchased for the purpose, which will enable him to produce methamphetamine on the U.S. side of the border rather than relying on cartel cocaine from Mexico. Mike arranges for engineers to be interviewed for the job while Gus secretly looks on. The first candidate is rejected after he glibly assures Mike that the job will be easy and can be done without difficulty even under the constraints Gus requires.  The second candidate, [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], impresses Gus with his forthright analysis of the time, expense, and risk associated with the project, which he calls difficult but not impossible. Gus hires Werner to oversee construction of the lab.\n\nTo accomplish the project in secret, Gus buys a warehouse on the outskirts of the city in which he has long-term living quarters built for Werner and his German crew, who maintain secrecy by travelling from their quarters to the job site unseen, work only at night, and do no work above ground. When construction falls behind schedule, Werner effects an escape and plans to rendezvous with his wife.  Mike catches up to him and realizes that Werner inadvertently revealed some construction details to Lalo.  Gus informs Mike that Werner will have to be killed in order to protect the secret of the lab, and plans to send men to do it.  Mike says that since supervising Werner was his responsibility, he will carry out the execution, which he does by shooting Werner in the head.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to take cocaine of inferior quality when picking up the Salamanca's drugs at Los Pollos Hermanos.  Rumors of the \"stepped on\" product reach Nacho and Domingo, who report them to Lalo. Lalo confirms the impurity of the cocaine in a visit to Salamanca street dealers.  In a meeting with Lalo and Juan Bolsa, Gus falsely claims that Werner Ziegler was working under Mike's supervision to construct a chilling system for Gus's chicken farm, and that Werner fled after stealing cocaine.  Gus goes on to claim that in an effort to hide the loss, he replaced the stolen cocaine with locally produced methamphetamine.  The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's departure from Albuquerque, pursuit by Mike, and subsequent death.  Lalo accepts Gus's cover story and apology, but remains suspicious.  Juan reminds Lalo that Gus enjoys the trust of Don Eladio, and indicates that Lalo should let the matter drop.  Because Lalo remains suspicious, Gus shuts down construction of the underground meth lab and has Mike send Werner's workers home.  Gus offers to continue paying Mike during the delay, but Mike declines out of frustration over Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner.\n\nGus coerces Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho gains Lalo's trust, and after Domingo is arrested, Nacho and Lalo use Jimmy/Saul to secure Domingo's release from jail in exchange for the location of several of Gus' dead drops. Nacho reports the plan to Gus, who plans to cancel the drops, but Nacho advises that this will reveal a mole within the Salamanca organization. Gus agrees and on the night of the transfer he tensely waits as Victor and Diego make sure that the DEA and local police seize nearly a million dollars but find no leads to Gus.\n\nMike spends several weeks feeling depressed over Werner's death and drinks to excess. After he is injured by a local gang, Gus has him taken to a pueblo Gus owns just inside the Mexican border, which includes a fountain dedicated to Max. Dr. Barry Goodman tends to Mike's wounds and Mike stays to heal. Gus visits and asks Mike to join his organization, saying that he wants Mike with him because Mike understands his need for revenge.\n\nGus arranges for Nacho to report to Mike about his activities to undermine the Salamanca organization. Mike works under an assumed name to secretly point the police towards Lalo for the murder of Fred the money wire store clerk. Lalo is surrounded by police and arrested. In jail under an assumed name, Lalo contacts Nacho from jail and says he wants Nacho to burn down Gus's flagship Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide status reports to Peter Schuler, Madrigal's CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the status of the meth lab and Gus assures Peter he will get the plan back on track. When Gus returns home, he and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as the mole in the Salamanca organization by destroying Gus's restaurant. Gus wants Lalo released, so he has Mike provide Jimmy the details of his investigation into Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling him to win a motion to release Lalo on bail. Saul is coerced by Lalo to obtain the money, which goes awry when Saul is ambushed by gunmen. At Gus's behest, Mike tracks Saul, executes the gunmen, and he and Saul retain the money and return to Albuquerque. When they return, Gus is informed by Mike of the ambush and describes a tattoo worn by one of them. Gus identifies the tattoo as belonging to a Colombian man and suggests that the men were hired assassins, confirming this suspicion following a phone call with Bolsa whom he tells Mike is protecting Gus's interests. Mike asks Gus to release Nacho from their operation, arguing that Nacho held up his end that Gus should no longer use the life of Nacho's father (whom Gus threatened earlier), as leverage. Gus refuses, asserting that fear would be a more effective motivator and prevent NAcho fro\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nWhen [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] seeks a buyer for his high-quality meth, [[Saul Goodman]] arranges a meeting with the unknown purchaser. Walt and his partner, [[Jesse Pinkman]] ([[Aaron Paul]]), arrive at a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in the South Valley, but the buyer seemingly never shows up, with Jesse and Walt unaware that Gus, the restaurant manager, had been silently watching them. Walt realizes this later, and arranges a second meeting with only himself and Gus. Gus tells him that he is not interested in conducting business since Jesse was late and [[substance intoxication|high]] for the first meeting, and is thus potentially unreliable. Walt persuades Gus to reconsider his decision, promising that he will never have to deal with Jesse and that their product will earn him enormous returns.\n\nGus eventually agrees to purchase 38 pounds of Walt's meth for $1.2 million but only if it can be delivered within a limited time at a remote location. With Jesse unconscious after taking [[heroin]] with his girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]], Walt is forced to miss the birth of his daughter Holly to make the delivery. Shortly afterward, Gus is given a tour of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s [[Albuquerque]] field office, along with other local [[boosterism|boosters]]. While there, he discovers that Walt has [[lung cancer]] and that his brother-in-law, [[Hank Schrader]], is a DEA agent.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nGus is pleased with the quality of Walt's blue meth, and offers him $3 million for three months of his time to cook more in a high-tech \"superlab\" hidden under an industrial laundry that Gus owns. Walt initially refuses, but Gus eventually convinces Walt that he should cook for his family's financial security. Gus provides him [[Gale Boetticher]], the talented chemist who set up the superlab, to help cook, but Walt needs to placate Jesse after Hank assaults him, so he convinces Gus to bring Jesse back as his assistant. Gus informs the cartel that once Walt is done with his three months, they will be free to kill him. [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] are impatient and travel from Mexico to the US to carry out the murder, but Gus intervenes and points them to Hank, who actually killed Tuco. Gus anonymously warns Hank about the pending attack, enabling Hank to kill Marco and critically injure Leonel, despite becoming nearly paralyzed from the waist down. Gus uses his influence with the police to distract them at the hospital so Mike can fatally inject Leonel.\n\nThe attempt on Hank's life leads to a large-scale crackdown on the cartel, and Juan Bolsa is killed. Realizing his own life was at stake, Walt agrees to continue cooking in the superlab for an extended period for $15 million with Jesse aiding him, but Gus is still concerned about Jesse's loyalties. Jesse learns that drug dealers who work for Gus were responsible for the death of Tom\u00e1s, the young brother of Jesse's girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]]. Before Jesse can kill them himself, Walt runs them over with his car and tells Jesse to flee. Walt explains to Gus that this was just a \"hiccup\" in their agreement. Gus agrees to overlook the matter but reinstates Gale as Walt's assistant, and privately tells Gale to learn all of Walt's methods so that he can take over from Walt. Walt realizes that Gus is trying to groom Gale as his replacement, meaning his life is at risk, so he secretly meets with Jesse and asks him to find out where Gale lives. Once Jesse finds Gale's apartment, Walt sets out to kill him, but Victor stops him and brings him to the lab, where Mike is waiting. Walt asks Mike to let him call Jesse and convince him to come to the lab, but instead Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale. Victor rushes to Gale's apartment, but Jesse arrives first and fatally shoots Gale.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nGus arrives at the lab, where Walt and Jesse have been secured by Victor and Mike.  Knowing he was recognized at Gale's apartment, Victor fears for his life and attempts to show his continued usefulness to Gus by beginning to cook meth, which he learned how to do while guarding Walt and Jesse.  Walt begs for Gus to spare them, but they are shocked when Gus slices open Victor's neck and lets him bleed to death in front of them. Gus calmly tells Walt and Jesse to get back to work, and increases oversight in the lab by installing security cameras and having Mike and Tyrus watch them while they work. Mike suggests to Gus that they may be able to drive a wedge between Walt and Jesse. Mike takes Jesse out of the lab to help pick up dead drops and carry out other tasks, and arranges for Jesse to foil a pre-planned attack on him, which boosts Jesse's confidence and increases his sense of loyalty to Mike and Gus. Gus is impressed by Jesse's mettle, and has Mike involve him in more work outside the lab. Worried about their safety, Walt gives Jesse a cigarette with a capsule of [[ricin]] hidden inside and tells him to poison Gus when he gets the chance, but Jesse does not follow through.\n\nGus arranges to meet with Don Eladio and the other cartel leaders to work out the differences that have caused the cartel to disrupt Gus' business and he brings Mike and Jesse with him. Jesse cooks a superior batch of meth and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico and work for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse.  During the party at Eladio's house to celebrate their rapprochement, Gus tricks Eladio and most of the other cartel leaders into drinking from a poisoned bottle of tequila. Gus takes the first drink to alleviate suspicion, but forces himself to vomit afterwards. During the fight that ensues after cartel leaders begin dying from the poison's effects, Jesse helps the ill Gus and wounded Mike escape, killing Hector's last living grandson, Joaquin Salamanca, in the process.  He brings them to Dr. Goodman's makeshift hospital Gus had previously arranged at his villa, where both receive treatment.  After recovering, Gus returns to Albuquerque and taunts Hector, telling him the cartel leaders are all dead, and that because of Joaquin's death, the Salamanca family line ends with Hector.  Jesse is no longer loyal to Walt and refuses to serve as his protector.  With the DEA beginning to connect Gale's death to Gus, Gus fires Walt and threatens to kill Walt's family if he retaliates or informs.\n\nConsidering his life at risk, Walt attempts to kill Gus with a [[pipe bomb]] attached to his car, but Gus senses something amiss and walks away from the vehicle. Panicked, Walt recovers the bomb and hides at his home.  After unsuccessfully attempting to enlist Jesse in aiding him to kill Gus, Walt poisons Andrea's son Brock and convinces Jesse Gus is responsible.  Jesse agrees to help Walt and tells him about Gus' routine, including his visits to Hector at the nursing home.  Walt convinces Hector to help him by promising him final revenge on Gus. Hector pretends to have turned informant to the DEA.  Gus visits Hector to find out why he was at the DEA office.  Hector refuses to acknowledge Gus as Gus prepares to kill him with a lethal injection.  Before Gus administers the shot, Hector suddenly turns to face him, stares at him intently and repeatedly rings the bell on his wheelchair. Too late, Gus sees that the bell is attached to the detonator of Walt's pipe bomb, which Walt had installed on the underside of Hector's wheelchair. The resulting explosion kills Hector and Tyrus immediately. Gus appears uninjured as he calmly walks out of the room and adjusts his tie, but the scene slowly reveals that the explosion removed the right side of his face and head, and Gus falls to the floor and dies.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nThough Gus doesn't appear his death has numerous consequences. The continuing investigation into Gus' death reaches his restaurant business and the destroyed superlab, which Walt and Jesse burned after Gus died. Knowing that the security camera recordings stored on Gus' laptop can incriminate them, Walt, Jesse, and Mike use an electromagnet outside the police station to erase the laptop's hard drive while it is in the police evidence room.  The police recover the account numbers and access codes for the offshore accounts Gus previously set up to pay his employees for their silence and seize the accounts.  Mike, Walt, and Jesse partner in a new meth business, with Mike continuing to pay Gus' former employees out of his share of the profits in order to assure their continued silence.  When police successfully interdict these payments, Walt fears his identity will be exposed and attempts to obtain the employees' names from Mike so he can have them killed. When Mike refuses, Walt kills him. Walt then obtains the names from Lydia Rodart-Quayle and has Gus' former employees killed in prison before they can reveal his identity, effectively bringing an end to Gus' drug distribution empire.\n\n== Character development ==\n[[File:Giancarlo Esposito cropped retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Giancarlo Esposito]] portrays Gus Fring in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe character Gustavo Fring is named after the former [[Germany national football team|German International]] [[Torsten Frings]].<ref name=\"DieWelt\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article161675759/Breaking-Bad-Schurke-nach-deutschem-Trainer-benannt.html |title=Breaking-Bad-Schurke nach deutschem Trainer benannt |date=January 31, 2017 |work=[[Die Welt]] |access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> Initially, [[Giancarlo Esposito]] was offered a character that was described to him as \"very admirable, very polite\", and he decided to play that character as if he had \"some kind of a secret\".

The attraction opened in November 1995, and houses the world's largest private aircraft collection on display. It became the new home for much of owner [[Kermit Weeks]]' collection of aircraft that were previously housed at the Weeks Air Museum in [[Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport|Tamiami]], Florida and were damaged to varying degrees by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992. On April 6, 2014, the attraction was closed to the public, though it is still being maintained and is available for private events. On January 30, 2015, Fantasy of Flight opened a scaled-down museum attraction to display some of their aircraft to the public in the interim while the rest of the facility is upgraded and planned to reopen sometime in the future.<ref name=\"General Aviation News\">{{cite web|url=http://generalaviationnews.com/2014/03/10/general-aviation-in-the-marketplace/|title= General aviation in the marketplace |publisher=General Aviation News/ |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>\n\nFantasy of Flight was the only attraction in the world to offer daily aerial demonstrations (weather permitting) of aircraft in its collection. Most of Weeks' aircraft are airworthy and may still be seen flying from one of the facility's grass runways or its seaplane runway. Fantasy of Flight fields more airworthy aircraft than the air forces of Austria, Cuba, Denmark, Kuwait, Portugal, or South Africa.

Airport\" and uses the airport identifier \"FA08.\" The field sits at an estimated elevation of 129 feet (42 meters). It is designated as private use only and special permission is needed to land there. The field is generally closed to all non-company traffic. The airfield consists of two turf [[runway]]s: runway 4/22 (5090 x 125&nbsp;ft. / 1551 x 38 m) and runway 14/32 (2500 x 100&nbsp;ft. / 762 x 30 m).

The Boeing Stearman is used for 30 minute long 'hands-on experience' flights, in which the customer takes control of the aircraft at some point during the flight. The New Standard D-25 is used for 15 minute [[barnstorming]] flights, in which up to four customers sit in the forward open cockpit of the aircraft as a qualified pilot flies the aircraft.\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Fantasy of Flight collection contains the following aircraft, although the aircraft are not always present at the museum. Some are on loan to other facilities, others may be flown to events, and still others may be off display for maintenance or restoration. Most of the collection is contained in the north and south hangars which are now closed to the public, with a smaller portion now on display at the interim museum attraction housed in the old maintenance hangar. In 2012, the \"Golden Hill\" storage facility attraction opened just across the road from the main facility. A number of aircraft have been re-located into this new building, notably the [[B-23 Dragon]] and the [[B-29 Superfortress]] nose section, while the buildings were re-arranged in order to allow visitor access, but this section was part of the main facility closure in 2014.<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/fantasyofflight |title=Fantasy of Flight \u2013 Polk City, FL \u2013 Public Places & Attractions, Museum |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kermit Week's Albatros D.Va.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Kermit Weeks boards his Albatros D.Va in preparation for its first flight at Fantasy of Flight|Kermit Weeks boards his Albatros D.Va in preparation for its first flight at Fantasy of Flight]]\n[[File:Fantasy of Flight Aircraft.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Fantasy of Flight's Bell 47G displayed in foreground, Supermarine Spitfire Mk.16 behind, and Cierva C.30A autogyro in the upper right.

Visitors walk through several immersion environments as they enter the attraction. From the lobby, guests walk into the interior of a [[World War II]]-era [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] complete with lighting and sound effects as if the aircraft were conducting [[paratrooper]] operations.  Guests pass a seated paratrooper in full kit and move forward toward the [[Jumpmaster]] figure standing at the open side hatch. Over the hatch blinks a red \"Ready\" light which switches to a green \"Jump\" light as the guest approaches the hatch. Through the hatch is the entry to the attraction.\n\nOther immersion environments include a \"sensation of flight\" simulator, followed by a celebration of the early days of flight. Then, a passage covered by heavy shrapnel-resistant curtains leads visitors into a full-scale representation of the trench warfare of [[World War I]], complete with aircraft overhead. It was, in part, due to the development of aerial warfare that trench fighting became obsolete.\n\nThe final immersion display includes the collection's [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] housed in a large darkened room staged to appear as a winter evening at [[RAF Horham]], home of the [[95th Air Base Wing|95th Bombardment Group (Heavy)]] during World War II. The full-scale [[diorama]], complete with ground vehicles, outbuildings, and landscaping, represents a maintenance area and one of the B-17's engine cowlings and propellers are removed to maintenance stands in front of the aircraft.  Guests can enter the plane via the aft side hatch in the tail, walk through the bomb bay, visit the cockpit, and exit near the nose of the aircraft.\n\n==Golden Hill Storage Facility==\n[[File:General View of Golden Hill Building 1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=General view of Golden Hill Building 1 opened to the public in the summer of 2012|General view of Golden Hill Building 1 opened to the public in the summer of 2012]]\nFor years Fantasy of Flight has maintained a storage building opposite the main property on the north side of Broadway Boulevard where aircraft awaiting restoration were stored. In late 2011, work began on a second building to double the storage space with the intention of spreading out the stored items a bit and opening the buildings to the public on a limited basis. Finally, in June 2011 preparations were sufficient to open one building for a special preview over the Father's Day holiday. The response to the limited, self-guided experience was overwhelmingly positive, and the building joined the attraction's public programming in the summer of 2012, with the second building scheduled to open shortly thereafter.\n\nThe buildings are known by Fantasy of Flight as the \"Golden Hill\" facility as a tongue in cheek reference to the [[Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility]] of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] which is nicknamed \"Silver Hill\" by the NASM staff. Fantasy of Flight guest access to the Golden Hill facility is via over-the-road trolley operated from the main parking lot in the mornings. Guests are allowed to explore the facility on their own with docents present to answer questions. The facility closes at midday due to the lack of comfortable air handling equipment in the steel buildings which can get hot in the Florida sun.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\n== N1944A ==\n[[File:N1944A Oil Leak.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Crews work to solve an oil leak on N1944A prior to departure from England|Crews work to solve an oil leak on N1944A prior to departure from England]]\nIn the summer of 2011, Kermit Weeks and a crew from Fantasy of Flight flew to [[Cotswold Airport]] in the United Kingdom to evaluate a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] for possible purchase. The aircraft has a distinguished war record including sorties during the [[D-Day]] invasion and [[Operation Market Garden]].\n\nAt the end of July, Weeks went forward with the purchase.  His crew conducted minor repairs and the plane, registration number N1944A, was flown back to the United States by Weeks and his crew. Due to weather delays on some legs of the trip, the journey took a total of 11 days and covered approximately 4500 miles from Kemble, UK to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Fans of the aircraft, Kermit Weeks, or Fantasy of Flight were able to watch the trip documented daily on Fantasy of Flight's Facebook page as the crew sent back pictures and observations along the way.\n\nThe aircraft arrived without incident on August 4, 2011 at Oshkosh.  It was on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum for several months before being moved permanently to the campus of Fantasy of Flight in Polk City. On May 1, 2012, the C-47 was finally flown south to Fantasy of Flight, arriving on May 2 after an overnight stop in [[Douglas, Georgia]]. The aircraft is now on display at the attraction and open to guest walk-throughs.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\n== Douglas DC-3 attraction sign ==\n[[File:Douglas DC-3 FOF Below LFront FOF 14Dec09 (14403942537).jpg|thumb|DC-3 attraction sign]]\nStanding along the side of Interstate 4 near the exit for Fantasy of Flight is a [[Douglas DC-3]] painted with the attraction's name to get the attention of passers by. The aircraft itself is not part of the collection and was, in fact, specifically purchased for its intended purpose as an attraction sign. The airframe is far too corroded to make restoration of the DC-3 feasible. The aircraft was displayed for a period of time in a 'crashed' position, nose down in the ground with a mannequin hanging from the tail wheel, apparently a 'man' evacuating the aircraft with a parachute. The mannequin was dressed up for certain occasions around the year, including [[Santa Claus]] for [[Christmas]]; [[Uncle Sam]] for [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]; and a [[Pilgrim]] for [[Thanksgiving]].\n\nThe aircraft in this crashed position received a mixture of criticism and compliments. Some people claimed that the display made the aircraft look bad and set a bad example to airline passengers without an aviation background, while others found the position of the aircraft comical and many enjoyed guessing what the mannequin would be dressed as next. Currently, the aircraft is in an upright position with the mannequin seated in the opened cockpit hatch on the left hand side.\n\n== The Compass Rose Diner ==\n\n[[File:Compass Rose Diner.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Patrons at the Compass Rose|Patrons at the Compass Rose]]\n\nAdjacent to the attraction's lobby is an [[Art Deco]] themed restaurant called \"The Compass Rose Diner\" which features the characteristics of diners associated with airports during the 1930s and early 1940s. The restaurant features tall windows, multi-hued terrazzo floors, and the curved architectural lines associated with the Art Deco period. The diner was open to the public and served a short-order menu similar to that of [[lunch counter]]s popularized during the pre-World War II era. When the main facility was closed to the public in 2014, the diner was closed and much of its equipment sold off, though the space itself is still available as part of the venue's rental offerings.\n\n==Partial closing==\nOn March 4, 2014, Fantasy of Flight announced that they would close to the public after April 6, 2014 but continue to stage private events. They further announced that they would reopen to the public in late 2014 as a scaled-down museum, with reduced admission prices, while they simultaneously begin to design and build the main facility into more of a destination attraction that would appeal to a wider audience rather than just aviation aficionados.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackovics |first1=Ted |title=Fantasy of Flight closing as daily attraction |url=http://tbo.com/news/business/fantasy-of-flight-closing-as-daily-attraction-20140304/ |accessdate=2020-01-31 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=4 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://archive.ph/20140305045000/http://tbo.com/news/business/fantasy-of-flight-closing-as-daily-attraction-20140304/#selection-3895.0-3895.29 |archivedate=2014-03-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Ironically, the announcement that the facility would soon be closing its doors to the public has caused a significant upswell in visitors.

The attraction opened in November 1995, and houses the world's largest private aircraft collection on display. It became the new home for much of owner [[Kermit Weeks]]' collection of aircraft that were previously housed at the Weeks Air Museum in [[Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport|Tamiami]], Florida and were damaged to varying degrees by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992. On April 6, 2014, the attraction was closed to the public, though it is still being maintained and is available for private events. On January 30, 2015, Fantasy of Flight opened a scaled-down museum attraction to display some of their aircraft to the public in the interim while the rest of the facility is upgraded and planned to reopen sometime in the future.<ref name=\"General Aviation News\">{{cite web|url=http://generalaviationnews.com/2014/03/10/general-aviation-in-the-marketplace/|title= General aviation in the marketplace |publisher=General Aviation News/ |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>\n\nFantasy of Flight was the only attraction in the world to offer daily aerial demonstrations (weather permitting) of aircraft in its collection. Most of Weeks' aircraft are airworthy and may still be seen flying from one of the facility's grass runways or its seaplane runway. Fantasy of Flight fields more airworthy aircraft than the air forces of Austria, Cuba, Denmark, Kuwait, Portugal or South Africa. It also fields more airworthy [[fixed-wing aircraft]] than either the [[Royal Navy]] or the [[Indian Navy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uknda.org/my_documents/my_files/RAF_TheWorldsAirForces1.1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-04-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117034441/http://www.uknda.org/my_documents/my_files/RAF_TheWorldsAirForces1.1.pdf |archive-date=2009-11-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Facility ==\n[[File:Map of Fantasy of Flight.png|thumb|General Layout of Fantasy of Flight]]\nThe facility features a main building consisting of two large hangars (called \"North\" and \"South\") for the aircraft on display, restoration shops, the immersion environments, a gift shop and the [[Art Deco]] themed Compass Rose Diner.

Airport\" and uses the airport identifier \"FA08.\" The field sits at an estimated elevation of 129 feet (42 meters). It is designated as private use only and special permission is needed to land there. The field is generally closed to all non-company traffic. The airfield consists of two turf [[runway]]s: runway 4/22 (5090 x 125&nbsp;ft. / 1551 x 38 m) and runway 14/32 (2500 x 100&nbsp;ft. / 762 x 30 m). The airfield appears as \"Orlampa\" on the [[Jacksonville]] [[sectional chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/FA08 |title=FA08 \u2013 Orlampa Inc Airport |publisher=AirNav |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref> The name \"Orlampa\" was originated by [[Kermit Weeks]] based on the airfield being approximately midway between the cities of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].\n\nWaldo Wright's Flying Service offers airplane rides for sale from the Fantasy of Flight field during parts of the year and operates a [[PT-17|Boeing PT-17 Stearman]] and a [[New Standard D-25]]. The Boeing Stearman is used for 30 minute long 'hands-on experience' flights, in which the customer takes control of the aircraft at some point during the flight. The New Standard D-25 is used for 15 minute [[barnstorming]] flights, in which up to four customers sit in the forward open cockpit of the aircraft as a qualified pilot flies the aircraft.\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Fantasy of Flight collection contains the following aircraft, although the aircraft are not always present at the museum. Some are on loan to other facilities, others may be flown to events, still others may be off display for maintenance or restoration. Most of the collection is contained in the north and south hangars which are now closed to the public, with a smaller portion now on display at the interim museum attraction housed in the old maintenance hangar. In 2012, the \"Golden Hill\" storage facility attraction opened just across the road from the main facility. A number of aircraft have been re-located into this new building, notably the [[B-23 Dragon]] and the [[B-29 Superfortress]] nose section, while the buildings were re-arranged in order to allow visitor access, but this section was part of the main facility closure in 2014.<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/fantasyofflight |title=Fantasy of Flight \u2013 Polk City, FL \u2013 Public Places & Attractions, Museum |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kermit Week's Albatros D.Va.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Kermit Weeks boards his Albatros D.Va in preparation for its first flight at Fantasy of Flight|Kermit Weeks boards his Albatros D.Va in preparation for its first flight at Fantasy of Flight]]\n[[File:Fantasy of Flight Aircraft.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Fantasy of Flight's Bell 47G displayed in foreground, Supermarine Spitfire Mk.16 behind, and Cierva C.30A autogyro in the upper right.

Visitors walk through several immersion environments as they enter the attraction. From the lobby, guests walk into the interior of a [[World War II]]-era [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] complete with lighting and sound effects as if the aircraft were conducting [[paratrooper]] operations.  Guests pass a seated paratrooper in full kit and move forward toward the [[Jumpmaster]] figure standing at the open side hatch. Over the hatch blinks a red \"Ready\" light which switches to a green \"Jump\" light as the guest approaches the hatch. Through the hatch is the entry to the attraction.\n\nOther immersion environments include a \"sensation of flight\" simulator, followed by a celebration of the early days of flight. Then, a passage covered by heavy shrapnel-resistant curtains leads visitors into a full-scale representation of the trench warfare of [[World War I]], complete with aircraft overhead. It was, in part, due to the development of aerial warfare that trench fighting became obsolete.\n\nThe final immersion display includes the collection's [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] housed in a large darkened room staged to appear as a winter evening at [[RAF Horham]], home of the [[95th Air Base Wing|95th Bombardment Group (Heavy)]] during World War II. The full-scale [[diorama]], complete with ground vehicles, outbuildings and landscaping, represents a maintenance area and one of the B-17's engine cowlings and propellers are removed to maintenance stands in front of the aircraft.  Guests can enter the plane via the aft side hatch in the tail, walk through the bomb bay, visit the cockpit, and exit near the nose of the aircraft.\n\n==Golden Hill Storage Facility==\n[[File:General View of Golden Hill Building 1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=General view of Golden Hill Building 1 opened to the public in the summer of 2012|General view of Golden Hill Building 1 opened to the public in the summer of 2012]]\nFor years Fantasy of Flight has maintained a storage building opposite the main property on the north side of Broadway Boulevard where aircraft awaiting restoration were stored. In late 2011, work began on a second building to double the storage space with the intention of spreading out the stored items a bit and opening the buildings to the public on a limited basis. Finally, in June 2011 preparations were sufficient to open one building for a special preview over the Father's Day holiday. The response to the limited, self-guided experience was overwhelmingly positive, and the building joined the attraction's public programming in the summer of 2012, with the second building scheduled to open shortly thereafter.\n\nThe buildings are known by Fantasy of Flight as the \"Golden Hill\" facility as a tongue in cheek reference to the [[Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility]] of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] which is nicknamed \"Silver Hill\" by the NASM staff. Fantasy of Flight guest access to the Golden Hill facility is via over-the-road trolley operated from the main parking lot in the mornings. Guests are allowed to explore the facility on their own with docents present to answer questions. The facility closes at midday due to the lack of comfortable air handling equipment in the steel buildings which can get hot in the Florida sun.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\n== N1944A ==\n[[File:N1944A Oil Leak.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Crews work to solve an oil leak on N1944A prior to departure from England|Crews work to solve an oil leak on N1944A prior to departure from England]]\nIn the summer of 2011, Kermit Weeks and a crew from Fantasy of Flight flew to [[Cotswold Airport]] in the United Kingdom to evaluate a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] for possible purchase. The aircraft has a distinguished war record including sorties during the [[D-Day]] invasion and [[Operation Market Garden]].\n\nAt the end of July, Weeks went forward with the purchase.  His crew conducted minor repairs and the plane, registration number N1944A, was flown back to the United States by Weeks and his crew. Due to weather delays on some legs of the trip, the journey took a total of 11 days and covered approximately 4500 miles from Kemble, UK to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Fans of the aircraft, Kermit Weeks or Fantasy of Flight were able to watch the trip documented daily on Fantasy of Flight's Facebook page as the crew sent back pictures and observations along the way.\n\nThe aircraft arrived without incident on August 4, 2011 at Oshkosh.  It was on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum for several months before being moved permanently to the campus of Fantasy of Flight in Polk City. On May 1, 2012, the C-47 was finally flown south to Fantasy of Flight, arriving on May 2 after an overnight stop in [[Douglas, Georgia]]. The aircraft is now on display at the attraction and open to guest walk-throughs.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\n== Douglas DC-3 attraction sign ==\n[[File:Douglas DC-3 FOF Below LFront FOF 14Dec09 (14403942537).jpg|thumb|DC-3 attraction sign]]\nStanding along the side of Interstate 4 near the exit for Fantasy of Flight is a [[Douglas DC-3]] painted with the attraction's name to get the attention of passers by. The aircraft itself is not part of the collection and was, in fact, specifically purchased for its intended purpose as an attraction sign. The airframe is far too corroded to make restoration of the DC-3 feasible. The aircraft was displayed for a period of time in a 'crashed' position, nose down in the ground with a mannequin hanging from the tail wheel, apparently a 'man' evacuating the aircraft with a parachute. The mannequin was dressed up for certain occasions around the year, including [[Santa Claus]] for [[Christmas]], [[Uncle Sam]] for [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] and a [[Pilgrim]] for [[Thanksgiving]].\n\nThe aircraft in this crashed position received a mixture of criticism and compliments. Some people claimed that the display made the aircraft look bad and set a bad example to airline passengers without an aviation background, while others found the position of the aircraft comical and many enjoyed guessing what the mannequin would be dressed as next. Currently, the aircraft is in an upright position with the mannequin seated in the opened cockpit hatch on the left hand side.\n\n== The Compass Rose Diner ==\n\n[[File:Compass Rose Diner.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Patrons at the Compass Rose|Patrons at the Compass Rose]]\n\nAdjacent to the attraction's lobby is an [[Art Deco]] themed restaurant called \"The Compass Rose Diner\" which features the characteristics of diners associated with airports during the 1930s and early 1940s. The restaurant features tall windows, multi-hued terrazzo floors and the curved architectural lines associated with the Art Deco period. The diner was open to the public and served a short-order menu similar to that of [[lunch counter]]s popularized during the pre-World War II era. When the main facility was closed to the public in 2014, the diner was closed and much of its equipment sold off, though the space itself is still available as part of the venue's rental offerings.\n\n==Partial closing==\nOn March 4, 2014, Fantasy of Flight announced that they would close to the public after April 6, 2014 but continue to stage private events. They further announced that they would reopen to the public in late 2014 as a scaled-down museum, with reduced admission prices, while they simultaneously begin to design and build the main facility into more of a destination attraction that would appeal to a wider audience rather than just aviation aficionados.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackovics |first1=Ted |title=Fantasy of Flight closing as daily attraction |url=http://tbo.com/news/business/fantasy-of-flight-closing-as-daily-attraction-20140304/ |accessdate=2020-01-31 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=4 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://archive.ph/20140305045000/http://tbo.com/news/business/fantasy-of-flight-closing-as-daily-attraction-20140304/#selection-3895.0-3895.29 |archivedate=2014-03-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Ironically, the announcement that the facility would soon be closing its doors to the public has caused a significant upswell in visitors.
