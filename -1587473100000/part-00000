The Xbox version of ''Hulk'' is playable on [[Xbox 360]].\n\n==Plot==\nEight years after the film, the game begins in a [[dream sequence]] where a man named Bruce Banner transforms into a large and powerful monster dubbed the [[Hulk]] and destroys waves of soldiers and tanks sent by the military to attack him. Upon awakening, Bruce Banner is contacted by his old mentor [[Ravage (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Crawford]] who explains that he has developed a cure for the Hulk called the Gamma Orb. Unfortunately, military troops led by the corrupt [[John Ryker|General John Ryker]] have raided the lab. Bruce Banner sneaks into the lab and discovers that General Ryker wants to obtain the Gamma Orb. After reaching Dr. Crawford, Bruce allows his old mentor to use the Gamma Orb on him, but Crawford betrays Banner and uses it to steal the Hulk's energy. Crawford touches the Orb and absorbs a part of Bruce Banner's power transforming himself into a Hulk-like creature called [[Ravage (Marvel Comics)|Ravage]]. Simultaneously, Banner transforms into the Hulk. After a chase of Ravage over rooftops and through sewers with Ryker's forces in hot pursuit, Hulk finds himself at a dead end where he is ambushed by the vampire [[Halflife (comics)|Half-Life]]. Hulk defeats Half-Life who explains that Ravage has taken the orb to [[Alcatraz]] but will kill a hostage there if the Hulk is detected.\n\nBruce infiltrates Alcatraz which has been secretly occupied by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] and his private army. Bruce deactivates the Gamma detection device using a security terminal which shows live footage of a Gamma chamber used to mutate the Leader's henchmen into Gamma-irradiated super soldiers. It also shows the Leader's psychotic brother [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]] taking the hostage [[Betty Ross]] to the irradiation chamber after being ordered by a mysterious voice to \"dispose\" of her when she refuses to further aid them in their schemes. Seeing Betty in distress causes Bruce to transform into the Hulk decimating the research facilities and defeating Madman after disabling the irradiation chamber. Betty tells the Hulk that she has been exposed to the Gamma radiation and must be taken to the military Gamma base. The Hulk takes Betty to the base, but is incapacitated by a force field. Bruce is sedated and strapped to an operating table where General Ryker plans on dissecting him. Betty frees Bruce, who (disguised as a soldier) formulates an antidote, transforming into the Hulk and fighting the military while trying to find and destroy the shield generator. Hulk finds the generator, but is confronted by [[Flux (comics)|Flux]], a Hulk-like soldier. The Hulk defeats Flux and throws him into the generator, destroying it.\n\nHulk escapes and returns to Alcatraz. After fighting through the Leader's forces as Hulk and Bruce Banner, Hulk finally confronts Ravage, who was guarding Leader's teleport device. Ravage is defeated and returns to the form of Dr. Crawford. Crawford informs Bruce that the Gamma Orb is at Leader's control center (called New Freehold) and Bruce teleports to it. After being ambushed by Half-Life and Madman, Bruce once again transforms into the Hulk and confronts them. Madman escapes at the middle of the fight, leaving Half-Life to battle Hulk alone. After beating Half-Life, the Hulk finally confronts the Leader. The Leader uses the orb to cure the Hulk. Bruce was finally free of his mutation, but in order to save humanity from the Leader's Gamma army, he touches the Orb to become the Hulk once more. He unleashes the Hulk, who beats the Leader despite his powerful psychic attacks and destroys the Gamma Orb. As New Freehold begins to collapse, the Leader escapes by teleporting himself. The Hulk manages to reach the teleport chamber, but he encounters one final fight with Madman. After defeating Madman, the Hulk teleports himself and escapes. The ending shows Dr. Crawford trying (and failing) to create another Gamma Orb, General Ryker experimenting on Flux, and Bruce Banner walking alongside a highway attempting to hitch a ride home. Banner's shadow was that of the Hulk.\n\n==Reception==\n\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 74/100<ref name=MCPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/hulk/critic-reviews|title=Hulk Critic

The game received praise for its music, graphics, gameplay, most of the game controls and camera functions, the more balanced tone compared to that of the film it is based on, and voice work, including that of the Grey Hulk. Meanwhile, the limited powers of the Hulk and the linear gameplay received criticisms. The Bruce Banner levels received mixed responses, with some criticizing it for its difficulty and placement in a game based on the Hulk, while others praising it for its stealth-based gameplay and variation it provides within the game itself.\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that the game was too linear but appreciated its \"mindless mayhem\".<ref name=EW>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2003/06/13/hulk|title=The Hulk Review|last=Keighley|first=Geoff|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=714|date=June 13, 2003|pages=104\u2013105|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Playboy]]'' also thought the game was linear and short, but fun.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/games/hulk/index.html|title=Hulk|magazine=[[Playboy]]|year=2003|accessdate=February 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030712072814/http://playboy.com/arts-entertainment/games/hulk/index.html|archivedate=July 12, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' liked the game's controls and camera functions.<ref name=Cincinnati>{{cite news|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/061003_hulk.html|title=Incredible: new 'Hulk' game is big, green|last=Saltzman|first=Marc|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=June 10, 2003|accessdate=February 11, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511193139/http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/061003_hulk.html|archivedate=May 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' lambasted the Bruce Banner levels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/et-tu-brute-6410306|title=Et Tu, Brute?|last=Catucci|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|date=June 10, 2003|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref>  In Japan, where the PlayStation 2 version was ported by [[CyberFront]] for release on January 8, 2004,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of one seven, two sixes, and one seven for a total of 26 out of 40.<ref name=Fam/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{moby game|id=/hulk_|name=''Hulk''}}\n* {{moby game|id=/gameboy-advance/incredible-hulk|name=''Hulk'' (Game Boy Advance)}}\n\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Universal Interactive}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hulk (Video Game)}}\n[[Category:2003 video games]]\n[[Category:Video games based on Hulk (comics)]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Advance games]]\n[[Category:GameCube games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 2 games]]\n[[Category:Radical Entertainment games]]\n[[Category:Hulk (film)]]\n[[Category:Universal Interactive games]]\n[[Category:Superhero video games]]\n[[Category:Video games based on films]]\n[[Category:Video games based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Video games based on Marvel Comics films]]\n[[Category:Video games based on works by Michael France]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox games]]\n[[Category:Video games set in 2012]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Hulk\n|image = Hulk Coverart.png\n|caption = North American cover art for Microsoft Windows\n|developer = [[Radical Entertainment]]\n|publisher = [[Universal Interactive]]\n|designer = Eric Holmes\n|writer = Jeff Houde\n|composer = Graig Robertson\n|released = {{Video game release|NA|May 27, 2003|PAL|June 13, 2003|JP|January 8, 2004 <small>(PS2)</small>}}\n|genre = [[Action game|Action]]\n|modes = [[Single-player]]\n|platforms = [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]\n}}\n'''''Hulk''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] based on the [[Hulk (film)|film of the same name]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Hulk|superhero]].

The Xbox version of ''Hulk'' is playable on [[Xbox 360]].\n\n==Plot==\nEight years after the film, the game begins in a [[dream sequence]] where a man named Bruce Banner transforms into a large and powerful monster dubbed the [[Hulk]] and destroys waves of soldiers and tanks sent by the military to attack him. Upon awakening, Bruce Banner is contacted by his old mentor [[Ravage (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Crawford]] who explains that he has developed a cure for the Hulk called the Gamma Orb. Unfortunately, military troops led by the corrupt [[John Ryker|General John Ryker]] have raided the lab. Bruce Banner sneaks into the lab and discovers that General Ryker wants to obtain the Gamma Orb. After reaching Dr. Crawford, Bruce allows his old mentor to use the Gamma Orb on him, but Crawford betrays Banner and uses it to steal the Hulk's energy. Crawford touches the Orb and absorbs a part of Bruce Banner's power transforming himself into a Hulk-like creature called [[Ravage (Marvel Comics)|Ravage]]. Simultaneously, Banner transforms into the Hulk. After a chase of Ravage over rooftops and through sewers with Ryker's forces in hot pursuit, Hulk finds himself at a dead end where he is ambushed by the vampire [[Halflife (comics)|Half-Life]]. Hulk defeats Half-Life who explains that Ravage has taken the orb to [[Alcatraz]] but will kill a hostage there if the Hulk is detected.\n\nBruce infiltrates Alcatraz which has been secretly occupied by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] and his private army. Bruce deactivates the Gamma detection device using a security terminal which shows live footage of a Gamma chamber used to mutate the Leader's henchmen into Gamma-irradiated super soldiers. It also shows the Leader's psychotic brother [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]] taking the hostage [[Betty Ross]] to the irradiation chamber after being ordered by a mysterious voice to \"dispose\" of her when she refuses to further aid them in their schemes. Seeing Betty in distress causes Bruce to transform into the Hulk decimating the research facilities and defeating Madman after disabling the irradiation chamber. Betty tells the Hulk that she has been exposed to the Gamma radiation and must be taken to the military Gamma base. The Hulk takes Betty to the base, but is incapacitated by a force field. Bruce is sedated and strapped to an operating table where General Ryker plans on dissecting him. Betty frees Bruce, who (disguised as a soldier) formulates an antidote, transforming into the Hulk and fighting the military while trying to find and destroy the shield generator. Hulk finds the generator, but is confronted by [[Flux (comics)|Flux]], a Hulk-like soldier. The Hulk defeats Flux and throws him into the generator, destroying it.\n\nHulk escapes and returns to Alcatraz. After fighting through the Leader's forces as Hulk and Bruce Banner, Hulk finally confronts Ravage, who was guarding Leader's teleport device. Ravage is defeated and returns to the form of Dr. Crawford. Crawford informs Bruce that the Gamma Orb is at Leader's control center (called New Freehold) and Bruce teleports to it. After being ambushed by Half-Life and Madman, Bruce once again transforms into the Hulk and confronts them. Madman escapes at the middle of the fight, leaving Half-Life to battle Hulk alone. After beating Half-Life, the Hulk finally confronts the Leader. The Leader uses the orb to cure the Hulk. Bruce was finally free of his mutation, but in order to save humanity from the Leader's Gamma army, he touches the Orb to become the Hulk once more. He unleashes the Hulk, who beats the Leader despite his powerful psychic attacks and destroys the Gamma Orb. As New Freehold begins to collapse, the Leader escapes by teleporting himself. The Hulk manages to reach the teleport chamber, but he encounters one final fight with Madman. After defeating Madman, the Hulk teleports himself and escapes. The ending shows Dr. Crawford trying (and failing) to create another Gamma Orb, General Ryker experimenting on Flux, and Bruce Banner walking alongside a highway attempting to hitch a ride home. Banner's shadow was that of the Hulk.\n\n==Reception==\n\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 74/100<ref name=MCPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/hulk/critic-reviews|title=Hulk Critic

After seeing her for the first time, Michael and his bodyguards inquire about her to Signore Vitelli, a local [[tavern]] keeper to try and find out who she is. After describing her in detail, Vitelli angrily says he does not know her and leaves. When Michael's bodyguards realize that the girl is Signore Vitelli's daughter, they both ask Michael to leave, but Michael, speaking through his bodyguard and interpreter Fabrizio, soon gains Signore Vitelli's respect by introducing himself and apologizing. Michael asks and receives Signore Vitelli's permission to court Apollonia under the [[Chaperone (social)|chaperonage]] of her family. After a brief [[courtship]], they are married.\n\nSoon afterward, however, Apollonia is killed by a [[car bomb]] intended for Michael. The attack was set up by Fabrizio, who had betrayed Michael to Corleone family enemies back in Michael's native New York City. In an unfortunate twist of fate, she unknowingly puts herself in danger when she tries to impress Michael by showing him that she taught herself how to drive, which was uncommon for Sicilian women. In the book, she is pregnant at the time of her death, but this detail is not specified in the film. The explosion is powerful enough to throw Michael off his feet and knock him unconscious. The local Mafia chieftain, Don Tommasino, an old friend of Michael's father Vito, moves Michael to a hospital. Michael regains consciousness a few days later, whereupon Don Tommasino informs Michael of his wife's death. After returning to the United States, Michael reconnects with his previous girlfriend, Kay Adams, but does not tell her that he had been married while he was living in Sicily.

Fabrizio is found running a pizza parlor in Buffalo, New York under the alias of Fred Vincent. He is shot in the chest by an assassin who walks into the pizza parlor.

When Sollozzo learns Corleone survived, he sends agents to the hospital for another attempt after he has Captain McCluskey ([[Sterling Hayden]]), a New York City police captain on Sollozzo's payroll, arrest Don Corleone's personal guards at the hospital and removes the police officers stationed outside the Don's hospital room. The assassination attempt fails after Vito's youngest son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] arrives, and finding all the guards gone, suspects another assassination attempt is about to happen. He moves his father to another room, then tricks the would-be assassins into believing guards are still protecting his father. Captain McCluskey arrives and confronts Michael, punching him and breaking his jaw. Hagen arrives shortly afterwards with guards legally licensed to carry weapons; McCluskey, unable to arrest them without raising suspicions, backs down and leaves.\n\nSoon after, Sollozzo seeks a meeting with Michael to resolve the hostilities, although at Michael's urging, the Corleones view this as an opportunity to kill Sollozzo, which would, of necessity, also involve killing McCluskey.  Michael successfully convinces [[Sonny Corleone]], [[Tom Hagen]] and other leaders of the Family that the usual strict [[Mafia]] prohibition against killing police for fear of bringing down the retribution of the authorities should not apply in this case, since McCluskey is \"a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop, a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him\" and says that this would be \"a terrific story\" to be given to newspaper people on the Corleone Family payroll after the fact.\n\nUnder McCluskey's personal protection, Sollozzo meets with Michael in a Bronx restaurant. Although Michael is frisked before the meeting, a revolver had been planted behind the overhead tank of a toilet in the restaurant's lavatory. (The Corleones were able to do this only because they found out in advance where the meeting would take place - because McCluskey was required by police regulations to leave an address where he could be reached that night and a cop in his precinct who was being paid off by the Corleones told Sonny where McCluskey would be that evening). Michael excuses himself to go to the bathroom, and retrieves the revolver. When he returns, he draws the gun and shoots Sollozzo in the forehead, killing him instantly, and kills McCluskey with two shots moments later.\n\nAlthough the double murder, including that of a police captain, brings an official crackdown on organized crime, the subsequent leak of information about McCluskey's criminal links to Sollozzo - as Michael correctly predicted - gets wide coverage in the newspapers and takes some of the heat off.\n\n===Johnny Ola===\nJohnny Ola is a fictional character in ''The Godfather Part II''. He is portrayed by [[Dominic Chianese]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20078/The-Godfather-Part-II/cast|title=The Godfather, Part II (1974)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref>\n\nJohnny Ola is a mobster and right-hand man to Jewish mobster [[Hyman Roth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/blog/2011/07/postscript_to_g.html|title=Postscript to G.D.

Ola is Sicilian but speaks American English with a New York accent. Ola is part of Roth's plan to assassinate [[Michael Corleone]] at his home at [[Lake Tahoe]], with unwitting help from Michael's brother [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]]. When Michael asks if Fredo and Johnny had ever met, they deny knowing each other. Later, however, Fredo carelessly reveals that he and Ola had visited a nightclub together in [[Havana]]. Michael overhears the conversation and realizes that Fredo is the traitor within the family. Michael sends his bodyguard Bussetta to kill Ola and Roth. Bussetta strangles Ola, but Roth gets away.\n\n===Carlo Rizzi===\n{{main|Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)}}\n\n=== Louie Russo ===\nLuigi \"Louie\" Russo is a fictional character in [[Mark Winegardner|Mark Winegardner's]] ''[[The Godfather Returns]]''. Russo serves as the Don of the [[Chicago Outfit]] from 1955 to 1961.\n\nLouie Russo and his brother, Willy, were 'made' under [[Al Capone]]. His brother was one of the men sent to kill [[Vito Corleone]] during the [[Castellammarese War]] (mentioned in ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''), although he was eventually killed by [[Luca Brasi]].\n\nRusso holds a grudge against the Corleones for years for his brother's death, at one point attempting (unsuccessfully) to have Vito's son [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] killed. After [[Michael Corleone]] becomes Don in 1955, however, Russo tricks him into believing that the bad blood between them is over. Under Russo, the Chicago mob expands into the New York area and interferes with the Corleones' [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] casinos. Russo unsuccessfully conspires with Vincent Forlenza and Nick Geraci to kill Michael Corleone, in the process indirectly duping Fredo into betraying his brother to [[Hyman Roth]].\n\nIn June 1961, he invites [[Tom Hagen]] to his supper club/gambling house in rural [[Illinois]] with the intention of killing him. He, Hagen, a rower, and two Russo ''[[Soldato|soldatos]]'' go out on a gondola in his man-made lake. On the course of the trip, as part of Michael's revenge, Hagen strangles one ''soldato'' while the rower hits Russo and the other ''soldato'' with his oar. Hagen then personally kills Russo on his boat, with Russo's own gun, and dumps the bodies in the lake.\n\nIn his appearances in ''The Godfather Returns'', Russo is portrayed as a cruel, vindictive man whose methods of retribution are particularly vicious, even by [[American Mafia|Mafia]] standards; in the sequel ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]'', Tom Hagen describes Russo as \"a sick man, in ways I don't like to think about.\" Following an assassination attempt years before, in which his eyes are permanently damaged, he wears large black sunglasses to shield them from the light. When he inadvertently shows his uncovered eyes to Tom Hagen after his glasses are knocked off, Hagen notes that they are red with a green ring in the middle. The novel reveals that Russo is estranged from his [[gay]] son, but still uses him as a source of information on [[The closet|closeted]] rivals for purposes of [[blackmail]] and gamesmanship with the other families.\n\n===Hyman Roth===\n{{main|Hyman Roth}}\n\n===Virgil Sollozzo===\nVirgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's novel ''The Godfather''. He is portrayed by [[Al Lettieri]] in the film adaptation of the same name.\n\nIn 1945, [[heroin]] kingpin Virgil Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his operation. Sollozzo is backed by the rival Tattaglia family, and wants Vito's political influence and legal protection. Vito declines, believing the politicians and judges on his payroll would turn against him if he engaged in [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. During the meeting, Sonny expresses interest in the deal. After the meeting, Vito castigates his son for letting an outsider know what he was thinking. During [[Christmas]], as Vito crosses a street to buy oranges from a vendor, Sollozzo's hitmen emerge with guns drawn. Vito runs for his [[Cadillac]], but is shot five times. Fredo, who had been accompanying Vito, drops his gun and is unable to return fire as the assassins escape.\n\nVito survives, and Sollozzo makes a second assassination attempt at the hospital. [[Captain McCluskey|Mark McCluskey]]\u2014a corrupt police captain on Sollozzo's payroll\u2014has removed Vito's bodyguards, leaving him unprotected. However, Michael arrives moments before the imminent attack. Realizing his father is in danger, Michael and a nurse move Vito to another room. Michael affirms his loyalty at Vito's bedside.\n\nWhile Vito recovers, Sonny serves as acting head of the family. Michael, knowing his father will never be safe while Sollozzo lives, convinces Sonny that he can murder Sollozzo and McCluskey. Michael kills both men and is smuggled to Sicily under the protection of Vito's friend and business partner Don Tommasino. The deaths of Sollozzo and McCluskey ignite a war between the Corleone and the Tattaglia families, with the other New York families backing the latter. After Sonny is killed by Barzini's men, Vito resumes control and brokers a peace accord among the families, during which he realizes that Barzini masterminded the attempt on his life and Sonny's murder.\n\n===Joey Zasa===\nJoey Zasa is a fictional character and antagonist appearing in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. He was portrayed by [[Joe Mantegna]]. He is based on a composite of three real [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] members: [[Joseph Colombo]], [[Joe Gallo]] and [[John Gotti]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Perrotta|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/who-is-joey-zasa-based-on|title=Q: Who is \"The Godfather: Part III\" character Joey Zasa based on?|website=Screenprism|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}M</ref>\n\nZasa is a longtime member of Corleone ''[[caporegime]]'' [[Peter Clemenza]]'s regime. Following the retirement of Ritchie Nobilio, who succeeded [[Frank Pentangeli]] ([[Michael V. Gazzo]]) after the events of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Zasa assumes control over the [[Corleone family]] business in [[New York City]] with approval from the [[The Commission (Mafia)|Commission]] and [[Michael Corleone]] ([[Al Pacino]]). Zasa is feared and, to a certain degree, respected among his peers in the New York underworld for his business acumen and utter ruthlessness. However, his flamboyance and hunger for publicity earns Michael's displeasure, especially during the 1970s when it attracts unwanted public attention to Michael's criminal past when he is attempting to rehabilitate his public image. Michael especially disapproves of Zasa's eagerness to enter the drug trade, and distances himself from him.\n\nIn ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', Zasa first appears at a reception honoring Michael. He gets into an argument with one of his soldiers, [[Vincent Mancini]] ([[Andy Garc\u00eda]]), the illegitimate son of [[Sonny Corleone]]. Zasa calls Vincent a bastard in Michael's presence, prompting the enraged young man to attack Zasa. Zasa subsequently hires two assassins to kill Vincent, but Vincent quickly kills both.\n\nLater in the film, Zasa participates in a plot to have Michael assassinated during a meeting with the various [[Don (mafia)|Don]]s in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. During the meeting, Michael insults Zasa, prompting him to storm out; moments later, a helicopter containing gunmen hovers above the room and guns down nearly everyone inside. Michael escapes, but nearly every other Don is killed.  The survivors make deals with Zasa. \n\nSeveral days later, Michael's sister Connie ([[Talia Shire]]) gives clearance for Vincent to kill Zasa before he can take another run at Michael.  Vincent assassinates Zasa in [[Bensonhurst]] during a street festival. Vincent's men and Michael's personal assassin [[Al Neri]] (disguised as members of the church procession) kill Zasa's bodyguards, while Vincent (disguised as an [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[mounted police|Mounted Patrol]] officer) shoots Zasa in the back three times as he attempts to escape.\n\n==Other characters==\n===Amerigo Bonasera===\nAmerigo Bonasera is a fictional character created by [[Mario Puzo]] who appears in his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[The Godfather|1972 film adaptation]]. Though he is not a major character, he plays a vital role in revealing the merciful side of main character [[Vito Corleone]]. The novel opens with the words: \"Amerigo Bonasera sat at New York Criminal Court...\". The film also starts with his famous line, \"I believe in America. America has made my fortune.\"\n\nBonasera is a proud [[Italian-American]] [[undertaker]] who tends to keep away from the [[Corleone family]], knowing they are involved with [[the Mafia]], though [[Carmella Corleone|Don Corleone's wife]] is a [[godparent|godmother]] to Bonasera's daughter. His daughter is brutally beaten by her boyfriend and his friend for refusing to have sex after they had plied her with whiskey. The men escape any serious penalty because they are from wealthy, politically connected families.\n\nDesperate, Bonasera decides to go to Don Corleone on the day of his daughter's wedding to ask him to kill the young men; according to tradition, a [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] never refuses a favor on the day of his daughter's wedding. His proposition angers Don Corleone, who reprimands him for asking for a favor without showing the proper respect, and for seeking the attackers' deaths when his daughter was alive and would recover. Nevertheless, Vito agrees to grant a favor in return for Bonasera's \"friendship\" and the respectful address of \"Godfather\". Vito Corleone also gently reprimands Bonasera for attempting to seek justice through the courts [[Omert\u00e0|instead of coming to him first]].\n\nVito hands the job to [[Peter Clemenza]] with explicit instructions that his men aren't to get \"carried away\" and accidentally kill anyone. The next evening, Paulie Gatto and two other members of his crew give the men a brutal beating that puts them in the hospital for months. Bonasera sends his thanks to Vito through Corleone family ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Tom Hagen]]. Though feeling safer now that he has Don Corleone on his side, Bonasera begins dreading the day Corleone asks him a favor; he has a nightmare of the Don ordering him to bury the bodies of two men he has just killed.\n\nLater in the film, Hagen calls on Bonasera to finally pay back the favor. Initially terrified, Bonasera is relieved when Vito Corleone comes to his funeral parlor with the corpse of his eldest son, [[Sonny Corleone]], who has been gunned down by the [[Barzini family]]. A heartbroken Vito merely requests that Bonasera repair the extensive physical damage so that Sonny's mother can have an open casket. Bonasera is seen one final time at Vito Corleone's funeral; the novel states he had fulfilled all obligations and satisfied their friendship by preparing Sonny's body for burial.\n\nIn the 1972 film, Bonasera is played by Salvatore Corsitto (1913\u20131999).\n\nIn [[The Godfather (2006 video game)|the 2006 video game adaptation]], [[Aldo Trapani]], instead of Clemenza, is ordered to punish the two perpetrators, who are found in the graveyard outside Bonasera's funeral home harassing Bonasera's daughter. He attacks the assailants, knocking them out and leaving one in an open grave.\n\n===Cardinal Lamberto===\n{{main|Cardinal Lamberto}}\n\n===Lucy Mancini===\nLucy Mancini is a fictional character in [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]''. She was portrayed by [[Jeannie Linero]] and appears in ''The Godfather'' and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20076/The-Godfather/cast|title=The Godfather (1972)|newspaper=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref> \n\nShe is one of the childhood friends of [[Vito Corleone]]'s children, particularly his daughter, [[Connie Corleone]]. She is the [[maid of honor]] at Connie's wedding. Lucy has sex with Vito's son [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] at the wedding and begins an extramarital affair with him. The novel and the films diverge in their treatments of Lucy's fate after Sonny's death.\n\nIn the novel, Lucy is a fairly important supporting character, with several chapters dedicated to her story.  After Sonny's death, Vito's ''[[consigliere]]'', [[Tom Hagen]] sends Lucy to [[Las Vegas]]. She is given a small interest (five and later ten \"points\") in one of the family's hotels, primarily so that she can keep an eye on Vito's middle son, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], who is learning the hotel and casino business. She also serves as a shareholder-of-record who has no criminal record: several such owners are necessary for a valid [[gaming license]]. On paper she is a millionaire, although she does not vote her shares in the casinos. Eventually, Lucy establishes a new life in Las Vegas, and becomes largely independent of the Corleone clan. She is lonely, however, and occasionally pines for Sonny: while never having loved him or even truly known him, she misses him as a lover, and cannot achieve sexual satisfaction with anyone else. That changes when she meets and falls in love with surgeon Dr. Jules Segal. He explains that her difficulty in reaching [[orgasm]] is caused by a [[Loose Vagina|loose vagina]], which commonly results from multiple childbirths. In Lucy's case, this appears to be [[congenital]] and can be remedied with simple vaginal surgery. After Segal's colleague in [[Los Angeles]] performs the surgery, Lucy is able to enjoy sex again, and she and Jules presumably are happily married.\n\nIn Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations, Lucy's role is minimal.  She is seen as a young woman in ''[[The Godfather]]'', but her character is not featured after Sonny's death. She makes no appearance in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', she is present in a manner inconsistent with her fate as described in ''The Godfather'' novel. Lucy is the mother of Sonny's illegitimate son, [[Vincent Corleone|Vincent]], who eventually succeeds [[Michael Corleone]] as the head of the Corleone crime family.  She appears briefly as a guest in the party scene at the beginning of the film when Michael invites Vincent to join the family for a group photo. In Puzo's original novel, Sonny does not impregnate her.\n\n===Danny Shea===\n{{main|Danny Shea (The Godfather)}}\n\n===Mickey Shea===\n{{main|Mickey Shea}}\n\n===Billy Van Arsdale===\n{{main|Billy Van Arsdale}}\n\n===Aldo Trapani===\n{{main|Aldo Trapani}}\n\n===Albert Volpe===\n{{main|Albert Volpe}}\n\n==The Five Families==\nThe Five Families are five major Mafia [[Crime family|crime families]] in the novel and film ''[[The Godfather]]''.

She is portrayed by [[Simonetta Stefanelli]] in the film adaptation of the same name. She also appears in flashbacks in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nApollonia is a young [[Sicilians|Sicilian]] woman who meets Michael Corleone during his exile in [[Sicily]]. After seeing her for the first time, Michael and his bodyguards inquire about her to Signore Vitelli, a local [[tavern]] keeper to try and find out who she is. After describing her in detail, Vitelli angrily says he does not know her and leaves. When Michael's bodyguards realize that the girl is Signore Vitelli's daughter, they both ask Michael to leave, but Michael, speaking through his bodyguard and interpreter Fabrizio, soon gains Signore Vitelli's respect by introducing himself and apologizing. Michael asks and receives Signore Vitelli's permission to court Apollonia under the [[Chaperone (social)|chaperonage]] of her family. After a brief [[courtship]], they are married.\n\nSoon afterward, however, Apollonia is killed by a [[car bomb]] intended for Michael. The attack was set up by Fabrizio, who had betrayed Michael to Corleone family enemies back in Michael's native New York City. In an unfortunate twist of fate, she unknowingly puts herself in danger when she tries to impress Michael by showing him that she taught herself how to drive, which was uncommon for Sicilian women. In the book, she is pregnant at the time of her death, but this detail is not specified in the film. The explosion is powerful enough to throw Michael off his feet and knock him unconscious. The local Mafia chieftain, Don Tommasino, an old friend of Michael's father Vito, moves Michael to a hospital. Michael regains consciousness a few days later, whereupon Don Tommasino informs Michael of his wife's death. After returning to the United States, Michael reconnects with his previous girlfriend, Kay Adams, but does not tell her that he had been married while he was living in Sicily.

Fabrizio is found running a pizza parlor in Buffalo, New York under the alias of Fred Vincent. He is shot in the chest by an assassin who walks into the pizza parlor. The assassin then tells him \"Michael Corleone sends his regards\", before shooting him again in the head. In a deleted scene from the film's script, Michael himself kills Fabrizio with a shotgun. This scene was never released, although publicity photos were distributed of Al Pacino, who portrayed Michael, firing a shotgun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/media/rm645044224/nm0000199|title= Photos of Al Pacino|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/03/15/the-anniversary-you-cant-refuse-40-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-godfather/#deleted-scene-1-michael-shoots-his-wifes-killer|title=The Anniversary You Can't Refuse: 40 Things You Didn't Know About The Godfather - Deleted Scene No. 1: Michael Shoots His Wife\u2019s Killer|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Cruz, Gilbert|date=2012-03-15|accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> A scene was filmed for Part II in which Michael is informed that Fabrizio has been found.

When Sollozzo learns Corleone survived, he sends agents to the hospital for another attempt after he has Captain McCluskey ([[Sterling Hayden]]), a New York City police captain on Sollozzo's payroll, arrest Don Corleone's personal guards at the hospital and removes the police officers stationed outside the Don's hospital room. The assassination attempt fails after Vito's youngest son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] arrives, and finding all the guards gone, suspects another assassination attempt is about to happen. He moves his father to another room, then tricks the would-be assassins into believing guards are still protecting his father. Captain McCluskey arrives and confronts Michael, punching him and breaking his jaw. Hagen arrives shortly afterwards with guards legally licensed to carry weapons; McCluskey, unable to arrest them without raising suspicions, backs down and leaves.\n\nSoon after, Sollozzo seeks a meeting with Michael to resolve the hostilities, although at Michael's urging, the Corleones view this as an opportunity to kill Sollozzo, which would, of necessity, also involve killing McCluskey.  Michael successfully convinces [[Sonny Corleone]], [[Tom Hagen]] and other leaders of the Family that the usual strict [[Mafia]] prohibition against killing police for fear of bringing down the retribution of the authorities should not apply in this case, since McCluskey is \"a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop, a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him\" and says that this would be \"a terrific story\" to be given to newspaper people on the Corleone Family payroll after the fact.\n\nUnder McCluskey's personal protection, Sollozzo meets with Michael in a Bronx restaurant. Although Michael is frisked before the meeting, a revolver had been planted behind the overhead tank of a toilet in the restaurant's lavatory. (The Corleones were able to do this only because they found out in advance where the meeting would take place - because McCluskey was required by police regulations to leave an address where he could be reached that night and a cop in his precinct who was being paid off by the Corleones told Sonny where McCluskey would be that evening). Michael excuses himself to go to the bathroom, and retrieves the revolver. When he returns, he draws the gun and shoots Sollozzo in the forehead, killing him instantly, and kills McCluskey with two shots moments later.\n\nAlthough the double murder, including that of a police captain, brings an official crackdown on organized crime, the subsequent leak of information about McCluskey's criminal links to Sollozzo - as Michael correctly predicted - gets wide coverage in the newspapers and takes some of the heat off.\n\n===Johnny Ola===\nJohnny Ola is a fictional character in ''The Godfather Part II''. He is portrayed by [[Dominic Chianese]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20078/The-Godfather-Part-II/cast|title=The Godfather, Part II (1974)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref>\n\nJohnny Ola is a mobster and right-hand man to Jewish mobster [[Hyman Roth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/blog/2011/07/postscript_to_g.html|title=Postscript to G.D.

Ola is Sicilian but speaks American English with a New York accent. Ola is part of Roth's plan to assassinate [[Michael Corleone]] at his home at [[Lake Tahoe]], with unwitting help from Michael's brother [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]]. When Michael asks if Fredo and Johnny had ever met, they deny knowing each other. Later, however, Fredo carelessly reveals that he and Ola had visited a nightclub together in [[Havana]]. Michael overhears the conversation and realizes that Fredo is the traitor within the family. Michael sends his bodyguard Bussetta to kill Ola and Roth. Bussetta strangles Ola, but Roth gets away.\n\n===Carlo Rizzi===\n{{main|Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)}}\n\n=== Louie Russo ===\nLuigi \"Louie\" Russo is a fictional character in [[Mark Winegardner|Mark Winegardner's]] ''[[The Godfather Returns]]''. Russo serves as the Don of the [[Chicago Outfit]] from 1955 to 1961.\n\nLouie Russo and his brother, Willy, were 'made' under [[Al Capone]]. His brother was one of the men sent to kill [[Vito Corleone]] during the [[Castellammarese War]] (mentioned in ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''), although he was eventually killed by [[Luca Brasi]].\n\nRusso holds a grudge against the Corleones for years for his brother's death, at one point attempting (unsuccessfully) to have Vito's son [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] killed. After [[Michael Corleone]] becomes Don in 1955, however, Russo tricks him into believing that the bad blood between them is over. Under Russo, the Chicago mob expands into the New York area and interferes with the Corleones' [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] casinos. Russo unsuccessfully conspires with Vincent Forlenza and Nick Geraci to kill Michael Corleone, in the process indirectly duping Fredo into betraying his brother to [[Hyman Roth]].\n\nIn June 1961, he invites [[Tom Hagen]] to his supper club/gambling house in rural [[Illinois]] with the intention of killing him. He, Hagen, a rower, and two Russo ''[[Soldato|soldatos]]'' go out on a gondola in his man-made lake. On the course of the trip, as part of Michael's revenge, Hagen strangles one ''soldato'' while the rower hits Russo and the other ''soldato'' with his oar. Hagen then personally kills Russo on his boat, with Russo's own gun, and dumps the bodies in the lake.\n\nIn his appearances in ''The Godfather Returns'', Russo is portrayed as a cruel, vindictive man whose methods of retribution are particularly vicious, even by [[American Mafia|Mafia]] standards; in the sequel ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]'', Tom Hagen describes Russo as \"a sick man, in ways I don't like to think about.\" Following an assassination attempt years before, in which his eyes are permanently damaged, he wears large black sunglasses to shield them from the light. When he inadvertently shows his uncovered eyes to Tom Hagen after his glasses are knocked off, Hagen notes that they are red with a green ring in the middle. The novel reveals that Russo is estranged from his [[gay]] son, but still uses him as a source of information on [[The closet|closeted]] rivals for purposes of [[blackmail]] and gamesmanship with the other families.\n\n===Hyman Roth===\n{{main|Hyman Roth}}\n\n===Virgil Sollozzo===\nVirgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's novel ''The Godfather''. He is portrayed by [[Al Lettieri]] in the film adaptation of the same name.\n\nIn 1945, [[heroin]] kingpin Virgil Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his operation. Sollozzo is backed by the rival Tattaglia family, and wants Vito's political influence and legal protection. Vito declines, believing the politicians and judges on his payroll would turn against him if he engaged in [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. During the meeting, Sonny expresses interest in the deal. After the meeting, Vito castigates his son for letting an outsider know what he was thinking. During [[Christmas]], as Vito crosses a street to buy oranges from a vendor, Sollozzo's hitmen emerge with guns drawn. Vito runs for his [[Cadillac]], but is shot five times. Fredo, who had been accompanying Vito, drops his gun and is unable to return fire as the assassins escape.\n\nVito survives, and Sollozzo makes a second assassination attempt at the hospital. [[Captain McCluskey|Mark McCluskey]]\u2014a corrupt police captain on Sollozzo's payroll\u2014has removed Vito's bodyguards, leaving him unprotected. However, Michael arrives moments before the imminent attack. Realizing his father is in danger, Michael and a nurse move Vito to another room. Michael affirms his loyalty at Vito's bedside.\n\nWhile Vito recovers, Sonny serves as acting head of the family. Michael, knowing his father will never be safe while Sollozzo lives, convinces Sonny that he can murder Sollozzo and McCluskey. Michael kills both men and is smuggled to Sicily under the protection of Vito's friend and business partner Don Tommasino. The deaths of Sollozzo and McCluskey ignite a war between the Corleone and the Tattaglia families, with the other New York families backing the latter. After Sonny is killed by Barzini's men, Vito resumes control and brokers a peace accord among the families, during which he realizes that Barzini masterminded the attempt on his life and Sonny's murder.\n\n===Joey Zasa===\nJoey Zasa is a fictional character and antagonist appearing in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''. He was portrayed by [[Joe Mantegna]]. He is based on a composite of three real [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] members: [[Joseph Colombo]], [[Joe Gallo]] and [[John Gotti]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Perrotta|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/who-is-joey-zasa-based-on|title=Q: Who is \"The Godfather: Part III\" character Joey Zasa based on?|website=Screenprism|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}M</ref>\n\nZasa is a longtime member of Corleone ''[[caporegime]]'' [[Peter Clemenza]]'s regime. Following the retirement of Ritchie Nobilio, who succeeded [[Frank Pentangeli]] ([[Michael V. Gazzo]]) after the events of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Zasa assumes control over the [[Corleone family]] business in [[New York City]] with approval from the [[The Commission (Mafia)|Commission]] and [[Michael Corleone]] ([[Al Pacino]]). Zasa is feared and, to a certain degree, respected among his peers in the New York underworld for his business acumen and utter ruthlessness. However, his flamboyance and hunger for publicity earns Michael's displeasure, especially during the 1970s when it attracts unwanted public attention to Michael's criminal past when he is attempting to rehabilitate his public image. Michael especially disapproves of Zasa's eagerness to enter the drug trade, and distances himself from him.\n\nIn ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', Zasa first appears at a reception honoring Michael. He gets into an argument with one of his soldiers, [[Vincent Mancini]] ([[Andy Garc\u00eda]]), the illegitimate son of [[Sonny Corleone]]. Zasa calls Vincent a bastard in Michael's presence, prompting the enraged young man to attack Zasa. Zasa subsequently hires two assassins to kill Vincent, but Vincent quickly kills both.\n\nLater in the film, Zasa participates in a plot to have Michael assassinated during a meeting with the various [[Don (mafia)|Don]]s in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. During the meeting, Michael insults Zasa, prompting him to storm out; moments later, a helicopter containing gunmen hovers above the room and guns down nearly everyone inside. Michael escapes, but nearly every other Don is killed.  The survivors make deals with Zasa. \n\nSeveral days later, Michael's sister Connie ([[Talia Shire]]) gives clearance for Vincent to kill Zasa before he can take another run at Michael.  Vincent assassinates Zasa in [[Bensonhurst]] during a street festival. Vincent's men and Michael's personal assassin [[Al Neri]] (disguised as members of the church procession) kill Zasa's bodyguards, while Vincent (disguised as an [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[mounted police|Mounted Patrol]] officer) shoots Zasa in the back three times as he attempts to escape.\n\n==Other characters==\n===Amerigo Bonasera===\nAmerigo Bonasera is a fictional character created by [[Mario Puzo]] who appears in his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[The Godfather|1972 film adaptation]]. Though he is not a major character, he plays a vital role in revealing the merciful side of main character [[Vito Corleone]]. The novel opens with the words: \"Amerigo Bonasera sat at New York Criminal Court...\". The film also starts with his famous line, \"I believe in America. America has made my fortune.\"\n\nBonasera is a proud [[Italian-American]] [[undertaker]] who tends to keep away from the [[Corleone family]], knowing they are involved with [[the Mafia]], though [[Carmella Corleone|Don Corleone's wife]] is a [[godparent|godmother]] to Bonasera's daughter. His daughter is brutally beaten by her boyfriend and his friend for refusing to have sex after they had plied her with whiskey. The men escape any serious penalty because they are from wealthy, politically connected families.\n\nDesperate, Bonasera decides to go to Don Corleone on the day of his daughter's wedding to ask him to kill the young men; according to tradition, a [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] never refuses a favor on the day of his daughter's wedding. His proposition angers Don Corleone, who reprimands him for asking for a favor without showing the proper respect, and for seeking the attackers' deaths when his daughter was alive and would recover. Nevertheless, Vito agrees to grant a favor in return for Bonasera's \"friendship\" and the respectful address of \"Godfather\". Vito Corleone also gently reprimands Bonasera for attempting to seek justice through the courts [[Omert\u00e0|instead of coming to him first]].\n\nVito hands the job to [[Peter Clemenza]] with explicit instructions that his men aren't to get \"carried away\" and accidentally kill anyone. The next evening, Paulie Gatto and two other members of his crew give the men a brutal beating that puts them in the hospital for months. Bonasera sends his thanks to Vito through Corleone family ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Tom Hagen]]. Though feeling safer now that he has Don Corleone on his side, Bonasera begins dreading the day Corleone asks him a favor; he has a nightmare of the Don ordering him to bury the bodies of two men he has just killed.\n\nLater in the film, Hagen calls on Bonasera to finally pay back the favor. Initially terrified, Bonasera is relieved when Vito Corleone comes to his funeral parlor with the corpse of his eldest son, [[Sonny Corleone]], who has been gunned down by the [[Barzini family]]. A heartbroken Vito merely requests that Bonasera repair the extensive physical damage so that Sonny's mother can have an open casket. Bonasera is seen one final time at Vito Corleone's funeral; the novel states he had fulfilled all obligations and satisfied their friendship by preparing Sonny's body for burial.\n\nIn the 1972 film, Bonasera is played by Salvatore Corsitto (1913\u20131999).\n\nIn [[The Godfather (2006 video game)|the 2006 video game adaptation]], [[Aldo Trapani]], instead of Clemenza, is ordered to punish the two perpetrators, who are found in the graveyard outside Bonasera's funeral home harassing Bonasera's daughter. He attacks the assailants, knocking them out and leaving one in an open grave.\n\n===Cardinal Lamberto===\n{{main|Cardinal Lamberto}}\n\n===Lucy Mancini===\nLucy Mancini is a fictional character in [[Mario Puzo]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]''. She was portrayed by [[Jeannie Linero]] and appears in ''The Godfather'' and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20076/The-Godfather/cast|title=The Godfather (1972)|newspaper=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref> \n\nShe is one of the childhood friends of [[Vito Corleone]]'s children, particularly his daughter, [[Connie Corleone]]. She is the [[maid of honor]] at Connie's wedding. Lucy has sex with Vito's son [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] at the wedding and begins an extramarital affair with him. The novel and the films diverge in their treatments of Lucy's fate after Sonny's death.\n\nIn the novel, Lucy is a fairly important supporting character, with several chapters dedicated to her story.  After Sonny's death, Vito's ''[[consigliere]]'', [[Tom Hagen]] sends Lucy to [[Las Vegas]]. She is given a small interest (five and later ten \"points\") in one of the family's hotels, primarily so that she can keep an eye on Vito's middle son, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], who is learning the hotel and casino business. She also serves as a shareholder-of-record who has no criminal record: several such owners are necessary for a valid [[gaming license]]. On paper she is a millionaire, although she does not vote her shares in the casinos. Eventually, Lucy establishes a new life in Las Vegas, and becomes largely independent of the Corleone clan. She is lonely, however, and occasionally pines for Sonny: while never having loved him or even truly known him, she misses him as a lover, and cannot achieve sexual satisfaction with anyone else. That changes when she meets and falls in love with surgeon Dr. Jules Segal. He explains that her difficulty in reaching [[orgasm]] is caused by a [[Loose Vagina|loose vagina]], which commonly results from multiple childbirths. In Lucy's case, this appears to be [[congenital]] and can be remedied with simple vaginal surgery. After Segal's colleague in [[Los Angeles]] performs the surgery, Lucy is able to enjoy sex again, and she and Jules presumably are happily married.\n\nIn Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations, Lucy's role is minimal.  She is seen as a young woman in ''[[The Godfather]]'', but her character is not featured after Sonny's death. She makes no appearance in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', she is present in a manner inconsistent with her fate as described in ''The Godfather'' novel. Lucy is the mother of Sonny's illegitimate son, [[Vincent Corleone|Vincent]], who eventually succeeds [[Michael Corleone]] as the head of the Corleone crime family.  She appears briefly as a guest in the party scene at the beginning of the film when Michael invites Vincent to join the family for a group photo. In Puzo's original novel, Sonny does not impregnate her.\n\n===Danny Shea===\n{{main|Danny Shea (The Godfather)}}\n\n===Mickey Shea===\n{{main|Mickey Shea}}\n\n===Billy Van Arsdale===\n{{main|Billy Van Arsdale}}\n\n===Aldo Trapani===\n{{main|Aldo Trapani}}\n\n===Albert Volpe===\n{{main|Albert Volpe}}\n\n==The Five Families==\nThe Five Families are five major Mafia [[Crime family|crime families]] in the novel and film ''[[The Godfather]]''.
