The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and an awareness that there would be much new cultural work being produced which had been inspired by the events.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available, equally, financial stimulus from governments, and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East-Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.  \n\nBy March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and an awareness that there would be much new cultural work being produced which had been inspired by the events. \n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available, equally, financial stimulus from governments, and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. \n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East-Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

J. Cherryh]], published in 1981 by [[DAW Books]].  It won the [[Hugo Award]] in 1982,<ref name=\"WWE-1982\">{{cite web |url=https://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1982 |title=1982 Award Winners & Nominees |work=Worlds Without End |accessdate=2009-07-14 }}</ref> was shortlisted for a [[Locus Award]] that same year,<ref name=\"WWE-1982\" /> and was named by [[Locus (magazine)|''Locus'' magazine]] as one of the top 50 science fiction novels of all time in 1987.\n\nThe book is set in Cherryh's [[Alliance\u2013Union universe]] during the Company Wars period, specifically late 2352 and early 2353.  The book details events centering on a [[space station]] in orbit around [[Alliance\u2013Union universe#Pell's World|Pell's World]] (also known as \"Downbelow\") in the [[Tau Ceti]] star system. The station serves as the transit point for ships moving between the Earth and Union sectors of the [[Milky Way|galaxy]].\n\nThe working title of the book was ''The Company War'', but Cherryh's editor at DAW, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], believed that the moniker lacked commercial appeal, so ''Downbelow Station'' was selected as the title for publication. It was the first novel edited by current DAW president, Elizabeth Wollheim, who worked alongside her father.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wollheim |first=Betsy |editor-last=Carmien |editor-first=Edward |title=The Cherryh Odyssey |title-link=The Cherryh Odyssey |chapter=A Pioneer of the Mind |publisher=[[Wildside Press]] |year=2004 |page=59 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bj9Jbnak3S0C&lpg=PP1&dq=intitle%3AThe%20intitle%3ACherryh%20intitle%3AOdyssey&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q=intitle:The%20intitle:Cherryh%20intitle:Odyssey&f=false |isbn=0-8095-1071-5}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSpace is explored not by short-sighted governments, but by the Earth Company, a private corporation which becomes enormously wealthy and powerful as a result. Nine star systems are found to lack [[planet]]s suitable for colonization, so space stations are built in orbit instead, stepping stones for further exploration. Then, Pell's World is found to be not only habitable, but already populated by the gentle, sentient (if technologically backward) [[Alliance\u2013Union universe#Pell's World|Hisa]]. Pell Station is built. The planet is nicknamed \"[[Alliance\u2013Union universe#Pell's World|Downbelow]]\" by the stationers, who also start to call their home \"Downbelow Station\".\n\nWhen Earth's out-of-touch policies cause it to begin losing control of its more distant stations and worlds, it builds a fleet of fifty military carriers, the Earth Company Fleet, to enforce its will. This leads to the prolonged Company War with the breakaway Union, based at Cyteen, another habitable world. Caught in between are the stationers and the merchanters<ref>In the Alliance\u2013Union universe, the traders who run starships are called \"merchanters\", not \"merchants\".</ref> who crew the freighters that maintain [[space trade|interstellar trade]].\n\nSet in the final days of the war, ''Downbelow Station'' opens with Earth Company Captain Signy Mallory and her warship, ''Norway'', escorting a ragtag fleet fleeing from Russell's and Mariner Stations to Pell.  Similar convoys arrive from other stations destroyed or lost to Union, leading to an enormous crisis. The flood of unexpected refugees strains station resources. Angelo Konstantin, Stationmaster of Pell, and his two sons, Damon and Emilio, struggle to cope with the situation. Fearing Union infiltrators and saboteurs, Pell dumps all the refugees in a Quarantine Zone, causing massive dislocations of Pell's own citizens.\n\nWhile conferring with Pell's administrators, Mallory encounters a delegation from the Earth Company, led by Segust Ayres, Second Secretary of Earth's Security Council. Offended by her brusque, arrogant manner, Ayres declines her offer of transportation to the front and charters a freighter instead. Unbeknownst to Mallory, Ayres' mission is to open peace negotiations with Union.\n\nMallory also drops off a Union prisoner of war, Josh Talley, whom she had rescued from a brutal interrogation by panicked security forces at Russell's. However, on the voyage to Pell, her sexual exploitation of him had been only marginally less abusive. Faced with indefinite confinement on Pell, Talley requests Adjustment, the wiping of much of his memory, in return for his freedom. When questioned by Damon Konstantin, he requests Adjustment to escape the indefinite imprisonment, so Konstantin reluctantly gives his permission.  Upon later review of his file, Damon learns that Talley had already undergone the treatment once before at Russell's.  Still feeling guilty for agreeing, he and his wife Elene Quen befriend the post-Adjustment Talley, an act of kindness that will have monumental, unforeseen consequences.\n\nJon Lukas, Angelo Konstantin's brother-in-law and only rival for power, is worried about the course of the war. The Fleet has received little or no support from an indifferent Earth and is gradually losing a [[war of attrition]]. He secretly contacts Union, offering to hand Pell over. Union responds by smuggling in a secret agent named Jessad.\n\nMeanwhile, the last ten surviving Company Fleet ships under the command of Conrad Mazian gather for the most critical operation of the war. All of Mazian's recent strategic maneuvers and raids have been leading up to this point. If they can take out Viking Station in one coordinated strike before their enemy's growing numerical superiority can overwhelm them, there would be a wide, barren region between Earth and Union space, one which would make further conflict vastly more costly for Union.\n\n[[File:CherryhDownbelowStation20thAnnCover.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''Downbelow Station'' (20th Anniversary Edition)]]\n\nSeb Azov, the Union military commander, has no choice but to gather his forces at Viking to await Mazian's anticipated attack. However, he has an ace up his sleeve. He has pressured Ayres into recording a message ordering Mazian to break off while peace is being negotiated. When Mazian strikes, Ayres' broadcast order does indeed force him to abort and the Fleet retreats to Pell in confusion.\n\nMazian meets with his captains and gives them the choice of accepting a peace treaty that essentially concedes victory to Union as per Ayres' broadcast or rebelling against Earth and continuing to fight that is his preference. They all remain loyal to their leader. One of Mazian's first acts is to place Pell under [[martial law]].\n\nThe Fleet is now forced to defend Downbelow Station, its only reliable base and supply source. Union forces attack and destroy two ships out on patrol. While Union suffers casualties as well, it can replace its losses, unlike Mazian. Counting one carrier lost earlier in the debacle at Viking, he has just seven ships left.\n\nUnder cover of the panic on the station caused by the battle in space, Lukas makes his move, killing and supplanting his hated rival, Angelo Konstantin. To escape rioting refugees, Elene Quen is forced to board ''Finity's End'', one of the most respected merchanter ships. The freighters flee the battle zone, but Quen convinces most of them to band together, for safety and to maximize their leverage whatever happens. Damon survives his uncle's assassination attempt and links up with Talley. Together, they manage to hide from Lukas; in fact, Talley discovers he is surprisingly good at it.\n\nEventually, they are contacted by Jessad, and Talley finds out why. He and Jessad are the same kind: ''[[Azi (clone)|azi]]'', artificially bred and, in Jessad and Talley's case, trained especially for espionage and sabotage. They are discovered by Fleet marines; Jessad is killed, while Konstantin and Talley are captured and taken to Mallory.\n\nShe receives orders from Mazian to quietly dispose of Konstantin. Lukas does the Fleet's bidding with far fewer scruples, so Konstantin is superfluous, even dangerous. Mazian is preparing to disable and abandon Downbelow Station. He has another goal in mind: to take over Earth itself in a surprise [[coup d'etat]]. The wrecking of Pell would create a [[firebreak]] with Union, playing the role he had originally intended for Viking.\n\nMallory has different ideas. Mazian has gone too far for her to stomach. She abruptly undocks from Pell and deserts. Mallory finds the Union forces and persuades Azov to unleash them against her former comrades. Talley is instrumental in convincing Azov of Mallory's truthfulness.\n\nMazian cannot afford a costly fight, so the Fleet sets off for Earth prematurely. Azov needs to pursue him, but is unwilling to leave ''Norway'' intact behind him. The tense standoff is broken by a timely arrival; Quen returns with the united merchanter fleet and claims Pell for the newborn Merchanter's Alliance, with ''Norway'' as its militia. Without the authority to deal with this new development and unwilling to fight the merchanters, Azov leaves to deal with Mazian.\n\nThe end of the Company War is at last in sight, much to the relief of the Konstantins, the merchanters, and the residents of Downbelow Station.\n\n==Characters==\n*Earth Company personnel\n**Signy Mallory, female, captain of the Earth Company Ship ECS5 ''Norway'' and the third most senior captain in the Earth Company Fleet\n**Conrad Mazian, male, flamboyant, brilliant commander of the Earth Company Fleet\n**Segust Ayres, male, Second Secretary of the Earth Company Security Council\n*Pell stationers\n**Angelo Konstantin, male, Stationmaster of Pell Station, husband of Alicia Lukas Konstantin\n**Alicia Lukas Konstantin, married to Angelo Konstantin, sister of Jon Lukas, bedridden and dependent on technology for survival\n**Damon Konstantin, son of Angelo and Alicia; head of Legal Affairs\n**Elene Quen, female, a former merchanter, married to Damon Konstantin\n**Emilio Konstantin, son of Angelo and Alicia\n**Jon Lukas, male, head of the Lukas family, rivals of the Konstantins\n*Union personnel\n**Joshua Talley, male, a prisoner of war who ends up at Pell\n**Jessad, male, a secret agent\n**Seb Azov, male, Union military commander\n*Hisa (natives of Pell, also known as 'Downers')\n**Satin, female, mate of Bluetooth, asks for work assignment on Pell Station,\n**Bluetooth, male, follows Satin to Pell Station\n**Lily, female, attendant to Alicia Konstantin\n*Others\n**Vassily Kressich, male, refugee from Mariner Station\n\n==''The Company War'' board game==\n[[File:MayfairCompanyWarBoxCover.jpg|thumb|right|''The Company War'' (1983)]]\n<!-- FAIR USE of MayfairCompanyWarBoxCover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:MayfairCompanyWarBoxCover.jpg for rationale -->\n\n''The Company War'' is a [[board game]] based on ''Downbelow Station''. It was developed by Bill Fawcett and James D. Griffin and published by [[Mayfair Games]] in 1983. Cherryh endorsed the game and contributed an introductory essay and star maps.\n\nThe game is for two to four players and can be completed in about an hour. It is played on a large board depicting Union\u2013Alliance space with [[Jump (Alliance\u2013Union universe)|jump-points]] and space stations. Union and Earth Company ships, represented by counters, are moved about the board via dice. The aim of the game is to collect the most points by transporting goods between stations and destroying enemy ships.\n\nAn unofficial variant of the game (with Cherryh and Fawcett's permission), ''Advanced Company War'', was developed by Christopher Weuve in 1997.<ref>[http://www.kentaurus.com/acw.htm ChrisW's \"Advanced Company War\" page]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* 1982: [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]]: winner<ref name=\"WWE-1982\" /><ref name=\"ct820907\"/>\n* 1982: [[Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel]]: shortlist nominee<ref name=\"WWE-1982\" />\n* 1987: [[Locus Award]], All-Time Best SF Novel: position 41\n* 1998: [[Locus Award]], All-Time Best SF Novel before 1990: position 25\n\n==Song==\nThe [[Filk music|filk]] song \"Signy Mallory\" by [[Mercedes Lackey]] and [[Leslie Fish]] won the 2005 [[Filk music#Pegasus Awards|Pegasus Award]] for Best Space Opera Song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/songs/signy-mallory.html |title=The Pegasus Awards - Signy Mallory |publisher=Ohio Valley Filk Fest (ovff.org) |accessdate=May 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Publication information==\n* {{flagicon|United States}}: {{cite book | author=C.J.

J. Cherryh]], published in 1981 by [[DAW Books]].  It won the [[Hugo Award]] in 1982,<ref name=\"WWE-1982\">{{cite web |url=https://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1982 |title=1982 Award Winners & Nominees |work=Worlds Without End |accessdate=2009-07-14 }}</ref> was shortlisted for a [[Locus Award]] that same year,<ref name=\"WWE-1982\" /> and was named by [[Locus (magazine)|''Locus'' magazine]] as one of the top 50 science fiction novels of all time in 1987.\n\nThe book is set in Cherryh's [[Alliance\u2013Union universe]] during the Company Wars period, specifically late 2352 and early 2353.  The book details events centering on a [[space station]] in orbit around [[Alliance\u2013Union universe#Pell's World|Pell's World]] (also known as \"Downbelow\") in the [[Tau Ceti]] star system. The station serves as the transit point for ships moving between the Earth and Union sectors of the [[Milky Way|galaxy]].\n\nThe working title of the book was ''The Company War'', but Cherryh's editor at DAW, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], believed that the moniker lacked commercial appeal, so ''Downbelow Station'' was selected as the title for publication. It was the first novel edited by current DAW president, Elizabeth Wollheim, who worked alongside her father. <ref>{{cite book |last=Wollheim |first=Betsy |editor-last=Carmien |editor-first=Edward |title=The Cherryh Odyssey |title-link=The Cherryh Odyssey |chapter=A Pioneer of the Mind |publisher=[[Wildside Press]] |year=2004 |page=59 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bj9Jbnak3S0C&lpg=PP1&dq=intitle%3AThe%20intitle%3ACherryh%20intitle%3AOdyssey&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q=intitle:The%20intitle:Cherryh%20intitle:Odyssey&f=false |isbn=0-8095-1071-5}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSpace is explored not by short-sighted governments, but by the Earth Company, a private corporation which becomes enormously wealthy and powerful as a result. Nine star systems are found to lack [[planet]]s suitable for colonization, so space stations are built in orbit instead, stepping stones for further exploration. Then, Pell's World is found to be not only habitable, but already populated by the gentle, sentient (if technologically backward) [[Alliance\u2013Union universe#Pell's World|Hisa]]. Pell Station is built. The planet is nicknamed \"[[Alliance\u2013Union universe#Pell's World|Downbelow]]\" by the stationers, who also start to call their home \"Downbelow Station\".\n\nWhen Earth's out-of-touch policies cause it to begin losing control of its more distant stations and worlds, it builds a fleet of fifty military carriers, the Earth Company Fleet, to enforce its will. This leads to the prolonged Company War with the breakaway Union, based at Cyteen, another habitable world. Caught in between are the stationers and the merchanters<ref>In the Alliance\u2013Union universe, the traders who run starships are called \"merchanters\", not \"merchants\".</ref> who crew the freighters that maintain [[space trade|interstellar trade]].\n\nSet in the final days of the war, ''Downbelow Station'' opens with Earth Company Captain Signy Mallory and her warship, ''Norway'', escorting a ragtag fleet fleeing from Russell's and Mariner Stations to Pell.  Similar convoys arrive from other stations destroyed or lost to Union, leading to an enormous crisis. The flood of unexpected refugees strains station resources. Angelo Konstantin, Stationmaster of Pell, and his two sons, Damon and Emilio, struggle to cope with the situation. Fearing Union infiltrators and saboteurs, Pell dumps all the refugees in a Quarantine Zone, causing massive dislocations of Pell's own citizens.\n\nWhile conferring with Pell's administrators, Mallory encounters a delegation from the Earth Company, led by Segust Ayres, Second Secretary of Earth's Security Council. Offended by her brusque, arrogant manner, Ayres declines her offer of transportation to the front and charters a freighter instead. Unbeknownst to Mallory, Ayres' mission is to open peace negotiations with Union.\n\nMallory also drops off a Union prisoner of war, Josh Talley, whom she had rescued from a brutal interrogation by panicked security forces at Russell's. However, on the voyage to Pell, her sexual exploitation of him had been only marginally less abusive. Faced with indefinite confinement on Pell, Talley requests Adjustment, the wiping of much of his memory, in return for his freedom. When questioned by Damon Konstantin, he requests Adjustment to escape the indefinite imprisonment, so Konstantin reluctantly gives his permission.  Upon later review of his file, Damon learns that Talley had already undergone the treatment once before at Russell's.  Still feeling guilty for agreeing, he and his wife Elene Quen befriend the post-Adjustment Talley, an act of kindness that will have monumental, unforeseen consequences.\n\nJon Lukas, Angelo Konstantin's brother-in-law and only rival for power, is worried about the course of the war. The Fleet has received little or no support from an indifferent Earth and is gradually losing a [[war of attrition]]. He secretly contacts Union, offering to hand Pell over. Union responds by smuggling in a secret agent named Jessad.\n\nMeanwhile, the last ten surviving Company Fleet ships under the command of Conrad Mazian gather for the most critical operation of the war. All of Mazian's recent strategic maneuvers and raids have been leading up to this point. If they can take out Viking Station in one coordinated strike before their enemy's growing numerical superiority can overwhelm them, there would be a wide, barren region between Earth and Union space, one which would make further conflict vastly more costly for Union.\n\n[[File:CherryhDownbelowStation20thAnnCover.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''Downbelow Station'' (20th Anniversary Edition)]]\n\nSeb Azov, the Union military commander, has no choice but to gather his forces at Viking to await Mazian's anticipated attack. However, he has an ace up his sleeve. He has pressured Ayres into recording a message ordering Mazian to break off while peace is being negotiated. When Mazian strikes, Ayres' broadcast order does indeed force him to abort and the Fleet retreats to Pell in confusion.\n\nMazian meets with his captains and gives them the choice of accepting a peace treaty that essentially concedes victory to Union as per Ayres' broadcast or rebelling against Earth and continuing to fight that is his preference. They all remain loyal to their leader. One of Mazian's first acts is to place Pell under [[martial law]].\n\nThe Fleet is now forced to defend Downbelow Station, its only reliable base and supply source. Union forces attack and destroy two ships out on patrol. While Union suffers casualties as well, it can replace its losses, unlike Mazian. Counting one carrier lost earlier in the debacle at Viking, he has just seven ships left.\n\nUnder cover of the panic on the station caused by the battle in space, Lukas makes his move, killing and supplanting his hated rival, Angelo Konstantin. To escape rioting refugees, Elene Quen is forced to board ''Finity's End'', one of the most respected merchanter ships. The freighters flee the battle zone, but Quen convinces most of them to band together, for safety and to maximize their leverage whatever happens. Damon survives his uncle's assassination attempt and links up with Talley. Together, they manage to hide from Lukas; in fact, Talley discovers he is surprisingly good at it.\n\nEventually, they are contacted by Jessad, and Talley finds out why. He and Jessad are the same kind: ''[[Azi (clone)|azi]]'', artificially bred and, in Jessad and Talley's case, trained especially for espionage and sabotage. They are discovered by Fleet marines; Jessad is killed, while Konstantin and Talley are captured and taken to Mallory.\n\nShe receives orders from Mazian to quietly dispose of Konstantin. Lukas does the Fleet's bidding with far fewer scruples, so Konstantin is superfluous, even dangerous. Mazian is preparing to disable and abandon Downbelow Station. He has another goal in mind: to take over Earth itself in a surprise [[coup d'etat]]. The wrecking of Pell would create a [[firebreak]] with Union, playing the role he had originally intended for Viking.\n\nMallory has different ideas. Mazian has gone too far for her to stomach. She abruptly undocks from Pell and deserts. Mallory finds the Union forces and persuades Azov to unleash them against her former comrades. Talley is instrumental in convincing Azov of Mallory's truthfulness.\n\nMazian cannot afford a costly fight, so the Fleet sets off for Earth prematurely. Azov needs to pursue him, but is unwilling to leave ''Norway'' intact behind him. The tense standoff is broken by a timely arrival; Quen returns with the united merchanter fleet and claims Pell for the newborn Merchanter's Alliance, with ''Norway'' as its militia. Without the authority to deal with this new development and unwilling to fight the merchanters, Azov leaves to deal with Mazian.\n\nThe end of the Company War is at last in sight, much to the relief of the Konstantins, the merchanters, and the residents of Downbelow Station.\n\n==Characters==\n*Earth Company personnel\n**Signy Mallory, female, captain of the Earth Company Ship ECS5 ''Norway'' and the third most senior captain in the Earth Company Fleet\n**Conrad Mazian, male, flamboyant, brilliant commander of the Earth Company Fleet\n**Segust Ayres, male, Second Secretary of the Earth Company Security Council\n*Pell stationers\n**Angelo Konstantin, male, Stationmaster of Pell Station, husband of Alicia Lukas Konstantin\n**Alicia Lukas Konstantin, married to Angelo Konstantin, sister of Jon Lukas, bedridden and dependent on technology for survival\n**Damon Konstantin, son of Angelo and Alicia; head of Legal Affairs\n**Elene Quen, female, a former merchanter, married to Damon Konstantin\n**Emilio Konstantin, son of Angelo and Alicia\n**Jon Lukas, male, head of the Lukas family, rivals of the Konstantins\n*Union personnel\n**Joshua Talley, male, a prisoner of war who ends up at Pell\n**Jessad, male, a secret agent\n**Seb Azov, male, Union military commander\n*Hisa (natives of Pell, also known as 'Downers')\n**Satin, female, mate of Bluetooth, asks for work assignment on Pell Station,\n**Bluetooth, male, follows Satin to Pell Station\n**Lily, female, attendant to Alicia Konstantin\n*Others\n**Vassily Kressich, male, refugee from Mariner Station\n\n==''The Company War'' board game==\n[[File:MayfairCompanyWarBoxCover.jpg|thumb|right|''The Company War'' (1983)]]\n<!-- FAIR USE of MayfairCompanyWarBoxCover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:MayfairCompanyWarBoxCover.jpg for rationale -->\n\n''The Company War'' is a [[board game]] based on ''Downbelow Station''. It was developed by Bill Fawcett and James D. Griffin and published by [[Mayfair Games]] in 1983. Cherryh endorsed the game and contributed an introductory essay and star maps.\n\nThe game is for two to four players and can be completed in about an hour. It is played on a large board depicting Union\u2013Alliance space with [[Jump (Alliance\u2013Union universe)|jump-points]] and space stations. Union and Earth Company ships, represented by counters, are moved about the board via dice. The aim of the game is to collect the most points by transporting goods between stations and destroying enemy ships.\n\nAn unofficial variant of the game (with Cherryh and Fawcett's permission), ''Advanced Company War'', was developed by Christopher Weuve in 1997.<ref>[http://www.kentaurus.com/acw.htm ChrisW's \"Advanced Company War\" page]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* 1982: [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]]: winner<ref name=\"WWE-1982\" /><ref name=\"ct820907\"/>\n* 1982: [[Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel]]: shortlist nominee<ref name=\"WWE-1982\" />\n* 1987: [[Locus Award]], All-Time Best SF Novel: position 41\n* 1998: [[Locus Award]], All-Time Best SF Novel before 1990: position 25\n\n==Song==\nThe [[Filk music|filk]] song \"Signy Mallory\" by [[Mercedes Lackey]] and [[Leslie Fish]] won the 2005 [[Filk music#Pegasus Awards|Pegasus Award]] for Best Space Opera Song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/songs/signy-mallory.html |title=The Pegasus Awards - Signy Mallory |publisher=Ohio Valley Filk Fest (ovff.org) |accessdate=May 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Publication information==\n* {{flagicon|United States}}: {{cite book | author=C.J.

The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan and North America in 2011, in [[PAL region]]s by [[Deep Silver]] in 2012, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] by [[Sega]] in 2019.

The gameplay is divided between the daytime, where Vincent interacts with the characters in a [[social simulation game|social simulation]], and his dreams where he must navigate three-dimensional towers through combined platforming and puzzle-solving. The game's ending is affected by choices made by Vincent over the course of the story.\n\n''Catherine'' was developed by the same studio behind the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, including producer and director [[Katsura Hashino]], character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]], and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. The game began production near the end of ''[[Persona 4]]''{{'s}} development in 2008, with the aim being to create something for a more adult audience. The English localization was handled by [[Atlus USA]]. ''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, a then-newly formed division within Atlus led by Hashino. The team aimed to expand upon the original, bringing back the original cast while adding a new love interest named Rin, short for Qatherine.\n\nReception was generally positive, with critics praising its mature subject matter and gameplay, despite some criticism directed towards its difficulty. The game was nominated for several awards, and exceeded Atlus' sales expectations by having sold over one million copies worldwide by 2017.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Catherine game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of the character Vincent navigating through a Nightmare stage]]\n''Catherine'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game in which players control Vincent Brooks, a man who is tormented by deadly nightmares after becoming involved with multiple women.

[[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]-exclusive \"Colosseum\" challenge levels are unlocked after first completing the story.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/><ref name=\"CathModes\"/>\n\nThe daytime gameplay has Vincent interacting with his girlfriends and other characters in the Stray Sheep bar.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/> During dialogue and text segments, Vincent can choose several options to respond; these include standard dialogue options and composing text messages.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"gradar_english\"/> During his time in the Stray Sheep, Vincent can Purchase drinks which help his navigation of Nightmare stages, but also impede his movement if he has too many.<ref name=\"CathDrinks\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}} He can also play a minigame titled \"Rapunzel\" which mimics the gameplay in nightmares, or listen to a jukebox containing tracks from other Atlus games.<ref name=\"Minigames\"/> Leaving the Stray Sheep will trigger the next Nightmare section.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}}\n\nThe main gameplay takes place in the Nightmare stages. Vincent must climb towers made of blocks, which Vincent must arrange into a stairway to reach the exit. As he climbs, the tower collapses beneath him, and if he fails to arrange the blocks before the collapse reaches him, Vincent will fall and the game ends; he either restarts from the last checkpoint on the tower if Vincent has a pillow item, or the player must restart the game from their last save.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=8-9}} Blocks can be freely pushed and pulled, balanced on the edge of a similar block, and form stairways.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=10-11}} In addition to standard blocks, some blocks have additional functions such as springing Vincent higher, and some blocks are lethal traps.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/> Vincent can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies, and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=16}}\n\nCompleting a stage awards a score based on the time completed and items collected. These are posted on online leader boards accessed from the game's start menu.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=6-7}} In addition to the Golden Playhouse mode, Babel Mode features four large stages playable with up to two players, while Colosseum features two players simultaneously playing a stage in order to reach the top first.<ref name=\"CathModes\"/> The game has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player during the course of the narrative.<ref name=\"gradar_english\"/>\n\nAdditional elements were added in ''Full Body''.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/> A new mode features rearranged versions of the game's puzzles, with the original game's arrangement featuring as a separate mode.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> A new online multiplayer mode is also added, where players can enter both a randomised match or a contest with a player of equal rank.<ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> New character Rin can be called to halt the tower's collapse for a short time.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> Players can access a new difficulty level called \"Safety\", which removes all threats and time limit, and allows players to skip puzzles and continue with the story.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\nSet in an unnamed North American city, the plot of ''Catherine'' is presented as a [[story within a story]] on ''Golden Playhouse'', a television program described as \"like a Saturday morning theatre, with a bit of a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' vibe\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/> The Stray Sheep, a bar where the main cast frequently meets, acts as the stage for the game's major events.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/> The game focuses on three main characters:<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/>\n* '''Vincent Brooks''', a 32-year-old systems engineer who acts as the game's protagonist and [[player character]]. Unambitious and lackadaisical, Vincent lives a stereotypical bachelor's life; he avoids the challenges of adulthood, including his uninspiring job, his run-down apartment, and his unwillingness to marry his girlfriend, Katherine.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> Vincent is voiced by [[Koichi Yamadera]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Troy Baker]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Catherine''', a 22-year-old woman. She meets Vincent at the Stray Sheep seemingly by accident, and ends up spending the night with him. This encounter, and Catherine's continued attempts to romance Vincent, become the catalyst for the game's events. Outwardly Catherine is playful, seductive, and free spirited; in reality, she is a [[succubus]] who tempts men for her own ends.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/> Catherine is voiced by [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Katherine McBride''', a 32-year-old woman working as an office manager at a clothing manufacturer. A high school friend of Vincent's, they reconnected five years prior to the game's events and began dating. Katherine wishes to marry Vincent, and is increasingly irritated by his indecisiveness.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"CathKath\"/> Katherine is voiced by [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"CathKath\"/> and [[Michelle Ruff]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Rin''', short for '''Qatherine''', is a character exclusive to ''Full Body''. An amnesiac who plays the piano at the Stray Sheep, Rin becomes a comforting presence during Vincent's journey.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> The character is voiced by [[Aya Hirano]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> and Brianna Knickerbocker in English.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/>\n\nThe supporting cast includes Vincent's regular drinking partners at the Stray Sheep: Orlando Haddick ([[Hiroaki Hirata]]/[[Liam O'Brien]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), an old friend and divorcee who holds cynical views on marriage; Johnny Ariga ([[Takehito Koyasu]]/[[Travis Willingham]])<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/> an idealist searching for a soulmate; and Toby Nebbins ([[Kish\u014d Taniyama]]/[[Yuri Lowenthal]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), Johnny's co-worker who has a crush on [[Erica Anderson (character)|Erica Anderson]], ([[Junko Minagawa]]/[[Erin Fitzgerald]]<ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/><ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>) a waitress at the Stray Sheep.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersFriends\"/> Thomas Mutton ([[Norio Wakamoto]]/[[Kirk Thornton]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), nicknamed \"Boss\", is the owner of the Stray Sheep. The game is narrated by Trisha,{{efn|Known in Japanese as {{nihongo|Rue Ishida|\u77f3\u7530\u2606\u30eb\u30a6|Ishida R\u016b}}}} (Junko Minagawa/Erin Fitzgerald<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/><ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>) who is the host of ''Golden Playhouse'' dubbed the \"Midnight Venus\".<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nVincent Brooks is unwilling to commit to marrying his longtime girlfriend Katherine. One night at the Stray Sheep Bar, a drunken Vincent meets an enigmatic young woman named Catherine; they have a [[one-night stand]] which turns into an affair. Simultaneously, Vincent begins experiencing surreal nightmares where he and other men must ascend a tower while outrunning terrifying demons; if they fail in the dream, they die in real life. The stress of his [[double life]] and the growing intensity of his nightmares eventually compel Vincent to end the affair with Catherine. In a violent confrontation between Vincent, Catherine, and Katherine, Catherine is seemingly killed; however, the incident is revealed to have occurred in the nightmare, from which Vincent and Katherine escape. The next day, Katherine \u2014 who has retained no memory of the nightmare, but having discovered his [[infidelity]] \u2014 breaks off their relationship.<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nVincent realizes he is the only person aware of Catherine's existence, and that all of her messages have vanished from his phone. Vincent confronts Mutton, the proprietor of the Stray Sheep who is the only other person he has witnessed Catherine speaking to. He learns that Mutton is [[Dumuzid the Shepherd]], and that Catherine is a succubus who aided Mutton in his game to kill men who would not commit to marriage and family. Vincent enters the nightmare world one last time, on the condition that he and the other men will be freed if he reaches the top of the tower. Vincent is victorious and defeats Dumuzid, who is revealed to be an associate of [[Astaroth]].<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nIn ''Full Body'', Rin moves in next door to Vincent after taking a job at the Stray Sheep playing piano. Vincent and Rin grow close, with Rin comforting him in his nightmares by playing the piano. During one meeting, Vincent accidentally discovers that Rin is a [[otokonoko|cross-dressing man]], which causes a rift between them following Vincent's shocked reaction. If Vincent chooses to reconnect with Rin, he appears in Vincent's nightmare and is captured by Mutton, with Vincent rescuing him by defeating Astaroth. Alternate endings for Katherine and Catherine are unlocked if Vincent sends them a recording of Rin's piano music.\n\nFrom here, there are several possible endings, depending on the player's actions throughout the game:\n*'''Katherine Ending:''' Vincent meets with Katherine, and asks her to take him back. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she forgives him after Mutton and Vincent's friends reveal his ordeal. In the \"true\" ending, they are married. In the ''Full Body'' ending, Katherine again leaves Vincent, gaining new self-confidence while fondly remembering her time with Vincent.\n*'''Catherine Ending:''' Vincent summons Catherine, and asks to marry her. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she accepts; they live together in [[Hell]] despite the objections of [[Nergal]], the King of Hell and Catherine's father. In the \"true\" ending, Vincent overthrows Nergal, becoming the King of Hell with Catherine as his queen. In the ''Full Body'' version, Catherine transports Vincent back to his high school days and appears as a human, allowing them to fall in love and start a family.\n*'''Freedom Ending:''' Vincent realizes he does not desire marriage. Having won against Mutton, he demands payment from him, which he immediately uses to bet on a wrestling match. In the \"good\" ending, he loses the bet. In the \"true\" ending, he wins and uses the money to fulfill his dream of [[Space tourism|visiting outer space]].\n*'''Rin Ending:''' In the \"bad\" ending, Rin leaves while wishing Vincent the best following Astaroth's defeat. In the \"good\" ending, Rin is revealed to be part of an alien race of \"[[angel]]s\" after his brother challenges Vincent to a final challenge to determine mankind's fate; Vincent wins, and he and Rin become a couple. In the \"true\" ending, Rin performs a piano concert for humans and many alien races, with Vincent as his producer and partner.\n\nIn all of the game's endings, Trisha states in a closing narration that the purpose of Vincent's story, and the player's actions in directing his story, was to determine whether the player desired a life of comfort or a life of excitement. She explains that the tower was a [[Hero's journey|metaphor for the journey to adulthood]], and that \"there is no right way to climb the tower.\"<ref name=\"CathBook\"/> In a secret ending unlocked when the player clears the game's challenge stages, Trisha [[Breaking the fourth wall|speaks directly to the player]] and reveals that she is [[Ishtar]], with Astaroth having been one of her avatars. Tired of Dumuzid's infidelity, the events of ''Catherine'' were a test to find someone worthy of her love. She offers to make the player into a deity so that they can become her consort.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Catherine XBox 360 Japan.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Uncensored Xbox 360 cover art featuring Katherine. The differing covers of the 360 and PS3 versions were intended to catch consumer eyes in stores, and exemplify the contrasting appeal of the two heroines.<ref name=\"CathPackagingJP\"/>]]\n''Catherine'' was developed by the \"2nd Creative Production Department\", a team within [[Atlus]] who had previously handled development for the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, a subseries within the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise.<ref name=\"CatherineDev\"/><ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/> Planning for ''Catherine'' began while the development team were performing final polishing work for ''[[Persona 4]]'' prior to the latter's 2008 release.<ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/><ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> The three key staff members were all veterans of the ''Persona'' series: director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]] had helmed both ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''Persona 4''; art director and character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] had designed characters for both ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4''; and composer [[Shoji Meguro]] had created music for multiple ''Megami Tensei'' titles, including the ''Persona'' series. The chief designer was Kazuhisa Wada, while the chief programmer was Yujiro Kosaka.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/><ref name=\"CathStaffANN\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' was the very first title developed by Atlus for [[High-definition video|high-definition]] (HD) [[video game console]]s, specifically the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) and [[Xbox 360]] (360).<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> Using HD consoles they were able to fully portray the world of ''Catherine''. Despite the shift onto HD consoles making their vision easier to realize, debugging for multiple consoles caused problems that pushed back the planned development schedule.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> In a 2012 statement, an Atlus staff member said that ''Catherine'' was a \"difficult\" game for the company to make.<ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/> The game would later be called a \"test\" for the development of ''[[Persona 5]]''.<ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' was first announced in August 2010, along with its prospective platforms.<ref name=\"CathAnnounced\"/> Upon its announcement, ''Catherine'' proved unexpectedly popular, garnering as much public attention and fan expectation as recent releases in the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Due to the game's content, Atlus found it difficult to gain their wished-for rating from Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] ratings board.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> Beginning from October 2010, Atlus and its then-parent Index Media began an \"aggressive\" advertising campaign to promote the title in Japan.<ref name=\"SilHashino\"/> ''Catherine'' released on February 17, 2011.<ref name=\"CathDateJP\"/> A PS3 demo for the game was released in January, but in early February Atlus pulled the demo, stating that it had achieved the maximum number of planned downloads.<ref name=\"CathJPDemo\"/> Following player complaints about the game's difficulty, Atlus created a patch which added a lower difficulty. The patches for both the PS3 and 360 versions released in March.<ref name=\"CathJPpatchPS3\"/><ref name=\"CathJPpatch360\"/> The PS3 version was released in mainland Asia on July 26, 2011, distributed by Softsource. The 360 version was not released in the region due to unspecified coding issues.<ref name=\"CathAsiaRelease\"/>\n\nDifferent cover artwork was created by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versions\u2014the PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing her behind. Soejima was originally told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally going to be in identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms.<ref name=\"CathPackagingJP\"/> This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risqu\u00e9.<ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' protagonist Vincent made a cameo appearance in ''Persona 3 Portable'', the [[PlayStation Portable]] remake of ''Persona 3''. The port's female protagonist runs into Vincent, who makes reference to the events of ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersonaSil\"/> Vincent was included in ''Persona 3 Portable'' as it was created by the same development team as ''Catherine'', but the version of Vincent in ''Persona 3 Portable'' is not the same as that used in ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersona3\"/> Despite the possibility, staff have discounted either an anime adaptation or further games in the series, the latter due to its challenging production.<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/><ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/>\n\n===Scenario and design===\nThe aim with ''Catherine'' was to create a game that was not within the role-playing genre as with the majority of Atlus' titles, in addition to making something that was aimed at adults. The main aim was to create something new as a change prior to developing a new role-playing game.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> It used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> Hashino had wanted an in-house engine, but the team's lack of experience with HD consoles meant this was impracticable.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> While they had the option of developing the title for [[Handheld game console|handheld consoles]] or [[mobile device]]s, Hashino felt that the game would lose its charm on less powerful hardware.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/>\n\nThe initial story was written by Hashino, who originally worked alone on the scenario before other writers were brought on to help.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The scenario's main writer was Yuichiro Tanaka, previously lead writer for the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathWriter\"/> The setting incorporated both Japanese and American influences.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/> Hashino felt that ''Catherine'' was an ambitious title due to its themes and subject matter, saying that no-one but Atlus would have supported the project. The main theme is love between men and women, although in its infancy the project was themed around conflict. In order to make the love triangle between Vincent, Catherine and Katherine sound realistic, he asked other members of Atlus staff for their experiences. One story, where a woman detailed killing people in her dreams, was almost directly referenced within the game.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Vincent was a very unlikeable character, but based on staff feedback he was adjusted to appear more sympathetic. As the initial premise could not be changed, the team instead added Mutton's plot and worked to make Vincent a more sympathetic character within this framework.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/>\n\nSoejima, who had mainly worked on the ''Persona'' series up to this point, was most focused on making the characters' expressions seem realistic within the context of the story.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> All the characters were designed around being realistic, with their proportions being more akin to real people rather than stylized figures.<ref name=\"CathSoejima1\"/><ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> According to him, he was influenced by the game's themes of instinctual desire intruding into everyday life, the desire for sleep, and the concept of greed. Vincent exemplified these themes.<ref name=\"CathSoejima2\"/> Vincent's character was based on and named after [[Vincent Gallo]], specifically his appearance in the 1998 film ''[[Buffalo '66]]''. The younger \"Catherine\" was designed to be beautiful and youthful when compared to \"Katherine\", who had an adult charm.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The pink coloring of the game's [[user interface]] was intended to evoke its sensual and \"kitschy\" atmosphere.<ref name=\"CathUI\"/> The cutscenes were created by anime production studio [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].<ref name=\"CathStaffANN\"/> While the ''Persona'' games up to that point boasted around half an hour of cutscenes, the number in ''Catherine'' came to considerably more. Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C spent around a year working on the anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/>\n\n===Localization===\n''Catherine'' was initially not planned for a Western release.<ref name=\"CathJPexclusive\"/> After an initial leak through listings on [[EB Games]] and [[Gamestop]], [[Atlus USA]] confirmed that ''Catherine'' would be released in North America.<ref name=\"SilCathUSannounced\"/> The game was localized for the West by Atlus USA, who had previously handled many of the company's earlier titles.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> Main localization staff included editors Mike Meeker and Clayton S. Chan; and [[quality assurance]] staff Scott Williams, Jonathon Reinhold, Kourtnie McKenzie, Allie Doyon and Charles Chaikaew.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/> Compared to previous Atlus titles, which had focused on Japanese culture, Atlus USA had comparatively little work adjusting things for a Western audience as the game was set within a North American city environment. Their main issue was with the dialogue, which was meant to be naturalistic despite some tongue-in-cheek dialogue, alongside jokes and references that needed adjusting so they would make sense to a Western audience. According to the localizers, the problem \"[wasn't] translating the definition, it's translating the intent\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/>\n\nA major issue the team faced was with the quotes used in loading screens. While they were apparently all famous quotes, they had been taken from a Japanese book of quotes without any authors being mentioned, in addition to their translation into Japanese sometimes being poor. In the event, Atlus USA went with new quotes to put in their place rather than trying to identify and translate the existing quotes. The quotes used were from multiple sources, including [[Douglas Adams]], [[George Carlin]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. According to Chan, the main advantage of ''Catherine'' compared to other projects was that the situations and characters were ones he and other team members could understand rather than typical fantasy scenarios.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nAtlus USA initially had difficulty persuading mainstream stores like [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Walmart]] to take ''Catherine'' due to its suggestive cover art and marketing calling it an \"adult\" title, which was mostly associated with erotic games not sold in such stores. To convince them that the game was suitable for mainstream stores, Atlus USA put together a film reel of clips from unspecified [[AAA (video game industry)|triple-A]] games those stores did sell that featured more explicit content than ''Catherine''. When they met the retailer representatives, they showcased the film and pointed out that ''Catherine'' had none of that content, before showing off the most explicit scenes in the game to prove their point. The retailers were convinced and allowed ''Catherine'' to be sold in mainstream stores, while also looking through their stocks after seeing the content of currently-stocked titles.<ref name=\"CathWestStores\"/> As with the Japanese version, Atlus used alternate covers for the 360 and PS3 versions, and alternate versions of those covers toning down the suggestive elements for stores catering to more sensitive consumers.<ref name=\"SilCathCoversWest\"/> ''Catherine'' released in North America on July 26, 2011.<ref name=\"CathUSDate\"/> In addition to the standard edition, a special limited \"Love is Dead\" edition was created for both PS3 and 360.<ref name=\"CathNAcollectors\"/>\n\nThough initial statements from Atlus said that ''Catherine'' would not be released in Europe,<ref name=\"CathEUdetails\"/> its release in the region was leaked through a rating for the 360 version in Germany.<ref name=\"CathEUleak\"/> Its official release was confirmed in a press release from Atlus shortly after the leak. The title was published by [[Deep Silver]] across all PAL territories, and featured written language support for English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. Deep Silver was chosen as the publisher as they shared Atlus' enthusiasm about the game.<ref name=\"CathEUannounced\"/> ''Catherine'' released in Europe on February 10, 2012.<ref name=\"CathEUdate\"/> As with North America, the PS3 and 360 versions had a limited special edition. Called the \"Stray Sheep Edition\" after a central location in the game, it had differing content to the North American edition.<ref name=\"CathEUcollectors\"/> In Australia, the title was distributed by QV Software.<ref name=\"CathAUqv\"/> The PS3 version released on February 16,<ref name=\"QVcathPS3\"/> while the 360 version released on February 23.<ref name=\"QVcath360\"/>  A [[Microsoft Windows]] version, titled ''Catherine Classic'', was published worldwide by [[Sega]] on January 10, 2019 through [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"CatherinePCdate\"/> This port was the first modern Atlus title ported to the platform, as the company were previously averse to it. The port included expanded graphics options, controller customization, and the English and Japanese voice tracks.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/>\n\nSince release, ''Catherine'' has occasionally been played competitively in [[esport]] tournaments. The game's professional scene began when [[Fighting game community|FGC]] member David \"Dacidbro\" Broweleit desired to learn the insides of the game's engine.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/> The first notable tournament was an event called Super NorCal Install, which took place in 2012. The tournament would become the basis for the game's competitive scene.<ref name=\"RBComp\"/> Publisher [[Atlus]] would later officially sponsor the game as a side event at [[Evo 2015]], while streaming it on their [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] account.<ref name=\"PolyEsports\"/> The attention surrounding the event would later carry on into [[Evo 2016]], [[Community Effort Orlando|CEOtaku 2016]], [[Genesis (tournament)|Genesis 4]], as well as a dedicated event in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] called ''The King of Catherine'', which had awarded a {{USD}}5,000 prize pool to winners.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/><ref name=\"CathGenesis\"/><ref name=\"CathKing\"/> Speaking later, the developers said they were surprised with how popular the game became in the international esports scene.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\n====Voice cast====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| footer    = [[Troy Baker]] (left) and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] (right) were the respective English voices for Vincent and Catherine. Describing the localization as a positive experience, they were free to adlib with their respective characters.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/>\n| image1    = Troy Baker SDCC 2019 (48378614692) (cropped).jpg\n| width1    = 130\n| alt1      = \n| image2    = Laura Bailey SDCC 2019 (48378674272) (vertical cropped).jpg\n| width2    = 160\n| alt2      = \n}}\nValerie Arem of PCB Productions was the voice director for dubbing.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as a positive experience, reinforced by the fact that they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/> Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nBaker, Bailey and Ruff had all previously worked with Atlus on the ''Persona'' series: Ruff voiced Yukari Takeba in ''Persona 3'' while Baker and Bailey respectively voiced [[Kanji Tatsumi]] and Rise Kujikawa from ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/><ref name=\"BaileyRise\"/> In an interview, Baker described the Atlus USA staff as giving him and the other English actors a great deal of freedom when it came to delivering lines and portraying their characters. He noted that the themes in ''Catherine'' were far more controversial compared to earlier titles he and Atlus had worked on, and that it was a unique voice acting opportunity.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Bailey was working on another Atlus project when she was offered the opportunity to voice Catherine. Having already heard of the project in the press, Bailey accepted the offer; during her time recording lines, she found the experience strange as she considered Baker to be a brotherly figure, starkly contrasting the relationship between Vincent and Catherine.<ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/>\n\nRuff was offered the role of Katherine based on her acting abilities and her previous work with Atlus. She saw some footage of Katherine to get a feeling for her relationship with Vincent, but did not try to sync her performance with the Japanese. This was partly because of the planned English sync adjustments, and partly because she heard Japanese voice recording and cutscene finalization was still in progress.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> This was confirmed by Arem in a separate interview. Arem described each main actor's strengths during recording: Baker had good timing when it came to delivering his lines, Bailey required few retakes, while Ruff was able to realistically convey a variety of emotions. She also noted the work done by Fitzgerald, the voice actress for both Trisha and Erica; Fitzgerald had difficulty with the timing for Trisha's lines, but managed to \"pull it off\".<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> The amount of voice acting involved was so large that the actors felt they could not finish it.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Looking back on the production, Arem said she would not recast any of the characters.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n\n===''Catherine: Full Body''===\n\n''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, an internal team founded by Hashino after the release of ''[[Persona 5]]'' with multiple ''Persona'' staff. Hashino envisioned the game as the definitive version of ''Catherine'', the aim being to present the team's mission to create new and innovative gaming experiences by returning to one of their more unconventional titles.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino and Soejima returned as producer and character designer respectively. The director was Kenichi Goto, who worked as battle planner for the [[PlayStation 2]] ''Devil Summoner'' games and ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C returned to produce twenty more anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The game was ported directly into the in-house ''Persona 5'' engine.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The gameplay was tweaked based on fan feedback, and easier difficulty was added so players could enjoy the story.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> The game includes [[downloadable content]] (DLC) that features ''Persona 5'' protagonist [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] as a playable guest character.<ref name=\"FullDLCjoker\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Winslow |first1=Jeremy |title=E3 2019: Persona 5 Characters Join Catherine: Full Body |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616084416/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe keyword for the project was \"diversity\", expressed in both the narrative and the unconventional gameplay compared to other titles on the market.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Rin was included in ''Full Body'' as part of Hashino's wish to update the game's sensibilities and subject matter based on current trends.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> When asked to create a third \"Catherine\", Soejima was initially unsure how to proceed. As he designed Catherine and Katherine as \"hot\" and \"cool\" respectively, he chose a \"cute\" design for Rin.<ref name=\"SilSoejima\"/> Soejima designed Rin around a lack of aggression, from the character's expression and coloring reflecting this.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino also asked Soejima to redesign Trisha's hairstyle, which was changed into twin bun-style afros on either side of her head.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was released in Japan on February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateJP\"/> A notable addition to the Japanese version was a choice of eleven different voice actresses for Catherine, nine of which were DLC. All the actresses had previously played adulterous characters.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The voices available in the base game were the original voice Sawashiro and [[Mamiko Noto]]. The Japanese DLC actresses were [[Ami Koshimizu]], [[Aoi Y\u016bki]], [[Yui Horie]], [[Kana Asumi]], [[Haruka Tomatsu]], [[Megumi Toyoguchi]], [[Rie Kugimiya]], [[Rina Sat\u014d]], and [[Nana Mizuki]].<ref name=\"FullVoices\"/> Each actress portrayed Catherine in a different way, with Noto's version being described as a \"[[yandere]] lady\".<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/>\n\nThe original English voice cast reprised their roles for new dialogue, with Brianna Knickerbocker voicing the character of Rin.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/> The localization team had to translate roughly 165,000 Japanese characters and over 6,000 new lines of spoken dialogue. As the original script altered several established lines, the team constantly referenced the Japanese script and worked hard to smoothly incorporate new and original text.  While the team could have recast due to the lapse of time between the original and ''Full Body'', the team wanted to \"preserve the integrity\" of ''Full Body'' and so brought back the entire main cast and most of the supporting cast. There were problems with how some voices had aged over the past eight years, and due to concerns over Baker's voice the team opted not to re-record a scene where Vincent screamed for 20 seconds.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|title=Bringing Catherine: Full Body to Life in English|last=Stebel|first=Jonathon|website=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=September 4, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906041523/https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|archivedate=September 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A notable adjustment for the Western release of ''Full Body'' was the crediting and dialogue for the transgender character Erica. She was originally referred to in the English credits using her birth name with her chosen name in parentheses. The Japanese version of ''Full Body'' retained this, but Atlus changed it for the Western release to use Erica's chosen name. This is notable because the game appeared in the news following public debate over whether the original credits were [[transphobic]].<ref name=\"ANNfullbody\"/> Some dialogue within the game related to Erica was also changed for similar reasons.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The PS4 version was released by Atlus in North America and Europe on September 3, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateWW\"/> For the European version, the localizers had the extra task of translating the text into French, Spanish, Italian and German.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\"/> The lack of an English localization for the Vita version was attributed to the console's discontinuation outside of Japan that year.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/> A [[Nintendo Switch]] version was annouced during a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2020, and will be released on July 7, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minotti |first1=Mike |title=Catherine: Full Body is coming to Switch on July 7 |url=https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/26/catherine-full-body-is-coming-to-switch-on-july-7/ |website=Venture Beat |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nMeguro began working on the first demo tracks for the game in August 2009. Meguro worked as the main composer, leading a team composed of himself, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Toshiki Konishi. Kitajoh was the general coordinator and managed sound effects for the action scenes.<ref name=\"MeguroCathLiners\"/> Meguro did not have much freedom with the project, as Hashino was specific about What he wanted the music to be like, giving him the key words of \"classic\", \"adult oriented\" and \"erotic\".<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> The music team used multiple genres for the music in ''Catherine'', switching genre depending on the flow of gameplay; action segments used remixes of [[classical music]], quiet moments used [[jazz]], and the animated cutscenes used symphonic-based music.<ref name=\"CathShoji2\"/> As the animated cutscenes were produced by an external company, Meguro found creating music for them difficult when compared to previous projects of his, as he had to sync the music to something he had no creative input with.<ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Meguro was highly impressed by both the sound quality compared to his previous work, and the amount of control he had to adjust the relative volume of music and sound effects.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Rapper L-VOKAL contributed to the score.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/>\n\nFor ''Full Body'', in addition to Meguro's original work on the score, music company Inspion Izene was brought on to both arrange and add to the soundtrack. The company had previously helped with the original game's sound design, and were brought in to help distinguish the game's sound from that of the ''Persona'' series and its parent ''Megami Tensei''.<ref name=\"SoundInterview\"/> L-VOKAL returned to help remix tracks.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/> Inspion Izene composed seventeen new tracks for the game.<ref name=\"SoundInterview\"/> The theme song for the game is \"Re:set\" by [[Sekai no Owari]].<ref name=\"FullTheme\"/> The theme was performed by Chinese singer Satsuki; the team wanted a voice that would stand out, so they sought out a foreign singer who could speak Japanese.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|MC = (X360) 82/100<ref name=\"mc_360\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/catherine |title=Catherine for Xbox 360 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820145250/http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/catherine |archivedate=August 20, 2012 |df= }}</ref><br />(PS3) 79/100<ref name=\"mc_ps3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/catherine |title=Catherine for PlayStation 3 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819220835/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/catherine |archivedate=August 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><br />(PC) 80/100<ref name=\"mc_pc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/catherine-classic |title=Catherine Classic for PC Reviews - Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=January 10, 2019 |accessdate=April 29, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319144909/https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/catherine-classic |archive-date=March 19, 2019 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n<!-- Reviewers -->\n|CVG = 8/10<ref name=\"GAVG\"/>\n|GRadar = 8/10<ref name=\"gradar_english\"/>\n|GSpot = 8.5/10<ref name=\"gspot_catherine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/catherine/review.html |title=Catherine Review, Catherine Xbox 360 Review |publisher=GameSpot.com |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820042942/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/catherine/review.html |archivedate=August 20, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n|GT = 7.8/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/game/catherine/13734 |title=Catherine Video Game &#124;

Considering both appear as horrifying boss battles, they can easily be any man's worst nightmare.\"<ref name=\"GIlist\"/> In 2014, [[David Auerbach]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' claimed ''Catherine'' to be sexist, writing that its treatment of relationships and sex exemplified a misogynous tendency in [[video game culture]] that became a topic of media discussion over the next several years. Among other complaints, Auerbach claimed that the game is \"a bellwether for what tech culture and gaming have come to mean for a lot of men: a safe playspace from the realities that they believe women force on them.\"<ref name=\"ShaftFeminism\"/>\n\n[[Emily Short]], a game writer and designer, wrote that she found the game's characters generally unsympathetic for a variety of reasons. She was also annoyed by its approach to gender roles due to its negative message about women in relationships and lack of non-standard relationship types, describing the narrative as \"both misogynist and misandrist\" despite late-game attempts to recognise the complexity of gender relations.<ref name=\"GamaAnalysis\"/> In a 2011 feature on faith in video game narratives, ''GameSpot'' said that the game succeeded in \"personalizing the emotional weight of everyday sin\" without carrying an overtly Christian message.<ref name=\"GSanalysis\"/>\n\n===Sales===\nThe PlayStation 3 version topped the Japanese charts in its opening week with over 140,000 copies sold while the Xbox 360 version came in 7th with over 21,000, and was able to outsell ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', which was released on the same day, by a margin of two-to-one.<ref name=\"CathSales1\"/> The game has also been commercially successful in America, selling 78,000 copies across both systems to consumers in its first six days, making it Atlus' biggest launch yet for a game.<ref name=\"CathSales2\"/> The game had sold around 500,000 copies by the end of 2011, being a huge success for the company;<ref name=\"CathSales3\"/> 260,000 copies were sold in Japan and 230,000 in North America.<ref name=\"CathSales4\"/> By 2017, the original game had shipped one million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> The PC port of the original game was among the best-selling new releases of the month on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://store.steampowered.com/sale/2019_top_new |title=Best of 2019: New Releases |website=[[Steam (service)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |access-date=2019-12-28 |archive-url=http://archive.today/2019.12.28-165246/https://store.steampowered.com/sale/2019_top_new |archive-date=2019-12-28 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Based on total revenue for the first two weeks on sale.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1708485146980406784 |title=A Look Back - The Best of 2019 |date=2019-12-26 |website=[[Steam (service)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |access-date=2019-12-28 |archive-url=http://archive.today/2019.12.28-165922/https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1708485146980406784 |archive-date=2019-12-28 |url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nUpon its Japanese debut, the PS4 version of ''Full Body'' reached second place in the sales charts with sales of nearly 52,000 units.

The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in Japan and North America in 2011, in [[PAL region]]s by [[Deep Silver]] in 2012, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] by [[Sega]] in 2019. A re-release with additional content, titled '''''Catherine: Full Body''''',{{efn|{{nihongo||\u30ad\u30e3\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3\u30fb\u30d5\u30eb\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3|Kyasarin: Furu Bodi}}}} was released in 2019 for the [[PlayStation 4]] worldwide and for the [[PlayStation Vita]] only in Japan, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version scheduled to be released worldwide in 2020.\n\nThe story follows Vincent Brooks, a man who is beset by supernatural nightmares while torn between his feelings for longtime girlfriend Katherine and the similarly-named beauty Catherine. The gameplay is divided between the daytime, where Vincent interacts with the characters in a [[social simulation game|social simulation]], and his dreams where he must navigate three-dimensional towers through combined platforming and puzzle-solving. The game's ending is affected by choices made by Vincent over the course of the story.\n\n''Catherine'' was developed by the same studio behind the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, including producer and director [[Katsura Hashino]], character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]], and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. The game began production near the end of ''[[Persona 4]]''{{'s}} development in 2008, with the aim being to create something for a more adult audience. The English localization was handled by [[Atlus USA]]. ''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, a then-newly formed division within Atlus led by Hashino. The team aimed to expand upon the original, bringing back the original cast while adding a new love interest named Rin, short for Qatherine.\n\nReception was generally positive, with critics praising its mature subject matter and gameplay, despite some criticism directed towards its difficulty. The game was nominated for several awards, and exceeded Atlus' sales expectations by having sold over one million copies worldwide by 2017.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Catherine game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of the character Vincent navigating through a Nightmare stage]]\n''Catherine'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game in which players control Vincent Brooks, a man who is tormented by deadly nightmares after becoming involved with multiple women. The gameplay is divided into two parts; daytime [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] segments where Vincent interacts with various characters at the Stray Sheep bar, and nightmare segments where he navigates deadly block towers using a combination of [[Platform game|platforming]] and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]].<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/> The game is split into three modes; the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story campaign dubbed \"Golden Playhouse\", and \"Babel\". [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]-exclusive \"Colosseum\" challenge levels are unlocked after first completing the story.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/><ref name=\"CathModes\"/>\n\nThe daytime gameplay has Vincent interacting with his girlfriends and other characters in the Stray Sheep bar.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/> During dialogue and text segments, Vincent can choose several options to respond; these include standard dialogue options and composing text messages.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"gradar_english\"/> During his time in the Stray Sheep, Vincent can Purchase drinks which help his navigation of Nightmare stages, but also impede his movement if he has too many.<ref name=\"CathDrinks\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}} He can also play a minigame titled \"Rapunzel\" which mimics the gameplay in nightmares, or listen to a jukebox containing tracks from other Atlus games.<ref name=\"Minigames\"/> Leaving the Stray Sheep will trigger the next Nightmare section.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=18-20}}\n\nThe main gameplay takes place in the Nightmare stages. Vincent must climb towers made of blocks, which Vincent must arrange into a stairway to reach the exit. As he climbs, the tower collapses beneath him, and if he fails to arrange the blocks before the collapse reaches him, Vincent will fall and the game ends; he either restarts from the last checkpoint on the tower if Vincent has a pillow item, or the player must restart the game from their last save.<ref name=\"CathIGNpreview\"/><ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/>{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=8-9}} Blocks can be freely pushed and pulled, balanced on the edge of a similar block, and form stairways.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=10-11}} In addition to standard blocks, some blocks have additional functions such as springing Vincent higher, and some blocks are lethal traps.<ref name=\"CathGSpotPreview\"/> Vincent can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies, and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=16}}\n\nCompleting a stage awards a score based on the time completed and items collected. These are posted on online leader boards accessed from the game's start menu.{{sfn|Atlus|2011|p=6-7}} In addition to the Golden Playhouse mode, Babel Mode features four large stages playable with up to two players, while Colosseum features two players simultaneously playing a stage in order to reach the top first.<ref name=\"CathModes\"/> The game has multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player during the course of the narrative.<ref name=\"gradar_english\"/>\n\nAdditional elements were added in ''Full Body''.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/> A new mode features rearranged versions of the game's puzzles, with the original game's arrangement featuring as a separate mode.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> A new online multiplayer mode is also added, where players can enter both a randomised match or a contest with a player of equal rank.<ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> New character Rin can be called to halt the tower's collapse for a short time.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> Players can access a new difficulty level called \"Safety\", which removes all threats and time limit, and allows players to skip puzzles and continue with the story.<ref name=\"DengFullInfo\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\nSet in an unnamed North American city, the plot of ''Catherine'' is presented as a [[story within a story]] on ''Golden Playhouse'', a television program described as \"like a Saturday morning theatre, with a bit of a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' vibe\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/> The Stray Sheep, a bar where the main cast frequently meets, acts as the stage for the game's major events.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/> The game focuses on three main characters:<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/>\n* '''Vincent Brooks''', a 32-year-old systems engineer who acts as the game's protagonist and [[player character]]. Unambitious and lackadaisical, Vincent lives a stereotypical bachelor's life; he avoids the challenges of adulthood, including his uninspiring job, his run-down apartment, and his unwillingness to marry his girlfriend, Katherine.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> Vincent is voiced by [[Koichi Yamadera]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Troy Baker]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Catherine''', a 22-year-old woman. She meets Vincent at the Stray Sheep seemingly by accident, and ends up spending the night with him. This encounter, and Catherine's continued attempts to romance Vincent, become the catalyst for the game's events. Outwardly Catherine is playful, seductive, and free spirited; in reality, she is a [[succubus]] who tempts men for her own ends.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/> Catherine is voiced by [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Katherine McBride''', a 32-year-old woman working as an office manager at a clothing manufacturer. A high school friend of Vincent's, they reconnected five years prior to the game's events and began dating. Katherine wishes to marry Vincent, and is increasingly irritated by his indecisiveness.<ref name=\"CathGemProfiles\"/><ref name=\"CathKath\"/> Katherine is voiced by [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"CathKath\"/> and [[Michelle Ruff]] in English.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n* '''Rin''', short for '''Qatherine''', is a character exclusive to ''Full Body''. An amnesiac who plays the piano at the Stray Sheep, Rin becomes a comforting presence during Vincent's journey.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"CathFullInfo\"/> The character is voiced by [[Aya Hirano]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> and Brianna Knickerbocker in English.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/>\n\nThe supporting cast includes Vincent's regular drinking partners at the Stray Sheep: Orlando Haddick ([[Hiroaki Hirata]]/[[Liam O'Brien]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), an old friend and divorcee who holds cynical views on marriage; Johnny Ariga ([[Takehito Koyasu]]/[[Travis Willingham]])<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/> an idealist searching for a soulmate; and Toby Nebbins ([[Kish\u014d Taniyama]]/[[Yuri Lowenthal]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), Johnny's co-worker who has a crush on [[Erica Anderson (character)|Erica Anderson]], ([[Junko Minagawa]]/[[Erin Fitzgerald]]<ref name=\"CathCharactersStray\"/><ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>) a waitress at the Stray Sheep.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathCharactersFriends\"/> Thomas Mutton ([[Norio Wakamoto]]/[[Kirk Thornton]]<ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>), nicknamed \"Boss\", is the owner of the Stray Sheep. The game is narrated by Trisha,{{efn|Known in Japanese as {{nihongo|Rue Ishida|\u77f3\u7530\u2606\u30eb\u30a6|Ishida R\u016b}}}} (Junko Minagawa/Erin Fitzgerald<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/><ref name=\"CathBtVA\"/>) who is the host of ''Golden Playhouse'' dubbed the \"Midnight Venus\".<ref name=\"CathBook\"/><ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nVincent Brooks is unwilling to commit to marrying his longtime girlfriend Katherine. One night at the Stray Sheep Bar, a drunken Vincent meets an enigmatic young woman named Catherine; they have a [[one-night stand]] which turns into an affair. Simultaneously, Vincent begins experiencing surreal nightmares where he and other men must ascend a tower while outrunning terrifying demons; if they fail in the dream, they die in real life. The stress of his [[double life]] and the growing intensity of his nightmares eventually compel Vincent to end the affair with Catherine. In a violent confrontation between Vincent, Catherine, and Katherine, Catherine is seemingly killed; however, the incident is revealed to have occurred in the nightmare, from which Vincent and Katherine escape. The next day, Katherine \u2014 who has retained no memory of the nightmare, but having discovered his [[infidelity]] \u2014 breaks off their relationship.<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nVincent realizes he is the only person aware of Catherine's existence, and that all of her messages have vanished from his phone. Vincent confronts Mutton, the proprietor of the Stray Sheep who is the only other person he has witnessed Catherine speaking to. He learns that Mutton is [[Dumuzid the Shepherd]], and that Catherine is a succubus who aided Mutton in his game to kill men who would not commit to marriage and family. Vincent enters the nightmare world one last time, on the condition that he and the other men will be freed if he reaches the top of the tower. Vincent is victorious and defeats Dumuzid, who is revealed to be an associate of [[Astaroth]].<ref name=\"CathRef\"/>\n\nIn ''Full Body'', Rin moves in next door to Vincent after taking a job at the Stray Sheep playing piano. Vincent and Rin grow close, with Rin comforting him in his nightmares by playing the piano. During one meeting, Vincent accidentally discovers that Rin is a [[otokonoko|cross-dressing man]], which causes a rift between them following Vincent's shocked reaction. If Vincent chooses to reconnect with Rin, he appears in Vincent's nightmare and is captured by Mutton, with Vincent rescuing him by defeating Astaroth. Alternate endings for Katherine and Catherine are unlocked if Vincent sends them a recording of Rin's piano music.\n\nFrom here, there are several possible endings, depending on the player's actions throughout the game:\n*'''Katherine Ending:''' Vincent meets with Katherine, and asks her to take him back. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she forgives him after Mutton and Vincent's friends reveal his ordeal. In the \"true\" ending, they are married. In the ''Full Body'' ending, Katherine again leaves Vincent, gaining new self-confidence while fondly remembering her time with Vincent.\n*'''Catherine Ending:''' Vincent summons Catherine, and asks to marry her. In the \"bad\" ending, she refuses. In the \"good\" ending, she accepts; they live together in [[Hell]] despite the objections of [[Nergal]], the King of Hell and Catherine's father. In the \"true\" ending, Vincent overthrows Nergal, becoming the King of Hell with Catherine as his queen. In the ''Full Body'' version, Catherine transports Vincent back to his high school days and appears as a human, allowing them to fall in love and start a family.\n*'''Freedom Ending:''' Vincent realizes he does not desire marriage. Having won against Mutton, he demands payment from him, which he immediately uses to bet on a wrestling match. In the \"good\" ending, he loses the bet. In the \"true\" ending, he wins and uses the money to fulfill his dream of [[Space tourism|visiting outer space]].\n*'''Rin Ending:''' In the \"bad\" ending, Rin leaves while wishing Vincent the best following Astaroth's defeat. In the \"good\" ending, Rin is revealed to be part of an alien race of \"[[angel]]s\" after his brother challenges Vincent to a final challenge to determine mankind's fate; Vincent wins, and he and Rin become a couple. In the \"true\" ending, Rin performs a piano concert for humans and many alien races, with Vincent as his producer and partner.\n\nIn all of the game's endings, Trisha states in a closing narration that the purpose of Vincent's story, and the player's actions in directing his story, was to determine whether the player desired a life of comfort or a life of excitement. She explains that the tower was a [[Hero's journey|metaphor for the journey to adulthood]], and that \"there is no right way to climb the tower.\"<ref name=\"CathBook\"/> In a secret ending unlocked when the player clears the game's challenge stages, Trisha [[Breaking the fourth wall|speaks directly to the player]] and reveals that she is [[Ishtar]], with Astaroth having been one of her avatars. Tired of Dumuzid's infidelity, the events of ''Catherine'' were a test to find someone worthy of her love. She offers to make the player into a deity so that they can become her consort.<ref name=\"CathBook\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Catherine XBox 360 Japan.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Uncensored Xbox 360 cover art featuring Katherine.

Despite the shift onto HD consoles making their vision easier to realize, debugging for multiple consoles caused problems that pushed back the planned development schedule.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> In a 2012 statement, an Atlus staff member said that ''Catherine'' was a \"difficult\" game for the company to make.<ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/> The game would later be called a \"test\" for the development of ''[[Persona 5]]''.<ref name=\"4Gcatherine\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' was first announced in August 2010, along with its prospective platforms.<ref name=\"CathAnnounced\"/> Upon its announcement, ''Catherine'' proved unexpectedly popular, garnering as much public attention and fan expectation as recent releases in the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Due to the game's content, Atlus found it difficult to gain their wished-for rating from Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] ratings board.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/> Beginning from October 2010, Atlus and its then-parent Index Media began an \"aggressive\" advertising campaign to promote the title in Japan.<ref name=\"SilHashino\"/> ''Catherine'' released on February 17, 2011.<ref name=\"CathDateJP\"/> A PS3 demo for the game was released in January, but in early February Atlus pulled the demo, stating that it had achieved the maximum number of planned downloads.<ref name=\"CathJPDemo\"/> Following player complaints about the game's difficulty, Atlus created a patch which added a lower difficulty. The patches for both the PS3 and 360 versions released in March.<ref name=\"CathJPpatchPS3\"/><ref name=\"CathJPpatch360\"/> The PS3 version was released in mainland Asia on July 26, 2011, distributed by Softsource. The 360 version was not released in the region due to unspecified coding issues.<ref name=\"CathAsiaRelease\"/>\n\nDifferent cover artwork was created by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versions\u2014the PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing her behind. Soejima was originally told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally going to be in identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms.<ref name=\"CathPackagingJP\"/> This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risqu\u00e9.<ref name=\"CathJPPoster\"/>\n\n''Catherine'' protagonist Vincent made a cameo appearance in ''Persona 3 Portable'', the [[PlayStation Portable]] remake of ''Persona 3''. The port's female protagonist runs into Vincent, who makes reference to the events of ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersonaSil\"/> Vincent was included in ''Persona 3 Portable'' as it was created by the same development team as ''Catherine'', but the version of Vincent in ''Persona 3 Portable'' is not the same as that used in ''Catherine''.<ref name=\"CathPersona3\"/> Despite the possibility, staff have discounted either an anime adaptation or further games in the series, the latter due to its challenging production.<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/><ref name=\"CathNaoki\"/>\n\n===Scenario and design===\nThe aim with ''Catherine'' was to create a game that was not within the role-playing genre as with the majority of Atlus' titles, in addition to making something that was aimed at adults. The main aim was to create something new as a change prior to developing a new role-playing game.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> It used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> Hashino had wanted an in-house engine, but the team's lack of experience with HD consoles meant this was impracticable.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> While they had the option of developing the title for [[Handheld game console|handheld consoles]] or [[mobile device]]s, Hashino felt that the game would lose its charm on less powerful hardware.<ref name=\"FamCathOrigins\"/>\n\nThe initial story was written by Hashino, who originally worked alone on the scenario before other writers were brought on to help.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The scenario's main writer was Yuichiro Tanaka, previously lead writer for the ''Persona'' series.<ref name=\"CathWriter\"/> The setting incorporated both Japanese and American influences.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/> Hashino felt that ''Catherine'' was an ambitious title due to its themes and subject matter, saying that no-one but Atlus would have supported the project. The main theme is love between men and women, although in its infancy the project was themed around conflict. In order to make the love triangle between Vincent, Catherine and Katherine sound realistic, he asked other members of Atlus staff for their experiences. One story, where a woman detailed killing people in her dreams, was almost directly referenced within the game.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> Vincent was a very unlikeable character, but based on staff feedback he was adjusted to appear more sympathetic. As the initial premise could not be changed, the team instead added Mutton's plot and worked to make Vincent a more sympathetic character within this framework.<ref name=\"CathVenusInterview\"/>\n\nSoejima, who had mainly worked on the ''Persona'' series up to this point, was most focused on making the characters' expressions seem realistic within the context of the story.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> All the characters were designed around being realistic, with their proportions being more akin to real people rather than stylized figures.<ref name=\"CathSoejima1\"/><ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> According to him, he was influenced by the game's themes of instinctual desire intruding into everyday life, the desire for sleep, and the concept of greed. Vincent exemplified these themes.<ref name=\"CathSoejima2\"/> Vincent's character was based on and named after [[Vincent Gallo]], specifically his appearance in the 1998 film ''[[Buffalo '66]]''. The younger \"Catherine\" was designed to be beautiful and youthful when compared to \"Katherine\", who had an adult charm.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/> The pink coloring of the game's [[user interface]] was intended to evoke its sensual and \"kitschy\" atmosphere.<ref name=\"CathUI\"/> The cutscenes were created by anime production studio [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].<ref name=\"CathStaffANN\"/> While the ''Persona'' games up to that point boasted around half an hour of cutscenes, the number in ''Catherine'' came to considerably more. Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C spent around a year working on the anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"CathInfoDeng\"/>\n\n===Localization===\n''Catherine'' was initially not planned for a Western release.<ref name=\"CathJPexclusive\"/> After an initial leak through listings on [[EB Games]] and [[Gamestop]], [[Atlus USA]] confirmed that ''Catherine'' would be released in North America.<ref name=\"SilCathUSannounced\"/> The game was localized for the West by Atlus USA, who had previously handled many of the company's earlier titles.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> Main localization staff included editors Mike Meeker and Clayton S. Chan; and [[quality assurance]] staff Scott Williams, Jonathon Reinhold, Kourtnie McKenzie, Allie Doyon and Charles Chaikaew.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/> Compared to previous Atlus titles, which had focused on Japanese culture, Atlus USA had comparatively little work adjusting things for a Western audience as the game was set within a North American city environment. Their main issue was with the dialogue, which was meant to be naturalistic despite some tongue-in-cheek dialogue, alongside jokes and references that needed adjusting so they would make sense to a Western audience. According to the localizers, the problem \"[wasn't] translating the definition, it's translating the intent\".<ref name=\"PSBlogCath\"/>\n\nA major issue the team faced was with the quotes used in loading screens. While they were apparently all famous quotes, they had been taken from a Japanese book of quotes without any authors being mentioned, in addition to their translation into Japanese sometimes being poor. In the event, Atlus USA went with new quotes to put in their place rather than trying to identify and translate the existing quotes. The quotes used were from multiple sources, including [[Douglas Adams]], [[George Carlin]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. According to Chan, the main advantage of ''Catherine'' compared to other projects was that the situations and characters were ones he and other team members could understand rather than typical fantasy scenarios.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nAtlus USA initially had difficulty persuading mainstream stores like [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Walmart]] to take ''Catherine'' due to its suggestive cover art and marketing calling it an \"adult\" title, which was mostly associated with erotic games not sold in such stores. To convince them that the game was suitable for mainstream stores, Atlus USA put together a film reel of clips from unspecified [[AAA (video game industry)|triple-A]] games those stores did sell that featured more explicit content than ''Catherine''. When they met the retailer representatives, they showcased the film and pointed out that ''Catherine'' had none of that content, before showing off the most explicit scenes in the game to prove their point. The retailers were convinced and allowed ''Catherine'' to be sold in mainstream stores, while also looking through their stocks after seeing the content of currently-stocked titles.<ref name=\"CathWestStores\"/> As with the Japanese version, Atlus used alternate covers for the 360 and PS3 versions, and alternate versions of those covers toning down the suggestive elements for stores catering to more sensitive consumers.<ref name=\"SilCathCoversWest\"/> ''Catherine'' released in North America on July 26, 2011.<ref name=\"CathUSDate\"/> In addition to the standard edition, a special limited \"Love is Dead\" edition was created for both PS3 and 360.<ref name=\"CathNAcollectors\"/>\n\nThough initial statements from Atlus said that ''Catherine'' would not be released in Europe,<ref name=\"CathEUdetails\"/> its release in the region was leaked through a rating for the 360 version in Germany.<ref name=\"CathEUleak\"/> Its official release was confirmed in a press release from Atlus shortly after the leak. The title was published by [[Deep Silver]] across all PAL territories, and featured written language support for English, Spanish, German, French, and Italian. Deep Silver was chosen as the publisher as they shared Atlus' enthusiasm about the game.<ref name=\"CathEUannounced\"/> ''Catherine'' released in Europe on February 10, 2012.<ref name=\"CathEUdate\"/> As with North America, the PS3 and 360 versions had a limited special edition. Called the \"Stray Sheep Edition\" after a central location in the game, it had differing content to the North American edition.<ref name=\"CathEUcollectors\"/> In Australia, the title was distributed by QV Software.<ref name=\"CathAUqv\"/> The PS3 version released on February 16,<ref name=\"QVcathPS3\"/> while the 360 version released on February 23.<ref name=\"QVcath360\"/>  A [[Microsoft Windows]] version, titled ''Catherine Classic'', was published worldwide by [[Sega]] on January 10, 2019 through [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name=\"CatherinePCdate\"/> This port was the first modern Atlus title ported to the platform, as the company were previously averse to it. The port included expanded graphics options, controller customization, and the English and Japanese voice tracks.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/>\n\nSince release, ''Catherine'' has occasionally been played competitively in [[esport]] tournaments. The game's professional scene began when [[Fighting game community|FGC]] member David \"Dacidbro\" Broweleit desired to learn the insides of the game's engine.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/> The first notable tournament was an event called Super NorCal Install, which took place in 2012. The tournament would become the basis for the game's competitive scene.<ref name=\"RBComp\"/> Publisher [[Atlus]] would later officially sponsor the game as a side event at [[Evo 2015]], while streaming it on their [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] account.<ref name=\"PolyEsports\"/> The attention surrounding the event would later carry on into [[Evo 2016]], [[Community Effort Orlando|CEOtaku 2016]], [[Genesis (tournament)|Genesis 4]], as well as a dedicated event in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] called ''The King of Catherine'', which had awarded a {{USD}}5,000 prize pool to winners.<ref name=\"PasteComp\"/><ref name=\"CathGenesis\"/><ref name=\"CathKing\"/> Speaking later, the developers said they were surprised with how popular the game became in the international esports scene.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\n====Voice cast====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| footer    = [[Troy Baker]] (left) and [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] (right) were the respective English voices for Vincent and Catherine. Describing the localization as a positive experience, they were free to adlib with their respective characters.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/>\n| image1    = Troy Baker SDCC 2019 (48378614692) (cropped).jpg\n| width1    = 130\n| alt1      = \n| image2    = Laura Bailey SDCC 2019 (48378674272) (vertical cropped).jpg\n| width2    = 160\n| alt2      = \n}}\nValerie Arem of PCB Productions was the voice director for dubbing.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as a positive experience, reinforced by the fact that they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/> Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.<ref name=\"KotoCathLocalInterview\"/>\n\nBaker, Bailey and Ruff had all previously worked with Atlus on the ''Persona'' series: Ruff voiced Yukari Takeba in ''Persona 3'' while Baker and Bailey respectively voiced [[Kanji Tatsumi]] and Rise Kujikawa from ''Persona 4''.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/><ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/><ref name=\"BaileyRise\"/> In an interview, Baker described the Atlus USA staff as giving him and the other English actors a great deal of freedom when it came to delivering lines and portraying their characters. He noted that the themes in ''Catherine'' were far more controversial compared to earlier titles he and Atlus had worked on, and that it was a unique voice acting opportunity.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Bailey was working on another Atlus project when she was offered the opportunity to voice Catherine. Having already heard of the project in the press, Bailey accepted the offer; during her time recording lines, she found the experience strange as she considered Baker to be a brotherly figure, starkly contrasting the relationship between Vincent and Catherine.<ref name=\"CathBaileyInterview\"/>\n\nRuff was offered the role of Katherine based on her acting abilities and her previous work with Atlus. She saw some footage of Katherine to get a feeling for her relationship with Vincent, but did not try to sync her performance with the Japanese. This was partly because of the planned English sync adjustments, and partly because she heard Japanese voice recording and cutscene finalization was still in progress.<ref name=\"CathRuffInterview\"/> This was confirmed by Arem in a separate interview. Arem described each main actor's strengths during recording: Baker had good timing when it came to delivering his lines, Bailey required few retakes, while Ruff was able to realistically convey a variety of emotions. She also noted the work done by Fitzgerald, the voice actress for both Trisha and Erica; Fitzgerald had difficulty with the timing for Trisha's lines, but managed to \"pull it off\".<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/> The amount of voice acting involved was so large that the actors felt they could not finish it.<ref name=\"CathBakerInterview\"/> Looking back on the production, Arem said she would not recast any of the characters.<ref name=\"SilLocalVoiceDirector\"/>\n\n===''Catherine: Full Body''===\n\n''Full Body'' was developed by Studio Zero, an internal team founded by Hashino after the release of ''[[Persona 5]]'' with multiple ''Persona'' staff. Hashino envisioned the game as the definitive version of ''Catherine'', the aim being to present the team's mission to create new and innovative gaming experiences by returning to one of their more unconventional titles.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino and Soejima returned as producer and character designer respectively. The director was Kenichi Goto, who worked as battle planner for the [[PlayStation 2]] ''Devil Summoner'' games and ''Persona 5''.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/> Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C returned to produce twenty more anime cutscenes.<ref name=\"FullbodyRinInfo\"/><ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The game was ported directly into the in-house ''Persona 5'' engine.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The gameplay was tweaked based on fan feedback, and easier difficulty was added so players could enjoy the story.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> The game includes [[downloadable content]] (DLC) that features ''Persona 5'' protagonist [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] as a playable guest character.<ref name=\"FullDLCjoker\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Winslow |first1=Jeremy |title=E3 2019: Persona 5 Characters Join Catherine: Full Body |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616084416/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-persona-5-characters-join-catherine-full-b/1100-6467812/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe keyword for the project was \"diversity\", expressed in both the narrative and the unconventional gameplay compared to other titles on the market.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/> Rin was included in ''Full Body'' as part of Hashino's wish to update the game's sensibilities and subject matter based on current trends.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> When asked to create a third \"Catherine\", Soejima was initially unsure how to proceed. As he designed Catherine and Katherine as \"hot\" and \"cool\" respectively, he chose a \"cute\" design for Rin.<ref name=\"SilSoejima\"/> Soejima designed Rin around a lack of aggression, from the character's expression and coloring reflecting this.<ref name=\"FullDengInterview\"/> Hashino also asked Soejima to redesign Trisha's hairstyle, which was changed into twin bun-style afros on either side of her head.<ref name=\"DengInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was released in Japan on February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateJP\"/> A notable addition to the Japanese version was a choice of eleven different voice actresses for Catherine, nine of which were DLC. All the actresses had previously played adulterous characters.<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/> The voices available in the base game were the original voice Sawashiro and [[Mamiko Noto]]. The Japanese DLC actresses were [[Ami Koshimizu]], [[Aoi Y\u016bki]], [[Yui Horie]], [[Kana Asumi]], [[Haruka Tomatsu]], [[Megumi Toyoguchi]], [[Rie Kugimiya]], [[Rina Sat\u014d]], and [[Nana Mizuki]].<ref name=\"FullVoices\"/> Each actress portrayed Catherine in a different way, with Noto's version being described as a \"[[yandere]] lady\".<ref name=\"FullFamitsuInterview\"/>\n\nThe original English voice cast reprised their roles for new dialogue, with Brianna Knickerbocker voicing the character of Rin.<ref name=\"CatherineFullEngInfo\"/> The localization team had to translate roughly 165,000 Japanese characters and over 6,000 new lines of spoken dialogue. As the original script altered several established lines, the team constantly referenced the Japanese script and worked hard to smoothly incorporate new and original text.  While the team could have recast due to the lapse of time between the original and ''Full Body'', the team wanted to \"preserve the integrity\" of ''Full Body'' and so brought back the entire main cast and most of the supporting cast. There were problems with how some voices had aged over the past eight years, and due to concerns over Baker's voice the team opted not to re-record a scene where Vincent screamed for 20 seconds.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|title=Bringing Catherine: Full Body to Life in English|last=Stebel|first=Jonathon|website=[[PlayStation Blog]]|date=September 4, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906041523/https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/09/04/bringing-catherine-full-body-to-life-in-english/|archivedate=September 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A notable adjustment for the Western release of ''Full Body'' was the crediting and dialogue for the transgender character Erica. She was originally referred to in the English credits using her birth name with her chosen name in parentheses. The Japanese version of ''Full Body'' retained this, but Atlus changed it for the Western release to use Erica's chosen name. This is notable because the game appeared in the news following public debate over whether the original credits were [[transphobic]].<ref name=\"ANNfullbody\"/> Some dialogue within the game related to Erica was also changed for similar reasons.<ref name=\"IGNFullPreview\"/> The PS4 version was released by Atlus in North America and Europe on September 3, 2019.<ref name=\"FullDateWW\"/> For the European version, the localizers had the extra task of translating the text into French, Spanish, Italian and German.<ref name=\"CatherineFullVoices\"/> The lack of an English localization for the Vita version was attributed to the console's discontinuation outside of Japan that year.<ref name=\"GIcatherinePC\"/> A [[Nintendo Switch]] version was annouced during a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2020, and will be released on July 7, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minotti |first1=Mike |title=Catherine: Full Body is coming to Switch on July 7 |url=https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/26/catherine-full-body-is-coming-to-switch-on-july-7/ |website=Venture Beat |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nMeguro began working on the first demo tracks for the game in August 2009. Meguro worked as the main composer, leading a team composed of himself, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Toshiki Konishi. Kitajoh was the general coordinator and managed sound effects for the action scenes.<ref name=\"MeguroCathLiners\"/> Meguro did not have much freedom with the project, as Hashino was specific about What he wanted the music to be like, giving him the key words of \"classic\", \"adult oriented\" and \"erotic\".<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/> The music team used multiple genres for the music in ''Catherine'', switching genre depending on the flow of gameplay; action segments used remixes of [[classical music]], quiet moments used [[jazz]], and the animated cutscenes used symphonic-based music.<ref name=\"CathShoji2\"/> As the animated cutscenes were produced by an external company, Meguro found creating music for them difficult when compared to previous projects of his, as he had to sync the music to something he had no creative input with.<ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Meguro was highly impressed by both the sound quality compared to his previous work, and the amount of control he had to adjust the relative volume of music and sound effects.<ref name=\"FamStaffComments\"/><ref name=\"CathShoji1\"/> Rapper L-VOKAL contributed to the score.<ref name=\"AtlusMessage\"/>\n\nFor ''Full Body'', in addition to Meguro's original work on the score, music company Inspion Izene was brought on to both arrange and add to the soundtrack.

Enemies can be dispatched by jumping on their heads; if Z is held down while attacking an enemy, Zee Tee will bounce high off its head, allowing him to reach higher platforms.  Blocks with faces on them can be struck from underneath to yield gems.\n\nEversion is possible only at certain points within each level.  Upon approaching an eversion point, the music of the possible destination becomes audible.  Additionally, the screen becomes slightly darker or lighter.  Everting at this location switches between two adjacent realities.  Switching to a third requires visiting a different location from the proper starting reality.  In total there are eight possible realities, though most levels use only a few.  In the HD version of Eversion, the background also changes when eversion occurs.\n\nEversion allows the player to exploit the properties of the different realities.  For example, in the first reality, clouds are visible as scenery, but they are intangible.  In the second and third realities, clouds are solid, allowing the player to reach previously inaccessible areas.  Plant-based objects also change, becoming solid, passable, or deadly depending on which reality is being visited, and certain bricks change from being solid, to breakable from underneath, to disappearing if Zee Tee steps upon them.  Enemies move at different speeds and show very different attitudes from one reality to the next, while certain hazards only appear at certain realities.\n\nCollecting the gems strewn about each level confers no benefit during gameplay, but collecting all of them allows the player to access a secret level as well as a new state of eversion, and at the level's conclusion, see a second ending to the game.\n\nIn the high-definition version of Eversion, finishing World 7 on layer 4 initiates the secret ending to the game.\n\nAs of 2018, the publisher's website is down and the original-definition freeware version is no longer available.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.humblebundle.com/store/eversion High-Definition version on Humble Store]\n* [http://store.steampowered.com/app/33680/ High-Definition version on Steam]\n* [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=177901993/ Comprehensive Achievement List and Guide]\n\n[[Category:2010 video games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:Side-scrolling video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{primary sources|date=December 2011}}\n{{original research|date=July 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Eversion\n|image = Eversion-logo.jpg\n|caption = The logo for Eversion\n|developer = Zaratustra Productions\n|publisher = Zaratustra Productions\n|designer = Guilherme S Tows\n|series =\n|engine = \n|released = '''Microsoft Windows'''{{vgrelease|WW|December 29, 2008}}'''Mac OS X''', '''Linux'''{{vgrelease|WW|August 15, 2012}}\n|genre = [[Platform game|Platformer]], [[Puzzle game|puzzle]], [[Survival horror|horror]]\n|modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n|platforms = [[Microsoft Windows]]<br/>[[OS X]]<br/>[[Linux]]\n}}\n\n'''''Eversion''''' is a short [[platform game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] by British indie studio Zaratustra Productions.
