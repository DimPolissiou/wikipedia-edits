It was first released in 1994 on Power Pak Records. It was co-produced by Moe Lytle and Tommy Hill. Her twelfth studio recording, ''Number One Christmas'' was also Seely's first album of [[holiday music]] to be released. \n\nThe album was later reissued on [[Gusto Records]] in 2007 where it was re-titled as ''A Golden Christmas''. The newer version remain unchanged with the exception of two new album tracks. \n\n==Background, content and release==\n''Number One Christmas'' was recorded in 1994 in sessions produced by Moe Lytle and Tommy Hill. Seely had worked with both producers on a prior album project with [[Jack Greene]] in 1982 in which they re-recorded their former hits.<ref name=\"Liner Notes\">{{cite journal |last1=Seely |first1=Jeannie |title=''Number One Christmas'' (Liner Notes and Album Information) |journal=Power Pak |date=1994}}</ref> In its original release, the album consisted of eight tracks.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> All tracks were cover versions of traditional holiday recordings. Among these recordings was \"[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]\", \"[[What Child Is This?]]\" and \"[[Silent Night]]\". The original album was released on Power Pak Records in 1994 as both a [[compact disc|CD]] and [[audio cassette|cassette]].<ref name=\"Liner Notes\"/>  \n\nThe album was re-released on October 7, 2007 on [[Gusto Records]] and was issued in a digital format.<ref name=\"Apple\">{{cite web |title=''A Golden Christmas'' by Jeannie Seely |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-golden-christmas/308332730 |website=[[Apple Music]] |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> It was also re-titled ''A Golden Christmas''.<ref>{{cite web |title=''A Golden Christmas'' -- Jeannie Seely |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/golden-christmas-mw0002668830 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The re-release included the same material, as well as two new track that were added. The song, \"[[Up on the Housetop]]\", was featured and included featured instrumentation from a group called the Nashville Fiddles.
