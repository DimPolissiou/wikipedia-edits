Some vehicles, especially [[van]]s, tend to have more power outlets, usually one for the front passengers, one for the rear passengers and one for the luggage trunk.\n\nThe [[voltage]] of the power outlet is usually near 12 V [[direct current|DC]], (14V to 15V while the running engine is turning the alternator, in order to charge the [[car battery]] while providing electrical power), because it is directly powered without regulation from the car's electrical system.\n\n== Accessories ==\nMost accessories that can be plugged into the outlet are rated for input voltages of up to 24V, some are even rated for 30V or 32V, because larger vehicles such as lorry trucks and busses often have 24-[[volt]] electrical systems, with a higher voltage while their alternator is [[power generator|generating power]].\n\nAccessories might partially work with lower input voltages such as 9V.\n\nExamples of devices that can be operated from an automobile power outlet include lights, fans, beverage heating devices, and small motorized tools such as [[air compressor]]s for inflating [[tire]]s. Many portable electronic devices such as [[Digital audio player|music players]], [[mobile telephone]]s and [[power bank]]s use an adapter (usually a [[USB]] charger) connected to the car power outlet to recharge their internal batteries or to directly operate from the vehicle electrical system. Adapters for electronic devices often regulate the output voltage to be compatible with the supplied device, e.g. 5V for normal USB chargers. Higher output voltages such as 9V or 12V can be outputted by some [[Quick Charge|fast chargers]], while some others use higher output [[electrical current|currents]] only.\n\nDevices that require alternating-current [[mains electricity]] can be operated with a plug-in [[electrical inverter|inverter]], which outputs voltage levels and patterns similar to the home [[electrical outlet]].\n\nAutomobiles may provide several 12&nbsp;V receptacles that are intended only to operate electrical accessories, and which cannot be used with a cigarette lighter, despite having the same shape and diameter. Car manufacturers may offer a cigarette lighter only as an optional extra-cost accessory. Usually, only one 12&nbsp;V receptacle near the driver will be able to accommodate an actual cigarette lighter, with other receptacles designated as \"12&nbsp;V auxiliary power outlets\" which are not physically able to power a lighter.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== History ==\nThe electrical cigar-lighter was invented and patented in the early 1880s by the German inventor {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Wilhelm Schindler|de}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In the 1890s, these tools were sold as electrical cigar lighters (''Cigarrenanz\u00fcnder''), and later as ''Zigarrenanz\u00fcnder'' in the major German warehouse catalogues.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Probably in the 1920s they were renamed \"cigarette lighters\", as cigarettes overtook cigars in sales.\n\nIn 1921, the Morris {{US patent|1,376,154}} was issued for a so-called \"wireless\" or \"cordless\" lighter with a removable element.

These outlets usually have a plastic cap tethered to them, and are usually labeled as being only for DC power, because they are not intended to withstand the heat produced by an electrical cigarette lighter.\n\nThe use of cigarette lighter receptacles to supply 12 volt DC power is an example of [[backward compatibility]] to a [[de facto standard]]. As a power connector, the lighter receptacle is larger, harder to use and less reliable than other DC connectors{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}.  Cigarette lighter receptacles are in widespread use in many highway vehicles and some boats. Portable cigarette lighter receptacles attached to cables and [[alligator clip]]s for connection directly to [[car battery|car batteries]] are available for temporary use. In newer vehicles, one or more [[USB connector]]s may also be provided.\n\nStandardized 12 volt DC automobile plugs are defined in the United States by [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] Standard 2089 regarding vehicle [[Lead\u2013acid battery|battery]] adapters. This standard covers plugs and cord sets that insert into cigarette lighter receptacles. In Europe, 12 volt plugs and sockets are not specially regulated, and do not require approvals for the [[CE mark]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe male plug is sometimes used to feed power ''into'' a vehicle to recharge its battery, because it usually has no regulatory circuitry between the outlet and the [[car battery]]. For instance, portable solar battery maintainers generally connect to a vehicle's battery in this manner. [[Trickle charge]]rs also sometimes connect in this way, eliminating the need to leave a vehicle's hood open, as well as eliminating the possibility of reversed polarity. Most cars nowadays are designed with a battery-negative earthing system and therefore have +12v positive power distribution. In such case the centre pin of a plug/socket will be +12V DC and the outer casing 0V. While polarity is not an issue for a cigarette lighter, it is prudent to verify correct matching of polarities when connecting other kinds of accessory. In some models, the cigarette lighter outlet is not powered when the ignition key is removed and charging is not possible.\n\n=== Technical details ===\nThe sockets and mating plugs are defined in the ANSI/SAE J563<ref name=\"SAE\">{{cite web|title=Standard for 12 Volt Cigarette Lighters, Power Outlets, and Accessory Plugs|url=http://standards.sae.org/j563_200902/|website=SAE International|publisher=SAE International|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref> specification. For the 12 volt systems, the center contact is the positive terminal and the shell is the negative terminal. Most automobiles connect the negative terminal to the frame of the vehicle (negative ground).\n\n12 volt auto connectors are made to comply with a standard by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] for safety. UL2089 was developed to cover the requirements for portable adapters rated 24 V DC or less that are intended to be supplied from the battery powered electrical system of a vehicle. Products covered by the standard include cord assemblies of a plug that mates with the standard cigarette receptacle found in automobiles.\n\n;6-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug::\n* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|21.34\u201321.46 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.4 mm}})\n* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|21.08\u201321.23 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.155 mm}})\n\n; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size A::\n* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|20.93\u201321.01 mm}} (median {{nowrap|20.97 mm}})\n* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|20.73\u201320.88 mm}} (median {{nowrap|20.805 mm}})\n* Most often used in American automobiles\n\n; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size B::\n* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|21.41\u201321.51 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.455 mm}})\n* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|21.13\u201321.33 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.18 mm}})\n* Most often used in European automobiles, and sometimes as a second socket in American automobiles expressly for DC power connections.\n\nPlugs often include a [[pilot light]] [[LED]] indicator to indicate that electrical power is connected. Optionally, the plug may be equipped with an internal [[Fuse (automotive)|fuse]] for electrical safety, usually rated at 10 amps or less. In some designs, the tip of the plug may be unscrewed to reveal a cylindrical glass fuse; other variants may use a blade-type fuse inserted into the side or back of the plug.\n\n=== Design considerations ===\n\nSince the cigarette lighter socket was originally designed only to heat a cigarette lighter, repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors can lead to many problems. In addition to the issues with partially-compatible physical dimensions, the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, there have been reports of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from [[electrical resistance|ohmic resistance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=215769#td_post_2354183|title=Testing power from car cigarette lighter socket ?|publisher=moneysavingexpert.com|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>  Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC outlets, but low-quality connectors may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact.\n\nAs a DC power connector, it has the disadvantages of bulkiness{{clarify|date=June 2019}}, relatively low current rating{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, and poor contact reliability. However, due to its large diameter, the connector and appliances can have a robust design against damage such as bending. Additionally, the connector is reversible.\n\nA second problem is that nominally \"twelve-volt\" power in cars fluctuates widely. The outlet is connected directly to the electrical system of the car. The actual voltage, matching the [[car battery]]'s voltage, will be approximately 12.5 volts when dormant (less in cold conditions), approximately 14.5 volts when the engine and the alternator/generator are operating (more when cold), and may briefly drop as low as 5\u20136 volts during engine start due to the high temporary battery current usage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servicemanagement365.com/Mobile_Communications_Hardware/Article405913.aspx |title=Plugging the cigar lighter gap |publisher=Service Management 365 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717205010/http://www.servicemanagement365.com/Mobile_Communications_Hardware/Article405913.aspx |archivedate=July 17, 2007 }}</ref> When used, [[DC to DC converter]]s will usually compensate for small fluctuations, but reliable power may not be available without an independent battery-powered [[uninterruptible power supply]].\n\nHowever, almost all car accessories are able to adapt to these variations of voltage, and keep working without issues.\n\nRarely, more extreme cases of voltage fluctuation can occur when the car battery is disconnected while the engine is running, or when the car receives a [[Jump start (vehicle)|jump start]]. When the battery is disconnected while the engine is running, its voltage smoothing effect (similar to [[capacitor]]s) is unavailable and a [[load dump]] transient can produce very high voltages as the built in [[voltage regulator]] has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant, the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds, during which the alternator output voltage will exceed its intended value. The load dump transient may also ruin the [[diode]]s in the [[alternator]] by exceeding their breakdown voltage. A car receiving a jump start from a truck may be subject to a 24&nbsp;V electrical system used in some vehicles.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c984D31D2sQC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&source=bl&ots=PWK0YWGbFG|title=Handbook of automotive power electronics and motor drives|first=Ali|last=Emadi|page=119|isbn=0-8247-2361-9|publisher=CRC press|date=2005-05-25|quote=The maximum operating voltage for 14&nbsp;V systems is specified at 24&nbsp;V, representing a double battery jump-start condition.}}</ref> Also, a \"double battery jump-start\" is performed by some tow truck drivers in cold climates.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/3893|work=High-Frequency Automotive Power Supplies|series=Application note 3893|date=2007-07-17|publisher=Maxim Integrated Products|title= Double-Battery Jump Start | quote = Another steady-state [[Overvoltage|OV]] condition is the double-battery jump start, which occurs when a [[tow truck]] or other service personnel use 24&nbsp;V to jump-start a disabled vehicle or otherwise charge a dead battery.

In some models, the cigarette lighter outlet is not powered when the ignition key is removed and charging is not possible.\n\n=== Technical details ===\nThe sockets and mating plugs are defined in the ANSI/SAE J563<ref name=\"SAE\">{{cite web|title=Standard for 12 Volt Cigarette Lighters, Power Outlets, and Accessory Plugs|url=http://standards.sae.org/j563_200902/|website=SAE International|publisher=SAE International|accessdate=2016-02-16}}</ref> specification. For the 12 volt systems, the center contact is the positive terminal and the shell is the negative terminal. Most automobiles connect the negative terminal to the frame of the vehicle (negative ground).\n\n12 volt auto connectors are made to comply with a standard by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] for safety. UL2089 was developed to cover the requirements for portable adapters rated 24 V DC or less that are intended to be supplied from the battery powered electrical system of a vehicle. Products covered by the standard include cord assemblies of a plug that mates with the standard cigarette receptacle found in automobiles.\n\n;6-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug::\n* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|21.34\u201321.46 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.4 mm}})\n* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|21.08\u201321.23 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.155 mm}})\n\n; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size A::\n* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|20.93\u201321.01 mm}} (median {{nowrap|20.97 mm}})\n* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|20.73\u201320.88 mm}} (median {{nowrap|20.805 mm}})\n* Most often used in American automobiles\n\n; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size B::\n* Receptacle inside diameter: {{nowrap|21.41\u201321.51 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.455 mm}})\n* Plug body diameter: {{nowrap|21.13\u201321.33 mm}} (median {{nowrap|21.18 mm}})\n* Most often used in European automobiles, and sometimes as a second socket in American automobiles expressly for DC power connections.\n\nPlugs often include a [[pilot light]] [[LED]] indicator to indicate that electrical power is connected. Optionally, the plug may be equipped with an internal [[Fuse (automotive)|fuse]] for electrical safety, usually rated at 10 amps or less. In some designs, the tip of the plug may be unscrewed to reveal a cylindrical glass fuse; other variants may use a blade-type fuse inserted into the side or back of the plug.\n\n=== Design considerations ===\n\nSince the cigarette lighter socket was originally designed only to heat a cigarette lighter, repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors can lead to many problems. In addition to the issues with partially-compatible physical dimensions, the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, there have been reports of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from [[electrical resistance|ohmic resistance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=215769#td_post_2354183|title=Testing power from car cigarette lighter socket ?|publisher=moneysavingexpert.com|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>  Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC outlets, but low-quality connectors may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact.\n\nAs a DC power connector, it has the disadvantages of bulkiness{{clarify|date=June 2019}}, relatively low current rating{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, and poor contact reliability. However, due to its large diameter, the connector and appliances can have a robust design against damage such as bending. Additionally, the connector is reversible.\n\nA second problem is that nominally \"twelve-volt\" power in cars fluctuates widely. The outlet is connected directly to the electrical system of the car. The actual voltage, matching the [[car battery]]'s voltage, will be approximately 12.5 volts when dormant (less in cold conditions), approximately 14.5 volts when the engine and the alternator/generator are operating (more when cold), and may briefly drop as low as 5\u20136 volts during engine start due to the high temporary battery current usage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servicemanagement365.com/Mobile_Communications_Hardware/Article405913.aspx |title=Plugging the cigar lighter gap |publisher=Service Management 365 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717205010/http://www.servicemanagement365.com/Mobile_Communications_Hardware/Article405913.aspx |archivedate=July 17, 2007 }}</ref> When used, [[DC to DC converter]]s will usually compensate for small fluctuations, but reliable power may not be available without an independent battery-powered [[uninterruptible power supply]].\n\nHowever, almost all car accessories are able to adapt to these variations of voltage, and keep working without issues.\n\nRarely, more extreme cases of voltage fluctuation can occur when the car battery is disconnected while the engine is running, or when the car receives a [[Jump start (vehicle)|jump start]]. When the battery is disconnected while the engine is running, its voltage smoothing effect (similar to [[capacitor]]s) is unavailable and a [[load dump]] transient can produce very high voltages as the built in [[voltage regulator]] has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant, the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds, during which the alternator output voltage will exceed its intended value. The load dump transient may also ruin the [[diode]]s in the [[alternator]] by exceeding their breakdown voltage. A car receiving a jump start from a truck may be subject to a 24&nbsp;V electrical system used in some vehicles.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c984D31D2sQC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&source=bl&ots=PWK0YWGbFG|title=Handbook of automotive power electronics and motor drives|first=Ali|last=Emadi|page=119|isbn=0-8247-2361-9|publisher=CRC press|date=2005-05-25|quote=The maximum operating voltage for 14&nbsp;V systems is specified at 24&nbsp;V, representing a double battery jump-start condition.}}</ref> Also, a \"double battery jump-start\" is performed by some tow truck drivers in cold climates.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/3893|work=High-Frequency Automotive Power Supplies|series=Application note 3893|date=2007-07-17|publisher=Maxim Integrated Products|title= Double-Battery Jump Start | quote = Another steady-state [[Overvoltage|OV]] condition is the double-battery jump start, which occurs when a [[tow truck]] or other service personnel use 24&nbsp;V to jump-start a disabled vehicle or otherwise charge a dead battery.
