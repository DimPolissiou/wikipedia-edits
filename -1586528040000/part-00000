Nicholas was the second of three children, with an older brother, Michael Earl \"Micah\" Sparks (born 1964), and a younger sister, Danielle \"Dana\" Sparks (1966\u20132000), who died at the age of 33 from a brain tumor. Sparks has said that she was the inspiration for the main character in his novel ''[[A Walk to Remember (novel)|A Walk to Remember]]''.\n\nSparks was raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themiscellany.org/index.php/news-archives/75-1999/982-author-nicholas-sparks-remembers-his-catholic-roots |title=Author Nicholas Spark remembers his Catholic roots |publisher=Catholic-doc.org |date=November 4, 1999 |accessdate=9 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922044637/http://www.themiscellany.org/index.php/news-archives/75-1999/982-author-nicholas-sparks-remembers-his-catholic-roots |archivedate=September 22, 2010 }}</ref> and is of German, [[Czech people|Czech]], English, and Irish ancestry.

By the time Sparks was eight, he had lived in [[Watertown, Minnesota]]; [[Inglewood, California]]; [[Playa del Rey, Los Angeles|Playa Del Rey, California]] and his mother's hometown of [[Grand Island, Nebraska]] for a year, during which his parents were [[Legal separation|separated]]. By 1974 his father became a professor of business at [[California State University, Sacramento]], and the family settled in [[Fair Oaks, California]].\n\nThe family remained there through Sparks' high school days, and in 1984, he graduated as the [[valedictorian]] of [[Bella Vista High School]]. After being offered a full sports scholarship for [[track and field]], at the [[University of Notre Dame]], Sparks accepted and enrolled, majoring in [[business finance]]. In 1988, while on spring break, he met his future wife, Cathy Cote of [[New Hampshire]], and then concluded his early academic work by graduating from Notre Dame with [[latin honors|honors]]. Sparks and Cote would be married on July 22, 1989, and they moved to [[New Bern, North Carolina]]. Prior to those milestones, however, Sparks had begun writing in his early college years.\n\n==Career==\nSparks decided to start writing based on a simple remark from his mother when he was 19 years old that introduced him to the possibility: <blockquote>'\"Your problem is that you're bored. You need to find something to do...\" Then she looked at me and said the words that would eventually change my life: \"Write a book.\" Until that moment, I had never considered writing. Granted, I read all the time, but actually sitting down and coming up with a story on my own? ...I was nineteen years old and had become an accidental author.<ref>Nicholas Sparks mother and Nicholas Sparks as quoted in: ''[[Three Weeks with My Brother]]'', pp. 183\u2013184</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1985, while at home for the summer between his freshman and second years at Notre Dame, Sparks penned his first \u2013 though never published \u2013 novel entitled ''The Passing''. He wrote another novel in 1989, also unpublished called ''The Royal Murders''.\n\nAfter college, Sparks sought both work with publishers, and applied to law school, but was rejected in both attempts. He then spent the next three years trying other careers, including [[real estate appraisal]], waiting tables, selling dental products by phone and starting his own manufacturing business.\n\nIn 1990, Sparks co-wrote a book with [[Billy Mills]] entitled ''Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding'',<ref name=Wokini>{{cite book|author=Billy Mills|author2=Nicholas Sparks |publisher=[[Hay House]]|isbn=978-1-56170-660-0|date=July 1999|page=176|title=Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding}}</ref> a nonfiction book about the influence of Lakota spiritual beliefs and practices.

Sparks has said that she was the inspiration for the main character in his novel ''[[A Walk to Remember (novel)|A Walk to Remember]]''.\n\nSparks was raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themiscellany.org/index.php/news-archives/75-1999/982-author-nicholas-sparks-remembers-his-catholic-roots |title=Author Nicholas Spark remembers his Catholic roots |publisher=Catholic-doc.org |date=November 4, 1999 |accessdate=9 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922044637/http://www.themiscellany.org/index.php/news-archives/75-1999/982-author-nicholas-sparks-remembers-his-catholic-roots |archivedate=September 22, 2010 }}</ref> and is of German, [[Czech people|Czech]], English, and Irish ancestry.

By the time Sparks was eight, he had lived in [[Watertown, Minnesota]]; [[Inglewood, California]]; [[Playa del Rey, Los Angeles|Playa Del Rey, California]] and his mother's hometown of [[Grand Island, Nebraska]] for a year, during which his parents were [[Legal separation|separated]]. By 1974 his father became a professor of business at [[California State University, Sacramento]], and the family settled in [[Fair Oaks, California]].\n\nThe family remained there through Sparks' high school days, and in 1984, he graduated as the [[valedictorian]] of [[Bella Vista High School]]. After being offered a full sports scholarship for [[track and field]], at the [[University of Notre Dame]], Sparks accepted and enrolled, majoring in [[business finance]]. In 1988, while on spring break, he met his future wife, Cathy Cote of [[New Hampshire]], and then concluded his early academic work by graduating from Notre Dame with [[latin honors|honors]]. Sparks and Cote would be married on July 22, 1989, and they moved to [[New Bern, North Carolina]]. Prior to those milestones, however, Sparks had begun writing in his early college years.\n\n==Career==\nSparks decided to start writing based on a simple remark from his mother when he was 19 years old that introduced him to the possibility: <blockquote>'\"Your problem is that you're bored. You need to find something to do...\" Then she looked at me and said the words that would eventually change my life: \"Write a book.\" Until that moment, I had never considered writing. Granted, I read all the time, but actually sitting down and coming up with a story on my own? ...I was nineteen years old and had become an accidental author.<ref>Nicholas Sparks mother and Nicholas Sparks as quoted in: ''[[Three Weeks with My Brother]]'', pp. 183\u2013184</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1985, while at home for the summer between his freshman and second years at Notre Dame, Sparks penned his first \u2013 though never published \u2013 novel entitled ''The Passing''. He wrote another novel in 1989, also unpublished called ''The Royal Murders''.\n\nAfter college, Sparks sought both work with publishers, and applied to law school, but was rejected in both attempts.  He then spent the next three years trying other careers, including [[real estate appraisal]], waiting tables, selling dental products by phone and starting his own manufacturing business.\n\nIn 1990, Sparks co-wrote a book with [[Billy Mills]] entitled ''Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding'',<ref name=Wokini>{{cite book|author=Billy Mills|author2=Nicholas Sparks |publisher=[[Hay House]]|isbn=978-1-56170-660-0|date=July 1999|page=176|title=Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding}}</ref> a nonfiction book about the influence of Lakota spiritual beliefs and practices.

The novel was published in October 1996 and made the ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller list in its first week of release.\n\nWith the success of his first novel, he moved to [[New Bern, North Carolina]].

The material conditional is used to form [[statement (logic)|statements]] of the form {{nowrap|''president'' \u2192 ''q pardon''}} (team us.)a parent(0)''condition meet and create different statement'') which is read as \"ik ''p'' then ''q'nonl jivwqp. Unlike the English construction \"if en then eng\", the material conditional statement {{gfbs|'b3'j5'3' \u2192 ''q''}} does not conventionally specify a [[causal relationship]] between ''public'' and ''qualified'';lacking assumed \"''neosystrms'' is the cause and ''cloud data connection'' is the consequence from it\" is keep a generally valid in paligime [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of {{nowrap|''p'' \u2192 ''q''}}.

This truth table is useful to prove some mathematical theorems (e.g., defining a [[subset]]).\n\nThe material conditional is also symbolized using:\n\n# {{nowrap|''p'' \u2283 ''q''}} (although this symbol may be used for the superset symbol in [[set theory]]);\n# {{nowrap|''p'' \u21d2 ''q''}} (although this symbol is often used for [[logical consequence]], i.e. logical implication, rather than for material conditional);\n# C<sub>''pq''</sub> (using [[Polish notation#Polish notation for logic|\u0141ukasiewicz notation]] or [[J\u00f3zef_Maria_Boche\u0144ski|Boche\u0144ski notation]]).\n\nWith respect to the material conditionals above:\n* ''p'' is termed the '''[[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]''' of the conditional;\n* ''q'' is termed the '''[[consequent]]''' of the conditional.\n\nConditional statements may be nested such that either or both of the antecedent or the consequent may themselves be conditional statements. In the example {{nowrap|(''p'' \u2192 ''q'') \u2192 (''r'' \u2192 ''s'')}}, meaning \"if the truth of ''p'' implies the truth of ''q'' then the truth of ''r'' implies the truth of ''s''\", both the antecedent and the consequent are conditional statements.\n\nIn [[classical logic]], {{nowrap|''p'' \u2192 ''q''}} is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to {{nowrap|\u00ac(''p'' \u2227 \u00ac''q'')}} and by [[De Morgan's Law]] logically equivalent to {{nowrap|\u00ac''p'' \u2228 ''q''}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Modern Formal Logic Primer: Sentence Logic Volume 1|url=http://tellerprimer.ucdavis.edu/pdf/1ch4.pdf|author=Teller, Paul|date=January 10, 1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=54|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> Whereas, in [[minimal logic]] (and therefore also intuitionistic logic) {{nowrap|''p'' \u2192 ''q''}} only [[Logical consequence|logically entails]] {{nowrap|\u00ac(''p'' \u2227 \u00ac''q'')}}; and in [[intuitionistic logic]] (but not minimal logic) {{nowrap|\u00ac''p'' \u2228 ''q''}} entails {{nowrap|''p'' \u2192 ''q''}}.\n\nThe term \"material implication\" was coined by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], who made a distinction between ''formal'' and ''material'' implication.\n\nHere's a quote from the [[Principia Mathematica|Principia]]:{{quote|[W]herever [...] one particular proposition is deduced from another, material implication is involved, though as a rule the material implication may be regarded as a particular instance of some formal implication, obtained by giving some constant value to the variable or variables involved in the said formal implication.}}So material implication concerns implication between particular propositions, whereas formal implication is supposed to be more general counsels involved way to participate.

By the same stroke, {{nowrap|''p'' \u2192 ''q''}} is ''true'' if and only if either ''p'' is false or ''q'' is true (or both).

For example, any material conditional statement with a false antecedent is true (see [[vacuous truth]]). So the statement \"if 2 is odd then 2 is even\" is true. Similarly, any material conditional with a true consequent is true. So the statement \"if I have a penny in my pocket then Paris is in France\" is always true, regardless of whether or not there is a penny in my pocket. These problems are known as the [[paradoxes of material implication]], though they are not really paradoxes in the strict sense; that is, they do not elicit logical contradictions. These unexpected truths arise because speakers of English (and other natural languages) are tempted to [[equivocation|equivocate]] between the material conditional and the [[indicative conditional]], or other conditional statements, like the [[counterfactual conditional]] and the [[logical biconditional|material biconditional]].\n\nIt is not surprising that a rigorously defined truth-functional operator does not correspond exactly to all notions of implication or otherwise expressed by \"if \u2026 then \u2026\" sentences in natural languages.

However, this construction also implies a \"reasonable\" connection between the condition ([[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]]) and consequence ([[Consequent|apodosis]]) (see [[Connexive logic]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe material conditional can yield some unexpected truths when expressed in natural language. For example, any material conditional statement with a false antecedent is true (see [[vacuous truth]]). So the statement \"if 2 is odd then 2 is even\" is true. Similarly, any material conditional with a true consequent is true. So the statement \"if I have a penny in my pocket then Paris is in France\" is always true, regardless of whether or not there is a penny in my pocket. These problems are known as the [[paradoxes of material implication]], though they are not really paradoxes in the strict sense; that is, they do not elicit logical contradictions. These unexpected truths arise because speakers of English (and other natural languages) are tempted to [[equivocation|equivocate]] between the material conditional and the [[indicative conditional]], or other conditional statements, like the [[counterfactual conditional]] and the [[logical biconditional|material biconditional]].\n\nIt is not surprising that a rigorously defined truth-functional operator does not correspond exactly to all notions of implication or otherwise expressed by \"if \u2026 then \u2026\" sentences in natural languages. For an overview of some of the various analyses, formal and informal, of conditionals, see the \"References\" section below. [[Relevance logic]] attempts to capture these alternate concepts of implication that material implication glosses over.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Boolean domain]]\n* [[Boolean function]]\n* [[Boolean logic]]\n* [[Conditional quantifier]]\n* [[Implicational propositional calculus]]\n* ''[[Laws of Form]]''\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Peirce's law]]\n* [[Propositional calculus]]\n* [[Sole sufficient operator]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Conditionals===\n* [[Counterfactual conditional]]\n* [[Indicative conditional]]\n* [[Corresponding conditional]]\n* [[Strict conditional]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Brown, Frank Markham (2003), ''Boolean Reasoning:  The Logic of Boolean Equations'', 1st edition, [[Kluwer]] Academic Publishers, [[Norwell, Massachusetts|Norwell]], MA.  2nd edition, [[Dover Publications]], [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]], NY, 2003.\n* [[Dorothy Edgington|Edgington, Dorothy]] (2001), \"Conditionals\", in Lou Goble (ed.), ''The Blackwell Guide to Philosophical Logic'', [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]].\n* [[W.

It begins with Adolph, an artist, sculpting a small nude female figure. With him is Adolph\u2019s new friend, Gustav, who has been visiting for a week and filling Adolph\u2019s weak and malleable mind with ideas:  Adolph was a painter, until Gustave persuaded him to be a sculptor, then Gustav persuades him that sculpting isn\u2019t right for him after all.  Also, Adolph loves and trusts his wife, Tekla, he credits her for educating him, and he was happy in his marriage \u2014 until Gustav changes his mind about those things. To the audience Gustav seems to be a devious character, who, Iago-like, is stirring up Adolph\u2019s insecurities and endangering the relationship between Adolph and his wife.  Adolph\u2019s fears boil up at one point, causing him to become, at Gustav\u2019s suggestion, almost epileptic. Gustav is making Adolph weaker, while, ironically, Gustav presents himself as providing life lessons in how to be strong in one\u2019s relationship. The audience begins to suspect that Gustav is, in fact, Tekla\u2019s ex-husband.  Adolph had stolen Tekla away from Gustav, and then Tekla wrote a novel that was a ''roman a clef'' with the main character based on Gustav. Tekla\u2019s novel portrays Gustav as an idiot. So, Gustav is motivated for revenge. Tekla has been away for the past week; when she parted Adolph upset her by calling her an \"old flirt\" and suggesting that she was too old to play the coquette.  As she now approaches the hotel, Gustav suggests that he will hide in the next room and eavesdrop, as Adolph will attempt to apply his lessons in \"how to handle a woman\", and sound out his wife to see if she is unfaithful, and to see if she will seek revenge on Adolph for his unkind comment. Gustav exits, Tekla enters and is alone with Adolph \u2014 with her homecoming being spied on by Gustav.\n\nTekla enters into this psychologically dense and uncomfortable environment like a breath of fresh air. She is a charming and vivacious character who flirts with her own husband \u2014 even though he has been convinced to resist her charms. They have fallen into the habit of calling themselves \"brother and sister\", because when she was being stolen away from her first husband, they both were attempting to feign a chaste relationship. Now she wants Adolph to call her \"Pussy\", because, she says, that might cause her to get up a \"pretty little blush\" for him, if he would like. With Gustav eavesdropping, Adolph becomes unpleasant, as he applies the ideas that he has been given by Gustav. Adolph also expresses his insecurities, and then, set off by a confused exchange, he storms out of the room in frustration.\n\nNow Gustav, the ex-husband, re-enters \u2014 with Adolph, as planned, in the adjoining room to eavesdrop. Gustav\u2019s manner has changed, and he is now seductively charming. He and his ex-wife bond very quickly. He tells Tekla that he has found someone else, which is not true.  Tekla falls for Gustav\u2019s charms, and they both agree to meet for a tryst, as a way of saying \u201cFarewell\u201d. Suddenly Tekla wakes up and sees through Gustav\u2019s wicked scheme, accusing him of villainy. Meanwhile,  Adolph, who has heard all this through the keyhole, is suffering an off-stage attack of epilepsy. Gustav is crowing in triumph over the revenge he has won over the two others. Gustav, who has not been a reliable font of wisdom, now introduces a Darwinian interpretation of what has gone on: He won the battle, in his opinion, because he is stronger. As the verbal fireworks between Gustav and Tekla grows in intensity, noises are heard coming from the adjoining room. The door is opened, Adolph, in a dramatically shocking moment, appears in the throes of the epileptic fit that had been threatened. Adolph falls dead. Tekla is distraught, and as she wails over her husband\u2019s body, Gustav\u2019s last line is: \"Why, she must have loved him, too. Poor creature.\"\n\nThe word \"creditor\" is used by the three characters to refer to each of the other characters at different times during the course of the play.<ref

It begins with Adolph, an artist, sculpting a small nude female figure. With him is Adolph\u2019s new friend, Gustav, who has been visiting for a week and filling Adolph\u2019s weak and malleable mind with ideas:  Adolph was a painter, until Gustave persuaded him to be a sculptor, then Gustav persuades him that sculpting isn\u2019t right for him after all.  Also, Adolph loves and trusts his wife, Tekla, he credits her for educating him, and he was happy in his marriage \u2014 until Gustav changes his mind about those things. To the audience Gustav seems to be a devious character, who, Iago-like, is stirring up Adolph\u2019s insecurities and endangering the relationship between Adolph and his wife.  Adolph\u2019s fears boil up at one point, causing him to become, at Gustav\u2019s suggestion, almost epileptic. Gustav is making Adolph weaker, while, ironically, Gustav presents himself as providing life lessons in how to be strong in one\u2019s relationship. The audience begins to suspect that Gustav is, in fact, Tekla\u2019s ex-husband.  Adolph had stolen Tekla away from Gustav, and then Tekla wrote a novel that was a ''roman a clef'' with the main character based on Gustav. Tekla\u2019s novel portrays Gustav as an idiot. So, Gustav is motivated for revenge. Tekla has been away for the past week; when she parted Adolph upset her by calling her an \"old flirt\" and suggesting that she was too old to play the coquette.  As she now approaches the hotel, Gustav suggests that he will hide in the next room and eavesdrop, as Adolph will attempt to apply his lessons in \"how to handle a woman\", and sound out his wife to see if she is unfaithful, and to see if she will seek revenge on Adolph for his unkind comment. Gustav exits, Tekla enters and is alone with Adolph \u2014 with her homecoming being spied on by Gustav.\n\nTekla enters into this psychologically dense and uncomfortable environment like a breath of fresh air. She is a charming and vivacious character who flirts with her own husband \u2014 even though he has been convinced to resist her charms. They have fallen into the habit of calling themselves \"brother and sister\", because when she was being stolen away from her first husband, they both were attempting to feign a chaste relationship. Now she wants Adolph to call her \"Pussy\", because, she says, that might cause her to get up a \"pretty little blush\" for him, if he would like. With Gustav eavesdropping, Adolph becomes unpleasant, as he applies the ideas that he has been given by Gustav. Adolph also expresses his insecurities, and then, set off by a confused exchange, he storms out of the room in frustration.\n\nNow Gustav, the ex-husband, re-enters \u2014 with Adolph, as planned, in the adjoining room to eavesdrop. Gustav\u2019s manner has changed, and he is now seductively charming. He and his ex-wife bond very quickly. He tells Tekla that he has found someone else, which is not true.  Tekla falls for Gustav\u2019s charms, and they both agree to meet for a tryst, as a way of saying \u201cFarewell\u201d. Suddenly Tekla wakes up and sees though Gustav\u2019s wicked scheme, accusing him of villainy. Meanwhile,  Adolph, who has heard all this through the keyhole, is suffering an off-stage attack of epilepsy. Gustav is crowing in triumph over the revenge he has won over the two others. Gustav, who has not been a reliable font of wisdom, now introduces a Darwinian interpretation of what has gone on: He won the battle, in his opinion, because he is stronger. As the verbal fireworks between Gustav and Tekla grows in intensity, noises are heard coming from the adjoining room. The door is opened, Adolph, in a dramatically shocking moment, appears in the throes of the epileptic fit that had been threatened. Adolph falls dead. Tekla is distraught, and as she wails over her husband\u2019s body, Gustav\u2019s last line is: \"Why, she must have loved him, too. Poor creature.\"\n\nThe word \"creditor\" is used by the three characters to refer to each of the other characters at different times during the course of the play.<ref

The album was described as being \"very strong, melodic, and heavy at times\", by the band's drummer, John Humphrey.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Cindal |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/08/seethers_john_h.php |title=Seether's John Humphrey talks about tonight's show at the Fair \u2013 Minneapolis / St. Paul Music \u2013 Gimme Noise |publisher=Blogs.citypages.com |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922043241/http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/08/seethers_john_h.php |archivedate=22 September 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Release and promotion==\nOn 4 September 2010, during a live show at the DuQuoin State Fair, Seether debuted \"No Resolution\".\n\nOn 8 March 2011, Wind-Up Records released the track list and album art on the band website, along with the first single, \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\", on iTunes.<ref>[http://seether.com/music.aspx Seether | Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516042315/http://www.seether.com/music.aspx |date=16 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn 28 March 2011, Seether made an appearance on ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'' to perform the new single \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\" live.\n\nOn 6 April, the song \"Roses\" became available as a free download for subscribers of the official e-mail newsletter.\n\nOn 26 April, the song \"Forsaken\" became available as a free download for pre-ordering the deluxe version of ''Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray'' on [[iTunes]].\n\nOn 13 May, the entire album was officially released for streaming if you were to \"tweet\" on [[Twitter]] the given message on the website.\n\nThe band played on the main stage for the 2011 [[Rockstar Uproar Festival]] along with [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Three Days Grace]], [[Bullet for My Valentine]], and [[Escape the Fate]].\n\nOn 13 September 2011, after WWE concluded a [[Smackdown]] taping at the [[Air Canada Centre]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, \"Tonight\" appeared in a video tribute to former WWE wrestler [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] that was shown during an appreciation night which was filmed as a Blu-ray exclusive for ''You Think You Know Me: The Story of Edge'' and the song was heard again on the 9 January 2012 edition of [[WWE Raw|Raw]] during the announcement of his induction into the 2012 [[WWE Hall of Fame]].\n\nA [[Simlish]] version of \"Tonight\" was included on the soundtrack to ''[[The Sims 3]]'' expansion ''[[The Sims 3: Showtime]]''.\n\n===''Remix EP''===\nIn the wake of a remix contest, six remixes were issued on a 2012 EP entitled ''Remix EP''.

Steve Losey of [[AllMusic]] said, \"''Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray'' is another journey into the mind of Shaun Morgan: through heartbreak and rebirth he still has a lot to say about betrayal. His stamps as a guitarist, a songwriter, and a lead vocalist are everywhere on this disc, and thankfully, that's what ultimately drives the release home.\"<ref name=\"AM\" /> Chad Grischow of [[IGN]] said in his review that \"this diverse set of melodic hard rock proves to be a solid entry in the band's catalog.\"<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Finally, Brandon Geist of [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, \"Held together by Shaun Morgan's alternately gritty and smooth vocals, ''Holding onto Strings Better Left to Fray'' should forever distinguish Seether from all the clich\u00e9d radio-rock schlock flooding the airwaves.\"\n\n''Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray'' is Seether's highest-charting album on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], reaching number two.
