Although they took heavy casualties, the 17th performed well for an untried unit and earned the nickname \"Stonewall Regiment\".<ref name=17micoe/> Three days later, they participated in the [[Battle of Antietam]] as part of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]]. After the battle, the regiment left with its command and returned to [[Virginia]].\n\nIn October 1863, the regiment was assigned to the [[Army of the Tennessee]].

It lay under its arms during the night, and on the following morning commenced falling back closely followed by the Confederates. It continued to retreat, acting as a rear guard for the rest of the corps. While crossing Turkey Creek, Longstreet's men attacked in force, causing a severe engagement to occur. In this action, the regiment lost 7 men killed, 19 wounded and 10 missing. During the retreat to Knoxville and during the [[Knoxville Campaign|siege]] the men suffered greatly, especially while being besieged from the want of proper and sufficient rations.<ref name=17micoe/> When the siege was lifted by the retreating Confederates, the 17th was ordered to [[Annapolis, Maryland]], where 200 new recruits were incorporated into its ranks.\n\nFrom Annapolis, the regiment set out with [[Ulysses S.

On May 12, 1864, the 17th Michigan was actively engaged in the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], and charged the southern Confederate works at Spotsylvania Court House. In this charge the regiment lost 23 killed, 73 wounded and 93 taken prisoner. The loss in prisoners was owing to the regiment being surrounded by a greatly superior force under the command of Longstreet.<ref name=17micoe/>\n\nOn May 16, 1864, the regiment was designated as an engineer unit,<ref name=17micoe/> and served in that capacity the remainder of the year.  It moved with its corps from the North Anna River, thence to Cold Harbor, across the Chickahominy and the James Rivers to the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where it remained until the city fell.  From the time it arrived in front of Petersburg until its fall, the Regiment was actively building and reconstructing fortifications, all the while being held in reserve, if needed as infantry.\n\nAfter Lee's surrender at [[Old Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], the regiment proceeded to Washington, D.C. to participate in the Grand Review, remaining there until June 3, 1865, when it was mustered out of service and started for Detroit, arriving there on June 7, 1865, to be paid off and disbanded.\n\n==Recognition and honors==\nEight men from the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]:<ref name=17micoe/>\n* Private [[Frederick Alber]], Company A, [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], May 12, 1864\n* Private [[Joseph E.

Most of the soldiers in the regiment were from south-central Michigan, and Company E was composed largely of students from Michigan State Normal College, today known as [[Eastern Michigan University]].

Withington]], until August 27 when they left for [[Maryland]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of South Mountain]], Maryland, on September 14, 1862, the regiment saw its first major action. Although they took heavy casualties, the 17th performed well for an untried unit and earned the nickname \"Stonewall Regiment\".<ref name=17micoe/> Three days later, they participated in the [[Battle of Antietam]] as part of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]]. After the battle, the regiment left with its command and returned to [[Virginia]].\n\nIn October 1863, the regiment was assigned to the [[Army of the Tennessee]]. On October 14, 1863, the regiment, then attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, IX Corps, marched from [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to [[Loudon, Tennessee]], to oppose the advance of the Confederate General [[James Longstreet]]. It lay under its arms during the night, and on the following morning commenced falling back closely followed by the Confederates. It continued to retreat, acting as a rear guard for the rest of the corps. While crossing Turkey Creek, Longstreet's men attacked in force, causing a severe engagement to occur. In this action, the regiment lost 7 men killed, 19 wounded and 10 missing. During the retreat to Knoxville and during the [[Knoxville Campaign|siege]] the men suffered greatly, especially while being besieged from the want of proper and sufficient rations.<ref name=17micoe/> When the siege was lifted by the retreating Confederates, the 17th was ordered to [[Annapolis, Maryland]], where 200 new recruits were incorporated into its ranks.\n\nFrom Annapolis, the regiment set out with [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s campaign of 1864; when in May of that year it lost 7 men killed, and 39 wounded in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]]. On May 12, 1864, the 17th Michigan was actively engaged in the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], and charged the southern Confederate works at Spotsylvania Court House. In this charge the regiment lost 23 killed, 73 wounded and 93 taken prisoner. The loss in prisoners was owing to the regiment being surrounded by a greatly superior force under the command of Longstreet.<ref name=17micoe/>\n\nOn May 16, 1864, the regiment was designated as an engineer unit,<ref name=17micoe/> and served in that capacity the remainder of the year.  It moved with its corps from the North Anna River, thence to Cold Harbor, across the Chickahominy and the James Rivers to the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where it remained until the city fell.  From the time it arrived in front of Petersburg until its fall, the Regiment was actively building and reconstructing fortifications, all the while being held in reserve, if needed as infantry.\n\nAfter Lee's surrender at [[Old Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], the regiment proceeded to Washington, D.C. to participate in the Grand Review, remaining there until June 3, 1865, when it was mustered out of service and started for Detroit, arriving there on June 7, 1865, to be paid off and disbanded.\n\n==Recognition and honors==\nEight men from the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]:<ref name=17micoe/>\n* Private [[Frederick Alber]], Company A, [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], May 12, 1864\n* Private [[Joseph E.

[[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] rivers where the [[Ohio River]] begins. It abuts the borough of [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]].\n\nA large part of the Homestead Works of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] existed in Munhall. Steel products were the only items made in Munhall in 1910 when 5,185 people lived here. In 1940, 13,900 people lived in Munhall. The population was 11,406 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Munhall borough, Pennsylvania| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref> Munhall, along with the boroughs of Homestead and [[West Homestead, Pennsylvania|West Homestead]], are served by the [[Steel Valley School District]].\n\n==History==\nA post office called Munhall was established in 1887.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postalhistory.com/postoffices.asp?task=display&state=PA&county=Allegheny|title=Allegheny County|publisher=Jim Forte Postal History|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref> The borough was formed on June 24, 1901, out of a part of Mifflin Township,<ref>{{cite journal|title=School District of Borough of Munhall v.

It has been restored and modernized during the last quarter of a century - new electrical lighting has been installed, computers for the use of visitors have been installed, and the gloominess inside has vanished. Additionally, there are indoor pools, basketball courts, and other recreational facilities.\n\nIn 2000, Continental Realestate Companies opened [[The Waterfront]].  This large \"LifeStyle\" shopping center was built on the former site of the [[Carnegie Steel]] Works.  Most of the structures associated with the steel mills on this site were demolished during construction. Still standing in the Waterfront development are some of the brick stacks from the Homestead Steel Works. In addition, near the river is a former mill structure known as the Pump House which was restored by the developer.\n\nThe Byzantine Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, serving the Archeparchy of Pittsburgh, is also located in the borough.\n\n==Geography==\nMunhall is located at {{coord|40|23|28|N|79|54|4|W|type:city}} (40.391202, -79.901221).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.4|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|2.3|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi}}, or 4.55%, is water.\n\n==Surrounding and adjacent communities==\nMunhall has six land borders, including [[Whitaker, Pennsylvania|Whitaker]] to the east, [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]] to the south and east, [[West Homestead, Pennsylvania|West Homestead]] to the west, [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]] to the northwest, and the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of [[Lincoln Place (Pittsburgh)|Lincoln Place]] to the southwest and [[New Homestead (Pittsburgh)|New Homestead]] to the south-southwest.\n\nAcross the [[Monongahela River]], Munhall runs adjacent with (from north to southeast) the Pittsburgh neighborhood of [[Swisshelm Park (Pittsburgh)|Swisshelm Park]], [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania|Swissvale]] and [[Rankin, Pennsylvania|Rankin]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 5185\n|1920= 6438\n|1930= 12995\n|1940= 13900\n|1950= 16437\n|1960= 17332\n|1970= 16574\n|1980= 14535\n|1990= 13158\n|2000= 12264\n|2010= 11406\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=11081\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Pennsylvania|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/17216604v1p40ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=November 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120100311/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|archivedate=November 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-40.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Number and Distribution of Inhabitants:Pennsylvania-Tennessee|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch09.pdf|work=Fifteenth Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\"/> of 2000, there were 12,264 people, 5,364 households, and 3,239 families residing in the borough.

Also known as ''the News'' or ''the BDN'', the paper is published by Bangor Publishing Company, a local family-owned company. \n\nIt has been owned by the Towle-Warren family for four generations; current publisher Richard J. Warren is the great-grandson of J.

The car is on display at the [[Cole Land Transportation Museum]] in Bangor.]]\nThe ''Bangor Daily News''{{'}}s first issue was June 18, 1889; the main stockholder in the publishing company was Bangor shipping and logging businessman Thomas J. Stewart.<ref name=history/> Upon Stewart's death in 1890, his sons took control of the paper, which was originally a tabloid with \"some news, but also plenty of gossip, lurid stories and scandals.\"<ref name=history/> In 1895, J. Norman Towle purchased the newspaper. Ownership of the paper remained in the family, and Towle's great-grandson Richard J. Warren remains the publisher today.<ref name=history/> \n\nThe ''Bangor Daily News'' merged with the ''Bangor Whig & Courier'' in 1900, leaving two newspapers in the city: ''BDN'' and the ''Bangor Daily Commercial'' (which ceased publication in 1949). Towle's son-in-law Fred Jordan took control of the paper in 1929. Forty-six ''BDN'' staff members served in the U.S. forces during [[World War II]], and the paper's managing editor John M. O\u2019Connell was sent to Europe as a [[war correspondent]].<ref name=history/> After Fred Jordan's death in 1947, his widow Lillis Towle Jordan became publisher.<ref name=history/> Richard K. Warren became publisher in 1955 and remained in that role until 1984, a time when the newspaper's circulation dramatically increased.<ref name=history/> It has only missed one day of delivery in its entire history. On [[New Year's Eve]] 1962, a massive blizzard dumped over three feet of snow on Bangor, with 20-foot snowdrifts that made it impossible for the delivery trucks to move.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe newspaper's peak came in the mid-1980s, when ''Bangor Daily News'' had 150 reporters and editors and 150 other employees.  At the time, published seven regional editions of the newspaper throughout Maine, and in addition to its main office on Main Street in Bangor had news bureaus at [[Madawaska, Maine|Madawaska]], [[Presque Isle, Maine|Presque Isle]], [[Houlton, Maine|Houlton]], [[Pittsfield, Maine|Pittsfield]], [[Calais, Maine|Calais]], [[Machias, Maine|Machias]], [[Rockland, Maine|Rockland]], [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]] and [[Ellsworth, Maine|Ellsworth]].<ref name=history/>\n\nRichard J.

Also known as ''the News'' or ''the BDN'', the paper is published by Bangor Publishing Company, a local family-owned company. \n\nIt has been owned by the Towle-Warren family for four generations; current publisher Richard J.
