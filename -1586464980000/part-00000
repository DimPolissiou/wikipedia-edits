Kean effortlessly ties historical accounts, stories of madness and insanity, with the scientific breakthroughs that often followed. His writing shows that every breakthrough was borne of malady, injury, necessity.\n\n=== Part I: Gross Anatomy ===\n\n==== Introduction ====\nE artwork and medicine). \n\nThey both teamed together when the king fell to try to see if they could revive him. Upon examination, the king had no fractures to his head and so it would have been assumed that nothing was wrong. The surgeons knew better, and were going to encounter the first concussion of that time. After the king's death, they found that his brain was in awful shape, \"yellowed and putrefied\" and found \"pools of blackened fluid beneath the meninges\". This is the medical discovery/advancement that would set the stage for generations to come: the fact that brain damage could be present despite no obvious fractures or surface wounds.\n\n=== Part II: Cells, Senses, Circuits ===\n\n==== Chapter 2: The Assassin's Soup  ====\n\nAnother scientist, [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]], was enamored by the pictures of neurons that Golgi produced. Despite his fascination with the drawings, though, he disagreed with reticulum theory. He noticed that, under a microscope, gray matter neurons were not fused together.\n\nThe story of another assassin follows: [[Leon Czolgosz]]. The man had a similar past to that of Guiteau, and planned to murder president [[William McKinley]] as to secure his own party's political candidate in the White House. He proceeded to shoot McKinley in the stomach and pancreas and was then sentenced to the electric chair. McKinley died of infection after eating when his stomach had not fully healed. Much to the anger of various neuroscientists and neurosurgeons alike, Czolgosz's brain was confiscated from study and destroyed.\n\nThe experiments of [[Otto Loewi]] are also mentioned. His experiment was one in which he placed two frog hearts in separate cups of saline. He sped one heart up by triggering nerves, then transferred the saline of the fast heart into the saline of the normal beating heart, resulting in the normal heart being as fast as the other heart that he had triggered. This proved that neurons did not just use electricity, but also used chemicals. But since he realized that electricity could not jump the (tiny) distance between dendrites, he concluded that the electricity transformed into transferable chemicals.\n\n==== Chapter 3: Wiring and Rewiring   ====\nHere, Kean introduces the eccentric [[James Holman]]. He was a blind explorer, a man who climbed mountains and visited all corners of the globe without sight. He was appointed the Naval Knight of Windsor, which was more illustrious than it sounded. Holman hated being home and often sank into deep bouts of depression when cooped up for too long a time.\n\nTo get around during his journeys, he carried a cane. He did not use the cane like other blind people did, feeling around with it. He used his cane to strike the ground, causing a click that he could hear. This click, in turn, echoed in his ears, creating what was essentially human echolocation.\n\nve that synesthesia is a result of poor pruning.\n\nAlbert Hoffman helped scientists further understand synesthesia by creating a certain psychedelic drug known as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. Created in his lab, he tried it, and was startled by the results. It ultimately showed that we all carry the latent ability of synesthesia if we knew how to tap it as LSD does.\n\nCajal (from the previous chapter) pointed out that adult neurons and neuron circuits could not renew themselves, and once they were dead, they were dead for good. He said that only children could renew their brain tissue. This is true to some extent, though for adults, while they cannot regrow neurons, they can rewire circuits in their brains with hard work.\n\n==== Chapter 4: Facing Brain Damage  ====\nThis chapter starts with the introduction of ''mutil\u00e9s'', men who had various parts of their faces blown off by the metal weapons used in the [[World War I|Great War]]. Their defaced faces, faces without noses or eyes or cheeks, were the root of much sadness and insecurity for the men, and many committed suicide. An American sculptor Anna Coleman Ladd traveled and set up a business for these men, and she would create faces for them out of plaster and ceramic and paint, making them startlingly realistic. These faces made the men happy and helped them assimilate back into society. Despite this, the faces could not smile or kiss or chew and the paint soon chipped.\n\nRelated, a Japanese scientist Tatsuji Inouye examines soldiers who had been shot through their visual cortex during battle and lost random spots of vision. Inouye figured that the spots of missing vision were connected with the spots that their brain had been shot through, and set out to map the visual cortex through talking to these soldiers.\n\nKean introduces other scientists such as the duo Hubel and Wiesel, who tried various experiments with cats to get their neurons to fire. Through many botched experiment attempts, one fateful accident led to the breakthrough that certain neurons fire at certain things. Specifically, they discovered that neurons like to track motion and can derive the shapes of objects through columns of orientation-preferring neurons.\n\nKean also, in depth, explains the role of the parietal lobe and the occipital lobe through all these accounts. He writes that the brain can stumble after injury, and the results can be serious. For example, if the visual cortex suffers damage, the person afflicted will lose many things, one of which being basic perceptual skills. Damage to the parietal lobe causes the loss of the ability to locate objects in space. Infections and viruses like [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] may make their way up to the brain and affect it.\n\nHe also covers the interesting topic of object-blindness. Someone may not recognize an object, a color, or other seemingly mundane things. Face-blind people cannot recognize faces, and can hardly discern age or gender between portrait pictures.\n\n=== Part III: Body and Brain ===\n\n==== Chapter 5: The Brain's Motor  ====\nKean begins the chapter with the sad tale of George Dedlow. George Dedlow had fought in the Civil War and in turn had both his arms and both his legs amputated for various reasons. These amputations brought on another neurological phenomenon: phantom limbs. George Dedlow, amongst millions of other war amputees, felt pain in limbs that he did not have.\n\nA neuroscientist, [[Silas Weir Mitchell (physician)|Silas Weir Mitchell]], specialized in examining amputees and was fascinated with them. He examined patients who complained of pain or discomfort in their phantom arms, legs, and genitals. Here, Kean ties the motor and sensory cortexes in. When something is amputated, the respective part of the brain for controlling that part goes black (figuratively). The now obsolete part of the brain is quickly taken over by neighboring brain areas, such as the face or arms.\n\nV. S. Ramachandran, a neuroscientist, was also fascinated with amputees and their phantom pains. One of his patients was a man with insistent pain in his arm, an arm that was in fact removed many years prior. Ramachandran proceeded to test out a treatment of his own creation. He made the man place his arms into a box, the one arm that was still attached surrounded by mirrors. The box and the mirror together provided the illusion that his arm was still intact. Then, he made the man move his hands around as if he still had both. It is after this ritual of moving his hands about that the man exclaims that he feels his pain subsiding, that he feels his phantom fist unclench for the first time in many years. Thus concludes the chapter about the brain and its motor, which essentially is responsible for every part working correctly.\n\n==== Chapter 6: The Laughing Disease  ====\nThe Laughing Disease, later referred to as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], originated in Papua, New Guinea in the tribe of the Fore (For-ay) people. It was commonplace in the tribe to consume the body when someone had passed, believing that consuming the body would speed its journey to the afterlife. Cannibalism was an important cultural norm to the Fore, though it was what ultimately spread kuru. The slow rise of this disease caught the attention of one [[Daniel Carleton Gajdusek|D. Carleton Gajdusek]], a doctor who specialized in pediatrics with a strange affinity for microbes and their spread. His interest piqued (he loved to travel around the world in search of malady), he traveled to New Guinea to see what the fuss was about and try to investigate it for himself. While he was there, he collected hundreds of gallons of samples of blood and urine and sweat, trying to find how it spread (and it spread. Rapidly, in fact. It was the question of many biologists and those in the medical field alike). He bribed families for the brains of their deceased, the ones that fell victim to kuru and were going to be eaten by their relatives and used the brains he acquired to conduct autopsies as fast as possible (which were often difficult as refrigeration was often below-average and unavailable).\n\nIt is here that Kean brings up the cerebellum, the center in the brain that controls finer movements, controls the timing of movement. Very important. It was probable that a malfunction in this area of the brain was what was the root of kuru, as the symptoms (shuffling, uncontrollable laughing) were typical of that area of the brain.\n\nDuring an autopsy of a diseased brain, Gajdusek found plaque (microscopic) on many areas. He also discovered many other things that may have come from eating brains. After a long investigation of kuru, and as hundreds of people were dying from it, the phrase \"slow virus\" was brought about. Along with that, a mix between the words ''protein'' and ''infection'' was also created: [[prion]]s. Scientists found that this was how kuru was spread.\n\nThe brain has something called the [[Blood\u2013brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]] which essentially blocks everything from entering the brain, save for a few thing. For instance, if you were to inject dye into the bloodstream, every organ would turn that color except for the brain due to the BBB. It is this barrier that makes it so difficult to medicate people for mental diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimers]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]]. It was hard for certain things to get it, and even harder for microbes (with the exception of syphilis and herpes). Though, proteins were one of the things that could pass through the barrier. And prions, being part protein, can thus make it through the barrier. Another illness that falls into the category of prions is [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease|Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome]], a degenerative neurological disorder.\n\nUnrelated, after Gajdusek returned after his kuru investigations, he was revealed to be a pedophile after admitting to touching young boys that he had picked up as his children in Papua, New Guinea.\n\n==== Chapter 7: Sex and Punishment  ====\nHarvey Cushing was obsessed with the pituitary gland. He sent his assistant, William Sharp, to retrieve this gland from a giant who had just died, among other things such as the heart, the lungs, and the brain. After retrieving the organs in a hurry, Sharp was brutally yelled at by Cushing because he had forgotten a part he hadn't even known existed. He was later forgiven, as Cushing still had his pituitary.\n\nCushing was absolutely fascinated with the idea of mishaps in the pituitary gland. He often sought out circuses and freak shows in hopes that they would have a giant or a dwarf, and often stopped to talk with them about their lives and their pasts. One such man was one by the name of John who was a giant, a farmer from South Dakota, the man who Cushing's assistant de-organed before his funeral service.\n\nThe modern study of emotion came about because of [[James Papez]], a neuroanatomist.\n\nIt is in his chapter that Kean discusses the limbic system of the brain, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala.\n\nKean recalls a story in which a woman named S.M. contracted a rare disease that killed off amygdala cells. After it was frozen and shriveled, S.M. felt no fear. She had felt fear in normal amounts at appropriate things as a child, though after the disease had run its course, she felt not a lick of it. It was nearly comical how scientists reacted: they tried (in vain) to scare her. Taking her to haunted houses, she often ran ahead, eager to find out what else awaited.\n\nAfter this tale, Kean ties it in with the limbic system, the topic of the chapter, and the temporal lobe.\n\nIn regards to the temporal lobe, Kean mentions duo [[Heinrich Kl\u00fcver]] and [[Paul Bucy]]. The pair experimented on monkeys, removing parts of their brains (the temporal lobes) and getting disastrous and disturbing results.\n\n=== Part IV: Beliefs and Delusions ===\n\n==== Chapter 8: The Sacred Disease   ====\nThe sacred disease is epilepsy, called so because many felt as if their soul met a higher power: God, in some cases. He mentions the plight of [[Wilder Penfield]]. His sister had been suffering from major epileptic fits and seizures. He then proceeded to operate on her after noticing a tumor was pressing on her brain from behind her sinuses and dually pressing down on her optic nerve, which was swollen. When he went in to operate, he had to remove 1/8 of her brain, a startling amount. After this mass excavation, he noticed that the tumor grew deep into the other brain hemisphere, and he succumbed to the fact that the tumor had won. She later died because of it, as expected.\n\nEpileptic fits are common amongst famous figures. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] was one epileptic, a temporal lobe epileptic, who fell victim to his illness time and time again, and it affected his writing greatly.\n\nA [[John Hughlings Jackson]] noticed that epileptics had uncannily similar seizures, with certain parts seizing after other parts, same sequences. This led him to believe that circuits, though different, had many similarities.\n\nThe experiment on Mary Rafferty was a strange one and arguably cruel. She had come in with a two inch gaping hole in her skull brought about by a mix of a chafing whalebone wig and cancer. Roberts Bartholomew took her in and decided to conduct an experiment. He slid two metal electrodes into her brain and started a generator, causing her to move her arms and legs about wildly. He believed he had stuck the electrodes on the motor cortex. She later died.\n\n{{See also|Cortical homunculus|l1=Sensory Homunculus}}\n\n==== Chapter 9: Sleights of Mind  ====\nWoodrow Wilson traveled the country with the intention of breaking the Senate. He instead broke himself. After complaining of headaches (among other various ailments) Wilson suffered many small strokes, and then suffered one large one that left him paralyzed and a pity to behold. Another thing: the whole left side of this world ceased to exist.\n\nHe suffered from what we now know today as [[hemispatial neglect]], which causes only one hemisphere to process things. Sufferers of this condition will only shave half their faces, eat half their food, dress only half of themselves. In memories of being in a certain place, patients might only recall the buildings on one side of the street. Wilson might have a pile of pens right next to him, but if they were not on the right side, he would complain of not having a pen on hand. He would also deny that he was ill. This is another phenomenon known as [[anosognosia]], which is the refusal to admit that one is ill, refusing to acknowledge the illness.\n\nThis leads into the discussion on delusions in general. There are ones such as [[Cotard delusion|Cotard's Delusion]], in which people believe that they are dead, and [[Capgras delusion|Capgras syndrome]], in which one believes that everyone has been replaced by a double. There is the Alice in Wonderland syndrome, in which the person's body feels much out of proportion and delusional bicephaly.\n\n=== Part V: Consciousness ===\n\n==== Chapter 10: Honest Lying  ====\nThis chapter covers the mental disorders that afflict those who always lie, compulsively so.\n\nIt begins with Kean introducing the fact that the Japanese captured 100,000 men, many of whom were British, as prisoners of war. Some British doctors who had been captured noticed that the Japanese were depriving the men of certain nutrients to see the results. The nutrient in question was thiamine, necessary for proper brain function. Without it, many of the prisoners developed beriberi.\n\nKorsakoff's Syndrome leads to people lying compulsively, especially brain-damaged alcoholics. Back to before, the brain needs thiamine. Alcohol prevents the intestines from absorbing it, leading to thiamine shortage. Because of this shortage, the brain changes majorly.\n\nAnother way to lie, other than outright lying, is confabulation. Confabulation is not an outright lie: it happened to the patient at some point, they just cannot recall when. Memories have time stamps, and that time stamp can be corrupted. So a patient might have eaten an exquisite meal twenty years ago on their honeymoon and claimed they ate it yesterday simply because they cannot remember. Confabulation is also a defense mechanism, to protect themselves from embarrassment. When asked how many kids they have, they will often lie because \"what kind of monster forgets their children\" [sic]? It is, in short, honest lying.\n\nKean also talks about how hippocampus removal results in amnesia.\n\nWhile amnesia can be induced very easily, there is the other side of the spectrum: remembering ''everything''. Take Solomon Shereshevsky, who was sent to neurologist Aleksandr Luria by someone at a meeting after noticing Shereshevsky was not taking notes but could repeat everything he had said from that morning verbatim. He could remember things for years.\n\nA normal brain is a good balance, like a sieve.\n\n==== Chapter 11: Left, Right, and Center  ====\nThis chapter focuses on the [[corpus callosum]].\n\nThe first story is one in which a man shoots himself in the head, but misses his brain completely, blowing part of his skull off and exposing his brain. He went to the doctor, who in turn pressed the man's brain with a spatula to get a reaction out of him, which he did.\n\n[[Paul Broca]] (language) is also discussed, a linguist and a neuroscientist. His relationship (business strictly) with one Gustave Dax is also discussed.\n\nA man named W.J. had what were called \"absences\" in which he would do something and not realize he had done it and would have 20+ seizures a day. A group of scientists concluded that the corpus callosum spread seizures.\n\nKean also discusses the differences and similarities and roles of the left and right brain, and the left and right hemispheres.\n\n==== Chapter 12: The Man, the Myth, the Legend   ====\nPhineas Gage got an iron rod shot up through his skull, injuring his brain and his skull and blinding him in his left eye. His surgeon performed medical surgery on him that relieved the pressure in his skull which ultimately saved his life (King Henri II, if he had received a similar procedure, may have survived). After his surgery, Gage, usually mild, because foul-mouthed and developed ADD-like symptoms, switching from one thing to another very rapidly.\n\nKean talks about the thalamus and the prefrontal parietal network, the last chapter of this book, the last part of the brain, though not the only one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://samkean.com/thetaleoftheduelingneurosurgeons.html Author's website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons, The}}\n[[Category:Neuroscience books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{Third-party|date=April 2017}}{{long plot|date=April 2017}}\n{{Orphan|date=March 2018}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox book\n| name          = The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons\n| author        = [[Sam Kean]]\n| language      = English\n| country       = United States of America\n| published     =May 6, 2014 \n| isbn          =978-0-316-18234-8 \n| image         = The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons.jpg| caption       =\n| subject       = Non-fiction, Biology, Neuroscience, Medicine, History\n| media_type    = Print ([[Hardcover]] and [[Paperback]])\n| pages         = 407\n| dewey         = \n| congress      = \n}}\n\n'''''The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons''''', also known by its full title '''''The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons: The History of The Human Brain as Revealed by True Stories of Trauma, Madness, and Recovery''''' is a non-fictitious science book regarding the brain and its functions, written by science reporter [[Sam Kean]].

Kean effortlessly ties historical accounts, stories of madness and insanity, with the scientific breakthroughs that often followed. His writing shows that every breakthrough was borne of malady, injury, necessity.\n\n=== Part I: Gross Anatomy ===\n\n==== Introduction ====\nEach chapter begins with a rebus, a word puzzle, pertaining to the subject of the chapter. In this introductory section, Kean essentially provides some background information and summarizes how the book will continue.\n\n==== Chapter 1: The Dueling Neurosurgeons  ====\nThe first chapter begins with Kean setting the stage of a historic jousting match between King Henri II of France and Gabriel Montgomery. After jousting with Montgomery once, Henri demanded that he go a second time (which broke the laws of chivalry and good sport). It is during this second joust that Henri was whacked square in the face by his opponent's jousting pole.\n\nThis is when Kean introduces the \"dueling neurosurgeons\": Ambroise Par\u00e9 and Andreas Vesalius, both esteemed neurosurgeons at the time. Par\u00e9 was the royal surgeon at the time and was a pioneer in terms of medicine, as he refused to heed medical norms at the time due to the fact that they were often painful and useless for the patient. Vesalius  was also a royal surgeon, though in a different court, and wrote the book \"On The Fabric of the Human Body\" (an amazing medical work, effortlessly combining beautiful artwork and medicine). \n\nThey both teamed together when the king fell to try to see if they could revive him. Upon examination, the king had no fractures to his head and so it would have been assumed that nothing was wrong. The surgeons knew better, and were going to encounter the first concussion of that time. After the king's death, they found that his brain was in awful shape, \"yellowed and putrefied\" and found \"pools of blackened fluid beneath the meninges\". This is the medical discovery/advancement that would set the stage for generations to come: the fact that brain damage could be present despite no obvious fractures or surface wounds.\n\n=== Part II: Cells, Senses, Circuits ===\n\n==== Chapter 2: The Assassin's Soup  ====\nThis chapter begins with a troubled man: [[Charles J. Guiteau|Charles Guiteau]]. He had apparently heard God speak to him, saying that he should assassinate the president at the time: [[James A. Garfield|James Garfield]]. The man, arguably insane before his attempt to kill the president, had endured a lot in his life such as divorce and being relentlessly made fun of by many groups of people for his unsightly appearance. After much planning, he shot Garfield in the lower back, not killing him right away, but being the ultimate cause of his death (Guiteau claimed that doctors killed Garfield, he had just shot him).\n\nGuiteau's lawyer (who was, subsequently, his brother) George Scoville, pled insanity. Though, after many tests with various court-appointed psychologists/psychiatrists, he was declared sane because he could differentiate between right and wrong.\n\nDuring the trial, a neurosurgeon [[Edward Charles Spitzka]] pointed out that there was more than likely underlying trouble in Guiteau's mind. After the trial concluded and Guiteau passed, an autopsy of his brain was conducted. By this time, autopsy had evolved into a microscopic art, and so Spitzka took to the microscope with samples of Guiteau's brain. Of course, Spitzka found holes in his gray matter and extensive damage to the tissue that \"nourished neurons\". Later, it was declared that Guiteau was more than likely a schizophrenic.\n\nDuring this time, another scientist, [[Camillo Golgi]], was brewing up reticulum theory. He had spilled silver solution on brain samples and then looked at them under a microscope. What he saw stunned him: neurons. He noticed they had three parts: the cell body, axon, and dendrites, and he was the first to see them in such detail. He could determine no space between the neurons and emerged a supporter of reticulum theory.\n\nAnother scientist, [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]], was enamored by the pictures of neurons that Golgi produced. Despite his fascination with the drawings, though, he disagreed with reticulum theory. He noticed that, under a microscope, gray matter neurons were not fused together.\n\nThe story of another assassin follows: [[Leon Czolgosz]]. The man had a similar past to that of Guiteau, and planned to murder president [[William McKinley]] as to secure his own party's political candidate in the White House. He proceeded to shoot McKinley in the stomach and pancreas and was then sentenced to the electric chair. McKinley died of infection after eating when his stomach had not fully healed. Much to the anger of various neuroscientists and neurosurgeons alike, Czolgosz's brain was confiscated from study and destroyed.\n\nThe experiments of [[Otto Loewi]] are also mentioned. His experiment was one in which he placed two frog hearts in separate cups of saline. He sped one heart up by triggering nerves, then transferred the saline of the fast heart into the saline of the normal beating heart, resulting in the normal heart being as fast as the other heart that he had triggered. This proved that neurons did not just use electricity, but also used chemicals. But since he realized that electricity could not jump the (tiny) distance between dendrites, he concluded that the electricity transformed into transferable chemicals.\n\n==== Chapter 3: Wiring and Rewiring   ====\nHere, Kean introduces the eccentric [[James Holman]]. He was a blind explorer, a man who climbed mountains and visited all corners of the globe without sight. He was appointed the Naval Knight of Windsor, which was more illustrious than it sounded. Holman hated being home and often sank into deep bouts of depression when cooped up for too long a time.\n\nTo get around during his journeys, he carried a cane. He did not use the cane like other blind people did, feeling around with it. He used his cane to strike the ground, causing a click that he could hear. This click, in turn, echoed in his ears, creating what was essentially human echolocation.\n\nKean ties in Holman's use of his cane, to teach his brain to \"see\", with [[Grey matter|gray matter]] and [[white matter]]. He also talks extensively about circuits. Circuits essentially make up the brain, every human function being controlled by one. The circuits for breathing and yawning do not have much variation and are extremely simple. In contrast to that, the circuit that connects pictures to words, sounds to pictures (i.e. small children learning to read and associating the word ''dog'' with the actual animal) are more complicated. Negative experiences also wire circuits. A bad fright in a dark alley may cause you to flinch next time you enter one.\n\nAnother thing that concerns wiring and rewiring is the neurological phenomenon of [[synesthesia]]. There are over 60 known types of synesthesia. An example would be a synesthesiat hearing a sound and colors flooding their vision or someone reading a passage of words and each letter evokes a different color or a different smell or a different taste. Certain sounds cause the person to feel certain things in turn, or see spots of color dance across their vision. Neurologists agree that this occurs of faulty wiring in the brain, that  \"neuron circuits that process a sense accidentally strum circuits of another sense, causing both to go off simultaneously\". It is debated how this happens. As a child, one possesses more neurons than necessary and the unnecessary ones are pruned away and die when not used. Some believe that synesthesia is a result of poor pruning.\n\nAlbert Hoffman helped scientists further understand synesthesia by creating a certain psychedelic drug known as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. Created in his lab, he tried it, and was startled by the results. It ultimately showed that we all carry the latent ability of synesthesia if we knew how to tap it as LSD does.\n\nCajal (from the previous chapter) pointed out that adult neurons and neuron circuits could not renew themselves, and once they were dead, they were dead for good. He said that only children could renew their brain tissue. This is true to some extent, though for adults, while they cannot regrow neurons, they can rewire circuits in their brains with hard work.\n\n==== Chapter 4: Facing Brain Damage  ====\nThis chapter starts with the introduction of ''mutil\u00e9s'', men who had various parts of their faces blown off by the metal weapons used in the [[World War I|Great War]]. Their defaced faces, faces without noses or eyes or cheeks, were the root of much sadness and insecurity for the men, and many committed suicide. An American sculptor Anna Coleman Ladd traveled and set up a business for these men, and she would create faces for them out of plaster and ceramic and paint, making them startlingly realistic. These faces made the men happy and helped them assimilate back into society. Despite this, the faces could not smile or kiss or chew and the paint soon chipped.\n\nRelated, a Japanese scientist Tatsuji Inouye examines soldiers who had been shot through their visual cortex during battle and lost random spots of vision. Inouye figured that the spots of missing vision were connected with the spots that their brain had been shot through, and set out to map the visual cortex through talking to these soldiers.\n\nKean introduces other scientists such as the duo Hubel and Wiesel, who tried various experiments with cats to get their neurons to fire. Through many botched experiment attempts, one fateful accident led to the breakthrough that certain neurons fire at certain things. Specifically, they discovered that neurons like to track motion and can derive the shapes of objects through columns of orientation-preferring neurons.\n\nKean also, in depth, explains the role of the parietal lobe and the occipital lobe through all these accounts. He writes that the brain can stumble after injury, and the results can be serious. For example, if the visual cortex suffers damage, the person afflicted will lose many things, one of which being basic perceptual skills. Damage to the parietal lobe causes the loss of the ability to locate objects in space. Infections and viruses like [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] may make their way up to the brain and affect it.\n\nHe also covers the interesting topic of object-blindness. Someone may not recognize an object, a color, or other seemingly mundane things. Face-blind people cannot recognize faces, and can hardly discern age or gender between portrait pictures.\n\n=== Part III: Body and Brain ===\n\n==== Chapter 5: The Brain's Motor  ====\nKean begins the chapter with the sad tale of George Dedlow. George Dedlow had fought in the Civil War and in turn had both his arms and both his legs amputated for various reasons. These amputations brought on another neurological phenomenon: phantom limbs. George Dedlow, amongst millions of other war amputees, felt pain in limbs that he did not have.\n\nA neuroscientist, [[Silas Weir Mitchell (physician)|Silas Weir Mitchell]], specialized in examining amputees and was fascinated with them. He examined patients who complained of pain or discomfort in their phantom arms, legs, and genitals. Here, Kean ties the motor and sensory cortexes in. When something is amputated, the respective part of the brain for controlling that part goes black (figuratively). The now obsolete part of the brain is quickly taken over by neighboring brain areas, such as the face or arms.\n\nV. S. Ramachandran, a neuroscientist, was also fascinated with amputees and their phantom pains. One of his patients was a man with insistent pain in his arm, an arm that was in fact removed many years prior. Ramachandran proceeded to test out a treatment of his own creation. He made the man place his arms into a box, the one arm that was still attached surrounded by mirrors. The box and the mirror together provided the illusion that his arm was still intact. Then, he made the man move his hands around as if he still had both. It is after this ritual of moving his hands about that the man exclaims that he feels his pain subsiding, that he feels his phantom fist unclench for the first time in many years. Thus concludes the chapter about the brain and its motor, which essentially is responsible for every part working correctly.\n\n==== Chapter 6: The Laughing Disease  ====\nThe Laughing Disease, later referred to as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], originated in Papua, New Guinea in the tribe of the Fore (For-ay) people. It was commonplace in the tribe to consume the body when someone had passed, believing that consuming the body would speed its journey to the afterlife. Cannibalism was an important cultural norm to the Fore, though it was what ultimately spread kuru. The slow rise of this disease caught the attention of one [[Daniel Carleton Gajdusek|D.

His interest piqued (he loved to travel around the world in search of malady), he traveled to New Guinea to see what the fuss was about and try to investigate it for himself. While he was there, he collected hundreds of gallons of samples of blood and urine and sweat, trying to find how it spread (and it spread. Rapidly, in fact. It was the question of many biologists and those in the medical field alike). He bribed families for the brains of their deceased, the ones that fell victim to kuru and were going to be eaten by their relatives and used the brains he acquired to conduct autopsies as fast as possible (which were often difficult as refrigeration was often below-average and unavailable).\n\nIt is here that Kean brings up the cerebellum, the center in the brain that controls finer movements, controls the timing of movement. Very important. It was probable that a malfunction in this area of the brain was what was the root of kuru, as the symptoms (shuffling, uncontrollable laughing) were typical of that area of the brain.\n\nDuring an autopsy of a diseased brain, Gajdusek found plaque (microscopic) on many areas. He also discovered many other things that may have come from eating brains. After a long investigation of kuru, and as hundreds of people were dying from it, the phrase \"slow virus\" was brought about. Along with that, a mix between the words ''protein'' and ''infection'' was also created: [[prion]]s. Scientists found that this was how kuru was spread.\n\nThe brain has something called the [[Blood\u2013brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]] which essentially blocks everything from entering the brain, save for a few thing. For instance, if you were to inject dye into the bloodstream, every organ would turn that color except for the brain due to the BBB. It is this barrier that makes it so difficult to medicate people for mental diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimers]] and [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]]. It was hard for certain things to get it, and even harder for microbes (with the exception of syphilis and herpes). Though, proteins were one of the things that could pass through the barrier. And prions, being part protein, can thus make it through the barrier.

One such man was one by the name of John who was a giant, a farmer from South Dakota, the man who Cushing's assistant de-organed before his funeral service.\n\nThe modern study of emotion came about because of [[James Papez]], a neuroanatomist.\n\nIt is in his chapter that Kean discusses the limbic system of the brain, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala.\n\nKean recalls a story in which a woman named S.M. contracted a rare disease that killed off amygdala cells. After it was frozen and shriveled, S.M. felt no fear. She had felt fear in normal amounts at appropriate things as a child, though after the disease had run its course, she felt not a lick of it. It was nearly comical how scientists reacted: they tried (in vain) to scare her. Taking her to haunted houses, she often ran ahead, eager to find out what else awaited.\n\nAfter this tale, Kean ties it in with the limbic system, the topic of the chapter, and the temporal lobe.\n\nIn regards to the temporal lobe, Kean mentions duo [[Heinrich Kl\u00fcver]] and [[Paul Bucy]]. The pair experimented on monkeys, removing parts of their brains (the temporal lobes) and getting disastrous and disturbing results.\n\n=== Part IV: Beliefs and Delusions ===\n\n==== Chapter 8: The Sacred Disease   ====\nThe sacred disease is epilepsy, called so because many felt as if their soul met a higher power: God, in some cases. He mentions the plight of [[Wilder Penfield]]. His sister had been suffering from major epileptic fits and seizures. He then proceeded to operate on her after noticing a tumor was pressing on her brain from behind her sinuses and dually pressing down on her optic nerve, which was swollen. When he went in to operate, he had to remove 1/8 of her brain, a startling amount. After this mass excavation, he noticed that the tumor grew deep into the other brain hemisphere, and he succumbed to the fact that the tumor had won. She later died because of it, as expected.\n\nEpileptic fits are common amongst famous figures. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] was one epileptic, a temporal lobe epileptic, who fell victim to his illness time and time again, and it affected his writing greatly.\n\nA [[John Hughlings Jackson]] noticed that epileptics had uncannily similar seizures, with certain parts seizing after other parts, same sequences. This led him to believe that circuits, though different, had many similarities.\n\nThe experiment on Mary Rafferty was a strange one and arguably cruel. She had come in with a two inch gaping hole in her skull brought about by a mix of a chafing whalebone wig and cancer. Roberts Bartholomew took her in and decided to conduct an experiment. He slid two metal electrodes into her brain and started a generator, causing her to move her arms and legs about wildly. He believed he had stuck the electrodes on the motor cortex. She later died.\n\n{{See also|Cortical homunculus|l1=Sensory Homunculus}}\n\n==== Chapter 9: Sleights of Mind  ====\nWoodrow Wilson traveled the country with the intention of breaking the Senate. He instead broke himself. After complaining of headaches (among other various ailments) Wilson suffered many small strokes, and then suffered one large one that left him paralyzed and a pity to behold. Another thing: the whole left side of this world ceased to exist.\n\nHe suffered from what we now know today as [[hemispatial neglect]], which causes only one hemisphere to process things. Sufferers of this condition will only shave half their faces, eat half their food, dress only half of themselves. In memories of being in a certain place, patients might only recall the buildings on one side of the street. Wilson might have a pile of pens right next to him, but if they were not on the right side, he would complain of not having a pen on hand. He would also deny that he was ill. This is another phenomenon known as [[anosognosia]], which is the refusal to admit that one is ill, refusing to acknowledge the illness.\n\nThis leads into the discussion on delusions in general. There are ones such as [[Cotard delusion|Cotard's Delusion]], in which people believe that they are dead, and [[Capgras delusion|Capgras syndrome]], in which one believes that everyone has been replaced by a double. There is the Alice in Wonderland syndrome, in which the person's body feels much out of proportion and delusional bicephaly.\n\n=== Part V: Consciousness ===\n\n==== Chapter 10: Honest Lying  ====\nThis chapter covers the mental disorders that afflict those who always lie, compulsively so.\n\nIt begins with Kean introducing the fact that the Japanese captured 100,000 men, many of whom were British, as prisoners of war. Some British doctors who had been captured noticed that the Japanese were depriving the men of certain nutrients to see the results. The nutrient in question was thiamine, necessary for proper brain function. Without it, many of the prisoners developed beriberi.\n\nKorsakoff's Syndrome leads to people lying compulsively, especially brain-damaged alcoholics. Back to before, the brain needs thiamine. Alcohol prevents the intestines from absorbing it, leading to thiamine shortage. Because of this shortage, the brain changes majorly.\n\nAnother way to lie, other than outright lying, is confabulation. Confabulation is not an outright lie: it happened to the patient at some point, they just cannot recall when. Memories have time stamps, and that time stamp can be corrupted. So a patient might have eaten an exquisite meal twenty years ago on their honeymoon and claimed they ate it yesterday simply because they cannot remember. Confabulation is also a defense mechanism, to protect themselves from embarrassment. When asked how many kids they have, they will often lie because \"what kind of monster forgets their children\" [sic]? It is, in short, honest lying.\n\nKean also talks about how hippocampus removal results in amnesia.\n\nWhile amnesia can be induced very easily, there is the other side of the spectrum: remembering ''everything''. Take Solomon Shereshevsky, who was sent to neurologist Aleksandr Luria by someone at a meeting after noticing Shereshevsky was not taking notes but could repeat everything he had said from that morning verbatim. He could remember things for years.\n\nA normal brain is a good balance, like a sieve.\n\n==== Chapter 11: Left, Right, and Center  ====\nThis chapter focuses on the [[corpus callosum]].\n\nThe first story is one in which a man shoots himself in the head, but misses his brain completely, blowing part of his skull off and exposing his brain. He went to the doctor, who in turn pressed the man's brain with a spatula to get a reaction out of him, which he did.\n\n[[Paul Broca]] (language) is also discussed, a linguist and a neuroscientist. His relationship (business strictly) with one Gustave Dax is also discussed.\n\nA man named W.J. had what were called \"absences\" in which he would do something and not realize he had done it and would have 20+ seizures a day. A group of scientists concluded that the corpus callosum spread seizures.\n\nKean also discusses the differences and similarities and roles of the left and right brain, and the left and right hemispheres.\n\n==== Chapter 12: The Man, the Myth, the Legend   ====\nPhineas Gage got an iron rod shot up through his skull, injuring his brain and his skull and blinding him in his left eye. His surgeon performed medical surgery on him that relieved the pressure in his skull which ultimately saved his life (King Henri II, if he had received a similar procedure, may have survived). After his surgery, Gage, usually mild, because foul-mouthed and developed ADD-like symptoms, switching from one thing to another very rapidly.\n\nKean talks about the thalamus and the prefrontal parietal network, the last chapter of this book, the last part of the brain, though not the only one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://samkean.com/thetaleoftheduelingneurosurgeons.html Author's website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons, The}}\n[[Category:Neuroscience books]]\n", "name_user": "2601:280:4201:1830:cdf5:8f48:4dfa:f1ce", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eChapter 2: The Assassin's Soup)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Dueling_Neurosurgeons"}

In contrast to her French and German competitors, whose interiors were extravagantly decorated and heavily adorned, the ''Titanic'' emphasized comfort and subdued elegance more in the style of a British country manor or luxury hotel.<ref>{{harvsp|Robert Ballard|2005|p=77}}</ref> ''Titanic's'' enormous size enabled her to feature unusually large rooms, all equipped with the latest technologies for comfort, hygiene, and convenience. Staterooms and public spaces recreated historic styles with a painstaking attention to detail and accuracy. There was a wide range of recreational and sporting facilities in addition which provided ample opportunity for amusement during a voyage.\n\nAlthough closely similar to her sister ship and predecessor the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], ''Titanic'' featured additional first-class staterooms, augmented public rooms, and myriad minor improvements to enhance her luxury and comfort.\n\n[[File:Titanic cutaway diagram.png|thumb|''Titanic'' cutaway diagram]]\n\n== Location ==\nThe bulk of first-class facilities and accommodation was located on the upper decks within the superstructure of the ''Titanic'', where the vibrations and noise of the engines were at their lowest. The entirety of A-Deck was devoted to first-class recreational space and accommodation, along with most of B and C Decks. First-class facilities were located on every level down to F-Deck, which means that first-class passengers enjoyed the most space by far of any of the three classes on the ship.\n\n== Accommodation ==\n[[File:Titanic's B 59 stateroom.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'''s B 59 stateroom]]\nThe ''Titanic'' and her sister ''Olympic'' offered the finest and most luxurious first-class accommodations to be found on any contemporary ocean liner. The cheapest first-class fare could be had for \u00a323 ({{Inflation|UK|23|1912|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-2}}), without meals.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=42}}</ref> A suite could range in price from \u00a3400 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|400|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) to \u00a3870 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|870|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) for a \"Deluxe\" Parlor Suite at the height of the travelling season.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n=== Decor & Range ===\nThe \"special staterooms\" on B and C-Decks were richly appointed in 11 different period styles, including [[Adam style|Adam]], [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]], [[Louis Quinze|XV]], and [[Louis XVI style|XVI]], [[Empire style|French Empire]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]].<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 85.</ref> Some styles, like Adam or Louis XVI, had different variations used in certain staterooms which incorporated elements from other periods, bringing the total of different designs to 19 including the 11 base styles.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59</ref> In addition, there were two custom Harland and Wolff designs known as \"Bedroom A\" and \"Bedroom B\" which were used in a total of 43 bedrooms between B and C Decks. These were period-inspired but modernized and considered equal in quality to the 11 stringent period styles. Bedroom A was the plainer of the two, featuring fielded wood panels painted white, resting on a 3-foot high carved oak [[Dado (architecture)|dado]], and furnished with a brass or wooden bedstead. Bedroom B was known as the \"French cabin\" because it was Louis XV-inspired, featuring varnished oak panelling and [[Cabriolet (furniture)|Cabriolet]] furniture.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59-60</ref>\n\nIn the \"special staterooms\", there was a wide range of finely carved panelling, veneers, and marquetry made from exotic imported woods like [[Mahogany]], [[Sycamore]], [[Walnut]], [[Oak]] and [[Satinwood]]. Such was the attention to historic detail that every piece of furniture, light fixture, upholstery, and woodwork was recreated with an obsessive care for accuracy by designers and master craftsmen at Harland and Wolff. There were a small number of outside contractors hired to fit out select rooms or provide furnishings. The Dutch firm of H.P. Mutters & Zoon, for instance, fitted out twelve of the \"special staterooms\" according to the chosen period styles, supplying everything from the panelling and doors down to the sofa pillows, [[Down feather|down]] bed quilts, and wastepaper baskets.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 67-75</ref>\n\nFirst-class accommodation occupied almost the entirety of B and C Decks, but also large sections forward on A, D and E-Decks; a handful of first-class cabins were located on the boat deck between the forward grand staircase and officer's quarters.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/b-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : B Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On E-Deck staterooms and cabins were interchangeable between First and Second-Class, meaning sections could be prioritized for either one of the classes in the event of overbooking or high demand.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/e-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : E Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> Only the starboard side of E-Deck belonged to First/Second-Class, the whole of the Port side contained Third-Class and Crew cabins. The first-class corridors were in general very spartan in appearance, but the B and C Deck passageways which accessed the very finest staterooms were more impressive. These featured white-painted 'Venesta' panels (a durable type of [[plywood]]), pilasters, archways over the stateroom entrances, and a decorative [[frieze]] supported by gilt brackets running along the top of the walls which concealed the ventilation ducts and electrical wiring underneath.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\">Beveridge 2008 p. 264</ref> There were no handrails, no carpet runners, and lighting was provided by [[ormolu]] and cut-glass ceiling fixtures. On B Deck the two parallel corridors were enclosed by swinging [[baize]]-upholstered doors with [[louver]] panels, which muffled the sound coming from the stairwells and busy public rooms.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\"/>\n\nThe space which had been given over to an encircling B-Deck promenade on the ''Olympic'' was converted to additional large staterooms on ''Titanic'', the finest on board. Many of these staterooms had private entrances, separate servants' quarters, adjoining doors, and en-suite bathrooms; they could be booked in groups to accommodate families and servants. In all there were almost 330 first-class rooms, 100 of which were single-berth.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\">Description from ''International Marine Engineering'', July 1911. Tibballs, Geoff,\"The Mammoth Book of the Titanic.\" Carroll & Graf: 2002; 21.</ref>\n\nThe type of first-class stateroom that predominated was a single- or double-berth stateroom which contained a dressing table, horsehair sofa, wardrobe, and marble-topped washstand with basin. Double berth cabins had \"tipped\" washbasins on shelves that could be folded back into the cabinet to save room.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 101.</ref> Many also had additional bunks suspended over the main bed that could be folded against the wall.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Staterooms increased in size thereafter with double beds, built-in wardrobes, and comfortable seating areas. Single berth state rooms, like those on A-Deck, were decorated more modestly than the lavish period suites on B and C-Decks. Above most beds was an electrical outlet with a call button that could summon a steward, a reading lamp and a wire-mesh basket for storing small items. Although the ''Titanic'' was centrally heated, all first-class cabins contained [[electric heaters]] to provide additional warmth and passengers could get electric bed warmers on request to a steward.<ref>Hutchings, David F.; de Kerbrech, Richard P. (2011). RMS Titanic 1909\u201312 (Olympic Class): Owners' Workshop Manual. 74.</ref>\n\n=== Facilities ===\nAs was standard at the time, the bulk of first-class bathroom facilities were shared. Communal lavatories with illuminated signage could be found along the passageways divided by gender. A passenger could take a bath by notifying a steward, who would draw the bath based on availability. Because of the need to conserve limited fresh water supplies, baths were supplied with sea water; only the attached showers of the private bathrooms utilised fresh water.<ref>\"Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 13-14.</ref> ''Titanic'' had an impressive ratio of private bathrooms to passengers, more than any other ship in 1912. Virtually all of the suites on B and C Decks featured en-suite bathrooms.\n\nAlthough bed linen was changed daily, there was no laundry aboard because of limited fresh-water supplies. Passengers could get their clothes pressed and shoes polished on request, for a small fee.<ref>\"Boots & Shoes\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 29.</ref> Morning tea and pastries were served to passengers in their staterooms, but there was no room service in the modern sense \u2013 passengers had to go to the dining room to be served full breakfasts and other meals.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. 882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic, Scholastic Press, 1998; 31.</ref>\n\n=== The Parlour Suites ===\n[[File:B-58.jpg|thumb|Stateroom B-58 from the B-Deck Parlour Suite]]\nThe most splendid first-class accommodation on both the ''Titanic'' and the ''Olympic'' were the four parlour suites, two each on B and C Decks, just aft of the forward grand staircase landings. The two on B-Deck were advertised as \"Deluxe\" Parlour Suites, or Promenade Suites, because they each contained a 50&nbsp;ft. (15.24 M.) private promenade deck. The promenade deck connected to the first-class gangway entrances immediately forward, enabling the copious amounts of luggage usually carried by the ''Titanic's'' richest passengers to be loaded directly into their suites. The Parlour Suites each comprised two large bedrooms, two walk-in wardrobes, a private bathroom, lavatory, and a spacious sitting room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 57.</ref> The sitting rooms were lavish rooms that allowed for receiving small parties of guests. Each featured a faux fireplace, large card table, plush sofas and chairs, sideboards, and writing desks.\n\nThe two private promenade decks were unique to the ''Titanic'', decorated in half-timber [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]] panelling, wicker deck chairs, sofas, tables and potted plants. The deck chairs were cane, made by Dryad of Leicester.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The chairman of the [[White Star Line]], [[J. Bruce Ismay]], occupied the port-side \"Deluxe\" Suite on the ''Titanic'', while the starboard suite was occupied by the American millionaire Mrs. [[Charlotte Drake Cardeza]], her son, and entourage.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss''. 2001; 108-9.</ref>\n\n=== Condition in the Wreck ===\nThere has been relatively little exploration of the first-class staterooms on ''Titanic'' since her discovery. Only the staterooms in the bow section forward of the [[Grand Staircase of the Titanic|grand staircase]] survive in an appreciable condition. Because the cabins were all framed in pine and [[teak]], many of the walls between staterooms have deteriorated, leaving a warren of tangled electrical wiring, deep [[silt]] and wreckage treacherous to [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]]. James Cameron's 2001 ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' expedition focused on the cabins of some of the most famous ''Titanic'' passengers, including [[Henry S. Harper]], [[Molly Brown]] and [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Russell]]. Outstanding images of the marble [[Adam style|Adam]]-style fireplace in Bruce Ismay's Deluxe Suite sitting room and the gilded [[Louis Quinze]] fireplace of Mrs. Cardeza's sitting room were produced.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 108-9.</ref> Ismay's Private Promenade was also discovered, with the remnants of the distinctive half-timber panelling seen for the first time since the sinking.\n\nThe more common remains that delineate staterooms include desks and other hardwood furniture, collapsed bunks, silver-plated lamps, doors, brass bed frames, and even upright cabinets with their contents still in place on the shelves. In the debris field are strewn hundreds of items from first-class staterooms that poured out of the ship during the break-up.\n\n== Sporting facilities ==\n[[File:Gym.jpg|thumb|The gymnasium]]\nThe ''Titanic'' featured numerous sporting and relaxation facilities including:\n*A gymnasium including a punch bag, a rowing machine, exercise bikes, Stationary bicycles, two electric camels, and an electric horse.\n*[[Turkish bath]]s, [[electric bath]]s, and [[steam room]]\n*Private massage room\n*[[Swimming pool]]\n*[[Squash (sport)|Squash court]]\n*[[Barber]]\n\n=== Gymnasium ===\nThe 1st-Class Gymnasium was just aft of the forward grand staircase along the Starboard side of the Boat Deck. It was a brightly lit room with white-painted oak panelling and tile floors. Along the wall opposite the entrance was a carved oak installation with an illustrated cutaway of an [[Olympic-class ocean liner]] and a map depicting the travel routes of the [[White Star Line]] throughout the world. The room was equipped with state-of-the-art exercise equipment manufactured in [[Wiesbaden]], including two electric camels, an electric horse, a [[rowing machine]], punching bag, a weightlifting machine and mechanical bicycles.<ref>{{harvsp|Susan Wels|1997|p=34}}</ref>\n\nThere was a permanent \"Physical Educator\" on staff named T.W. McCawley who assisted passengers in using the devices. The gymnasium was open during the following hours and, like other recreational facilities aboard the ''Titanic'', segregated by gender and age:\n\n* 9:00&nbsp;am \u2013 12:00&nbsp;pm for Ladies Only\n* 1:00\u20133:00&nbsp;pm for Children Only\n* 2:00\u20136:00&nbsp;pm for Gentlemen Only\n\nThe roof of the deck house which enclosed the Gymnasium has long since collapsed and the room itself is sinking into the deck below.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Nonetheless the wood panelling that lined the walls is recognizable and so are some of the exercise machines.\n\n=== Turkish baths ===\n[[File:Cool Room of the Turkish Baths, RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|Cool Room in the Turkish Baths on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nAlong the Starboard side of F-Deck was a spa complex for first-class passengers known as the Turkish Baths. Besides the ''Titanic'', only the White Star liners [[RMS Adriatic|RMS ''Adriatic'']] (1906) and the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] (1911) featured Turkish Baths on board.<ref>Shifrin, Malcolm (2015). \"Chapter 23: The Turkish bath at sea\". Victorian Turkish Baths. Historic England. {{ISBN|978-1-84802-230-0}}.</ref>\nThere was a Temperate Room, Cool Room, Hot Room, Steam Room, [[electric bath]] and two Shampoo Rooms where massage was performed.\n\nThe Baths were segregated by sex, available to women between 9:00&nbsp;a.m. and 12:00&nbsp;p.m., and to men between 2:00&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. There was a charge of 4 shillings (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=4}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $1, per person for admission.<ref>\"Turkish Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean and the United States.' March 1910, 3rd Edition; pg. 14.</ref>\n\nThe Cool Room was the central feature of the Turkish Baths, decorated in a mix of Moorish/Arabic styles to evoke a Turkish [[Turkish bath|hamam]]. The walls were adorned with glossy blue-green tiles, richly carved teak, and bronze lamps. Against one wall was a marble drinking fountain. The ceiling was deeply recessed and painted a deep crimson, with gilded beams and hanging lanterns, supported by pillars encased in teak.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=40}}</ref> Unlike the ''Olympic'', the Titanic's cooling room did not have an exterior wall but still included \"fake\" portholes concealed by a carved Cairo curtain.  The doorways were adorned with gilded semi-domes to lend an exotic effect. Throughout the room were teak folding chairs, Damascus tables and cushioned chaise lounges for relaxation. There were also small curtained cubicles for changing.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nThe Cool Room was rediscovered in 2005 during a filming expedition for [[James Cameron]]'s documentary ''Last Mysteries of the Titanic'', in a remarkable state of preservation.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD0FNG7xvfw|title=Titanic Turkish Baths|website=YouTube|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> The room would have flooded early in the sinking and its location deep within the ship insulated it from damage when the bow hit the sea bed. It is largely protected from the destructive [[microbes]] and sea creatures which consume more exposed parts of the ship; because of this the woodwork is in good condition, even the delicate recliners and framework for the dressing rooms survive in recognizable condition.\n\n=== Swimming Pool ===\n[[File:Swimming pool of the Titanic.jpg|thumb|Swimming pool of the ''Olympic'']]\nAcross the corridor from the Turkish Baths was a heated swimming pool measuring an impressive 30&nbsp;ft. long X 14&nbsp;ft. wide and 7&nbsp;ft. deep. Water depth was 5&nbsp;ft. 4 in. at the deep end and 4&nbsp;ft. 6 in. at the shallow end.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\">{{harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413}}</ref> Heated salt water from a tank and cold sea water were pumped into the pool once the ship was out to sea. The room offered 13 changing cubicles and 2 shower stalls for convenience. The floors were tiled in blue and white linoleum, and a marble stair with teak footholds descended into the pool. The pool cost 1 shilling (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=1}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.25 to use but was open to men free of charge between 6 and 8&nbsp;a.m., for early morning exercise.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\nThe ''Olympic'' featured two [[springboard|diving boards]] which proved to be a safety hazard for divers, so they were not installed on ''Titanic''. When the ship was moving the amount of water which sloshed back and forth could make the diving-end deceptively shallow.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\" />\n\nThe entrance to the Swimming Pool is blocked by a closed watertight door along the bulkhead.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\">{{harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3}}</ref> It is presumably in good condition like the neighbouring Turkish Baths, given the slow flooding which occurred in this part of the ship and the resilient materials used in the pool's construction.\n\n=== Squash Court ===\nThe ''Titanic'' featured a Squash/Racquet Court in the bow, deep within the ship on G-Deck. It measured 30&nbsp;ft. long X 20&nbsp;ft. wide and, like the Gymnasium, had its own instructor on staff, Mr. Frederick Wright. There was an accompanying Spectator's Gallery on F-Deck overlooking the court. It could be entered only by a separate staircase starting on D-Deck, from where a passenger would descend the three decks past the viewing platform to G-Deck. The charge to play was 2 shillings (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=2}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.50, for half an hour.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n=== Barber Shop === fu  ck titanic\nA small barber shop was located just off the aft grand staircase on C-Deck, open between 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. There was a barber permanently on staff who offered shampooing, shaving, and hairdressing services for 1 shilling (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=1}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.25 each.<ref>\"Barber\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

The ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' were the first [[United Kingdom|British]] ships to feature restaurants separate from their main dining saloons. This was in imitation of the [[C\u00e9sar Ritz|Ritz]] restaurant first featured on board the [[Hamburg-Amerika]] liner [[USS America (ID-3006)|SS ''Amerika'']] in 1905, which had proven to be enormously popular.<ref>{{harvsp|Rick Archibald & Robert Ballard|2004|p=35}}</ref>\nThe restaurant could accommodate 137 diners at a time.<ref name=\"harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|37\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|37}}</ref> On the ''Olympic'' the room was sandwiched between the Second-Class promenades on either side, making it smaller than the version on ''Titanic'', whose restaurant extended to the port side of the ship and whose starboard-side promenade deck was converted to the Caf\u00e9 Parisien.\n\nThe restaurant was the preferred alternative to the main dining saloon and gave passengers the option of enjoying lavish French ''haute cuisine'' at an additional cost. A passenger could choose to eat exclusively in the restaurant for the duration of the voyage and receive a \u00a33-\u00a35 rebate on his/her ticket at the time of booking.<ref name=\"harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|37\" />  Unlike the main dining saloon, the restaurant gave passengers the freedom to eat whenever they liked (between 8&nbsp;am and 11&nbsp;pm).<ref name=\"Beveridge_282\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=282}}</ref> The restaurant was not managed by the [[White Star Line]]; Luigi Gatti ran it as a concession and his staff were not part of the regular [[Crew of the RMS Titanic|crew]].<ref name=\"Beveridge_286\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=286}}</ref>\n\nThe restaurant was one of the most luxurious rooms on the ship, decorated in the [[Neoclassicism#Architecture and the decorative arts|Louis XVI style]], with exquisitely carved French walnut panelling trimmed in gilt-brass accents.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349146/Louis-XVI-style|title=Louis XVI style|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> Fluted columns interspersed throughout the room were carved with gilded ribbons and the plaster ceilings were delicately molded with flower and ribbon motifs. Mirrors were installed within the panelling imitating windows and the room was divided into bays along either side with oval mirrors inset. Along the forward wall was a large buffet with a peach-coloured marble top and along the aft wall was a raised bandstand for the orchestra, with buffets on either side containing the silver service and cutlery.<ref>Article from \"The Shipbuilder\", June 1911.

Measuring 1,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in area, it was the largest room on board any ship in 1912, and accommodated up to 554 passengers.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 32.</ref> The ship's designers had originally planned to build an extravagant two-storey dining saloon topped by a dome for the ''Titanic'' and her sisters, like those on the rival [[Cunard]] liners ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' and ''[[RMS Mauretania (1906)|Mauretania]]''. This was vetoed early in the design stages in favour of a lavish single deck saloon which nonetheless greatly exceeded its Cunard rivals in terms of space.\n\nThe dining saloon was decorated in wooden panelling carved in the [[Jacobean style]] and painted in glossy white enamel. There were two aisles the length of the room which created a large central dining area delineated by pillars. At both the aft and forward end of this central area were two elaborately carved oak buffet stations that contrasted warmly with the otherwise entirely white room. On either side of the central seating area the room was divided into alcoves by partition walls with arched windows. In total, there were 115 tables, set for two to twelve people.<ref name=\"Beveridge_365\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=365}}</ref> Children were allowed to eat here with their parents, as long as the dining saloon was not fully booked.<ref name=\"Beveridge_177\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Titanic''{{'}}s dining saloon featured red and blue linoleum tiles. The furniture was made of oak and chairs upholstered in dark green leather, unusual in the fact that they were not swivel chairs bolted to the floor (a standard feature in other first-class dining saloons of the time). The rooms' portholes were elegantly concealed by rectangular 5&nbsp;ft. tall leaded-glass windows, giving passengers the impression that they were eating onshore instead of at sea. For even more atmosphere, the windows were lit from behind during the evening meals.<ref name=\"Beveridge_361\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=361}}</ref> The dining saloon's meals were prepared in the galley next door, which also serviced the [[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|second-class dining saloon]], located further aft on D Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_367\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=367}}</ref>\n\nOn the ''Titanic'' a seating chart for diners was drafted that remained in place the length of the voyage, though passengers could make special seating requests with the Purser at the beginning of the voyage. The dining saloon was open between 8 and 10&nbsp;am for breakfast, 1 and 2:30&nbsp;pm for lunch, and 6 and 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner.<ref>\"Meals\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 11.</ref> Passengers could dine up to 8:15 at the latest, but only on request in advance to a steward. A [[bugle]] call to the tune of \"[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]\" was sounded half an hour in advance of lunch or dinner by the ship's bugler, Peter W. Fletcher, so that passengers could dress, before a second call signalling the start of the meal.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=116}}</ref> On Sundays, beginning at 11:00&nbsp;am, the dining saloon was also used for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] service, which was conducted by the captain or, in his absence, by a minister travelling in first class. The service was accompanied by a [[Musicians of the RMS Titanic|quintet]], which included a piano.<ref name=\"Beveridge_366\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=366}}</ref> Contrary to what has often been portrayed in films, the orchestra did not play during meals.<ref name=\"Beveridge_133\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=133}}</ref>\n\n==== Condition in the Wreck, and Artifacts ====\nNot until filming for [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' in 2001 was the Dining Saloon explored. Located mid-ship, most of the room has collapsed \u2013 the aft end was severed during the break-up of the ship, allowing its contents to spill out. The very forward part survives and is accessible from the reception room, the partition wall having deteriorated. Several of the rectangular leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'' along with much of the wooden panelling, the gilded brass light fixtures, and the cast iron supports for the tables.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 81.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the ''Titanic's'' dining room chairs were recovered by the ''[[Mackay Bennett]]'' as wreckage in the weeks after the sinking, as is attested in photographs. Several of the bronze grilles from the swinging doors in the dining saloon have been identified in the debris field, along with innumerable pieces of silverware, china, and glassware from the dining saloon service.\n\n=== Verandah Caf\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Veranda caf\u00e9 on RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|The ''Olympic''{{'}}s Verandah Caf\u00e9]]\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 (also known as the Palm Court, or the Verandah and Palm Court) was divided into two rooms, located on both sides of the second-class staircase, on A Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=254}}</ref> Reminiscent of an outdoor sidewalk caf\u00e9, its rooms were brightly lit by large windows and double sliding doors that opened onto the aft end of the first-class Promenade Deck. The caf\u00e9 was elegantly furnished with wicker tables and chairs, spread out across a checkerboard tiled floor in light brown and beige.<ref name=\"Beveridge_248\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=248}}</ref> Various outdoor plants filled the rooms, including potted [[Kentia]] palms and ivy-covered trellises. It offered commanding views of the ocean but was fully enclosed so that it could be enjoyed in all types of weather, unlike the open-air caf\u00e9s on the {{RMS|Lusitania|3=2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}. First-class passengers could enjoy a selection of refreshments in the caf\u00e9.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\" />\n\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 had both smoking and non-smoking sections. The smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side, was accessible from the first-class smoking room. The non-smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side, was closed to traffic from the smoking room and on occasion used as a play area by mothers and children. To note, no such official area existed on board.<ref>.{{harvsp|E. E. O'Donnel|1998|p=64}}</ref> Contrary to the ''Titanic's'', the ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]''{{'}}s non-smoking section was frequently deserted.<ref name=\"Beveridge_250\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=250}}</ref>\n\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 was similar in style on both the ''Olympic'' and the ''Titanic''.

A fragment of the decorative bronze grille from the upper part of one of the Verandah and Palm Court windows was recovered in 1994 by [[Premiere Exhibitions]] and has been displayed in its various exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.premierexhibitions.com/exhibitions/3/3/titanic-artifact-exhibition/blog/window-frame-titanics-verandah-cafe| title=Window Frame From Titanic's Verandah Cafe| publisher=premiereexhibitions.com| access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Caf\u00e9 Parisien ===\n[[File:Titanic cafe parisien.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Titanic's'' Caf\u00e9 Parisien before climbing plants were later added to its trellised walls.]]\nThe Caf\u00e9 Parisien was a new feature on the ''Titanic'', designed to occupy a part of the space which on the ''Olympic'' served as a rarely used B-Deck promenade.

The Caf\u00e9 Parisien was most popular among young adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nIn 1912, the British magazine ''The Shipbuilder'' gave the following description of the caf\u00e9:\n\n{{quote|...a Caf\u00e9 Parisien, which is an entirely new feature on board ship, has been arranged in connection with the restaurant, and here lunches and dinners can be served under the same excellent conditions and with all the advantages of the restaurant itself...it will be seen that this caf\u00e9 has the appearance of a charming sun-lit verandah, tastefully decorated in French trellis-work with ivy and other creeping plants, and is provided with small groups of chairs surrounding convenient tables.<ref>[http://cafeparisien.com/history.php \"The 'Real' Caf\u00e9 Parisien\"], ''Caf\u00e9 Parisien''. 27 May 2013</ref>}}\n\n== Gathering places ==\nThere were many other venues that could be visited by first-class passengers, including:\n*Reception room\n*Lounge\n*Smoking room (men only)\n*Reading & writing room\n*Promenade deck\n*Grand staircase\n\n=== Smoking room ===\n[[File:SmokeRoom.jpg|thumb|First-class smoking room on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nFirst-class male passengers could enjoy a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]] smoking room, found at the aft end of A Deck just off the aft grand staircase. In keeping with social conventions of the time, the room was exclusive to men.<!--<ref name=\"Brewster, Coulter_29\" />--> In order to recreate the same atmosphere of a gentlemen's club, the room was decorated with dark [[mahogany]] panelling inlaid with [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and richly carved. Numerous large [[stained-glass]] windows were installed in pedimented niches within the panelling, illuminated from behind.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=245}}</ref> Like the lounge, the ceilings and windows were raised above the level of the Boat Deck for increased height and the room was flanked by alcoves with bay windows, also in stained-glass.\n\nThe floor was laid with blue and red linoleum tiles and the plaster ceiling was moulded with plaster medallions. In the centre of the far-back wall was a Norman Wilkinson painting, ''Plymouth Harbor'', which hung over a coal-burning fireplace in white marble. This was the only real fireplace on board: the others were installed with electric heaters.<ref name=BB245>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=252}}</ref> Square tables with raised edges (to prevent drink spillage in rough weather) dotted the room, surrounded by round club chairs upholstered in leather, of an unknown colour (probably green or burgundy).<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=246}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the fireplace was a revolving door which led to the Verandah Caf\u00e9. The room was U-shaped because the ventilation shaft from the Turbine Engine Room occupied the forward end. This area also included bathrooms.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=249}}</ref>\n\nThe Smoking Room was the preferred spot of gamblers who crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Professional card sharps also travelled on board under aliases, and the purser could do nothing but warn passengers about these swindlers, since passengers played at their own risk. At least four professional players travelled on board the ''Titanic''.<ref>{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=115}}</ref> Cigars and drinks could be made available upon request of the passengers, and were provided by the stewards of the adjacent bar.<ref name=\"Beveridge_248\" /> The bar stopped serving at 11:30&nbsp;pm and the Smoking Room itself closed at midnight.<ref>\"Smoke Room\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

No pictures of the ''Titanic's'' Smoking Room are known, only those of the ''Olympic''. Certain artifacts which once decorated the room have been recovered from the debris field, including two of the gilt-bronze chandeliers, and portions of the red and blue linoleum floor tiles.<ref>Wels, Susan.

It occupied a large space mid-ship on A-Deck, offering views onto the Promenade Deck and the ocean beyond. Intricately carved English oak panelling with intermittent motifs of musical instruments were the dominant feature of the room.<ref>Wels, Susan. ''Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner'', Time Life Books: 1997; pp. 68-9.</ref> Bronze sconces and large rounded mirrors were installed throughout. A 49-light opaque glass and ormolu [[Electrolier]] with crystal embellishment occupied the central recess of the ceiling, which was itself elaborately molded with instrumental motifs. Adjoining the open seating area were cosy alcoves with inset mirrors and tall bay windows of [[lead glass|leaded]] and [[stained glass]].\n\nThe lounge had an impressive height of 12&nbsp;ft. 3 in., enabled by raising the ceiling above the level of the Boat-Deck.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 38.</ref> Groups of tables and chairs, sofas, and armchairs upholstered in plush velvet with green and gold floral patterns were scattered throughout. At the centre of the forward wall was a gracefully carved grey marble decorative fireplace (it contained only an electric heater). A replica statue of the [[Diana of Versailles]] stood on the mantelpiece, with a large mirror above.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/artemis-versailles.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Artemis of Versailles|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> At the opposite end the wall curved and contained a wide mahogany bookcase which functioned as a lending library for first-class passengers. They could choose from a permanent collection of classics and the latest releases, which were freshly stocked on every voyage.<ref>\"Lounge\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; p. 12-13.</ref>\n\nOpen daily between 8&nbsp;am and 11&nbsp;pm, the room was used primarily for socializing and the taking of tea, coffee and light refreshment before and after dinner, serviced by a small connecting bar. It was a largely female domain but available to both sexes; because of its size it was also convenient for holding concerts and other first-class events, as is attested on the ''Olympic''.\n\n==== Artifacts from the lounge ====\nThe ''Titanic''{{'}}s lounge was destroyed when the ship broke apart, being located in an area where the midsection decks collapsed upon impact with the ocean floor. Several pieces of wreckage from the lounge have been identified in the debris field surrounding the wreck, including the [[Artemis]] statue, bronze sconces, and portions of the window frames.<ref>Dr Robert D.

They were installed after being purchased at auction when the ''Olympic'' was scrapped in 1935.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken.

The room was on the port side of the long corridor which connected the grand staircase to the lounge and was generally a female domain, though men could also use the room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 59.</ref> It was divided into two zones with a spacious main area and a smaller seating alcove off to the right separated by a porticoed doorway with [[oeil-de-boeuf]] windows. Like the lounge, the room was raised above the Boat Deck, allowing for 11&nbsp;ft. high windows and an enhanced feeling of spaciousness.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref>\n\nDecorated in a refined Georgian decorative order and painted white, the room featured delicate plaster work combined with sleek panelling, fluted columns, and a white marble fireplace. Potted palms on tall stands were placed in the corners of the room, while shaded sconces and beaded crystal chandeliers provided soft lighting. Comfortable silk-upholstered settees and chairs in shades of yellow and blue were grouped around tables and writing desks for convenience. The windows were lined with pink silk curtains and looked out onto the Promenade Deck, allowing ample sunlight to flood the room. The popularity of this space had proved disappointing aboard the ''Olympic'', and Thomas Andrews had plans to convert part of the room on the ''Titanic'' into further passenger quarters.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 40.</ref>\n\n=== Reception room ===\n[[File:Titanic-first-class-reception-room2.jpg|thumb|First-class reception on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nThe first-class dining saloon on D-Deck was preceded by a large reception room, measuring {{convert|460|m2|sqft|abbr=on|0}}, located at the foot of the forward grand staircase and encompassing the entire width of the ship. An ornate candelabra rested on the middle railing at the base of the staircase, the light oak colour of which contrasted warmly with the white-painted reception room.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=360}}</ref> The Reception area would have been the first impression of the ''Titanic'' for many first-class passengers entering through the two semi-enclosed entry vestibules on either side of the staircase. Around the corner from the reception room, forward of the staircase, was the set of three first-class elevators which ran the length of the stairwell.\n\n[[File:RMS Olympic Reception Room.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' reception room looking towards the Dining Saloon]]\nThe reception room was decorated in richly carved mahogany [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]]-style panelling painted a glossy white. Furnished with comfortable wicker chairs and Chesterfields upholstered in green damask silk, the room would have been conspicuously light and airy because of the beautifully illuminated leaded-glass windows which ran along either side of the room.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 54.</ref> These were lit naturally during the day through portholes concealed behind the windows and electrically in the evening. In contrast to the linoleum floors on the ''Olympic'', the ''Titanic''{{'}}s reception room was covered with plush [[Axminster carpet]]ing and there were potted palms in built-in holders in the corners of the alcoves.<ref name=BB355>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=355}}</ref> An imposing [[Aubusson tapestry]], ''La Chasse du duc de Guise'',<ref>{{harvsp|Philippe Masson|1998|p=30}}</ref> hung in front of the staircase. On the wall close to the tapestry were letters indicating the name of the deck.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=358}}</ref>\n\nIt was recorded on the inaugural voyage of the ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]'', whose reception hall was slightly smaller, that the room quickly filled up after dinner.<ref name=BB355 /> On the starboard side, there was an area reserved for a [[quintet]] and it held a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] [[Piano|grand piano]].<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=132}}</ref> The ''Titanic's'' reception room was enlarged in contrast to her sister ship through a reconfiguration of the two entry vestibules, reducing their size and adding broad arched entrances opening onto the foyer in front of the elevators.\n\nThe reception room was open to passengers before and after meals. Here, the orchestra played from 4 to 5&nbsp;pm while tea was served, then after dinner, from 8 to 9:15&nbsp;pm. Stewards served liquor and cigars until 11&nbsp;pm, at which time the hall closed. Generally, there were many spectators in the Room while the orchestra played.\n\n==== Entrance vestibules ====\nThe ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic'' both featured duplicate entrance vestibules on their port and starboard sides within the D-Deck reception rooms. There were sets of double gangway doors within the hull, screened by wrought-iron grilles.<ref>{{harvsp|Lynch & Marschall| 2001| p=78}}</ref> The vestibules were partially enclosed areas in the same white Jacobean-style panelling, and each contained a large sideboard for storing china. One set of French doors led into the reception room, but there was also a broad, arched entryway leading to the elevators. Separate corridors led off of the vestibules to the first-class staterooms in the forward part of D-Deck.\n\nThe ''Titanic's'' vestibules differed from those on the ''Olympic'' \u2013 they were reduced in size to make the reception room larger and they eliminated the communicating corridor between the two sides in order to enlarge the elevator foyers. The ''Olympic'' vestibules contained Third-Class staircases that led down to E-Deck, which were eliminated on ''Titanic'', and the elaborate wrought-iron grilles which covered the gangway doors were unique to ''Titanic''.\n\nIt was reported that during the sinking [[Charles Lightoller|2nd Officer Lightoller]] ordered crew members to open the port side gangway doors on D-Deck for loading more passengers into the lifeboats nearer to sea level.<ref>{{harvsp|Don Lynch & Ken Marschall|1997|p=108}}</ref> The 1986 expedition confirmed that one of the port-side doors was wide open and the inner doors pulled back.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" /> This would have significantly increased the ''Titanic's'' flooding if the crew neglected to close doors.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nSince its first exploration by [[James Cameron]] in 1995, the reception room has become one of the best-documented rooms inside the wreck of the ''Titanic''. It is accessed fairly easily via [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] from the forward stairwell, though there is a deep layer of silt and hanging [[rusticles]] which obscure large parts of the room. The ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' exploration in 2001 discovered that the ''Titanic's'' reception room differed in several minor details from the ''Olympic'': there were more support pillars, the decorative grilles of the elevator entrances were different, and there was a completely unknown wrought iron grill door in the front of the D-Deck gangway entrance.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, ''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Most of the exquisite leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'', along with much of the mahogany panelling, built-in plant holders, light fixtures, and carved framework surrounding the steel support pillars of the room. Small amounts of the original white lead paint survive in the carved creases of the woodwork, and several of the swinging doors with their bronze grilles still hang in the entrance vestibule doorways.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" />\n\n=== Promenade and Boat Decks ===\n[[File:RMS Olympic promenade deck.jpg|thumb|Promenade Deck on the RMS ''Olympic''. The entrance to the aft grand staircase is in the foreground.]]\n\nThe Promenade Deck encircled the whole of A-Deck and together with the middle part of the Boat Deck constituted the outdoor space for first-class passengers to enjoy the sea air and take exercise. Grand first-class public rooms with their large bay windows, like the smoking room and lounge, characterise the aft end of the Promenade. The forward end is distinguished by the stateroom windows which lined the walls along either side, with their heavy bronze frames and etched glass panes.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 58.</ref> Parts of this deck were as wide as 30&nbsp;ft. and sheltered alcoves at points along the deck were used to store the dozens of folded teak deckchairs which passengers could rent during the voyage.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\" />\n\nThe aft end of the Promenade was a large open air space flanked by two large cargo [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. This part of the deck was installed with wooden slatted wrought iron benches from where passengers could enjoy views of the stern and the sea. [[Francis Browne]] took several photos of this area on the ''Titanic'', including a famous one of 6 year old [[Polar the Titanic Bear|Douglas Spedden]] spinning a top with his father.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 66.</ref>  A key distinguishing feature between the ''Titanic'' and her sister ship is the ''Titanic'''s enclosed forward Promenade Deck, which was installed as protection against the elements and to reinforce a part of the ship prone to heavy vibration. Both had proven to be issues on board the ''Olympic.''<ref>Matsen, Brad. \"Titanic's Last Secrets: The Further Adventures of Shadow Divers John Chatterton & Richie Kohler\" Hachette: 2008; 132.</ref>\n\nDeck chairs and steamer rugs could be rented at the Purser's Office for 4 shillings/1 dollar each, which applied for the entire voyage. Stewards would bring broth and hot drinks for passengers to enjoy if requested.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 31.</ref> Oftentimes a passenger could spend the entire day relaxing and reading in his/her deck chair. The Promenade Deck was popular for playing games like [[shuffleboard]], deck quoits, [[dominoes]], and [[chess]], which could be obtained from the Quartermaster.\n\nThe middle part of the Boat Deck also served as a 200&nbsp;ft. long open-air promenade for first-class passengers between the officer's promenade at the forward end and the second-class promenade further aft. The gymnasium was located on the starboard side and the raised roof of the lounge, 82&nbsp;ft. above the waterline, functioned as a large sun deck where deckchairs could be set up.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., ''The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.'' Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref> This part of the deck was occupied by only four of the ''Titanic's'' 20 lifeboats, which were swung out to the side of the ship at the beginning of the voyage to leave the decks totally uncluttered for the first class.\n\nThe deck chairs from ''Titanic'', 614 in all between the first- and second-class areas, have become some of the most recognisable artefacts from the liner. Chief Baker [[Charles Joughin]] described throwing dozens overboard from the Promenade Deck during the sinking to be used as flotation devices; passing ships in the weeks after the sinking encountered islands of floating debris including deck chairs. About 10 of ''Titanic's'' deck chairs are known today, including one in the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia and one in the [[Museum of the City of New York]].<ref name=\"usatoday2\">{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-07/titanic-rearrange-deck-chairs/54084648/1|title=Titanic deck chairs' sad symbolism lives on|website=USATODAY.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\"artnet\">{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/deck-chair-titanic-museum-new-york-614054|title=See Deck Chair Salvaged from the &#039;Titanic&#039; &#124; artnet News|website=news.artnet.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/arts/design/one-titanic-survivor-goes-on-view-a-deck-chair.html?_r=0|title=One Titanic Survivor Goes on View: A Deck Chair|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Grand staircase ===\n{{Further|Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic}}\n[[File:Grand staircase.jpg|thumb|The grand staircase on board the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nThe grand staircase was one of the most impressive features on board the ''Titanic'' and the centre of first-class activity. The main stairwell was located in the forward part of the ship and began on the Boat Deck, extending six flights down to E-Deck. B and D Decks contained entry foyers on either side where first-class passengers would embark and disembark, the D-Deck entryway leading directly into the reception room. Each level was constructed in solid [[English oak]] with sweeping curves and the surrounding spaces panelled in the sleek neoclassical [[English Baroque|William and Mary]] style. The balustrades displayed distinctive wrought iron grilles with ormolu swags in the style of [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]].<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic,'' Carlton Press: 1997; pp. 36-7</ref> The A-Deck level was undoubtedly the most spectacular and is the most recognisable due to its frequent depiction in film.\n\nThe staircase was crowned by an extravagant [[wrought iron]] and glass dome with a large chandelier at the centre. This dome was installed on the roof of the boat deck and provided natural light to the stairwell before being artificially lit at night from behind. On the central landing of the A-Deck staircase was an exquisitely carved clock with allegorical figures on either side, known as ''Honour and Glory crowning Time.''<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic: An Illustrated History,'' Wellfleet Press: 2005; pp. 52-3</ref> At the foot of the staircase, on the newel post of the middle balustrade, was a bronze cherub holding an electric torch. B and C Decks probably had smaller replicas of these cherubs at either corner of the staircases, and contained landscape oil paintings as the focal points of their landings instead of the unique clock on A-Deck.\n\nFrom the grand staircase a passenger could access almost all of the facilities available in first class, level by level:\n\n* The Boat Deck level gave access to the outside promenade space, sun deck, the lifeboats, and the adjoining Gymnasium. The A-Deck level accessed first-class accommodation at the forward part of the ship and the grand public rooms located further aft via a long corridor. Entry vestibules opened onto the encircling Promenade Deck from the stairway.\n* B and C Decks connected to the main corridors containing the bulk of first-class accommodation, including the extravagant 'Millionaire's Suites' located immediately off the B-Deck level staircase. On the Starboard side of the C-Deck staircase was the Purser's Office, where passengers stored their jewellery and other valuable belongings during the voyage.\n* On D-Deck the staircase opened directly onto the reception room and adjoining Dining Saloon. Instead of a cherub, the central post of the staircase contained an impressive gilt candelabra with electric lights.<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\" /> Behind the staircases were installed the three first-class elevators which ran between E and A Decks.\n* On E-Deck the staircase narrowed and lost the sweeping curve of the upper flights; a modest single flight terminated on F-Deck, where the Turkish Baths and Swimming Pool could be reached.\n\n== Aft grand staircase ==\n[[File:RMS Olympic aft grand staircase.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' Aft grand staircase]]\nThere was in fact a second grand staircase located further aft in the ship, between the third and fourth funnels. It was in the same style as the forward grand staircase with an illuminated dome at the centre, but it was smaller and only installed between A, B, and C Decks. A simple clock graced the main landing in contrast to the ornate \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" clock in the forward Staircase. One could access the Smoking Room immediately off the A-Deck level, and the lounge via a long companionway with revolving doors on the port side.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/a-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : A Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On the ''Titanic'' there were two additional stateroom suites installed on either side of the A-Deck staircase, one of which was occupied by [[Thomas Andrews]], the ship's builder.\n\nThe whole of the B-Deck foyer was used as a reception area for patrons of the \u00c1 La Carte Restaurant and Caf\u00e9 Parisien, specially designed in the [[Georgian style|Georgian]] style and painted white like the main reception room on D-Deck. There was a recess for coat storage and comfortable [[rattan]] seating was arranged in groups throughout the room. This was in contrast to the B-Deck foyer of ''Olympic'', where there was no restaurant reception room and the foyer space was much smaller because of additional cabins and storage rooms.\n\nThis staircase was located just aft of where the ''Titanic'' broke apart during the sinking and was totally destroyed. It is assumed to be the source of much of the woodwork recovered as wreckage after the sinking.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|Second and Third-Class facilities on the RMS Titanic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n  | last1 = Archibald\n  | first1 = Rick\n  | last2 = Ballard\n  | first2 = Robert\n  | year = 2005\n  | title =The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 978-1-59223-424-0\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Beveridge\n  | first1 = Bruce\n  | year = 2009\n  | title = The Ship Magnificent, Volume Two: Interior Design & Fitting\n  | publisher = The History Press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7524-4626-4\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Chirnside\n  | first1 = Mark\n  | year = 2004\n  | title = The Olympic-class ships : \" Olympic \", \" Titanic \", \" Britannic \"\n  | publisher = Tempus\n  | isbn = 0-7524-2868-3\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 2003\n  | title = Ghosts of the Abyss\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 0-306-81223-1\n  | ref = harv\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/ghostsofabyssjou0000lync\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 1997\n  | title = Titanic: An Illustrated History\n  | publisher = Wellfleet press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7858-1972-1\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Marschall\n | first1 = Ken\n | year = 2001\n | title = James Cameron's Titanic Expedition: What We Saw on and Inside the Wreck\n | publisher = marconigraph.com\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = O'Donnel\n  | first1 = E.

In contrast to her French and German competitors, whose interiors were extravagantly decorated and heavily adorned, the ''Titanic'' emphasized comfort and subdued elegance more in the style of a British country manor or luxury hotel.<ref>{{harvsp|Robert Ballard|2005|p=77}}</ref> ''Titanic's'' enormous size enabled her to feature unusually large rooms, all equipped with the latest technologies for comfort, hygiene, and convenience. Staterooms and public spaces recreated historic styles with a painstaking attention to detail and accuracy. There was a wide range of recreational and sporting facilities in addition which provided ample opportunity for amusement during a voyage.\n\nAlthough closely similar to her sister ship and predecessor the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], ''Titanic'' featured additional first-class staterooms, augmented public rooms, and myriad minor improvements to enhance her luxury and comfort.\n\n[[File:Titanic cutaway diagram.png|thumb|''Titanic'' cutaway diagram]]\n\n== Location ==\nThe bulk of first-class facilities and accommodation was located on the upper decks within the superstructure of the ''Titanic'', where the vibrations and noise of the engines were at their lowest. The entirety of A-Deck was devoted to first-class recreational space and accommodation, along with most of B and C Decks. First-class facilities were located on every level down to F-Deck, which means that first-class passengers enjoyed the most space by far of any of the three classes on the ship.\n\n== Accommodation ==\n[[File:Titanic's B 59 stateroom.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'''s B 59 stateroom]]\nThe ''Titanic'' and her sister ''Olympic'' offered the finest and most luxurious first-class accommodations to be found on any contemporary ocean liner. The cheapest first-class fare could be had for \u00a323 ({{Inflation|UK|23|1912|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-2}}), without meals.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=42}}</ref> A suite could range in price from \u00a3400 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|400|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) to \u00a3870 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|870|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) for a \"Deluxe\" Parlor Suite at the height of the travelling season.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n=== Decor & Range ===\nThe \"special staterooms\" on B and C-Decks were richly appointed in 11 different period styles, including [[Adam style|Adam]], [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]], [[Louis Quinze|XV]], and [[Louis XVI style|XVI]], [[Empire style|French Empire]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]].<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 85.</ref> Some styles, like Adam or Louis XVI, had different variations used in certain staterooms which incorporated elements from other periods, bringing the total of different designs to 19 including the 11 base styles.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59</ref> In addition, there were two custom Harland and Wolff designs known as \"Bedroom A\" and \"Bedroom B\" which were used in a total of 43 bedrooms between B and C Decks. These were period-inspired but modernized and considered equal in quality to the 11 stringent period styles. Bedroom A was the plainer of the two, featuring fielded wood panels painted white, resting on a 3-foot high carved oak [[Dado (architecture)|dado]], and furnished with a brass or wooden bedstead. Bedroom B was known as the \"French cabin\" because it was Louis XV-inspired, featuring varnished oak panelling and [[Cabriolet (furniture)|Cabriolet]] furniture.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59-60</ref>\n\nIn the \"special staterooms\", there was a wide range of finely carved panelling, veneers, and marquetry made from exotic imported woods like [[Mahogany]], [[Sycamore]], [[Walnut]], [[Oak]] and [[Satinwood]]. Such was the attention to historic detail that every piece of furniture, light fixture, upholstery, and woodwork was recreated with an obsessive care for accuracy by designers and master craftsmen at Harland and Wolff. There were a small number of outside contractors hired to fit out select rooms or provide furnishings. The Dutch firm of H.P. Mutters & Zoon, for instance, fitted out twelve of the \"special staterooms\" according to the chosen period styles, supplying everything from the panelling and doors down to the sofa pillows, [[Down feather|down]] bed quilts, and wastepaper baskets.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 67-75</ref>\n\nFirst-class accommodation occupied almost the entirety of B and C Decks, but also large sections forward on A, D and E-Decks; a handful of first-class cabins were located on the boat deck between the forward grand staircase and officer's quarters.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/b-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : B Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On E-Deck staterooms and cabins were interchangeable between First and Second-Class, meaning sections could be prioritized for either one of the classes in the event of overbooking or high demand.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/e-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : E Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> Only the starboard side of E-Deck belonged to First/Second-Class, the whole of the Port side contained Third-Class and Crew cabins. The first-class corridors were in general very spartan in appearance, but the B and C Deck passageways which accessed the very finest staterooms were more impressive. These featured white-painted 'Venesta' panels (a durable type of [[plywood]]), pilasters, archways over the stateroom entrances, and a decorative [[frieze]] supported by gilt brackets running along the top of the walls which concealed the ventilation ducts and electrical wiring underneath.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\">Beveridge 2008 p. 264</ref> There were no handrails, no carpet runners, and lighting was provided by [[ormolu]] and cut-glass ceiling fixtures. On B Deck the two parallel corridors were enclosed by swinging [[baize]]-upholstered doors with [[louver]] panels, which muffled the sound coming from the stairwells and busy public rooms.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\"/>\n\nThe space which had been given over to an encircling B-Deck promenade on the ''Olympic'' was converted to additional large staterooms on ''Titanic'', the finest on board. Many of these staterooms had private entrances, separate servants' quarters, adjoining doors, and en-suite bathrooms; they could be booked in groups to accommodate families and servants. In all there were almost 330 first-class rooms, 100 of which were single-berth.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\">Description from ''International Marine Engineering'', July 1911. Tibballs, Geoff,\"The Mammoth Book of the Titanic.\" Carroll & Graf: 2002; 21.</ref>\n\nThe type of first-class stateroom that predominated was a single- or double-berth stateroom which contained a dressing table, horsehair sofa, wardrobe, and marble-topped washstand with basin. Double berth cabins had \"tipped\" washbasins on shelves that could be folded back into the cabinet to save room.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 101.</ref> Many also had additional bunks suspended over the main bed that could be folded against the wall.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Staterooms increased in size thereafter with double beds, built-in wardrobes, and comfortable seating areas. Single berth state rooms, like those on A-Deck, were decorated more modestly than the lavish period suites on B and C-Decks. Above most beds was an electrical outlet with a call button that could summon a steward, a reading lamp and a wire-mesh basket for storing small items. Although the ''Titanic'' was centrally heated, all first-class cabins contained [[electric heaters]] to provide additional warmth and passengers could get electric bed warmers on request to a steward.<ref>Hutchings, David F.; de Kerbrech, Richard P. (2011). RMS Titanic 1909\u201312 (Olympic Class): Owners' Workshop Manual. 74.</ref>\n\n=== Facilities ===\nAs was standard at the time, the bulk of first-class bathroom facilities were shared. Communal lavatories with illuminated signage could be found along the passageways divided by gender. A passenger could take a bath by notifying a steward, who would draw the bath based on availability. Because of the need to conserve limited fresh water supplies, baths were supplied with sea water; only the attached showers of the private bathrooms utilised fresh water.<ref>\"Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 13-14.</ref> ''Titanic'' had an impressive ratio of private bathrooms to passengers, more than any other ship in 1912. Virtually all of the suites on B and C Decks featured en-suite bathrooms.\n\nAlthough bed linen was changed daily, there was no laundry aboard because of limited fresh-water supplies. Passengers could get their clothes pressed and shoes polished on request, for a small fee.<ref>\"Boots & Shoes\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

The two on B-Deck were advertised as \"Deluxe\" Parlour Suites, or Promenade Suites, because they each contained a 50&nbsp;ft. (15.24 M.) private promenade deck. The promenade deck connected to the first-class gangway entrances immediately forward, enabling the copious amounts of luggage usually carried by the ''Titanic's'' richest passengers to be loaded directly into their suites. The Parlour Suites each comprised two large bedrooms, two walk-in wardrobes, a private bathroom, lavatory, and a spacious sitting room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 57.</ref> The sitting rooms were lavish rooms that allowed for receiving small parties of guests. Each featured a faux fireplace, large card table, plush sofas and chairs, sideboards, and writing desks.\n\nThe two private promenade decks were unique to the ''Titanic'', decorated in half-timber [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]] panelling, wicker deck chairs, sofas, tables and potted plants. The deck chairs were cane, made by Dryad of Leicester.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The chairman of the [[White Star Line]], [[J. Bruce Ismay]], occupied the port-side \"Deluxe\" Suite on the ''Titanic'', while the starboard suite was occupied by the American millionaire Mrs. [[Charlotte Drake Cardeza]], her son, and entourage.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss''. 2001; 108-9.</ref>\n\n=== Condition in the Wreck ===\nThere has been relatively little exploration of the first-class staterooms on ''Titanic'' since her discovery. Only the staterooms in the bow section forward of the [[Grand Staircase of the Titanic|grand staircase]] survive in an appreciable condition. Because the cabins were all framed in pine and [[teak]], many of the walls between staterooms have deteriorated, leaving a warren of tangled electrical wiring, deep [[silt]] and wreckage treacherous to [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]]. James Cameron's 2001 ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' expedition focused on the cabins of some of the most famous ''Titanic'' passengers, including [[Henry S. Harper]], [[Molly Brown]] and [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Russell]]. Outstanding images of the marble [[Adam style|Adam]]-style fireplace in Bruce Ismay's Deluxe Suite sitting room and the gilded [[Louis Quinze]] fireplace of Mrs. Cardeza's sitting room were produced.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 108-9.</ref> Ismay's Private Promenade was also discovered, with the remnants of the distinctive half-timber panelling seen for the first time since the sinking.\n\nThe more common remains that delineate staterooms include desks and other hardwood furniture, collapsed bunks, silver-plated lamps, doors, brass bed frames, and even upright cabinets with their contents still in place on the shelves. In the debris field are strewn hundreds of items from first-class staterooms that poured out of the ship during the break-up.\n\n== Sporting facilities ==\n[[File:Gym.jpg|thumb|The gymnasium]]\nThe ''Titanic'' featured numerous sporting and relaxation facilities including:\n*A gymnasium including a punch bag, a rowing machine, exercise bikes, Stationary bicycles, two electric camels, and an electric horse.\n*[[Turkish bath]]s, [[electric bath]]s, and [[steam room]]\n*Private massage room\n*[[Swimming pool]]\n*[[Squash (sport)|Squash court]]\n*[[Barber]]\n\n=== Gymnasium ===\nThe 1st-Class Gymnasium was just aft of the forward grand staircase along the Starboard side of the Boat Deck. It was a brightly lit room with white-painted oak panelling and tile floors. Along the wall opposite the entrance was a carved oak installation with an illustrated cutaway of an [[Olympic-class ocean liner]] and a map depicting the travel routes of the [[White Star Line]] throughout the world. The room was equipped with state-of-the-art exercise equipment manufactured in [[Wiesbaden]], including two electric camels, an electric horse, a [[rowing machine]], punching bag, a weightlifting machine and mechanical bicycles.<ref>{{harvsp|Susan Wels|1997|p=34}}</ref>\n\nThere was a permanent \"Physical Educator\" on staff named T.W. McCawley who assisted passengers in using the devices. The gymnasium was open during the following hours and, like other recreational facilities aboard the ''Titanic'', segregated by gender and age:\n\n* 9:00&nbsp;am \u2013 12:00&nbsp;pm for Ladies Only\n* 1:00\u20133:00&nbsp;pm for Children Only\n* 2:00\u20136:00&nbsp;pm for Gentlemen Only\n\nThe roof of the deck house which enclosed the Gymnasium has long since collapsed and the room itself is sinking into the deck below.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Nonetheless the wood panelling that lined the walls is recognizable and so are some of the exercise machines.\n\n=== Turkish baths ===\n[[File:Cool Room of the Turkish Baths, RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|Cool Room in the Turkish Baths on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nAlong the Starboard side of F-Deck was a spa complex for first-class passengers known as the Turkish Baths. Besides the ''Titanic'', only the White Star liners [[RMS Adriatic|RMS ''Adriatic'']] (1906) and the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] (1911) featured Turkish Baths on board.<ref>Shifrin, Malcolm (2015). \"Chapter 23: The Turkish bath at sea\". Victorian Turkish Baths. Historic England. {{ISBN|978-1-84802-230-0}}.</ref>\nThere was a Temperate Room, Cool Room, Hot Room, Steam Room, [[electric bath]] and two Shampoo Rooms where massage was performed.\n\nThe Baths were segregated by sex, available to women between 9:00&nbsp;a.m. and 12:00&nbsp;p.m., and to men between 2:00&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. There was a charge of 4 shillings (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=4}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $1, per person for admission.<ref>\"Turkish Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean and the United States.' March 1910, 3rd Edition; pg. 14.</ref>\n\nThe Cool Room was the central feature of the Turkish Baths, decorated in a mix of Moorish/Arabic styles to evoke a Turkish [[Turkish bath|hamam]]. The walls were adorned with glossy blue-green tiles, richly carved teak, and bronze lamps. Against one wall was a marble drinking fountain. The ceiling was deeply recessed and painted a deep crimson, with gilded beams and hanging lanterns, supported by pillars encased in teak.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=40}}</ref> Unlike the ''Olympic'', the Titanic's cooling room did not have an exterior wall but still included \"fake\" portholes concealed by a carved Cairo curtain.  The doorways were adorned with gilded semi-domes to lend an exotic effect. Throughout the room were teak folding chairs, Damascus tables and cushioned chaise lounges for relaxation. There were also small curtained cubicles for changing.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nThe Cool Room was rediscovered in 2005 during a filming expedition for [[James Cameron]]'s documentary ''Last Mysteries of the Titanic'', in a remarkable state of preservation.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD0FNG7xvfw|title=Titanic Turkish Baths|website=YouTube|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> The room would have flooded early in the sinking and its location deep within the ship insulated it from damage when the bow hit the sea bed. It is largely protected from the destructive [[microbes]] and sea creatures which consume more exposed parts of the ship; because of this the woodwork is in good condition, even the delicate recliners and framework for the dressing rooms survive in recognizable condition.\n\n=== Swimming Pool ===\n[[File:Swimming pool of the Titanic.jpg|thumb|Swimming pool of the ''Olympic'']]\nAcross the corridor from the Turkish Baths was a heated swimming pool measuring an impressive 30&nbsp;ft. long X 14&nbsp;ft. wide and 7&nbsp;ft. deep. Water depth was 5&nbsp;ft. 4 in. at the deep end and 4&nbsp;ft. 6 in. at the shallow end.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\">{{harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413}}</ref> Heated salt water from a tank and cold sea water were pumped into the pool once the ship was out to sea. The room offered 13 changing cubicles and 2 shower stalls for convenience. The floors were tiled in blue and white linoleum, and a marble stair with teak footholds descended into the pool. The pool cost 1 shilling (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=1}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.25 to use but was open to men free of charge between 6 and 8&nbsp;a.m., for early morning exercise.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\nThe ''Olympic'' featured two [[springboard|diving boards]] which proved to be a safety hazard for divers, so they were not installed on ''Titanic''. When the ship was moving the amount of water which sloshed back and forth could make the diving-end deceptively shallow.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\" />\n\nThe entrance to the Swimming Pool is blocked by a closed watertight door along the bulkhead.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\">{{harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3}}</ref> It is presumably in good condition like the neighbouring Turkish Baths, given the slow flooding which occurred in this part of the ship and the resilient materials used in the pool's construction.\n\n=== Squash Court ===\nThe ''Titanic'' featured a Squash/Racquet Court in the bow, deep within the ship on G-Deck. It measured 30&nbsp;ft. long X 20&nbsp;ft. wide and, like the Gymnasium, had its own instructor on staff, Mr. Frederick Wright. There was an accompanying Spectator's Gallery on F-Deck overlooking the court. It could be entered only by a separate staircase starting on D-Deck, from where a passenger would descend the three decks past the viewing platform to G-Deck. The charge to play was 2 shillings (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=2}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.50, for half an hour.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n=== Barber Shop ===\nA small barber shop was located just off the aft grand staircase on C-Deck, open between 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. There was a barber permanently on staff who offered shampooing, shaving, and hairdressing services for 1 shilling (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=1}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.25 each.<ref>\"Barber\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

Measuring 1,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in area, it was the largest room on board any ship in 1912, and accommodated up to 554 passengers.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 32.</ref> The ship's designers had originally planned to build an extravagant two-storey dining saloon topped by a dome for the ''Titanic'' and her sisters, like those on the rival [[Cunard]] liners ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' and ''[[RMS Mauretania (1906)|Mauretania]]''. This was vetoed early in the design stages in favour of a lavish single deck saloon which nonetheless greatly exceeded its Cunard rivals in terms of space.\n\nThe dining saloon was decorated in wooden panelling carved in the [[Jacobean style]] and painted in glossy white enamel. There were two aisles the length of the room which created a large central dining area delineated by pillars. At both the aft and forward end of this central area were two elaborately carved oak buffet stations that contrasted warmly with the otherwise entirely white room. On either side of the central seating area the room was divided into alcoves by partition walls with arched windows. In total, there were 115 tables, set for two to twelve people.<ref name=\"Beveridge_365\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=365}}</ref> Children were allowed to eat here with their parents, as long as the dining saloon was not fully booked.<ref name=\"Beveridge_177\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Titanic''{{'}}s dining saloon featured red and blue linoleum tiles. The furniture was made of oak and chairs upholstered in dark green leather, unusual in the fact that they were not swivel chairs bolted to the floor (a standard feature in other first-class dining saloons of the time). The rooms' portholes were elegantly concealed by rectangular 5&nbsp;ft. tall leaded-glass windows, giving passengers the impression that they were eating onshore instead of at sea. For even more atmosphere, the windows were lit from behind during the evening meals.<ref name=\"Beveridge_361\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=361}}</ref> The dining saloon's meals were prepared in the galley next door, which also serviced the [[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|second-class dining saloon]], located further aft on D Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_367\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=367}}</ref>\n\nOn the ''Titanic'' a seating chart for diners was drafted that remained in place the length of the voyage, though passengers could make special seating requests with the Purser at the beginning of the voyage. The dining saloon was open between 8 and 10&nbsp;am for breakfast, 1 and 2:30&nbsp;pm for lunch, and 6 and 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner.<ref>\"Meals\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

A [[bugle]] call to the tune of \"[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]\" was sounded half an hour in advance of lunch or dinner by the ship's bugler, Peter W. Fletcher, so that passengers could dress, before a second call signalling the start of the meal.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=116}}</ref> On Sundays, beginning at 11:00&nbsp;am, the dining saloon was also used for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] service, which was conducted by the captain or, in his absence, by a minister travelling in first class.

Located mid-ship, most of the room has collapsed \u2013 the aft end was severed during the break-up of the ship, allowing its contents to spill out. The very forward part survives and is accessible from the reception room, the partition wall having deteriorated. Several of the rectangular leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'' along with much of the wooden panelling, the gilded brass light fixtures, and the cast iron supports for the tables.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 81.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the ''Titanic's'' dining room chairs were recovered by the ''[[Mackay Bennett]]'' as wreckage in the weeks after the sinking, as is attested in photographs. Several of the bronze grilles from the swinging doors in the dining saloon have been identified in the debris field, along with innumerable pieces of silverware, china, and glassware from the dining saloon service.\n\n=== Verandah Caf\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Veranda caf\u00e9 on RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|The ''Olympic''{{'}}s Verandah Caf\u00e9]]\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 (also known as the Palm Court, or the Verandah and Palm Court) was divided into two rooms, located on both sides of the second-class staircase, on A Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=254}}</ref> Reminiscent of an outdoor sidewalk caf\u00e9, its rooms were brightly lit by large windows and double sliding doors that opened onto the aft end of the first-class Promenade Deck.

First-class passengers could enjoy a selection of refreshments in the caf\u00e9.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\" />\n\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 had both smoking and non-smoking sections. The smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side, was accessible from the first-class smoking room. The non-smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side, was closed to traffic from the smoking room and on occasion used as a play area by mothers and children. To note, no such official area existed on board.<ref>.{{harvsp|E. E.

In keeping with social conventions of the time, the room was exclusive to men.<!--<ref name=\"Brewster, Coulter_29\" />--> In order to recreate the same atmosphere of a gentlemen's club, the room was decorated with dark [[mahogany]] panelling inlaid with [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and richly carved. Numerous large [[stained-glass]] windows were installed in pedimented niches within the panelling, illuminated from behind.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=245}}</ref> Like the lounge, the ceilings and windows were raised above the level of the Boat Deck for increased height and the room was flanked by alcoves with bay windows, also in stained-glass.\n\nThe floor was laid with blue and red linoleum tiles and the plaster ceiling was moulded with plaster medallions. In the centre of the far-back wall was a Norman Wilkinson painting, ''Plymouth Harbor'', which hung over a coal-burning fireplace in white marble. This was the only real fireplace on board: the others were installed with electric heaters.<ref name=BB245>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=252}}</ref> Square tables with raised edges (to prevent drink spillage in rough weather) dotted the room, surrounded by round club chairs upholstered in leather, of an unknown colour (probably green or burgundy).<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=246}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the fireplace was a revolving door which led to the Verandah Caf\u00e9. The room was U-shaped because the ventilation shaft from the Turbine Engine Room occupied the forward end. This area also included bathrooms.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=249}}</ref>\n\nThe Smoking Room was the preferred spot of gamblers who crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Professional card sharps also travelled on board under aliases, and the purser could do nothing but warn passengers about these swindlers, since passengers played at their own risk. At least four professional players travelled on board the ''Titanic''.<ref>{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=115}}</ref> Cigars and drinks could be made available upon request of the passengers, and were provided by the stewards of the adjacent bar.<ref name=\"Beveridge_248\" /> The bar stopped serving at 11:30&nbsp;pm and the Smoking Room itself closed at midnight.<ref>\"Smoke Room\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

It occupied a large space mid-ship on A-Deck, offering views onto the Promenade Deck and the ocean beyond. Intricately carved English oak panelling with intermittent motifs of musical instruments were the dominant feature of the room.<ref>Wels, Susan. ''Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner'', Time Life Books: 1997; pp. 68-9.</ref> Bronze sconces and large rounded mirrors were installed throughout. A 49-light opaque glass and ormolu [[Electrolier]] with crystal embellishment occupied the central recess of the ceiling, which was itself elaborately molded with instrumental motifs. Adjoining the open seating area were cosy alcoves with inset mirrors and tall bay windows of [[lead glass|leaded]] and [[stained glass]].\n\nThe lounge had an impressive height of 12&nbsp;ft. 3 in., enabled by raising the ceiling above the level of the Boat-Deck.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 38.</ref> Groups of tables and chairs, sofas, and armchairs upholstered in plush velvet with green and gold floral patterns were scattered throughout.

They were installed after being purchased at auction when the ''Olympic'' was scrapped in 1935.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'' WellFleet Press: 1997; 46-47.</ref> This room gives the best approximation of how the lounge appeared on the ''Olympic'' and thereby the ''Titanic''. The impressive Electrolier of the ''Olympic'' is also preserved at Cutler's Hall in [[Sheffield, England]].<ref name=\"cutlers-hallamshire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cutlers-hallamshire.org.uk/history/the-hall-and-its-collections|website=cutlers-hallamshire.org.uk|title=The Hall and its Collections|accessdate=2017-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809041254/http://www.cutlers-hallamshire.org.uk/history/the-hall-and-its-collections|archive-date=9 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Reading and writing room ===\n[[File:RMS Titanic's reading and writing room.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Titanic'''s Reading and Writing Room]]\nAs the title indicates, the reading and writing room was a leisurely space on A-Deck for relaxation, reading, and writing home to family and friends. The room was on the port side of the long corridor which connected the grand staircase to the lounge and was generally a female domain, though men could also use the room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 59.</ref> It was divided into two zones with a spacious main area and a smaller seating alcove off to the right separated by a porticoed doorway with [[oeil-de-boeuf]] windows. Like the lounge, the room was raised above the Boat Deck, allowing for 11&nbsp;ft. high windows and an enhanced feeling of spaciousness.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref>\n\nDecorated in a refined Georgian decorative order and painted white, the room featured delicate plaster work combined with sleek panelling, fluted columns, and a white marble fireplace. Potted palms on tall stands were placed in the corners of the room, while shaded sconces and beaded crystal chandeliers provided soft lighting. Comfortable silk-upholstered settees and chairs in shades of yellow and blue were grouped around tables and writing desks for convenience. The windows were lined with pink silk curtains and looked out onto the Promenade Deck, allowing ample sunlight to flood the room. The popularity of this space had proved disappointing aboard the ''Olympic'', and Thomas Andrews had plans to convert part of the room on the ''Titanic'' into further passenger quarters.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 40.</ref>\n\n=== Reception room ===\n[[File:Titanic-first-class-reception-room2.jpg|thumb|First-class reception on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nThe first-class dining saloon on D-Deck was preceded by a large reception room, measuring {{convert|460|m2|sqft|abbr=on|0}}, located at the foot of the forward grand staircase and encompassing the entire width of the ship. An ornate candelabra rested on the middle railing at the base of the staircase, the light oak colour of which contrasted warmly with the white-painted reception room.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=360}}</ref> The Reception area would have been the first impression of the ''Titanic'' for many first-class passengers entering through the two semi-enclosed entry vestibules on either side of the staircase. Around the corner from the reception room, forward of the staircase, was the set of three first-class elevators which ran the length of the stairwell.\n\n[[File:RMS Olympic Reception Room.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' reception room looking towards the Dining Saloon]]\nThe reception room was decorated in richly carved mahogany [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]]-style panelling painted a glossy white. Furnished with comfortable wicker chairs and Chesterfields upholstered in green damask silk, the room would have been conspicuously light and airy because of the beautifully illuminated leaded-glass windows which ran along either side of the room.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 54.</ref> These were lit naturally during the day through portholes concealed behind the windows and electrically in the evening. In contrast to the linoleum floors on the ''Olympic'', the ''Titanic''{{'}}s reception room was covered with plush [[Axminster carpet]]ing and there were potted palms in built-in holders in the corners of the alcoves.<ref name=BB355>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=355}}</ref> An imposing [[Aubusson tapestry]], ''La Chasse du duc de Guise'',<ref>{{harvsp|Philippe Masson|1998|p=30}}</ref> hung in front of the staircase. On the wall close to the tapestry were letters indicating the name of the deck.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=358}}</ref>\n\nIt was recorded on the inaugural voyage of the ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]'', whose reception hall was slightly smaller, that the room quickly filled up after dinner.<ref name=BB355 /> On the starboard side, there was an area reserved for a [[quintet]] and it held a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] [[Piano|grand piano]].<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=132}}</ref> The ''Titanic's'' reception room was enlarged in contrast to her sister ship through a reconfiguration of the two entry vestibules, reducing their size and adding broad arched entrances opening onto the foyer in front of the elevators.\n\nThe reception room was open to passengers before and after meals. Here, the orchestra played from 4 to 5&nbsp;pm while tea was served, then after dinner, from 8 to 9:15&nbsp;pm. Stewards served liquor and cigars until 11&nbsp;pm, at which time the hall closed. Generally, there were many spectators in the Room while the orchestra played.\n\n==== Entrance vestibules ====\nThe ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic'' both featured duplicate entrance vestibules on their port and starboard sides within the D-Deck reception rooms. There were sets of double gangway doors within the hull, screened by wrought-iron grilles.<ref>{{harvsp|Lynch & Marschall| 2001| p=78}}</ref> The vestibules were partially enclosed areas in the same white Jacobean-style panelling, and each contained a large sideboard for storing china. One set of French doors led into the reception room, but there was also a broad, arched entryway leading to the elevators. Separate corridors led off of the vestibules to the first-class staterooms in the forward part of D-Deck.\n\nThe ''Titanic's'' vestibules differed from those on the ''Olympic'' \u2013 they were reduced in size to make the reception room larger and they eliminated the communicating corridor between the two sides in order to enlarge the elevator foyers. The ''Olympic'' vestibules contained Third-Class staircases that led down to E-Deck, which were eliminated on ''Titanic'', and the elaborate wrought-iron grilles which covered the gangway doors were unique to ''Titanic''.\n\nIt was reported that during the sinking [[Charles Lightoller|2nd Officer Lightoller]] ordered crew members to open the port side gangway doors on D-Deck for loading more passengers into the lifeboats nearer to sea level.<ref>{{harvsp|Don Lynch & Ken Marschall|1997|p=108}}</ref> The 1986 expedition confirmed that one of the port-side doors was wide open and the inner doors pulled back.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" /> This would have significantly increased the ''Titanic's'' flooding if the crew neglected to close doors.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nSince its first exploration by [[James Cameron]] in 1995, the reception room has become one of the best-documented rooms inside the wreck of the ''Titanic''. It is accessed fairly easily via [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] from the forward stairwell, though there is a deep layer of silt and hanging [[rusticles]] which obscure large parts of the room. The ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' exploration in 2001 discovered that the ''Titanic's'' reception room differed in several minor details from the ''Olympic'': there were more support pillars, the decorative grilles of the elevator entrances were different, and there was a completely unknown wrought iron grill door in the front of the D-Deck gangway entrance.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, ''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Most of the exquisite leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'', along with much of the mahogany panelling, built-in plant holders, light fixtures, and carved framework surrounding the steel support pillars of the room. Small amounts of the original white lead paint survive in the carved creases of the woodwork, and several of the swinging doors with their bronze grilles still hang in the entrance vestibule doorways.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" />\n\n=== Promenade and Boat Decks ===\n[[File:RMS Olympic promenade deck.jpg|thumb|Promenade Deck on the RMS ''Olympic''. The entrance to the aft grand staircase is in the foreground.]]\n\nThe Promenade Deck encircled the whole of A-Deck and together with the middle part of the Boat Deck constituted the outdoor space for first-class passengers to enjoy the sea air and take exercise. Grand first-class public rooms with their large bay windows, like the smoking room and lounge, characterise the aft end of the Promenade. The forward end is distinguished by the stateroom windows which lined the walls along either side, with their heavy bronze frames and etched glass panes.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 58.</ref> Parts of this deck were as wide as 30&nbsp;ft. and sheltered alcoves at points along the deck were used to store the dozens of folded teak deckchairs which passengers could rent during the voyage.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\" />\n\nThe aft end of the Promenade was a large open air space flanked by two large cargo [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. This part of the deck was installed with wooden slatted wrought iron benches from where passengers could enjoy views of the stern and the sea. [[Francis Browne]] took several photos of this area on the ''Titanic'', including a famous one of 6 year old [[Polar the Titanic Bear|Douglas Spedden]] spinning a top with his father.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 66.</ref>  A key distinguishing feature between the ''Titanic'' and her sister ship is the ''Titanic'''s enclosed forward Promenade Deck, which was installed as protection against the elements and to reinforce a part of the ship prone to heavy vibration. Both had proven to be issues on board the ''Olympic.''<ref>Matsen, Brad. \"Titanic's Last Secrets: The Further Adventures of Shadow Divers John Chatterton & Richie Kohler\" Hachette: 2008; 132.</ref>\n\nDeck chairs and steamer rugs could be rented at the Purser's Office for 4 shillings/1 dollar each, which applied for the entire voyage. Stewards would bring broth and hot drinks for passengers to enjoy if requested.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 31.</ref> Oftentimes a passenger could spend the entire day relaxing and reading in his/her deck chair. The Promenade Deck was popular for playing games like [[shuffleboard]], deck quoits, [[dominoes]], and [[chess]], which could be obtained from the Quartermaster.\n\nThe middle part of the Boat Deck also served as a 200&nbsp;ft. long open-air promenade for first-class passengers between the officer's promenade at the forward end and the second-class promenade further aft. The gymnasium was located on the starboard side and the raised roof of the lounge, 82&nbsp;ft. above the waterline, functioned as a large sun deck where deckchairs could be set up.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., ''The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.'' Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref> This part of the deck was occupied by only four of the ''Titanic's'' 20 lifeboats, which were swung out to the side of the ship at the beginning of the voyage to leave the decks totally uncluttered for the first class.\n\nThe deck chairs from ''Titanic'', 614 in all between the first- and second-class areas, have become some of the most recognisable artefacts from the liner. Chief Baker [[Charles Joughin]] described throwing dozens overboard from the Promenade Deck during the sinking to be used as flotation devices; passing ships in the weeks after the sinking encountered islands of floating debris including deck chairs. About 10 of ''Titanic's'' deck chairs are known today, including one in the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia and one in the [[Museum of the City of New York]].<ref name=\"usatoday2\">{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-07/titanic-rearrange-deck-chairs/54084648/1|title=Titanic deck chairs' sad symbolism lives on|website=USATODAY.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\"artnet\">{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/deck-chair-titanic-museum-new-york-614054|title=See Deck Chair Salvaged from the &#039;Titanic&#039; &#124; artnet News|website=news.artnet.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/arts/design/one-titanic-survivor-goes-on-view-a-deck-chair.html?_r=0|title=One Titanic Survivor Goes on View: A Deck Chair|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Grand staircase ===\n{{Further|Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic}}\n[[File:Grand staircase.jpg|thumb|The grand staircase on board the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nThe grand staircase was one of the most impressive features on board the ''Titanic'' and the centre of first-class activity. The main stairwell was located in the forward part of the ship and began on the Boat Deck, extending six flights down to E-Deck. B and D Decks contained entry foyers on either side where first-class passengers would embark and disembark, the D-Deck entryway leading directly into the reception room. Each level was constructed in solid [[English oak]] with sweeping curves and the surrounding spaces panelled in the sleek neoclassical [[English Baroque|William and Mary]] style. The balustrades displayed distinctive wrought iron grilles with ormolu swags in the style of [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]].<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic,'' Carlton Press: 1997; pp. 36-7</ref> The A-Deck level was undoubtedly the most spectacular and is the most recognisable due to its frequent depiction in film.\n\nThe staircase was crowned by an extravagant [[wrought iron]] and glass dome with a large chandelier at the centre. This dome was installed on the roof of the boat deck and provided natural light to the stairwell before being artificially lit at night from behind. On the central landing of the A-Deck staircase was an exquisitely carved clock with allegorical figures on either side, known as ''Honour and Glory crowning Time.''<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic: An Illustrated History,'' Wellfleet Press: 2005; pp. 52-3</ref> At the foot of the staircase, on the newel post of the middle balustrade, was a bronze cherub holding an electric torch. B and C Decks probably had smaller replicas of these cherubs at either corner of the staircases, and contained landscape oil paintings as the focal points of their landings instead of the unique clock on A-Deck.\n\nFrom the grand staircase a passenger could access almost all of the facilities available in first class, level by level:\n\n* The Boat Deck level gave access to the outside promenade space, sun deck, the lifeboats, and the adjoining Gymnasium. The A-Deck level accessed first-class accommodation at the forward part of the ship and the grand public rooms located further aft via a long corridor. Entry vestibules opened onto the encircling Promenade Deck from the stairway.\n* B and C Decks connected to the main corridors containing the bulk of first-class accommodation, including the extravagant 'Millionaire's Suites' located immediately off the B-Deck level staircase. On the Starboard side of the C-Deck staircase was the Purser's Office, where passengers stored their jewellery and other valuable belongings during the voyage.\n* On D-Deck the staircase opened directly onto the reception room and adjoining Dining Saloon. Instead of a cherub, the central post of the staircase contained an impressive gilt candelabra with electric lights.<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\" /> Behind the staircases were installed the three first-class elevators which ran between E and A Decks.\n* On E-Deck the staircase narrowed and lost the sweeping curve of the upper flights; a modest single flight terminated on F-Deck, where the Turkish Baths and Swimming Pool could be reached.\n\n== Aft grand staircase ==\n[[File:RMS Olympic aft grand staircase.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' Aft grand staircase]]\nThere was in fact a second grand staircase located further aft in the ship, between the third and fourth funnels. It was in the same style as the forward grand staircase with an illuminated dome at the centre, but it was smaller and only installed between A, B, and C Decks. A simple clock graced the main landing in contrast to the ornate \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" clock in the forward Staircase. One could access the Smoking Room immediately off the A-Deck level, and the lounge via a long companionway with revolving doors on the port side.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/a-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : A Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On the ''Titanic'' there were two additional stateroom suites installed on either side of the A-Deck staircase, one of which was occupied by [[Thomas Andrews]], the ship's builder.\n\nThe whole of the B-Deck foyer was used as a reception area for patrons of the \u00c1 La Carte Restaurant and Caf\u00e9 Parisien, specially designed in the [[Georgian style|Georgian]] style and painted white like the main reception room on D-Deck. There was a recess for coat storage and comfortable [[rattan]] seating was arranged in groups throughout the room. This was in contrast to the B-Deck foyer of ''Olympic'', where there was no restaurant reception room and the foyer space was much smaller because of additional cabins and storage rooms.\n\nThis staircase was located just aft of where the ''Titanic'' broke apart during the sinking and was totally destroyed. It is assumed to be the source of much of the woodwork recovered as wreckage after the sinking.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|Second and Third-Class facilities on the RMS Titanic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n  | last1 = Archibald\n  | first1 = Rick\n  | last2 = Ballard\n  | first2 = Robert\n  | year = 2005\n  | title =The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 978-1-59223-424-0\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Beveridge\n  | first1 = Bruce\n  | year = 2009\n  | title = The Ship Magnificent, Volume Two: Interior Design & Fitting\n  | publisher = The History Press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7524-4626-4\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Chirnside\n  | first1 = Mark\n  | year = 2004\n  | title = The Olympic-class ships : \" Olympic \", \" Titanic \", \" Britannic \"\n  | publisher = Tempus\n  | isbn = 0-7524-2868-3\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 2003\n  | title = Ghosts of the Abyss\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 0-306-81223-1\n  | ref = harv\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/ghostsofabyssjou0000lync\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 1997\n  | title = Titanic: An Illustrated History\n  | publisher = Wellfleet press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7858-1972-1\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Marschall\n | first1 = Ken\n | year = 2001\n | title = James Cameron's Titanic Expedition: What We Saw on and Inside the Wreck\n | publisher = marconigraph.com\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = O'Donnel\n  | first1 = E.

Carlin]], and [[Bill Graves]], each of whom served 8&nbsp;years and 4&nbsp;days (Docking served four two-year terms; Carlin and Graves each served 2 4-year terms). The shortest-serving governor was [[John McCuish]], who served only 11 days after the resignation of [[Fred Hall]]. \n\nThe current governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Laura Kelly]], who took office on January 14, 2019.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe office was created in 1861 when Kansas was officially admitted to the United States as the 34th state. Prior to statehood in 1861, the office was preceded by a [[President of the United States|Presidential]] appointed Governor of [[Kansas Territory]] with similar powers.\n\nDespite being an executive branch official, the Governor also possesses [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] powers. The Governor's responsibilities include making yearly \"State of the State\" addresses to the [[Kansas Legislature]], submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the [[conservator of the peace|peace is preserved]].\n\n=== Gubernatorial term of office and requirements for running ===\n[[File:Standard of the Governor of Kansas (pre-1961).svg|thumb|left|150px|[[Flags of the Governors of the U.S. States|Flag of the Governor]] prior to 1961. It is unclear when the Governor's flag was first created]]\nThere is no lifetime limit on the number of times he or she may be elected, but a governor who has been elected to two consecutive terms must be out of office for at least one election cycle before being eligible once again for re-election. Elections occur at the same time as the Congressional [[midterm election]]s, and each term begins on the second Monday of January following the election. The lieutenant governor is subject to the same limitations and runs on a combined ticket with the governor.<ref>[http://www.kslib.info/constitution/ Constitution of the State of Kansas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120121218/http://www.kslib.info/constitution/ |date=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> From the establishment of the state in 1859 with the [[Wyandotte Constitution]] until 2018, there was neither an age requirement nor a residency requirement to run for the office; as of 2017 three Kansan teenagers were doing so.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article175956836.html |title=As third teen joins Kansas governor race, consider this: No rule says a dog can\u2019t run |last=Woodall |first=Hunter |date=September 28, 2017 |website=The Kansas City Star |access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, a law was passed establishing the age to run for Governor and Lieutenant Governor at 25, beginning with the [[2022 Kansas gubernatorial election|2022 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kwch.com/content/news/New-law-requires-Kansas-governor-candidates-to-be-at-least-25-years-old-483075941.html|title=New law sets minimum age for Kansas governor candidates|author=KWCH|work[[KWCH]]|date=May 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIf the governor becomes incapacitated, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor. However, if both offices become vacant, the line of succession is determined by the [[Kansas Legislature|legislature]].

I, \u00a7 11.</ref>\n\nSince becoming a state, Kansas has had 47&nbsp;governors. The state's longest-serving governors were [[Robert Docking]], [[John W. Carlin]], and [[Bill Graves]], each of whom served 8&nbsp;years and 4&nbsp;days (Docking served four two-year terms; Carlin and Graves each served 2 4-year terms). The shortest-serving governor was [[John McCuish]], who served only 11 days after the resignation of [[Fred Hall]]. \n\nThe current governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Laura Kelly]], who took office on January 14, 2019.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe office was created in 1861 when Kansas was officially admitted to the United States as the 34th state. Prior to statehood in 1861, the office was preceded by a [[President of the United States|Presidential]] appointed Governor of [[Kansas Territory]] with similar powers.\n\nDespite being an executive branch official, the Governor also possesses [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] powers. The Governor's responsibilities include making yearly \"State of the State\" addresses to the [[Kansas Legislature]], submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the [[conservator of the peace|peace is preserved]].\n\n=== Gubernatorial term of office and requirements for running ===\n[[File:Standard of the Governor of Kansas (pre-1961).svg|thumb|left|150px|[[Flags of the Governors of the U.S. States|Flag of the Governor]] prior to 1961. It is unclear when the Governor's flag was first created]]\nThere is no lifetime limit on the number of times he or she may be elected, but a governor who has been elected to two consecutive terms must be out of office for at least one election cycle before being eligible once again for re-election. Elections occur at the same time as the Congressional [[midterm election]]s, and each term begins on the second Monday of January following the election. The lieutenant governor is subject to the same limitations and runs on a combined ticket with the governor.<ref>[http://www.kslib.info/constitution/ Constitution of the State of Kansas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120121218/http://www.kslib.info/constitution/ |date=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> From the establishment of the state in 1859 with the [[Wyandotte Constitution]] until 2018, there was neither an age requirement nor a residency requirement to run for the office; as of 2017 three Kansan teenagers were doing so.<ref name=\"Lack of statutory requirements to run for gubernatorial office\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article175956836.html |title=As third teen joins Kansas governor race, consider this: No rule says a dog can\u2019t run |last=Woodall |first=Hunter |date=September 28, 2017 |website=The Kansas City Star |access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, a law was passed establishing the age to run for Governor and Lieutenant Governor at 25, beginning with the [[2022 Kansas gubernatorial election|2022 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kwch.com/content/news/New-law-requires-Kansas-governor-candidates-to-be-at-least-25-years-old-483075941.html|title=New law sets minimum age for Kansas governor candidates|author=KWCH|work[[KWCH]]|date=May 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIf the governor becomes incapacitated, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor. However, if both offices become vacant, the line of succession is determined by the [[Kansas Legislature|legislature]]. Under present law, the [[President of the Senate]] would be next in line to assume the governorship, followed by the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]].\n\n=== Residence ===\nSince 1962, the Governor of Kansas has resided in the governor's mansion, known as [[Cedar Crest (mansion)|Cedar Crest]]. It was designed by the architect firm [[Wight and Wight]].
