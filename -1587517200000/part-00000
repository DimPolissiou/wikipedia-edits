The station serves as an East Coast flagship station of the [[Azteca America]] television network.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== as W53AA (1973-1996)===\nThis station was signed on over UHF channel 53 in the 1970s by its original owner [[CBS|CBS Inc.]] as '''W53AA'''. It was one of multiple [[Television]] [[Broadcast relay station|Broadcast Translator]]s in New York City which operated at the upper end of the UHF band in order to provide reliable coverage to certain New York boroughs whose reception was ultimately compromised by construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]. This translator station relayed the signal of [[WCBS-TV]], which for decades prior and at that time operated over [[very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2.\n\nOriginally, most of the New York City television stations operated their main transmitters from the [[Empire State Building]]. However, reliable reception was ultimately compromised for some viewers once the majority of the World Trade Center was constructed, thus necessitating the use of the UHF translators. In response, nearly all of the TV stations, including WCBS-TV, relocated to the North Tower of the World Trade Center in 1975. CBS, however, maintained an auxiliary transmitter back at Empire.\n\nCBS eventually sold the station on July 15, 1987 to Accord Communications, Inc.  Accord, who purchased W53AA as an investment and intended to sell it for a profit, improved the station by relocating its transmitter to the Empire State Building and increasing its transmitting power to 7.2 kW.\n\nAccord sold W53AA on October 6, 1989 to Pan-Asian Communications, Inc. whose president was Andrew H. Ohm, a major figure in Korean media in the United States. Ohm established the Korea Broadcasting Corp. (KBC) over W53AA, the first Korean-owned television station in the United States. The station's emphasis was on Asian language programming and broadcast throughout the New York metropolitan area.\n\n=== as WKOB-LP/LD (1996-present)===\nOn February 19, 1996, the call-sign was changed to WKOB-LP.\n\nOn June 1, 1998, WKOB filed a displacement application to move to channel 48 due to the impending [[WFUT-DT|WFUT]] operation on Channel 53.\n \nIn the late 1990s, programming was leased and consisted of religious programs and infomercials.\n\nAccording to WKOB, in a filing to the FCC, the station had broadcast programming 24 hours a day under a time brokerage agreement with [[Paxson Communications]] LPTV, Inc. until August 31, 1999. The station then went silent because its time brokerage programming agreement expired.  WKOB notified the FCC on September 17, 1999 that the station was back on the air with a \u201climited\u201d amount of programming.  WKOB-LP also stated that it had obtained locally-produced programming targeted to the needs of the Korean residents of New York City, and asserted that this specialized programming service supported an award of Class A status, which it was ultimately denied.\n\n[[WRNN-TV]] strongly objected to any operation that could interfere with channel 48, as they had been assigned this channel for their Kingston, New York operation. In fact, WRNN-TV's owners took the unusual step to back up their opposition by monitoring WKOB-LP for 39 days between April 28 and August 22, 2000. They hired a Korean language interpreter, and based upon the transcripts provided by that interpreter, and their visual review of the programming, they determined the majority of the programs observed were religious services conducted in churches located in Korea. In its August 10, 2001 reply to WRNN-TV\u2019s opposition, WKOB-LP provided additional information regarding its programming, explaining that the programming is produced in New York, and edited in WKOB-LP\u2019s studio, and contended that if a Class A station cannot incorporate footage shot outside its service area in a locally produced program, then \u201ca local newscast would not get credit for local time during a news story on an address by the President in Washington.\u201d WKOB also asserted that \u201cits historical record of all-day programming coupled with its record of local service to the Korean minority community in New York justifies an exercise of the discretion granted to the Commission by the [CBPA] to act in the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe FCC ultimately denied both the application for review filed by WKOB Communications, Inc., and dismissed the opposition filed by WRNN-TV Associates Limited Partnership describing it as \"moot\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, the station owner began to suffer financial problems. It went into receivership in 2001, and a voluntary sale was attempted but fell through, leading to a lawsuit with the buyer. Financial problems still loomed, and the station ultimately requested Special Temporary Authority to go silent in January 2005.\n \nOhm sold the station to Nave Communications LLC on May 13, 2005 for $1,250,000. Under its new ownership, the station shortly thereafter became an [[Almavision]] affiliate in 2006. In Late-2006, Almavision programming ceased on the station, and was replaced by DayStar programming, which is still broadcasting to this day.\n\nThe station was displaced from Channel 53 to Channel 42 due to the FCC granting WFUT channel 53 for its pre-transition digital operations.\n\nThis station was originally signed on in the 1970s by CBS, Inc. In late 2008, Nave was uncertain if there would be any room left for its WKOB operation on the much smaller television band due to the DTV transition. Its attempt to secure Class A status and securing a spot on Channel 48 were both thwarted by WRNN-TV, and its Low Power classification relegated it to a secondary status. Making matters worse, its Channel 42 operation was predicted to cause interference to full power [[WZME|WSAH]] Bridgeport, if their pending application to broadcast on Channel 41 from the Empire State Building was approved. That application was ultimately denied due to unacceptable interference to [[WXTV-DT]] Paterson.\n\nDesperate and with few alternatives, Nave turned to [[CBS Corporation|CBS, Inc]]., asking if they would object to WKOB-LP requesting displacement to [[WCBS-TV]]'s analog channel position at Channel 2. CBS, which ultimately selected Channel 33 for their post-transition operations, did not object and signed a Waiver Of Consent, ultimately accepting whatever interference a WKOB-LP operation over Channel 2 would have presented to WCBS-TV. On January 21, 2009, the Request for Displacement was approved.\n\nWKOB-LP, however, did not commence operations on Channel 2 until seven months after WCBS-TV signed off Channel 2 for the final time in July 2009. The station finally began operations on RF Channel 2 on March 7, 2010 as WKOB-LD New York.\n\nWKOB-LD once had a construction permit to broadcast a digital signal on channel 59 at 400 Watts, which has since been modified to specify operation on channel 2 with 300 Watts, the latter of which is on the air as of February 2010. The station subsequently filed an Application For Displacement to move its digital signal back to channel 42. The station has filed this application for the following reason:\n\n{{quote|''\"Applicant\u2019s current operational facility is located on Channel 2, a [[Band I|low-band VHF]] channel. VHF facilities, particularly low band VHF, are subject to reception problems due to [[Electromagnetic interference|impulse noise]]. Applicant seeks a channel in the UHF band that will provide improved viewer reception.\"''}}\n\nThe application has been granted and there is an outstanding construction permit to build-out a transmitter facility for a Channel 42 operation, however Nave has not completed the build-out.\n\nIn June 2013, WKOB-LD was slated to be sold to Landover 5 LLC as part of a larger deal involving 51 other low-power television stations;<ref name=tvbr-saletolandover>{{cite news|last=Seyler|first=Dave|title=Anatomy of an LPTV deal extravaganza|url=http://rbr.com/anatomy-of-an-lptv-deal-extravaganza/|accessdate=July 3, 2013|newspaper=Television Business Report|date=June 24, 2013}}</ref> the sale fell through in June 2016.<ref name=\"fcc-nosaletolandover\">{{cite web|title=Notification of Non-consummation|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1731846&Form_id=905&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Nave Broadcasting sold WKOB-LD to HC2 Holdings in 2017.<ref name=\"fcc-saletohc2\">{{cite web|title=APPLICATION FOR CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT OF BROADCAST STATION CONSTRUCTION PERMIT OR LICENSE|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1765888&Service=LD&Form_id=345&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> \n\n== Digital television ==\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\n\n'''Digital channels'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This was the second time LATV appeared in the New York City market. It first appeared as a sub-channel on [[WPIX]], but was dropped just prior to that station adding [[ThisTV]] as a sub-channel. The addition of LATV as a sub-channel on WKOB-LD marked the second time a diginet was dropped by one station and later appeared over another in this Television market; [[Azteca America]] was the first, having relocated from [[WNYN-LD|WNYN-LD 39.4]] to [[WMBC-TV|WMBC-TV 63.6]]. LATV later secured carriage over [[WNWT-LD|WBQM-LD]].\n\nThe LATV affiliation over WKOB-LD ended after one week, however, as Daystar programming had returned to 42.1 and remains on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 12\u201319, 2011: WKOB-LD was apparently planning to add [[Tuff TV]] on 42.4. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"TUFF TV\" static, Line 2: \"TUFF TV\" blinking. This same day, a fifth sub-channel appeared for the first time on WKOB-LD, channel 42.5. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"WKOB-LP SD5\" static, Line 2: \"WKOB-LP\" blinking. Until 1/12/11, this text appeared on 42.4, with the appropriate corresponding SD#. On January 19, 2011, WKOB-LD added [[Tuff TV]] on 42.4.\n\nMarch 1, 2011: Daystar programming has been removed from 42.1. The stream remains live, but no A/V content is being transmitted. Daystar remains on 42.2.\n\nMarch 9, 2011: Daystar programming was returned to 42.1. WKOB-LD has added WizeBuys TV on 42.5. WizeBuys TV is a 24/7 national television network delivering both short and long form Direct Response advertising. It reaches over 30 million homes per day, including 15 of the top 20 DMAs that deliver an ever-growing audience. It is owned by The Cross Group, a subsidiary of Philadelphia based Cross MediaWorks.\n\nDuring the final week of March 2011, an STL problem existed where only the aural portion of Tuff TV could be received and re-broadcast by WKOB. On March 30, 2011, Tuff TV has all but been dropped from WKOB. The PSIP still identified 42.4 as Tuff TV through late June, and about once an hour, a technical issue still exists where the Tuff TV audio can be heard for about two seconds when the new programming service briefly interrupts for station ID.\n\nMarch 31, 2011: WKOB-LD has added HOT TV: History Of Television on 42.4. HOT TV is a classic TV station featuring TV shows and movies from the 1940s through the early 1960s.\n\nJune, 2011:  Daystar on channel 42.1 was replaced by color bars with a reference to GBC, and no further details.  Daystar continues on 42.2.  A few days later, infomercials appear on channel 42.1.\n\nJuly 2, 2011:  GBC World News was added to channel 42.1 at 8 AM.\n\nAugust, 2011:  GBC World News ceased operations, leaving a blank screen and no sound on 42.1\n\nSeptember, 2011: WizeBuy moved from 42.5 to 42.1 to replace the vacated space left by the demise of GBC, 42.5 deactivated\n\nSeptember 26, 2011: [[Retro Television Network|Retro Television Network (RTV)]] affiliation canceled. Replaced immediately with WKOB 42.3 24/7 Movie Network. This new station is locally produced and consists of 1930s through 1960s public domain movies.\n\nOctober 22, 2011: 24/7 Movie Network shifted to 42.1, HOT to 42.3 and WizeBuy to 42.4.  WKOB also has an ad running stating that they are hiring salespersons for HOT TV 42.3.\n\nNovember 25, 2011: The 24/7 Movie Network 42.1 has been removed and replaced by Mundo Hispano TV based out of Bloomfield, NJ. This station had formerly aired over [[WMBC-TV]] Newton, Channel 63-4. HOT 42.3 is off the air (running test color bars) and 42.4 is running 24/7 infomercials. Daystar remains active on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 24, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-1. The stations website describes Telos as: A Digital Television Network designed to present alternatives to traditional medicine.\n\nPrior to the Telos addition, channel 42-1, labeled \"24-7\" via PSIP to reflect the WKOB 24/7 Movie Network, was airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio duplicating the one which has been airing over 42-3 since November 2011.\n\nFebruary 4, 2012: HOT TV: History Of Television returned to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-3.\n\nMarch 16, 2012: WKOB-LD adds sub-channels 42-5 and 42-6. This marks the first time ever that WKOB-LD has added a sixth sub-channel. Both channels are labeled \"WKOB-LD\" via PSIP and are each airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio. However, for approximately two minutes beginning at 4:37AM EDT. on 3-17-12, audio was transmitted for the first time over both 42-5 and 42-6. The audio was from Telos TV which airs over 42-1, and this same audio feed aired over all six sub-channels during this two-minute interval. After which, audio content was restored to normal over all channels.\n\nPSIP channel names were also adjusted on 3-16-12. \"DayStar\" was changed to \"Daystar\" and \"HOT TV\" was changed to \"HOT\".\n\nAugust 2012: SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN) was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-5. The stations website describes SBN as: a television and radio network that is broadcast around the world 24/7. SBN is an extension of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and offers live church services as well as programs hosted by Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, Frances Swaggart, Evangelist Donnie Swaggart, Gabriel Swaggart, and more. The goal of SonLife Broadcasting Network is to reach the world with the Message of the Cross.\n\nSeptember 1, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network and HOT TV are not being carried over WKOB-LD, despite the TVCT information reflecting their continued occupancy. An EBR Test Pattern without Audio is presently airing on those subchannels.\n\nSeptember 15, 2012: [[Almavision]] was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-6.

The station serves as an East Coast flagship station of the [[Azteca America]] television network.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== as W53AA (1973-1996)===\nThis station was signed on over UHF channel 53 in the 1970s by its original owner [[CBS|CBS Inc.]] as '''W53AA'''. It was one of multiple [[Television]] [[Broadcast relay station|Broadcast Translator]]s in New York City which operated at the upper end of the UHF band in order to provide reliable coverage to certain New York boroughs whose reception was ultimately compromised by construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]. This translator station relayed the signal of [[WCBS-TV]], which for decades prior and at that time operated over [[very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2.\n\nOriginally, most of the New York City television stations operated their main transmitters from the [[Empire State Building]]. However, reliable reception was ultimately compromised for some viewers once the majority of the World Trade Center was constructed, thus necessitating the use of the UHF translators. In response, nearly all of the TV stations, including WCBS-TV, relocated to the North Tower of the World Trade Center in 1975. CBS, however, maintained an auxiliary transmitter back at Empire.\n\nCBS eventually sold the station on July 15, 1987 to Accord Communications, Inc.  Accord, who purchased W53AA as an investment and intended to sell it for a profit, improved the station by relocating its transmitter to the Empire State Building and increasing its transmitting power to 7.2 kW.\n\nAccord sold W53AA on October 6, 1989 to Pan-Asian Communications, Inc. whose president was Andrew H. Ohm, a major figure in Korean media in the United States. Ohm established the Korea Broadcasting Corp. (KBC) over W53AA, the first Korean-owned television station in the United States. The station's emphasis was on Asian language programming and broadcast throughout the New York metropolitan area.\n\n=== as WKOB-LP/LD (1996-present)===\nOn February 19, 1996, the call-sign was changed to WKOB-LP.\n\nOn June 1, 1998, WKOB filed a displacement application to move to channel 48 due to the impending [[WFUT-DT|WFUT]] operation on Channel 53.\n \nIn the late 1990s, programming was leased and consisted of religious programs and infomercials.\n\nAccording to WKOB, in a filing to the FCC, the station had broadcast programming 24 hours a day under a time brokerage agreement with [[Paxson Communications]] LPTV, Inc. until August 31, 1999. The station then went silent because its time brokerage programming agreement expired.  WKOB notified the FCC on September 17, 1999 that the station was back on the air with a \u201climited\u201d amount of programming.  WKOB-LP also stated that it had obtained locally-produced programming targeted to the needs of the Korean residents of New York City, and asserted that this specialized programming service supported an award of Class A status, which it was ultimately denied.\n\n[[WRNN-TV]] strongly objected to any operation that could interfere with channel 48, as they had been assigned this channel for their Kingston, New York operation. In fact, WRNN-TV's owners took the unusual step to back up their opposition by monitoring WKOB-LP for 39 days between April 28 and August 22, 2000. They hired a Korean language interpreter, and based upon the transcripts provided by that interpreter, and their visual review of the programming, they determined the majority of the programs observed were religious services conducted in churches located in Korea. In its August 10, 2001 reply to WRNN-TV\u2019s opposition, WKOB-LP provided additional information regarding its programming, explaining that the programming is produced in New York, and edited in WKOB-LP\u2019s studio, and contended that if a Class A station cannot incorporate footage shot outside its service area in a locally produced program, then \u201ca local newscast would not get credit for local time during a news story on an address by the President in Washington.\u201d WKOB also asserted that \u201cits historical record of all-day programming coupled with its record of local service to the Korean minority community in New York justifies an exercise of the discretion granted to the Commission by the [CBPA] to act in the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe FCC ultimately denied both the application for review filed by WKOB Communications, Inc., and dismissed the opposition filed by WRNN-TV Associates Limited Partnership describing it as \"moot\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, the station owner began to suffer financial problems. It went into receivership in 2001, and a voluntary sale was attempted but fell through, leading to a lawsuit with the buyer. Financial problems still loomed, and the station ultimately requested Special Temporary Authority to go silent in January 2005.\n \nOhm sold the station to Nave Communications LLC on May 13, 2005 for $1,250,000. Under its new ownership, the station shortly thereafter became an [[Almavision]] affiliate in 2006. In Late-2006, Almavision programming ceased on the station, and was replaced by DayStar programming, which is still broadcasting to this day.\n\nThe station was displaced from Channel 53 to Channel 42 due to the FCC granting WFUT channel 53 for its pre-transition digital operations.\n\nThis station was originally signed on in the 1970s by CBS, Inc. In late 2008, Nave was uncertain if there would be any room left for its WKOB operation on the much smaller television band due to the DTV transition. Its attempt to secure Class A status and securing a spot on Channel 48 were both thwarted by WRNN-TV, and its Low Power classification relegated it to a secondary status. Making matters worse, its Channel 42 operation was predicted to cause interference to full power [[WZME|WSAH]] Bridgeport, if their pending application to broadcast on Channel 41 from the Empire State Building was approved. That application was ultimately denied due to unacceptable interference to [[WXTV-DT]] Paterson.\n\nDesperate and with few alternatives, Nave turned to [[CBS Corporation|CBS, Inc]]., asking if they would object to WKOB-LP requesting displacement to [[WCBS-TV]]'s analog channel position at Channel 2. CBS, which ultimately selected Channel 33 for their post-transition operations, did not object and signed a Waiver Of Consent, ultimately accepting whatever interference a WKOB-LP operation over Channel 2 would have presented to WCBS-TV. On January 21, 2009, the Request for Displacement was approved.\n\nWKOB-LP, however, did not commence operations on Channel 2 until seven months after WCBS-TV signed off Channel 2 for the final time in July 2009. The station finally began operations on RF Channel 2 on March 7, 2010 as WKOB-LD New York.\n\nWKOB-LD once had a construction permit to broadcast a digital signal on channel 59 at 400 Watts, which has since been modified to specify operation on channel 2 with 300 Watts, the latter of which is on the air as of February 2010. The station subsequently filed an Application For Displacement to move its digital signal back to channel 42. The station has filed this application for the following reason:\n\n{{quote|''\"Applicant\u2019s current operational facility is located on Channel 2, a [[Band I|low-band VHF]] channel. VHF facilities, particularly low band VHF, are subject to reception problems due to [[Electromagnetic interference|impulse noise]]. Applicant seeks a channel in the UHF band that will provide improved viewer reception.\"''}}\n\nThe application has been granted and there is an outstanding construction permit to build-out a transmitter facility for a Channel 42 operation, however Nave has not completed the build-out.\n\nIn June 2013, WKOB-LD was slated to be sold to Landover 5 LLC as part of a larger deal involving 51 other low-power television stations;<ref name=tvbr-saletolandover>{{cite news|last=Seyler|first=Dave|title=Anatomy of an LPTV deal extravaganza|url=http://rbr.com/anatomy-of-an-lptv-deal-extravaganza/|accessdate=July 3, 2013|newspaper=Television Business Report|date=June 24, 2013}}</ref> the sale fell through in June 2016.<ref name=\"fcc-nosaletolandover\">{{cite web|title=Notification of Non-consummation|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1731846&Form_id=905&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Nave Broadcasting sold WKOB-LD to HC2 Holdings in 2017.<ref name=\"fcc-saletohc2\">{{cite web|title=APPLICATION FOR CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT OF BROADCAST STATION CONSTRUCTION PERMIT OR LICENSE|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1765888&Service=LD&Form_id=345&Facility_id=51441|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018|date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> \n\n== Digital television ==\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\n\n'''Digital channels'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This was the second time LATV appeared in the New York City market. It first appeared as a sub-channel on [[WPIX]], but was dropped just prior to that station adding [[ThisTV]] as a sub-channel. The addition of LATV as a sub-channel on WKOB-LD marked the second time a diginet was dropped by one station and later appeared over another in this Television market; [[Azteca America]] was the first, having relocated from [[WNYN-LD|WNYN-LD 39.4]] to [[WMBC-TV|WMBC-TV 63.6]]. LATV later secured carriage over [[WNWT-LD|WBQM-LD]].\n\nThe LATV affiliation over WKOB-LD ended after one week, however, as Daystar programming had returned to 42.1 and remains on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 12\u201319, 2011: WKOB-LD was apparently planning to add [[Tuff TV]] on 42.4. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"TUFF TV\" static, Line 2: \"TUFF TV\" blinking. This same day, a fifth sub-channel appeared for the first time on WKOB-LD, channel 42.5. A Test Pattern/Standard Color Bars is on this sub-channel with text reading as follows: Line 1: \"WKOB-LP SD5\" static, Line 2: \"WKOB-LP\" blinking. Until 1/12/11, this text appeared on 42.4, with the appropriate corresponding SD#. On January 19, 2011, WKOB-LD added [[Tuff TV]] on 42.4.\n\nMarch 1, 2011: Daystar programming has been removed from 42.1. The stream remains live, but no A/V content is being transmitted. Daystar remains on 42.2.\n\nMarch 9, 2011: Daystar programming was returned to 42.1. WKOB-LD has added WizeBuys TV on 42.5. WizeBuys TV is a 24/7 national television network delivering both short and long form Direct Response advertising. It reaches over 30 million homes per day, including 15 of the top 20 DMAs that deliver an ever-growing audience. It is owned by The Cross Group, a subsidiary of Philadelphia based Cross MediaWorks.\n\nDuring the final week of March 2011, an STL problem existed where only the aural portion of Tuff TV could be received and re-broadcast by WKOB. On March 30, 2011, Tuff TV has all but been dropped from WKOB. The PSIP still identified 42.4 as Tuff TV through late June, and about once an hour, a technical issue still exists where the Tuff TV audio can be heard for about two seconds when the new programming service briefly interrupts for station ID.\n\nMarch 31, 2011: WKOB-LD has added HOT TV: History Of Television on 42.4. HOT TV is a classic TV station featuring TV shows and movies from the 1940s through the early 1960s.\n\nJune, 2011:  Daystar on channel 42.1 was replaced by color bars with a reference to GBC, and no further details.  Daystar continues on 42.2.  A few days later, infomercials appear on channel 42.1.\n\nJuly 2, 2011:  GBC World News was added to channel 42.1 at 8 AM.\n\nAugust, 2011:  GBC World News ceased operations, leaving a blank screen and no sound on 42.1\n\nSeptember, 2011: WizeBuy moved from 42.5 to 42.1 to replace the vacated space left by the demise of GBC, 42.5 deactivated\n\nSeptember 26, 2011: [[Retro Television Network|Retro Television Network (RTV)]] affiliation canceled. Replaced immediately with WKOB 42.3 24/7 Movie Network. This new station is locally produced and consists of 1930s through 1960s public domain movies.\n\nOctober 22, 2011: 24/7 Movie Network shifted to 42.1, HOT to 42.3 and WizeBuy to 42.4.  WKOB also has an ad running stating that they are hiring salespersons for HOT TV 42.3.\n\nNovember 25, 2011: The 24/7 Movie Network 42.1 has been removed and replaced by Mundo Hispano TV based out of Bloomfield, NJ. This station had formerly aired over [[WMBC-TV]] Newton, Channel 63-4. HOT 42.3 is off the air (running test color bars) and 42.4 is running 24/7 infomercials. Daystar remains active on 42.2.\n\nJanuary 24, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-1. The stations website describes Telos as: A Digital Television Network designed to present alternatives to traditional medicine.\n\nPrior to the Telos addition, channel 42-1, labeled \"24-7\" via PSIP to reflect the WKOB 24/7 Movie Network, was airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio duplicating the one which has been airing over 42-3 since November 2011.\n\nFebruary 4, 2012: HOT TV: History Of Television returned to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-3.\n\nMarch 16, 2012: WKOB-LD adds sub-channels 42-5 and 42-6. This marks the first time ever that WKOB-LD has added a sixth sub-channel. Both channels are labeled \"WKOB-LD\" via PSIP and are each airing an EBR Test Pattern without audio. However, for approximately two minutes beginning at 4:37AM EDT. on 3-17-12, audio was transmitted for the first time over both 42-5 and 42-6. The audio was from Telos TV which airs over 42-1, and this same audio feed aired over all six sub-channels during this two-minute interval. After which, audio content was restored to normal over all channels.\n\nPSIP channel names were also adjusted on 3-16-12. \"DayStar\" was changed to \"Daystar\" and \"HOT TV\" was changed to \"HOT\".\n\nAugust 2012: SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN) was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-5. The stations website describes SBN as: a television and radio network that is broadcast around the world 24/7. SBN is an extension of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and offers live church services as well as programs hosted by Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, Frances Swaggart, Evangelist Donnie Swaggart, Gabriel Swaggart, and more. The goal of SonLife Broadcasting Network is to reach the world with the Message of the Cross.\n\nSeptember 1, 2012: Telos Alternative Health Network and HOT TV are not being carried over WKOB-LD, despite the TVCT information reflecting their continued occupancy. An EBR Test Pattern without Audio is presently airing on those subchannels.\n\nSeptember 15, 2012: [[Almavision]] was added to WKOB-LD, Channel 42-6. The network is an American television network broadcasting Christian programming in Spanish with affiliates across North and Central America.

Nicknamed \"[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]\" for his appearance (he often sported a [[Fu Manchu]] [[mustache]]) and stoic demeanor, the 7'1\" Edwards, though he never appeared in an [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], was a reliable low-post scorer, averaging 12.7 points per game over his career.\n\nHe retired with 14,862 career points and 6,004 career rebounds.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Seattle, Washington]], Edwards starred at [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]], where he led the Roughriders to the state title in 1973. He went on to play for the hometown [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|University of Washington]] Huskies under coach [[Marv Harshman]]. For his college career, between 1973 and 1977, Edwards averaged 14.6 points and 7.5 rebounds per game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/james-edwards-1.html|title=James Edwards|website=[[Sports Reference]]|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== NBA career ==\nEdwards played 19 years (1977\u20131996) in the [[National Basketball Association]], playing both the [[Center (basketball)|center]] and [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] positions.\n\n=== Los Angeles Lakers ===\n\nEdwards was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] on June 10, 1977 and made his NBA debut on October 18.\n<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/edwarja01.html</ref> He had a strong start to his rookie season, averaging 14.8 points and 7.2 rebounds before being traded later in the season.\n\n=== Indiana Pacers ===\nEdwards was then traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in 1977, where he enjoyed arguably his most productive statistical years. He averaged 15.9 points during his four years with the franchise.\n\n=== Cleveland Cavaliers ===\n\nEdwards spent parts of two seasons with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], averaging 16.0 points and 7.4 rebounds during his brief time there.\n\n=== Phoenix Suns ===\nEdwards was then traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in 1983, where he played for parts of six seasons. With the Suns he continued to be a key contributor, averaging 14.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game.\n\n===Drug investigation===\n\nIn April of 1987, Edwards, along with [[Jay Humphries]] and [[Grant Gondrezick]], was indicted by a [[Maricopa County]], Arizona, grand jury investigating cocaine trafficking.  Edwards was indicted on three counts, conspiracy to possess a narcotic drug, conspiracy to transfer a narcotic drug, and conspiracy to transfer or possess marijuana <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/18/sports/3-suns-players-are-indicted-in-drug-investigation.html</ref>.  Former Suns player [[Walter Davis (basketball)|Walter Davis]] was involved and was offered immunity in exchange for testimony, but his testimony failed to reveal critical details.  Edwards, along with all other defendants, never went to trial, but was required to undergo a drug counseling program as settlement <ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066773/1/index.htm</ref>.\n\n=== Detroit Pistons ===\n\nEdwards played four seasons with the [[Detroit Pistons]]. He was a key member of the 1989 and 1990 NBA [[NBA Finals|champion]] Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys squads, starting most of the team's games in 1990. He averaged 11.2 points and 3.6 rebounds as a Piston.\n\n=== Later career ===\n\nAfter his title runs with the Pistons, Edwards was traded to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] before the 1991-92 season, where he spent one season. He then signed with the Lakers for a second stint, spending two seasons with the team that drafted him.
