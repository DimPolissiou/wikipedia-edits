In 2007, its population was recorded as 307,987. Biskra is located in the north-east of [[Algeria]], about 248 miles (400&nbsp;km) from [[Algiers]], 71 miles (115&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] and 137 miles (222&nbsp;km) north of [[Touggourt]]. It is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The Door of the Desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location at the beginning of [[Sahara|the Sahara Desert]]. Due to its geographical location, its climate and natural resources, particularly farming, Biskra has always been a hub and a crossroad between the cities in the north and south. It has seen the passage of several civilizations, from [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]] and [[the Arabs]] to the French.\n\nIn 1844, Biskra became a French [[garrison]].<ref name=\"WDL2\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8784/ |title = Market, Biskra, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 25 September 2013 }}</ref> The town was used as a military post, and was the scene of severe fighting in the rebellions of 1849 and 1871. By 1935, Biskra was the principal settlement of a Saharan [[oasis]] watered by the intermittent ''[[Oued]] Biskra''.\n\nCurrently the city of Biskra has 28 neighborhoods, including the three principal neighborhoods of, Korra, City 60 Logements, and Equipment Zones. It is in the southern part of the Algerian rail system, and a popular winter resort.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nThe city has been known by several names, including Biskra, Sokkra, Vescra, Vecera, Vescera, Adbesran. Historians do not agree on the origins of the current name. Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} say its name comes down from the name Vescera, which means \"station\" or \"place\" of commercial exchange, due to its geographical location that connects north to south. But the Roman leader Betolimih BenyoubaII gave it another name, \"the river of destiny\", which is due to the river of Sidi Zarzour (its current name) that crosses the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome researchers{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that its name originates from the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name \"Adebesran,\" due to the ancient geothermal source that is located near the city, known as Salhine Hammam. Other sources{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that the real name comes down from the word \"Sokkra\", due to the better quality of the sweet dates that this city has everywhere in its oases. Still others{{Who|date=September 2019}} claim that the current name was given to the city by the Carthaginians.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Biskra Story.jpg|thumb|left]]\n\n=== Gaetuli ===\nThe [[Gaetuli]] first appeared in North Africa during the 3rd millennium BC. They settled on a large territory south of the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauritania.{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2019}} The Genset, a direct descendant of the branch of the Capesian civilization that migrated to the Sahara around 3000 BC, and is certainly the people who dominated in the most certain way Algeria during the 1500 years of its antiquity. They were according to the Greek historian Strabo the most numerous people of North Africa, but also the least known. Among the oldest references to the G\u00e9tules are probably those of the Carthaginians who indicate that the Prince of the G\u00e9tules proposed to marry \u00c9lyssa (or Dido for the Romans), the founding queen of Carthage (present Tunisia) around the year 815 BC. However, references in ancient Egypt of certain tribes go back to 1350 BC about in the reign of Akhenaton of the eighteenth dynasty that speaks of cattle trade with this people.\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are probably also the origin of [[Berber calendar|the Berber calendar]] which begins around 943\u2013949 BC. The beginning of this calendar would follow the victory of a coalition of G\u00e9tules over [[Egypt|the Egyptians]]. This coalition, formed by the North African tribes, left the south-west of Algeria, reinforcing its force en route wherever it passed in North Africa. The coalition led by [[Sheshonq]] (Berber name: Sheshnaq) defeated Pharaoh [[Psousennes II]]. Following this victory Sheshnaq married the daughter of the pharaoh, settled on the throne of Egypt under the name of Sheshonq in 952 BC, and founded the [[XXII Dynasty]]. This biblical event is mentioned in the Old Testament, which speaks of the pillaging of this leader of the Machaouach tribe. (The Berber calendar is a creation of Ammar NEGADI, it is he who chose this date for origin, his calendar was published in 1980 through the Association Union du Peuple Amazigh -UPA).\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are the Berber nomads of the pre-Saharan of North Africa and speak the Berber language with some variations. They came from the desert of the Caspian Sea (the world's largest inland sea, bordering present-day Iran) and were forced to migrate following the destruction of a natural dam that left them without a water source for their livestock.  Specialists of the desert life, they first settled on the edge of the Nile.  However, the Pharaohs hunted them in the sixth century BC.\n\nAlways while traversing the desert, arrived until Tassili with the Touaregs where they stayed a long time, got mixed up with the Touaregs and learned the Tamazigh language for reasons of communication, cultural and commercial exchanges. Unfortunately felt like \"Gringos\" in these places, decided to continue path until \"The Promised Land\":\n\nNorth Africa which has become almost theirs. In Algeria, they have set themselves at the limit of [[Aures]] for the dish to which they are accustomed, have posed problems to the Roman infiltration in the 3rd century BC because dreaded in combat and good horsemen. It was necessary to involve a late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] politician, Marius, to negotiate exploration of the South against concessions of agricultural land around Cirta and Setifis, at the time under Roman rule; a trick of dispersing them\nand so diminished in their strength. Thus, the G\u00e9tulie was occupied by the Romans (Biskra and its environs). This is what I learned from Charles Andr\u00e9s Julien and Courteau, both history teachers at the Sorbonne and specialists in North Africa.\n\n===The Romans Colonisation===\nThe city of Biskra experienced many very violent wars during the Roman colonization, including the great resistance war led by the Berber leader [[Tacfarinas]]. Followed by his successor the great healed militant [[Jugurtha]] \"Youghorta\" who resisted the Roman army. With the help of the inhabitants of the city, who did not hesitate to give their human and material support, Jugurtha destroyed the Roman army at the end of the so-called Noumidia region.\n\n===The Vandals in the 4th century===\n[[The Vandals]] \"Oundals\" invaded the city of Biskra and occupied all its land after a language resistance of its inhabitants. The weakness of the Vandals and lure falls in front of the resistance and the continuous fights of the inhabitants, forced them to integrate with the inhabitants of the Ziban in a complete way. \nAfter a few decades, the Romans took over the direction of the city where they built obstacles to protect themselves from the vengeance of the population.\n\n===The arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa El Fihri in the 7th century AD===\nThey remained with such vigilance until the arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa Elfehri in the 7th century AD. During this period, the whole area came under another monarchy. it was the Arab-Muslim monarchy. After 20 years of conquest, Okba Ben Nafaa died in 683 AD with his army when he returned from Morocco. His death was organized by an ambush mounted by his adversary the Numidian prince (Berber) Koceila and his army at the place called Tahouda, a small village located 5&nbsp;km from the oasis \"[[Sidi Okba]]\" whose body of this conqueror is based in the mosque of the city that took his name. According to the imam of this mosque, this place which contains more than 300 tombs, is the 4th holy place of [[Islam]], after [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Al-Aqsa Compound|Aksa]].\n\nIn the early 10th century, Biskra and the entire Ziban area were conquered by the kings of Beni Hammad.\n\n===The Hillal Bannis in the 12th century AD===\nFollowed by the kabyla of Elathbend banished Hilal (Hilalian Arabs) who removed and confiscated the property of the inhabitants. They asked the help of the Almohads of the kingdom of Marrakech in the 12th century AD.\n\n===The Hafsids in the 14th century AD===\nIn the 14th century AD, the Hafssid arrived in [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. Biskra became a very important pole for the Hafsids of Tunisia where it remained under lure monarchy and direction for a long time then under the authority of M\u00e9rinides of [[Fez]] and banned Abd-Elouadi and the Znatiyin of [[Tlemcen]].\n\n===The conquest of the city by the Turks in 1541===\nIn 1541, the conquest of the city by the Turks began, under the direction of Hocine Agha who defended the city of [[Algiers]] at the time and brought out the strength of Charles Compte of the latter.\n\n[[The Ottoman Empire]] remained in the city 3 centuries until the French colonization in 1830.\n\n===French colonization from 1844===\nIndeed, after the invasion of the city of Biskra in 1844, and due to its protective geographical nature, the French army, built a secure area in its agglomeration to oppose the popular resistance of the inhabitants. But the progress of the liberation movement of El-hadj Mohammed Esaghire Elokbi, the successor or \"caliphate\" of El-Emir Abdelkader who went to General Lamoriciere on 23 December 1847, destroyed his armor and returned to a war of two fronts, the first against the Ben Ghana family and the French forces and the second front against the pillaging and embezzlement of Ahmed Bey and his monarchy in Constantine.\n\nThus, the opposition and the refusal of the rebels continued until the war of Zaatcha 20 kilometers west of Biskra in 1849. The refusal threatened the French to drag on throughout the Ziban area and could even spreading to Aur\u00e8s under the leadership of Sheikh Bou Zian, who refused to pay the palm tax, Lieutenant Seroka, of the Arab Bureau of Biskra, the Zaatcha affair began.\n\nDuring this first period, the war of Bou Zian, chief of tribe, is memorable. The columns entered the gardens, delimited by small walls, which surrounded the Ksours in the oases and formed an inextricable maze. The shooting was terrible, the natives retreated but there are already several dead and many wounded, finished with the knife by Bou Zian, and his men. Carbuccia, the French Colonel withdrew. The failure was serious, the moral effect disastrous. Bou Zian exploited his victory and sent burning letters to the AURES and ZIBAN people ...\n\nArrived in front of the zone called Zaatcha the French met a bastioned wall, crenellated, preceded by a ditch of 7 meters wide and 1 to 3 meters deep filled with water.\n\nColonel Carbuccia in charge of this mission was surprised by the topography of the ground and the resistance which opposed him in the middle of a dense vegetation. The struggles and fights continued for 7 months without stopping. It took 7,000 troops and 53 days of blockade for the destruction of the siege by the three colonels together: Canrobert, Barral, and Lourmel giving the death of Chief Bouzian with 1400 besieged and 2130 people on the French side.\n\nThis defeat did not diminish the will of the inhabitants to resist against the forces of the French armies. Indeed, the inhabitants led many wars the most known, was the war of El-kamri in 1879.\n\nAfter nearly 100 years of events in Zaatcha, and in 1954, Biskra was among the important place where the war of 1 November began notably in the mountains of Aur\u00e8s and in the adobe villages, all surrounded by palm trees, with the walls and the saguias separating the gardens, present to the assailant considerable difficultie.\n\n===In culture===\nAt the end of the 19th century Biskra, a popular spa town and gateway to the Sahara, became a centre for artists and photographers such as \u00c9mile Frechon, Alexandre Bougault and Rudolf Lehnert. From 1872 to 1920 the French Count Albert Landon de Longueville hosted in his villa-cum-chateau at Biskra (today Villa B\u00e9n\u00e9vent), nobility, artists and writers, including B\u00e9la Bartok, Oscar Wilde, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Nasreddine Dinet, Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin, Karl Marx, Anatole France, Francis James and Henri Matisse.\n\nBiskra is the setting of key sections of [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]'s 1902 novel ''[[The Immoralist]]'' and lesser known 1897 prose-poem ''[[Les nourritures terrestres]]'' (The Fruits of the Earth), and he visited the town in 1895 (for a fortnight from 31 January) with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], following a meeting with [[Oscar Wilde]] in [[Blida]] and [[Algiers]].<!-- This was a very significant time for Gide \u2013 and he writes about his meetings with Wilde at great length. -->\n\nThe French artist [[Henri Matisse]] has a work titled [[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]] an oil painting finished in 1907.\n\nThe Hungarian composer [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] collected traditional music in Biskra in 1913.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe Polish composer [[Karol Szymanowski]], who traveled to North Africa, seemed to have been quite impressed by Biskra. This trip probably aroused a genuine interest for the North African/ Arabic culture. He composed many pieces influenced by his experience there. He sent a post card from Biskra on 11 April 1914.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDiana Mayo, protagonist of [[Edith Maude Hull]]'s popular 1919 novel ''[[The Sheik (novel)|The Sheik]]'', starts her journey into the desert from Biskra, and in the identically-named 1921 [[silent movie]] ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'' starring [[Rudolph Valentino]] in perhaps his most famous role.\n\nWinston Churchill's cousin, sculptress and author [[Clare Sheridan]] held a salon in Biskra in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=time>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=A Modest Proposal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884346,00.html |quote=...

Part of the city is surrounded by the Sfa Pass and the [[Aures, Algeria|Ziban Mountains]]. In the outskirts of Biskra, the landscape is very arid with all the same vegetation that vary depending on the location. Small water points can be found in the outskirts of Biskra, especially in the oases and canyons of the mountains around [[El Kantara]]. The prefecture of Biskra is crossed by Oued Labiod waterways, Oued El Arab, Djedi, Oued Mezira\u00e2, Oued El and Oued el Gantara. The city covers an area of 127.55 km2 (49.25 sq mi).

The population of Biskra are called Biskri.\n\nAs in the rest of the country, Biskra does not observe summer time and stays in the same time zone all year round. Whether winter or summer, the time is always the same in Biskra. The sunrise is around 7:41&nbsp;am to 21 December and 5:24&nbsp;am on 21 June. The sunset is around 5:30&nbsp;pm on 21 December and at 7:54&nbsp;pm on 21 June.\n\n===Cityscape===\n[[File:Biskra Cityscape.jpg|550px|thumb|center|Biskra Cityscape.]]\n\n[[File:Biskra City U.jpg|550px|thumb|center|[[Biskra University]].]]\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:BiskraNigthStreet.jpg|thumb|left|Street of Biskra at night]]\n[[File:Biskra Street.jpg|thumb|right|Biskra Street]]\n[[File:BiskraCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Biskra Sunset from City Center]]\n\nThe city of Biskra has gone through three phases before getting to where she is today. Started by the pre-colonial phase which testifies, that the city was pending this period under Roman rule over country of the Berbers, and having taken the role of the capital of southern Numidia, and the\n\nA very prosperous city, built by the Muslims in the Middle Ages. During [[Turkic peoples|the Turkish]] period the city was hit by epidemics, binding occupiers of the fort to leave the city to settle, in a group scattered the interior of the palm grove, south of the city, around two elements of the form local production, the built environment that are the mosque and seguias, besides the use local building materials.\n\nSecondly, the city was marked by the colonial phase characterized by the building of fort saint germain on the northern part, and the construction of a city (the colonial checkerboard) by an urban model, different from the previous one, and having undergone several extension, particularly the 1st and 2nd and the Dervau Plan, followed during the 50s, by popular extensions to the South at the expense of the palm grove and without dimensional and formal logic.\n\nIn the end the post colonial phase characterized by the proliferation of self-built no plan to urban and architectural quality at least and without model, where typological reference, which has only to be curbed, after the instruction of the laws intervention and control of the state, over the urban space, by launching large Housing development operations in the framework of ZUNH, in the form of housing communal collective or subdivision which, despite this, has not been able to resolve the demand for housing, bringing the state to promulgation, other laws havingobjective, improving urban quality, openness and diversification stakeholders.\n\nToday, the city of Biskra is made up of 28 neighborhoods including 3 main ones which are, Korra, City 60 Logts ENICAB and Equipment Zones.\n\n===Climate===\nBiskra has a [[subtropical]] [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') typical of the region in which it is found. The city has long and extremely hot summers and short, pleasantly warm winters. In summer, the peaks of heat are among the highest in the country with temperatures that can exceed 120&nbsp;\u00b0F (48&nbsp;\u00b0C) and are similar to cities like [[Luxor]] or [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The average peak July temperature, which is the hottest month, is about 108&nbsp;\u00b0F (42&nbsp;\u00b0C). On average, the city experiences more than 92 days a year where the temperature is equal to or exceeds 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) and nearly 20 days above 110&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.8&nbsp;\u00b0C). In comparison, New York City has had a total of 59 days when the temperature was equivalent to or above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) since 1870. Temperatures generally begin to approach or even exceed 94&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) by April. Biskra is one of the hottest cities in the country when it comes to daytime temperatures. Indeed, this one is often higher than (27&nbsp;\u00b0C) during the hottest months. The highest minimum temperature recorded in Biskra was 98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.5&nbsp;\u00b0C) on 4 July 1993, making it the hottest night ever recorded in the city. On 14 July 1910, the temperature reached 124&nbsp;\u00b0F (51&nbsp;\u00b0C) which is the record of heat in Biskra.\n\n[[File:Biskra Haboob.jpg|thumb|right|A 2018 Haboob]]\n[[File:Biskra parc.jpg|thumb|left|A rain at Biskra]]\n\nThe climate is very dry and mostly very clear. Rainfall is limited to only 128.8&nbsp;mm per year. Precipitation is quite rare despite some showers usually during the coldest months, mainly January and February, where it rains several times in the season, which brings the majority of humidity to Biskra in a year. The highest precipitation record recorded in Biskra in a year is (600.5&nbsp;mm) in 1910 while the driest year is only (27.7&nbsp;mm) recorded in 1945.

The month with the highest air rate in Biskra is December with 59% humidity, July is the least heavy month with only 27% on average per year. Aside from rainfall or humidity, sandstorms can occur several times a month and even become [[Haboob]], which can make visibility almost zero. Biskra has a very good duration of sunshine in the year with an average of 3,292 hours of sunshine a year. The wettest month is November with (20.1&nbsp;mm), while July is the driest month with (1.7&nbsp;mm).\n\nThe hot, dry and sunny climate of the city sometimes attracts some inhabitants of the northern regions as in the city of [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] located 115&nbsp;km northeast, which experiences fairly icy and wet winters during this period, to enjoy the pleasant weather and sunny in winter.\n\nOn average, Biskra knows no day in the year with a temperature below zero. Moving away from the urban area, the risk of frost may be more frequent and night temperatures are lower.

[[Biskra Province]], Algeria. In 2007, its population was recorded as 307,987. Biskra is located in the north-east of [[Algeria]], about 248 miles (400&nbsp;km) from [[Algiers]], 71 miles (115&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] and 137 miles (222&nbsp;km) north of [[Touggourt]]. It is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The Door of the Desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location at the beginning of [[Sahara|the Sahara Desert]]. Due to its geographical location, its climate and natural resources, particularly farming, Biskra has always been a hub and a crossroad between the cities in the north and south. It has seen the passage of several civilizations, from [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]] and [[the Arabs]] to the French.\n\nIn 1844, Biskra became a French [[garrison]].<ref name=\"WDL2\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8784/ |title = Market, Biskra, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 25 September 2013 }}</ref> The town was used as a military post, and was the scene of severe fighting in the rebellions of 1849 and 1871. By 1935, Biskra was the principal settlement of a Saharan [[oasis]] watered by the intermittent ''[[Oued]] Biskra''.\n\nCurrently the city of Biskra has 28 neighborhoods, including the three principal neighborhoods of, Korra, City 60 Logements, and Equipment Zones. It is in the southern part of the Algerian rail system, and a popular winter resort.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nThe city has been known by several names, including Biskra, Sokkra, Vescra, Vecera, Vescera, Adbesran. Historians do not agree on the origins of the current name. Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} say its name comes down from the name Vescera, which means \"station\" or \"place\" of commercial exchange, due to its geographical location that connects north to south. But the Roman leader Betolimih BenyoubaII gave it another name, \"the river of destiny\", which is due to the river of Sidi Zarzour (its current name) that crosses the city.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome researchers{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that its name originates from the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name \"Adebesran,\" due to the ancient geothermal source that is located near the city, known as Salhine Hammam. Other sources{{Who|date=September 2019}} say that the real name comes down from the word \"Sokkra\", due to the better quality of the sweet dates that this city has everywhere in its oases. Still others{{Who|date=September 2019}} claim that the current name was given to the city by the Carthaginians.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Biskra Story.jpg|thumb|left]]\n\n=== Gaetuli ===\nThe [[Gaetuli]] first appeared in North Africa during the 3rd millennium BC. They settled on a large territory south of the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauritania.{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2019}} The Genset, a direct descendant of the branch of the Capesian civilization that migrated to the Sahara around 3000 BC, and is certainly the people who dominated in the most certain way Algeria during the 1500 years of its antiquity. They were according to the Greek historian Strabo the most numerous people of North Africa, but also the least known. Among the oldest references to the G\u00e9tules are probably those of the Carthaginians who indicate that the Prince of the G\u00e9tules proposed to marry \u00c9lyssa (or Dido for the Romans), the founding queen of Carthage (present Tunisia) around the year 815 BC. However, references in ancient Egypt of certain tribes go back to 1350 BC about in the reign of Akhenaton of the eighteenth dynasty that speaks of cattle trade with this people.\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are probably also the origin of [[Berber calendar|the Berber calendar]] which begins around 943\u2013949 BC. The beginning of this calendar would follow the victory of a coalition of G\u00e9tules over [[Egypt|the Egyptians]]. This coalition, formed by the North African tribes, left the south-west of Algeria, reinforcing its force en route wherever it passed in North Africa. The coalition led by [[Sheshonq]] (Berber name: Sheshnaq) defeated Pharaoh [[Psousennes II]]. Following this victory Sheshnaq married the daughter of the pharaoh, settled on the throne of Egypt under the name of Sheshonq in 952 BC, and founded the [[XXII Dynasty]]. This biblical event is mentioned in the Old Testament, which speaks of the pillaging of this leader of the Machaouach tribe. (The Berber calendar is a creation of Ammar NEGADI, it is he who chose this date for origin, his calendar was published in 1980 through the Association Union du Peuple Amazigh -UPA).\n\nThe G\u00e9tules are the Berber nomads of the pre-Saharan of North Africa and speak the Berber language with some variations. They came from the desert of the Caspian Sea (the world's largest inland sea, bordering present-day Iran) and were forced to migrate following the destruction of a natural dam that left them without a water source for their livestock.  Specialists of the desert life, they first settled on the edge of the Nile.  However, the Pharaohs hunted them in the sixth century BC.\n\nAlways while traversing the desert, arrived until Tassili with the Touaregs where they stayed a long time, got mixed up with the Touaregs and learned the Tamazigh language for reasons of communication, cultural and commercial exchanges. Unfortunately felt like \"Gringos\" in these places, decided to continue path until \"The Promised Land\":\n\nNorth Africa which has become almost theirs. In Algeria, they have set themselves at the limit of [[Aures]] for the dish to which they are accustomed, have posed problems to the Roman infiltration in the 3rd century BC because dreaded in combat and good horsemen. It was necessary to involve a late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] politician, Marius, to negotiate exploration of the South against concessions of agricultural land around Cirta and Setifis, at the time under Roman rule; a trick of dispersing them\nand so diminished in their strength. Thus, the G\u00e9tulie was occupied by the Romans (Biskra and its environs). This is what I learned from Charles Andr\u00e9s Julien and Courteau, both history teachers at the Sorbonne and specialists in North Africa.\n\n===The Romans Colonisation===\nThe city of Biskra experienced many very violent wars during the Roman colonization, including the great resistance war led by the Berber leader [[Tacfarinas]]. Followed by his successor the great healed militant [[Jugurtha]] \"Youghorta\" who resisted the Roman army. With the help of the inhabitants of the city, who did not hesitate to give their human and material support, Jugurtha destroyed the Roman army at the end of the so-called Noumidia region.\n\n===The Vandals in the 4th century===\n[[The Vandals]] \"Oundals\" invaded the city of Biskra and occupied all its land after a language resistance of its inhabitants. The weakness of the Vandals and lure falls in front of the resistance and the continuous fights of the inhabitants, forced them to integrate with the inhabitants of the Ziban in a complete way. \nAfter a few decades, the Romans took over the direction of the city where they built obstacles to protect themselves from the vengeance of the population.\n\n===The arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa El Fihri in the 7th century AD===\nThey remained with such vigilance until the arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa Elfehri in the 7th century AD. During this period, the whole area came under another monarchy. it was the Arab-Muslim monarchy. After 20 years of conquest, Okba Ben Nafaa died in 683 AD with his army when he returned from Morocco. His death was organized by an ambush mounted by his adversary the Numidian prince (Berber) Koceila and his army at the place called Tahouda, a small village located 5&nbsp;km from the oasis \"[[Sidi Okba]]\" whose body of this conqueror is based in the mosque of the city that took his name. According to the imam of this mosque, this place which contains more than 300 tombs, is the 4th holy place of [[Islam]], after [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Al-Aqsa Compound|Aksa]].\n\nIn the early 10th century, Biskra and the entire Ziban area were conquered by the kings of Beni Hammad.\n\n===The Hillal Bannis in the 12th century AD===\nFollowed by the kabyla of Elathbend banished Hilal (Hilalian Arabs) who removed and confiscated the property of the inhabitants. They asked the help of the Almohads of the kingdom of Marrakech in the 12th century AD.\n\n===The Hafsids in the 14th century AD===\nIn the 14th century AD, the Hafssid arrived in [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]]. Biskra became a very important pole for the Hafsids of Tunisia where it remained under lure monarchy and direction for a long time then under the authority of M\u00e9rinides of [[Fez]] and banned Abd-Elouadi and the Znatiyin of [[Tlemcen]].\n\n===The conquest of the city by the Turks in 1541===\nIn 1541, the conquest of the city by the Turks began, under the direction of Hocine Agha who defended the city of [[Algiers]] at the time and brought out the strength of Charles Compte of the latter.\n\n[[The Ottoman Empire]] remained in the city 3 centuries until the French colonization in 1830.\n\n===French colonization from 1844===\nIndeed, after the invasion of the city of Biskra in 1844, and due to its protective geographical nature, the French army, built a secure area in its agglomeration to oppose the popular resistance of the inhabitants. But the progress of the liberation movement of El-hadj Mohammed Esaghire Elokbi, the successor or \"caliphate\" of El-Emir Abdelkader who went to General Lamoriciere on 23 December 1847, destroyed his armor and returned to a war of two fronts, the first against the Ben Ghana family and the French forces and the second front against the pillaging and embezzlement of Ahmed Bey and his monarchy in Constantine.\n\nThus, the opposition and the refusal of the rebels continued until the war of Zaatcha 20 kilometers west of Biskra in 1849. The refusal threatened the French to drag on throughout the Ziban area and could even spreading to Aur\u00e8s under the leadership of Sheikh Bou Zian, who refused to pay the palm tax, Lieutenant Seroka, of the Arab Bureau of Biskra, the Zaatcha affair began.\n\nDuring this first period, the war of Bou Zian, chief of tribe, is memorable. The columns entered the gardens, delimited by small walls, which surrounded the Ksours in the oases and formed an inextricable maze. The shooting was terrible, the natives retreated but there are already several dead and many wounded, finished with the knife by Bou Zian, and his men. Carbuccia, the French Colonel withdrew. The failure was serious, the moral effect disastrous. Bou Zian exploited his victory and sent burning letters to the AURES and ZIBAN people ...\n\nArrived in front of the zone called Zaatcha the French met a bastioned wall, crenellated, preceded by a ditch of 7 meters wide and 1 to 3 meters deep filled with water.\n\nColonel Carbuccia in charge of this mission was surprised by the topography of the ground and the resistance which opposed him in the middle of a dense vegetation.

It is probably the main contributor to the [[stimulant]] effect of ''Catha edulis''. Cathinone differs from many other amphetamines in that it has a [[ketone]] [[functional group]]. Other phenethylamines that share this structure include the stimulants [[methcathinone]], [[MDPV]], [[mephedrone]] and the [[antidepressant]] [[bupropion]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Discovery=== \n[[Khat]] has been cultivated in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula region of the world for thousands of years. It is most commonly chewed for the [[euphoria|euphoric]] effect it produces. The active ingredient was first proposed in 1930, when [[cathine]] was identified as a predominant alkaloid in the plant.<ref name=\"Patel\">{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=N.B.|title=Mechanism of Action of Cathinone: The Active Ingredient of Khat (Catha Edulis)|journal=East African Medical Journal|date=2009|volume=77|issue=6|pages=329\u201332|pmid=12858935|doi=10.4314/eamj.v77i6.46651|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/eamj/article/download/46651/33046}}</ref> Cathine was thought to be the main active ingredient in khat until the 1960s, when it was found that the amount of cathine in the khat leaves is insufficient to produce the effects observed. In 1975, the United Nations Narcotic Laboratory analyzed khat leaves from [[Yemen]], [[Kenya]] and [[Madagascar]] and found the presence of a different alkaloid, cathinone.<ref name=\"Patel\"/> Cathinone is a similar molecule to cathine, but is much more abundant in younger plants.  This finding caused scientists to speculate about whether cathinone was the true active ingredient in khat.<ref name=\"Patel\"/>  \n  \nA study was conducted in 1994 to test the effects of cathinone. Six volunteers who had never chewed khat were given an active khat sample and a cathinone-free [[placebo]] sample.<ref name=\"Wilder\">{{cite journal|last1=Wilder|first1=Peter|last2=Mathys|first2=Karoline|last3=Brenneisen|first3=Rudolf|last4=Kalix|first4=Peter|last5=Fisch|first5=Hans-Ulrich|title=Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Khat: A Controlled Study|journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics|date=May 1994|volume=55|issue=5|pages=556\u201362|pmid=7910126|doi=10.1038/clpt.1994.69}}</ref> The researchers analyzed the participants\u2019 moods, activity levels and blood pressure before and after consuming the khat or placebo. This analysis showed that cathinone produced amphetamine-like symptoms, leading the researchers to confirm that cathinone, not cathine, is the active ingredient in khat leaves.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/>\n\n===Cultural significance===\n[[File:Qat man.jpg|thumb|left|Man chewing khat]]\nOver 20 million people in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[East Africa]] chew khat leaves daily.  It is an important piece of the culture and economy in this region, especially in [[Ethiopia]] (where khat is said to have originated), Kenya, [[Djibouti]], and Yemen.  Men usually chew it during parties or other social gatherings while smoking cigarettes and drinking tea.  Farmers and other workers also use khat in the afternoon to reduce fatigue and hunger as the day goes on.  It functions like the [[caffeine]] in a strong cup of coffee as an anti-fatigue drug.  Students and drivers have been known to use it to stay alert for longer periods of time.<ref name=\"Kirby\">{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=Alex|title=Yemen's khat habit soaks up water|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012084142/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm|archivedate=12 October 2014}}</ref> \n\nIn order to produce its desired effects, khat leaves should be chewed fresh.  The fresh leaves have a higher concentration of cathinone.  Waiting too long after cultivation to chew the leaf will allow the cathinone to break down into its less potent form, cathine.  Because of the need for quick chewing, it is a habit that has historically been prevalent only where the plant grows.  However, in the recent years with improvements in road and air transport, khat chewing has spread to all corners of the world.\n\nThe cultivation of khat in Yemen is a highly profitable industry for farmers.  Khat plants will grow differently depending on the climate they are grown in and each one will produce different amounts of cathinone.<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\">{{cite journal|last1=Al-Motarreb|first1=Ahmed|last2=Baker|first2=Kathryn|last3=Broadley|first3=Kenneth J.|title=Khat: Pharmacological and Medical Aspects and Its Social Use in Yemen|journal=Phytotherapy Research|date=2002|volume=16|issue=2|pages=403\u201313|doi=10.1002/ptr.1106|pmid=12203257}}</ref>  It generally doesn\u2019t grow as well as in coastal, hot climates.

These [[neurotransmitters]] are all considered [[monoamine]]s and share the general structure of an [[aromatic ring]] and an [[amine]] group attached by a two-carbon separator.<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\"/> Because cathinone is a [[hydrophobic]] molecule, it can easily cross cell membranes and other barriers, including the [[blood-brain barrier]].<ref name=\"Hugins\"/> This property allows it to interact with the monoamine transporters in the [[synaptic cleft]] between [[neurons]].

Chewing releases juices from the leaves, which include the alkaloid cathinone. The absorption of cathinone has two phases: one in the [[buccal mucosa]] and one in the [[stomach]] and [[small intestine]].<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> The stomach and small intestine are very important in the absorption of ingested alkaloids.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> At approximately 2.3 hours after chewing khat leaves, the maximum concentration of cathinone in blood plasma is reached. The mean residence time is 5.2 \u00b1 3.4 hours.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> The elimination half-life of cathinone is 1.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> A two-compartment model for absorption and elimination best describes this data. However, at most, only 7% of the ingested cathinone is recovered in the urine.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> This indicates that the cathinone is being broken down in the body. Cathinone has been shown to selectively metabolize into R,S-(-)-norephedrine and cathine. The reduction of the [[ketone]] group in cathinone will produce cathine. This reduction is catalyzed by enzymes in the liver. The spontaneous breakdown of cathinone is the reason it must be chewed fresh after cultivation.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/>\n\n===Effects on health===\nThe first documentation of the khat plant being used in medicine was in a book published by an Arabian physician in the 10th century.<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\"/> It was used as an [[antidepressant]] because it led to feelings of happiness and excitement. Chronic khat chewing can also create drug dependence, as shown by animal studies.<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\"/> In such studies, monkeys were trained to push a lever to receive the drug reward. As the monkeys' dependence increased, they pressed the lever at an increasing frequency.<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\"/>\n\nKhat chewing and the effects of cathinone on the body differ from person to person, but there is a general pattern of behavior that emerges after ingesting fresh cathinone:<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\"/>\n\n# Feelings of euphoria that last for one to two hours\n# Discussion of serious issues and increased [[irritability]]\n# The chewer's imagination is very active\n# Depressive stage\n# Irritability, [[loss of appetite]] and [[insomnia]]\n\nThere are other effects not related to the CNS. The chewer can develop [[constipation]] and [[heartburn]] after a khat session.

The CoA-dependent pathway is actually a mix between the two main pathways as it starts like the beta-oxidative pathway and then when it loses CoA, it finishes the synthesis in the non-beta-oxidative pathway.  In this pathway, the trans-cinnamic acid produced from L-phenylalanine is ligated to a [[Coenzyme A]] (CoA), just like the beginning of the beta-oxidative pathway.<ref name=\"Hagel\"/> It then undergoes [[hydration reaction|hydration]] at the double bond.  This product then loses the CoA to produce [[benzaldehyde]], an intermediate of the non-beta-oxidative pathway.  Benzaldehyde is converted into benzoic acid and proceeds through the rest of the synthesis.<ref name=\"Hagel\"/>\n\n===Synthetic production===\n {{multiple image\n | width = 300\n | footer = Two mechanism of synthesizing Cathinone\n | image1 = Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure S-Cathinone.png\n | alt1 = Synthesize enantiomerically pure S-Cathinone\n | caption1 = Synthesize enantiomerically pure S-Cathinone\n | image2 = Cathinone synthesis.svg\n | alt2 = Racemic cathinone from propiophenone via the ''\u03b1''-brominated intermediate\n | caption2 = Racemic cathinone from propiophenone via the ''\u03b1''-brominated intermediate\n }}\nCathinone can be synthetically produced from propiophenone through a [[Friedel-Crafts]] Acylation of propionic acid and benzene.<ref name=\"Hugins\"/>  The resulting [[propiophenone]] can be brominated, and the bromine can be substituted with ammonia to produce a racemic mixture of cathinone. A different synthetic strategy must be employed to produce enantiomerically pure (S)-cathinone.

By reducing the ketone, it becomes cathine if it retains its stereochemistry, or norephedrine if its stereochemistry is inverted.  Cathine is a less potent version of cathinone and cathinone's spontaneous reduction is the reason that older khat plants are not as stimulating as younger ones.  Cathinone and amphetamine are closely related in that amphetamine is only lacking the ketone C=O group.<ref name=\"Synthetic Cathinone\">{{cite web|title=Synthetic cathinones drug profile|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/synthetic-cathinones|website=European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction|publisher=EMCDDA|accessdate=8 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317061401/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/synthetic-cathinones|archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref>  Cathinone is structurally related to [[methcathinone]], in much the same way as [[amphetamine]] is related to [[methamphetamine]]. Cathinone differs from amphetamine by possessing a [[ketone]] [[oxygen]] atom (C=O) on the ''\u03b2'' (beta) position of the side chain.  The corresponding alcohol,  [[cathine]], is a less powerful stimulant. The biophysiological conversion from cathinone to cathine is to blame for the depotentiation of [[khat]] leaves over time. Fresh leaves have a greater ratio of cathinone to cathine than dried ones, therefore having more psychoactive effects.\n\nThere are many cathinone derivatives that include the addition of an R group to the amino end of the molecule.  Some of these derivatives have medical uses as well.  [[Bupropion]] is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and its structure is Cathinone with a tertiary butyl group attached to the nitrogen and chlorine attached to the benzene ring [[meta- (chemistry)]] to the main carbon chain.<ref name=\"Synthetic Cathinone\"/>\n\nOther cathinone derivatives are strong psychoactive drugs.

Men usually chew it during parties or other social gatherings while smoking cigarettes and drinking tea.  Farmers and other workers also use khat in the afternoon to reduce fatigue and hunger as the day goes on.  It functions like the [[caffeine]] in a strong cup of coffee as an anti-fatigue drug.

The fresh leaves have a higher concentration of cathinone.  Waiting too long after cultivation to chew the leaf will allow the cathinone to break down into its less potent form, cathine.  Because of the need for quick chewing, it is a habit that has historically been prevalent only where the plant grows.  However, in the recent years with improvements in road and air transport, khat chewing has spread to all corners of the world.\n\nThe cultivation of khat in Yemen is a highly profitable industry for farmers.

Chewing releases juices from the leaves, which include the alkaloid cathinone. The absorption of cathinone has two phases: one in the [[buccal mucosa]] and one in the [[stomach]] and [[small intestine]].<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> The stomach and small intestine are very important in the absorption of ingested alkaloids.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> At approximately 2.3 hours after chewing khat leaves, the maximum concentration of cathinone in blood plasma is reached.

However, at most, only 7% of the ingested cathinone is recovered in the urine.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/> This indicates that the cathinone is being broken down in the body. Cathinone has been shown to selectively metabolize into R,S-(-)-norephedrine and cathine. The reduction of the [[ketone]] group in cathinone will produce cathine. This reduction is catalyzed by enzymes in the liver. The spontaneous breakdown of cathinone is the reason it must be chewed fresh after cultivation.<ref name=\"Wilder\"/>\n\n===Effects on health===\nThe first documentation of the khat plant being used in medicine was in a book published by an Arabian physician in the 10th century.<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\"/> It was used as an [[antidepressant]] because it led to feelings of happiness and excitement. Chronic khat chewing can also create drug dependence, as shown by animal studies.<ref name=\"Al-Motarreb\"/> In such studies, monkeys were trained to push a lever to receive the drug reward.

The beta-oxidative pathway produces [[benzoyl-CoA]] while the non-beta-oxidative pathway produces [[benzoic acid]].<ref name=\"Hagel\"/>  Both of these molecules can be converted to 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione by a [[condensation reaction]] catalyzed by a ThDP-dependent enzyme (Thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme) with [[pyruvate]] and producing CO2.<ref name=\"Hagel\"/>  1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione goes though a transaminase reaction to replace a ketone with an ammonia group to form (S)-cathinone.  (S)-Cathinone can then undergo a reduction reaction to produce the less potent but structurally similar cathine or norephedrine, which are also found in the plant.<ref name=\"Hagel\">{{cite journal|last1=Hagel|first1=Jillian M.|last2=Krizevski|first2=Raz|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Korey|last4=Sitrit|first4=Yaron|last5=Marsolais|first5=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|last6=Lewinsohn|first6=Efraim|last7=Facchini|first7=Peter J.|title=Expressed Sequence Tag Analysis of Khat (Catha Edulis) Provides a Putative Molecular Biochemical Basis for the Biosynthesis of Phenylpropylamino Alkaloids|journal=Genetics and Molecular Biology|date=October 2011|volume=34|issue=4|pages=640\u2013646|doi=10.1590/S1415-47572011000400017|pmid=22215969|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Expressed+Sequence+Tag+Analysis+of+Khat+(Catha+Edulis)+Provides+a+Putative+Molecular+Biochemical+Basis+for+the+Biosynthesis+of+Phenylpropylamino+Alkaloids|accessdate=8 March 2015|pmc=3229120|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704180945/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Expressed+Sequence+Tag+Analysis+of+Khat+(Catha+Edulis)+Provides+a+Putative+Molecular+Biochemical+Basis+for+the+Biosynthesis+of+Phenylpropylamino+Alkaloids|archivedate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAside from the beta- and non-beta-oxidative pathways, the biosynthesis of cathinone can proceed through a CoA-dependent pathway.  The CoA-dependent pathway is actually a mix between the two main pathways as it starts like the beta-oxidative pathway and then when it loses CoA, it finishes the synthesis in the non-beta-oxidative pathway.  In this pathway, the trans-cinnamic acid produced from L-phenylalanine is ligated to a [[Coenzyme A]] (CoA), just like the beginning of the beta-oxidative pathway.<ref name=\"Hagel\"/> It then undergoes [[hydration reaction|hydration]] at the double bond.  This product then loses the CoA to produce [[benzaldehyde]], an intermediate of the non-beta-oxidative pathway.  Benzaldehyde is converted into benzoic acid and proceeds through the rest of the synthesis.<ref name=\"Hagel\"/>\n\n===Synthetic production===\n {{multiple image\n | width = 300\n | footer = Two mechanism of synthesizing Cathinone\n | image1 = Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure S-Cathinone.png\n | alt1 = Synthesize enantiomerically pure S-Cathinone\n | caption1 = Synthesize enantiomerically pure S-Cathinone\n | image2 = Cathinone synthesis.svg\n | alt2 = Racemic cathinone from propiophenone via the ''\u03b1''-brominated intermediate\n | caption2 = Racemic cathinone from propiophenone via the ''\u03b1''-brominated intermediate\n }}\nCathinone can be synthetically produced from propiophenone through a [[Friedel-Crafts]] Acylation of propionic acid and benzene.<ref name=\"Hugins\"/>  The resulting [[propiophenone]] can be brominated, and the bromine can be substituted with ammonia to produce a racemic mixture of cathinone. A different synthetic strategy must be employed to produce enantiomerically pure (S)-cathinone.  This synthetic route starts out with the N-acetylation of the [[optically active]] [[amino acid]], S-alanine.<ref name=\"Hugins\"/>  Then, [[phosphorus pentachloride]] (PCl<sub>5</sub>) is used to chlorinate the [[carboxylic acid]] forming an acyl chloride. At the same time, a Friedel-Crafts acylation is preformed on benzene with aluminum chloride catalyst.

By reducing the ketone, it becomes cathine if it retains its stereochemistry, or norephedrine if its stereochemistry is inverted.  Cathine is a less potent version of cathinone and cathinone's spontaneous reduction is the reason that older khat plants are not as stimulating as younger ones.  Cathinone and amphetamine are closely related in that amphetamine is only lacking the ketone C=O group.<ref name=\"Synthetic Cathinone\">{{cite web|title=Synthetic cathinones drug profile|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/synthetic-cathinones|website=European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction|publisher=EMCDDA|accessdate=8 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317061401/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/synthetic-cathinones|archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref>  Cathinone is structurally related to [[methcathinone]], in much the same way as [[amphetamine]] is related to [[methamphetamine]]. Cathinone differs from amphetamine by possessing a [[ketone]] [[oxygen]] atom (C=O) on the ''\u03b2'' (beta) position of the side chain.  The corresponding alcohol,  [[cathine]], is a less powerful stimulant. The biophysiological conversion from cathinone to cathine is to blame for the depotentiation of [[khat]] leaves over time. Fresh leaves have a greater ratio of cathinone to cathine than dried ones, therefore having more psychoactive effects.\n\nThere are many cathinone derivatives that include the addition of an R group to the amino end of the molecule.  Some of these derivatives have medical uses as well.  [[Bupropion]] is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and its structure is Cathinone with a tertiary butyl group attached to the nitrogen and chlorine attached to the benzene ring [[meta- (chemistry)]] to the main carbon chain.<ref name=\"Synthetic Cathinone\"/>\n\nOther cathinone derivatives are strong psychoactive drugs.  One such drug is [[methylone]], a drug structurally similar to [[MDMA]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bupropion]]\n* [[Central nervous system]]\n* [[Khat]]\n* [[Substituted cathinone]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/cathinone/ Erowid Cathinone Vault]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1296958,00.html Cathinone Popularity Soars in Israel]\n\n{{Stimulants}}\n{{Monoamine releasing agents}}\n{{Phenethylamines}}\n\n[[Category:Cathinones| ]]\n[[Category:Amphetamine alkaloids]]\n[[Category:Drugs acting on the cardiovascular system]]\n[[Category:Euphoriants]]\n[[Category:Norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents]]\n[[Category:Stimulants]]\n[[Category:Phenyl compounds]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathinone"}

ATP is the most commonly used \"energy currency\" of cells for all organisms. It is formed from [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>). The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is:\n\n* ADP + P<sub>i</sub> + 3H<sup>+</sup><sub>out</sub> {{Eqm}} ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O + 3H<sup>+</sup><sub>in</sub>\n\nThe formation of ATP from ADP and P<sub>i</sub> is energetically unfavorable and would normally proceed in the reverse direction. In order to drive this reaction forward, ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis during [[cellular respiration]] to an [[electrochemical gradient]] created by the difference in [[hydron (chemistry)|proton]] (H<sup>+</sup>) concentration across the [[mitochondrial]] plasma membrane in [[eukaryotes]] or the [[plasma membrane]] in bacteria.

The F<sub>O</sub> region of ATP synthase is a proton pore that is embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. It consists of three main subunits, a, b, and c.

Boyer|Paul Boyer]], a [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Professor, developed the binding change, or flip-flop, mechanism theory, which postulated that ATP synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in ATP synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit. The research group of [[John E. Walker]], then at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology|MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in [[Cambridge]], crystallized the F<sub>1</sub> catalytic-domain of ATP synthase. The structure, at the time the largest asymmetric protein structure known, indicated that Boyer's rotary-catalysis model was, in essence, correct. For elucidating this, Boyer and Walker shared half of the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].\n\nThe crystal structure of the F<sub>1</sub> showed alternating alpha and beta [[Protein subunit|subunits]] (3 of each), arranged like segments of an orange around a rotating asymmetrical gamma subunit. According to the current model of ATP synthesis (known as the alternating catalytic model), the transmembrane potential created by (H+) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain, drives the (H+) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the F<sub>O</sub> region of ATP synthase. A portion of the F<sub>O</sub> (the ring of [[ATP synthase subunit C|c-subunits]]) [[Rotating locomotion in living systems|rotates]] as the protons pass through the membrane. The [[ATP synthase subunit C|c-ring]] is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk (consisting primarily of the gamma subunit), causing it to rotate within the alpha<sub>3</sub>beta<sub>3</sub> of F<sub>1</sub> causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to ATP synthesis. The major F<sub>1</sub> subunits are prevented from rotating in sympathy with the central stalk rotor by a peripheral stalk that joins the alpha<sub>3</sub>beta<sub>3</sub> to the non-rotating portion of F<sub>O</sub>. The structure of the intact ATP synthase is currently known at low-resolution from [[electron cryo-microscopy]] (cryo-EM) studies of the complex. The cryo-EM model of ATP synthase suggests that the peripheral stalk is a flexible structure that wraps around the complex as it joins F<sub>1</sub> to F<sub>O</sub>. Under the right conditions, the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse, with ATP hydrolysis driving proton pumping across the membrane.\n\nThe binding change mechanism involves the active site of a \u03b2 subunit's cycling between three states.<ref name=Gresser>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gresser MJ, Myers JA, Boyer PD | title = Catalytic site cooperativity of beef heart mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub> adenosine triphosphatase.

Large-enough quantities of ATP cause it to create a transmembrane [[proton]] [[gradient]], this is used by fermenting bacteria that do not have an electron transport chain, but rather hydrolyze ATP to make a proton gradient, which they use to drive [[flagella]] and the transport of nutrients into the cell.\n\nIn respiring [[bacteria]] under physiological conditions, ATP synthase, in general, runs in the opposite direction, creating ATP while using the [[electrochemical potential|proton motive force]] created by the [[electron transfer chain|electron transport chain]] as a source of energy. The overall process of creating energy in this fashion is termed [[oxidative phosphorylation]].\nThe same process takes place in the [[mitochondria]], where ATP synthase is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the F<sub>1</sub>-part projects into the [[mitochondrial matrix]].

ATP is the most commonly used \"energy currency\" of cells for all organisms. It is formed from [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>). The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is:\n\n* ADP + P<sub>i</sub> + 3H<sup>+</sup><sub>out</sub> {{Eqm}} ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O + 3H<sup>+</sup><sub>in</sub>\n\nThe formation of ATP from ADP and P<sub>i</sub> is energetically unfavorable and would normally proceed in the reverse direction. In order to drive this reaction forward, ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis during [[cellular respiration]] to an [[electrochemical gradient]] created by the difference in [[hydron (chemistry)|proton]] (H<sup>+</sup>) concentration across the [[mitochondrial]] plasma membrane in [[eukaryotes]] or the [[plasma membrane]] in bacteria. During [[photosynthesis]] in plants, ATP is synthesized by ATP synthase using a proton gradient created in the [[thylakoid lumen]] through the thylakoid membrane and into the [[chloroplast stroma]].\n\nATP synthase is an [[F-ATPase]].

The F<sub>O</sub> region of ATP synthase is a proton pore that is embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. It consists of three main subunits, a, b, and c. Six c subunits make up the rotor ring, and subunit b makes up a stalk connecting to F<sub>1</sub> OSCP that prevents the &alpha;&beta; hexamer from rotating.

Boyer|Paul Boyer]], a [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Professor, developed the binding change, or flip-flop, mechanism theory, which postulated that ATP synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in ATP synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit. The research group of [[John E. Walker]], then at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology|MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in [[Cambridge]], crystallized the F<sub>1</sub> catalytic-domain of ATP synthase. The structure, at the time the largest asymmetric protein structure known, indicated that Boyer's rotary-catalysis model was, in essence, correct. For elucidating this, Boyer and Walker shared half of the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].\n\nThe crystal structure of the F<sub>1</sub> showed alternating alpha and beta [[Protein subunit|subunits]] (3 of each), arranged like segments of an orange around a rotating asymmetrical gamma subunit. According to the current model of ATP synthesis (known as the alternating catalytic model), the transmembrane potential created by (H+) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain, drives the (H+) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the F<sub>O</sub> region of ATP synthase. A portion of the F<sub>O</sub> (the ring of [[ATP synthase subunit C|c-subunits]]) [[Rotating locomotion in living systems|rotates]] as the protons pass through the membrane. The [[ATP synthase subunit C|c-ring]] is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk (consisting primarily of the gamma subunit), causing it to rotate within the alpha<sub>3</sub>beta<sub>3</sub> of F<sub>1</sub> causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to ATP synthesis. The major F<sub>1</sub> subunits are prevented from rotating in sympathy with the central stalk rotor by a peripheral stalk that joins the alpha<sub>3</sub>beta<sub>3</sub> to the non-rotating portion of F<sub>O</sub>. The structure of the intact ATP synthase is currently known at low-resolution from [[electron cryo-microscopy]] (cryo-EM) studies of the complex. The cryo-EM model of ATP synthase suggests that the peripheral stalk is a flexible structure that wraps around the complex as it joins F<sub>1</sub> to F<sub>O</sub>. Under the right conditions, the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse, with ATP hydrolysis driving proton pumping across the membrane.\n\nThe binding change mechanism involves the active site of a \u03b2 subunit's cycling between three states.<ref name=Gresser>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gresser MJ, Myers JA, Boyer PD | title = Catalytic site cooperativity of beef heart mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub> adenosine triphosphatase.

Large-enough quantities of ATP cause it to create a transmembrane [[proton]] [[gradient]], this is used by fermenting bacteria that do not have an electron transport chain, but rather hydrolyze ATP to make a proton gradient, which they use to drive [[flagella]] and the transport of nutrients into the cell.\n\nIn respiring [[bacteria]] under physiological conditions, ATP synthase, in general, runs in the opposite direction, creating ATP while using the [[electrochemical potential|proton motive force]] created by the [[electron transfer chain|electron transport chain]] as a source of energy. The overall process of creating energy in this fashion is termed [[oxidative phosphorylation]].\nThe same process takes place in the [[mitochondria]], where ATP synthase is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the F<sub>1</sub>-part projects into the [[mitochondrial matrix]].
