The Greek terms are in columns on the left of the pages, not in alphabetical order, and the Albanian words on the right, written in Greek letters. Apart from single words, the dictionary includes complexes of words or short phrases. The Greek entries are in total 1701 and the Albanian 1494. <br />\nOn the first page there is a hand-written notice by Pouqueville: \u201c''Ce lexique est \u00e9crit de la main de Marc Botzari \u00e0 Corfou 1809 devant moi''.\u201d  This manuscript, which includes also a kind of Greek\u2013Albanian self-teaching method with dialogues written by Ioannes Vilaras and a French-Albanian glossary by Pouqueville, was donated by the latter to the Library in 1819.  The dictionary was dictated to the young M. Botsaris by his father Kitsos (1754\u20131813), his uncle Notis (1759\u20131841) and his father-in-law Christakis Kalogerou from [[Preveza]].  Titos Yochalas, a Greek historian who studied and edited the manuscript, noticing that some Greek words are translated into Albanian in more than one way, believes that M. Botsaris was writing the Greek words and the elders were translating into Albanian.  As many of the entries seem unlikely to be useful either for the Suliots or the Albanians of that time and circumstances, Yochalas believes that the dictionary was composed after Pouqueville's initiative, possibly as a source for a future French-Albanian dictionary. He also observes that the Albanian phrases are syntaxed as if were Greek, concluding that either the mother tongue of the authors was the Greek or the Greek language had a very strong influence on the Albanian, if the latter was possibly spoken in Souli (Yochalas, p.&nbsp;53). The Albanian idiom of the dictionary belongs to the Tosk dialect of south Albanian and retains many archaic elements, found also in the dialect spoken by the Greco-Albanian communities of South Italy and Sicily. In the Albanian entries there are many loans from Greek (approx. 510), as well as from Turkish (approx. 190) and Italian (21).<ref>[http://www.glossesweb.com/2011/02/marco-botsari-dictionary.html Yochalas Titos (editor, 1980) ''The Greek-Albanian Dictionary of Markos Botsaris''.

The Greek entries are in total 1701 and the Albanian 1494. <br />\nOn the first page there is a hand-written notice by Pouqueville: \u201c''Ce lexique est \u00e9crit de la main de Marc Botzari \u00e0 Corfou 1809 devant moi''.\u201d  This manuscript, which includes also a kind of Greek\u2013Albanian self-teaching method with dialogues written by Ioannes Vilaras and a French-Albanian glossary by Pouqueville, was donated by the latter to the Library in 1819.  The dictionary was dictated to the young M. Botsaris by his father Kitsos (1754\u20131813), his uncle Notis (1759\u20131841) and his father-in-law Christakis Kalogerou from [[Preveza]].  Titos Yochalas, a Greek historian who studied and edited the manuscript, noticing that some Greek words are translated into Albanian in more than one way, believes that M. Botsaris was writing the Greek words and the elders were translating into Albanian.  As many of the entries seem unlikely to be useful either for the Suliots or the Albanians of that time and circumstances, Yochalas believes that the dictionary was composed after Pouqueville's initiative, possibly as a source for a future French-Albanian dictionary. He also observes that the Albanian phrases are syntaxed as if were Greek, concluding that either the mother tongue of the authors was the Greek or the Greek language had a very strong influence on the Albanian, if the latter was possibly spoken in Souli (Yochalas, p.&nbsp;53). The Albanian idiom of the dictionary belongs to the Tosk dialect of south Albanian and retains many archaic elements, found also in the dialect spoken by the Greco-Albanian communities of South Italy and Sicily. In the Albanian entries there are many loans from Greek (approx. 510), as well as from Turkish (approx. 190) and Italian (21).<ref>[http://www.glossesweb.com/2011/02/marco-botsari-dictionary.html Yochalas Titos (editor, 1980) ''The Greek-Albanian Dictionary of Markos Botsaris''.

{"title_page": "Unified Diagnostic Services", "text_new": "'''Unified Diagnostic Services''' (UDS) is a diagnostic [[communication protocol]] in the [[electronic control unit]] (ECU) environment within the automotive electronics, which is specified in the ISO 14229-1.<ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/55283.html</ref> It is derived from ISO 14230-3 ([[KWP2000]]) and [[ISO 15765]]-3 (Diagnostic Communication over [[Controller Area Network]] (DoCAN)<ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/55284.html</ref>). Unified in this context means that it is an international and not a company-specific standard. By now this communication protocol is used in almost all new ECUs made by Tier 1 suppliers of [[Original Equipment Manufacturer]] (OEM). These ECUs control a wide range of functions in vehicles including [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI), [[Engine control unit|engine control]], the transmission, anti-lock braking system, door locks, braking, and more.\n\nThe diagnostic tool contacts all control units installed in a vehicle, which have UDS services enabled. In contrast to the CAN protocol, which only uses the first and second layers of the [[OSI model]], UDS services utilize the fifth and seventh layers of the OSI model. The Service ID (SID) and the parameters associated with the services are contained in the 8 data bytes of a message frame issued from the diagnostic tool. \n\nModern vehicles have a diagnostic interface for off-board diagnostics, which makes it possible to connect a computer (client) or diagnostics tool, which is referred to as tester, to the bus system of the vehicle. Thus, the messages defined in UDS can be sent to the controllers which must provide the predetermined UDS services. This makes it possible to [[Interrogation|interrogate]] the fault memory of the individual control units or to update them with a new firmware.\n\n== Services ==\n\nSID (Service Identifier)\n{| Class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Function group !! Request &nbsp; SID !! Response &nbsp; SID !! Service !! Description\n|-\n| Rowspan = 10 | Diagnostic and Communications Management\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x10\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x50\n| Diagnostic Session Control\n| UDS uses different operating sessions, which can be changed using the \"Diagnostic Session Control\". Depending on which session is active, different services are available. On start, the control unit is by default in the \"Default Session\". Other sessions are defined, but are not required to be implemented depending on the type of device:\n\n* \"Programming Session\" used to upload software.\n* \"Extended Diagnostic Session\" used to unlock additional diagnostic functions, such as the adjustment of sensors.\n* \"Safety system diagnostic session\" used to test all safety-critical diagnostic functions, such as airbag tests.\n\nIn addition, there are reserved session identifiers that can be defined for vehicle manufacturers and vehicle suppliers specific use.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x11\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x51\n| ECU Reset\n| The service \"ECU reset\" is used to restart the control unit (ECU). Depending on the control unit hardware and implementation, different forms of reset can be used:\n\n* \"Hard Reset\" simulates a shutdown of the power supply.\n* \"key off on Reset\" simulates the drain and turn on the ignition with the key.\n* \"Soft Reset\" allows initialization of certain program units and their storage structures.\n\nAgain, there are reserved values that can be defined for vehicle manufacturers and vehicle suppliers specific use.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x27\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x67\n| Security Access\n| Security check is available to enable the most security-critical services. For this purpose a \"Seed\" is generated and sent to the client by the control unit. From this \"Seed\" the client has to compute a \"Key\" and send it back to the control unit to unlock the security-critical services.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x28\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x68\n| Communication Control\n| With this service, both the sending and receiving of messages can be turned off in the control unit.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x3E\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x7E\n| Tester Present\n| If no communication is exchanged with the client for a long time, the control unit automatically exits the current session and returns to the \"Default Session\" back, and might go to sleep mode. Therefore, there is an extra service which purpose is to signal to the device that the client is still present.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x83\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC3\n| Access Timing Parameters\n| In the communication between the controllers and the client certain times must be observed. If these are exceeded, without a message being sent, it must be assumed that the connection was interrupted. These times can be called up and changed.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x84\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC4\n| Secured Data Transmission\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x85\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC5\n| Control DTC Settings\n| Enable or disable the detection of any or all errors. This is important when diagnostic work is performed in the car, which can cause an anomalous behavior of individual devices.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x86\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC6\n| Response On Event\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x87\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC7\n| Link Control\n| The Service Link Control is used to set the baud rate of the diagnostic access. It is usually implemented only at the central gateway.\n|-\n| Rowspan = 7 | Data Transmission\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x22\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x62\n| Read Data By Identifier\n| With this service it is possible to retrieve one or more values of a control unit. This can be information of all kinds and of different lengths such as Partnumber or the software version. Dynamic values such as the current state of the sensor can be queried. Each value is associated to a Data Identifier (DID) between 0 and 65535. Normal CAN signals are meant for information that some ECU uses in its functionality. DID data is sent on request only, and is for information that no ECU uses, but a service tool or a software tester can benefit from.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x23\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x63\n| Read Memory By Address\n| Read data from the physical memory at the provided address. This function can be used by a testing tool, in order to read the internal behaviour of the software.\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x24\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x64\n| Read Scaling Data By Identifier\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2A\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6A\n| Read Data By Identifier Periodic\n| With this service values are sent periodically by a control unit. The values to be sent must be defined to only using the \"Dynamically Define Data Identifier\".\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2C\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6C\n| Dynamically Define Data Identifier\n| This service offers the possibility of a fix for a device specified Data Identifier (DID) pool to configure another Data Identifier. This is usually a combination of parts of different DIDs or simply a concatenation of complete DIDs.\n\nThe requested data may be configured or grouped in the following manner:\n\n* Source DID, position, length (in bytes), Sub-Function Byte: defineByIdentifier\n* Memory address length (in bytes), Sub-Function Byte: defineByMemoryAddress\n* Combinations of the two above methods through multiple requests.\n\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2E\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6E\n| Write Data By Identifier\n| With the same Data Identifier (DID), values can also be changed. In addition to the identifier, the new value is sent along.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x3D\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x7D\n| Write Memory By Address\n| The \u201cWrite Memory By Address\u201d service allows the external diagnostic tool to write information into the ECU at one or more contiguous memory locations.\n|-\n| Rowspan = 2 | Stored Data Transmission\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x14\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x54\n| Clear Diagnostic Information\n| Delete all stored DTC\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x19\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x59\n| Read DTC Information\n| DTC stands for \"[[Diagnostic Trouble Code]]s\". Each DTC handled by the control unit fault is stored with its own code in the error memory and can be read at any time. In addition to the error, additional information will be stored, which can also be read.\n|-\n| Input / Output Control\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2F\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6F\n| Input Output Control By Identifier\n| This service allows an external system intervention on internal / external signals via the diagnostic interface.\n\nBy specifying a so-called option bytes additional conditions for a request can be specified, the following values are specified:\n\n''ReturnControlToECU'': The device must get back controls of the mentioned signals.\n\n''ResetToDefault'': The tester prompts to reset signals to the system wide default value.\n\n''Freeze Current State'': The device shall freeze the current signal value.\n\n''ShortTermAdjustment'': The device shall use the provided value for the signal\n|-\n| Remote Activation of Routine\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x31\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x71\n| Routine Control\n| The Control service routine services of all kinds can be performed. There are three different message types:\n* With the start-message, a service can be initiated. It can be defined to confirm the beginning of the execution or to notify when the service is completed.\n* With the Stop message, a running service can be interrupted at any time.\n* The third option is a message to query the results of the service.\nThe start and stop message parameters can be specified. This makes it possible to implement every possible project-specific service.\n|-\n| Rowspan = 5 | Upload / Download\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x34\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x74\n| Request Download\n| Downloading new software or other data into the control unit is introduced using the \"Request Download\". Here, the location and size of the data is specified. In turn, the controller specifies how large the data packets can be.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x35\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x75\n| Request Upload\n| The service \"request upload\" is almost identical to the service \"Request Download\". With this service, the software from the control unit is transferred to the tester. The location and size must be specified. Again, the size of the data blocks are specified by the tester.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x36\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x76\n| Transfer Data\n| For the actual transmission of data, the service \"Transfer Data\" is used. This service is used for both uploading and downloading data. The transfer direction is notified in advance by the service \"Request Download\" or \"Upload Request\". This service should try to send packets at maximum length, as specified in previous services. If the data set is larger than the maximum, the \"Transfer Data\" service must be used several times in succession until all data has arrived.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x37\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x77\n| Request Transfer Exit\n| A data transmission can be 'completed' when using the \"Transfer Exit\" service. This service is used for comparison between the control unit and the tester. When it is running, a control unit can answer negatively on this request to stop a data transfer request. This will be used when the amount of data (set in \"Request Download\" or \"Upload Request\") has not been transferred.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x38\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x78\n| Request File Transfer\n| This service is used to initiate a file download from the client to the server or upload from the server to the client. Additionally information about the file system are available by this service.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x7F\n| Negative Response\n| This response is given when a service request could not be performed, for example having a not supported Data Identifier. A Negative Response Code will be included.\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[On-board diagnostics]], general article about diagnostic services in vehicles\n*[[OBD-II PIDs]], about the US standard\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://automotive.softing.com/fileadmin/sof-files/pdf/de/ae/poster/UDS_Faltposter_softing2016.pdf Unified Diagnostic Services - ISO 14229] (poster by softing.com)\n\n\n[[Category:Automotive technologies]]\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n", "text_old": "'''Unified Diagnostic Services''' (UDS) is a diagnostic [[communication protocol]] in the [[electronic control unit]] (ECU) environment within the automotive electronics, which is specified in the ISO 14229-1.<ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/55283.html</ref> It is derived from ISO 14230-3 ([[KWP2000]]) and ISO 15765-3 (Diagnostic Communication over [[Controller Area Network]] (DoCAN)<ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/55284.html</ref>).

These ECUs control a wide range of functions in vehicles including [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI), [[Engine control unit|engine control]], the transmission, anti-lock braking system, door locks, braking, and more.\n\nThe diagnostic tool contacts all control units installed in a vehicle, which have UDS services enabled. In contrast to the CAN protocol, which only uses the first and second layers of the [[OSI model]], UDS services utilize the fifth and seventh layers of the OSI model. The Service ID (SID) and the parameters associated with the services are contained in the 8 data bytes of a message frame issued from the diagnostic tool. \n\nModern vehicles have a diagnostic interface for off-board diagnostics, which makes it possible to connect a computer (client) or diagnostics tool, which is referred to as tester, to the bus system of the vehicle. Thus, the messages defined in UDS can be sent to the controllers which must provide the predetermined UDS services. This makes it possible to [[Interrogation|interrogate]] the fault memory of the individual control units or to update them with a new firmware.\n\n== Services ==\n\nSID (Service Identifier)\n{| Class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Function group !! Request &nbsp; SID !! Response &nbsp; SID !! Service !! Description\n|-\n| Rowspan = 10 | Diagnostic and Communications Management\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x10\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x50\n| Diagnostic Session Control\n| UDS uses different operating sessions, which can be changed using the \"Diagnostic Session Control\". Depending on which session is active, different services are available. On start, the control unit is by default in the \"Default Session\". Other sessions are defined, but are not required to be implemented depending on the type of device:\n\n* \"Programming Session\" used to upload software.\n* \"Extended Diagnostic Session\" used to unlock additional diagnostic functions, such as the adjustment of sensors.\n* \"Safety system diagnostic session\" used to test all safety-critical diagnostic functions, such as airbag tests.\n\nIn addition, there are reserved session identifiers that can be defined for vehicle manufacturers and vehicle suppliers specific use.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x11\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x51\n| ECU Reset\n| The service \"ECU reset\" is used to restart the control unit (ECU). Depending on the control unit hardware and implementation, different forms of reset can be used:\n\n* \"Hard Reset\" simulates a shutdown of the power supply.\n* \"key off on Reset\" simulates the drain and turn on the ignition with the key.\n* \"Soft Reset\" allows initialization of certain program units and their storage structures.\n\nAgain, there are reserved values that can be defined for vehicle manufacturers and vehicle suppliers specific use.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x27\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x67\n| Security Access\n| Security check is available to enable the most security-critical services. For this purpose a \"Seed\" is generated and sent to the client by the control unit. From this \"Seed\" the client has to compute a \"Key\" and send it back to the control unit to unlock the security-critical services.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x28\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x68\n| Communication Control\n| With this service, both the sending and receiving of messages can be turned off in the control unit.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x3E\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x7E\n| Tester Present\n| If no communication is exchanged with the client for a long time, the control unit automatically exits the current session and returns to the \"Default Session\" back, and might go to sleep mode. Therefore, there is an extra service which purpose is to signal to the device that the client is still present.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x83\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC3\n| Access Timing Parameters\n| In the communication between the controllers and the client certain times must be observed. If these are exceeded, without a message being sent, it must be assumed that the connection was interrupted. These times can be called up and changed.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x84\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC4\n| Secured Data Transmission\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x85\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC5\n| Control DTC Settings\n| Enable or disable the detection of any or all errors. This is important when diagnostic work is performed in the car, which can cause an anomalous behavior of individual devices.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x86\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC6\n| Response On Event\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x87\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0xC7\n| Link Control\n| The Service Link Control is used to set the baud rate of the diagnostic access. It is usually implemented only at the central gateway.\n|-\n| Rowspan = 7 | Data Transmission\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x22\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x62\n| Read Data By Identifier\n| With this service it is possible to retrieve one or more values of a control unit. This can be information of all kinds and of different lengths such as Partnumber or the software version. Dynamic values such as the current state of the sensor can be queried. Each value is associated to a Data Identifier (DID) between 0 and 65535. Normal CAN signals are meant for information that some ECU uses in its functionality. DID data is sent on request only, and is for information that no ECU uses, but a service tool or a software tester can benefit from.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x23\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x63\n| Read Memory By Address\n| Read data from the physical memory at the provided address. This function can be used by a testing tool, in order to read the internal behaviour of the software.\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x24\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x64\n| Read Scaling Data By Identifier\n|\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2A\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6A\n| Read Data By Identifier Periodic\n| With this service values are sent periodically by a control unit. The values to be sent must be defined to only using the \"Dynamically Define Data Identifier\".\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2C\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6C\n| Dynamically Define Data Identifier\n| This service offers the possibility of a fix for a device specified Data Identifier (DID) pool to configure another Data Identifier. This is usually a combination of parts of different DIDs or simply a concatenation of complete DIDs.\n\nThe requested data may be configured or grouped in the following manner:\n\n* Source DID, position, length (in bytes), Sub-Function Byte: defineByIdentifier\n* Memory address length (in bytes), Sub-Function Byte: defineByMemoryAddress\n* Combinations of the two above methods through multiple requests.\n\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2E\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6E\n| Write Data By Identifier\n| With the same Data Identifier (DID), values can also be changed. In addition to the identifier, the new value is sent along.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x3D\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x7D\n| Write Memory By Address\n| The \u201cWrite Memory By Address\u201d service allows the external diagnostic tool to write information into the ECU at one or more contiguous memory locations.\n|-\n| Rowspan = 2 | Stored Data Transmission\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x14\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x54\n| Clear Diagnostic Information\n| Delete all stored DTC\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x19\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x59\n| Read DTC Information\n| DTC stands for \"[[Diagnostic Trouble Code]]s\". Each DTC handled by the control unit fault is stored with its own code in the error memory and can be read at any time. In addition to the error, additional information will be stored, which can also be read.\n|-\n| Input / Output Control\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x2F\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x6F\n| Input Output Control By Identifier\n| This service allows an external system intervention on internal / external signals via the diagnostic interface.\n\nBy specifying a so-called option bytes additional conditions for a request can be specified, the following values are specified:\n\n''ReturnControlToECU'': The device must get back controls of the mentioned signals.\n\n''ResetToDefault'': The tester prompts to reset signals to the system wide default value.\n\n''Freeze Current State'': The device shall freeze the current signal value.\n\n''ShortTermAdjustment'': The device shall use the provided value for the signal\n|-\n| Remote Activation of Routine\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x31\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x71\n| Routine Control\n| The Control service routine services of all kinds can be performed. There are three different message types:\n* With the start-message, a service can be initiated. It can be defined to confirm the beginning of the execution or to notify when the service is completed.\n* With the Stop message, a running service can be interrupted at any time.\n* The third option is a message to query the results of the service.\nThe start and stop message parameters can be specified. This makes it possible to implement every possible project-specific service.\n|-\n| Rowspan = 5 | Upload / Download\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x34\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x74\n| Request Download\n| Downloading new software or other data into the control unit is introduced using the \"Request Download\". Here, the location and size of the data is specified. In turn, the controller specifies how large the data packets can be.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x35\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x75\n| Request Upload\n| The service \"request upload\" is almost identical to the service \"Request Download\". With this service, the software from the control unit is transferred to the tester. The location and size must be specified. Again, the size of the data blocks are specified by the tester.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x36\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x76\n| Transfer Data\n| For the actual transmission of data, the service \"Transfer Data\" is used. This service is used for both uploading and downloading data. The transfer direction is notified in advance by the service \"Request Download\" or \"Upload Request\". This service should try to send packets at maximum length, as specified in previous services. If the data set is larger than the maximum, the \"Transfer Data\" service must be used several times in succession until all data has arrived.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x37\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x77\n| Request Transfer Exit\n| A data transmission can be 'completed' when using the \"Transfer Exit\" service. This service is used for comparison between the control unit and the tester. When it is running, a control unit can answer negatively on this request to stop a data transfer request. This will be used when the amount of data (set in \"Request Download\" or \"Upload Request\") has not been transferred.\n|-\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x38\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x78\n| Request File Transfer\n| This service is used to initiate a file download from the client to the server or upload from the server to the client. Additionally information about the file system are available by this service.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Style = \"text-align: center\" | 0x7F\n| Negative Response\n| This response is given when a service request could not be performed, for example having a not supported Data Identifier. A Negative Response Code will be included.\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[On-board diagnostics]], general article about diagnostic services in vehicles\n*[[OBD-II PIDs]], about the US standard\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://automotive.softing.com/fileadmin/sof-files/pdf/de/ae/poster/UDS_Faltposter_softing2016.pdf Unified Diagnostic Services - ISO 14229] (poster by softing.com)\n\n\n[[Category:Automotive technologies]]\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n", "name_user": "BIL", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Diagnostic_Services"}

(2005). \"''Meiji''\" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan encyclopedia,'' p. 624|page=624}}; n.b., Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is pseudonym of Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.today/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].</ref> This era represents the first half of the [[Empire of Japan]], during which period the Japanese people moved from being an isolated [[feudalism|feudal society]] at risk of colonisation by European powers to the new paradigm of a modern, industrialised [[nation state]] and emergent [[great power]], influenced by [[Western world|Western]] scientific, technological, philosophical, political, legal, and aesthetic ideas. As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically-different ideas, the changes to Japan were profound, and affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded to the reign of [[Emperor Meiji]]. It was preceded by the [[Kei\u014d]] era and was succeeded by the [[Taish\u014d]] era, upon the accession of [[Emperor Taish\u014d]].\n\n== Meiji Restoration ==\n{{main|Meiji Restoration}} \n{{see also|Abolition of the han system}}\n\nOn February 3, 1867, the 14-year-old [[Emperor Meiji|Prince Mutsuhito]] succeeded his father, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]], to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] as the 122nd emperor.\n\nOn November 9, 1867, then-''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] tendered his resignation to the Emperor, and formally stepped down ten days later.<ref>Takano, p. 256.</ref> [[Meiji Restoration|Imperial restoration]] occurred the next year on January 3, 1868, with the formation of [[Meiji government|the new government]]. The [[fall of Edo]] in the summer of 1868 marked the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and a new era, ''Meiji'', was proclaimed.\n\nThe first reform was the promulgation of the [[Five Charter Oath]] in 1868, a general statement of the aims of the [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji leaders]] to boost morale and win financial support for the [[Government of Meiji Japan|new government]]. Its five provisions consisted of:\n\n1. Deliberative assembly shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion\n\n2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of the affairs of state\n\n3. The common people, no less than the civil and military of officials, shall each be allowed to pursue his own calling so that there may be no discontent. \n\n4. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of nature.\n\n5. Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule\n\n\nImplicit in the Charter Oath was an end to exclusive political rule by the [[sh\u014dgun|bakufu]] (a ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s direct administration including officers), and a move toward more democratic participation in government. To implement the Charter Oath, a rather short-lived constitution with eleven articles was drawn up in June 1868. Besides providing for a new [[Daij\u014d-kan|Council of State]], legislative bodies, and systems of ranks for nobles and officials, it limited office tenure to four years, allowed public balloting, provided for a new taxation system, and ordered new local administrative rules.\n\n[[File:MeijiJoukyou.jpg|thumb|left|The fifteen-year-old [[Meiji Emperor]], moving from [[Kyoto]] to Tokyo at the end of 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]]]]\n\nThe Meiji government assured the foreign powers that it would follow the old treaties negotiated by the bakufu and announced that it would act in accordance with international law. Mutsuhito, who was to reign until 1912, selected a new reign title\u2014''Meiji'', or Enlightened Rule\u2014to mark the beginning of a new era in Japanese history. To further dramatize the new order, the capital was relocated from [[Kyoto]], where it had been situated since 794, to [[Tokyo]] (Eastern Capital), the new name for [[Edo]]. In a move critical for the consolidation of the new regime, most ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' voluntarily surrendered their land and census records to the Emperor in the [[Abolition of the han system|abolition of the Han system]], symbolizing that the land and people were under the Emperor's jurisdiction.\n\nConfirmed in their hereditary positions, the daimyo became governors, and the central government assumed their administrative expenses and paid [[samurai]] stipends. The han were replaced with [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] in 1871, and authority continued to flow to the national government. Officials from the favored former han, such as [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], and [[Hizen]] staffed the new ministries. Formerly [[Kuge|old court nobles]], and lower-ranking but more radical samurai, replaced bakufu appointees and daimyo as a new ruling class appeared.\n\n[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Meiji]] in his fifties.]]\n\nIn as much as the Meiji Restoration had sought to return the Emperor to a preeminent position, efforts were made to establish a [[Shinto]]-oriented state much like it was 1,000 years earlier. Since Shinto and Buddhism [[Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d|had molded into a syncretic belief]] in the prior one-thousand years and Buddhism had been closely connected with the shogunate, this involved the separation of Shinto and Buddhism ([[shinbutsu bunri]]) and the associated destruction of various Buddhist temples and related violence ([[haibutsu kishaku]]). Furthermore, a new [[State Shinto]] had to be constructed for the purpose. In 1871, the [[Office of Shinto Worship]] ([[:ja:\u795e\u7947\u7701]]) was established, ranking even above the Council of State in importance. The ''[[kokutai]]'' ideas of the Mito school were embraced, and the divine ancestry of the [[Imperial Household of Japan|Imperial House]] was emphasized. The government supported Shinto teachers, a small but important move. Although the Office of Shinto Worship was demoted in 1872, by 1877 the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]] controlled all Shinto shrines and certain Shinto sects were given state recognition. Shinto was released from Buddhist administration and its properties restored. Although Buddhism suffered from state sponsorship of Shinto, it had its own resurgence. Christianity also was legalized, and Confucianism remained an important ethical doctrine. Increasingly, however, Japanese thinkers identified with Western ideology and methods.\n\n== Politics ==\n{{main|Meiji oligarchy|Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji Constitution}}\n\nA major proponent of representative government was [[Itagaki Taisuke]] (1837\u20131919), a powerful [[Tosa Province|Tosa]] leader who had resigned from the Council of State over the [[Seikanron|Korean affair]] in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful, rather than rebellious, means to gain a voice in government. He started a school and a movement aimed at establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a [[legislative assembly]]. Such movements were called [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|The Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]. Itagaki and others wrote the [[Tosa Memorial]] ([[:ja:\u6c11\u64b0\u8b70\u9662\u8a2d\u7acb\u5efa\u767d\u66f8]]) in 1874, criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government.\n\nBetween 1871 and 1873, a series of [[Land Tax Reform (Japan 1873)|land and tax laws]] were enacted as the basis for modern fiscal policy. Private ownership was legalized, deeds were issued, and lands were assessed at fair market value with taxes paid in cash rather than in kind as in pre-Meiji days and at slightly lower rates.\n\nDissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide [[Aikokusha]] (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the [[Liberal Party of Japan (1881)|Jiy\u016bt\u014d]] (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines.\n\n[[File:Japanese Parliament in session.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of [[National Diet]], showing Minister speaking at the tribune from which members address the House.]]\n\nIn 1882, [[\u014ckuma Shigenobu]] established the [[Rikken Kaishint\u014d]] (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the [[Rikken Teiseit\u014d]] (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisions within and among them. The Jiy\u016bt\u014d, which had opposed the Kaishinto, was disbanded in 1884 and \u014ckuma resigned as Kaishint\u014d president.\n\nGovernment leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that [[constitutional government]] should someday be established. The [[Nagato Province|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] leader [[Kido Takayoshi]] had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. While acknowledging the realities of political pressure, however, the oligarchy was determined to keep control. Thus, modest steps were taken.\n\nThe Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed [[Chamber of Elders]] (Genr\u014din) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The Emperor declared that \"constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages\" as he ordered the [[Genr\u014d|Council of Elders]] to draft a constitution.\n\nThree years later, the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority, these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level, and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns. In 1880 delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the [[League for the Establishment of a National Assembly|Kokkai Kisei D\u014dmei]].\n\nAlthough the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for \"people's rights\", it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The [[Public Assembly Law, 1880|Public Assembly Law]] (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings.\n\nWithin the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, Okuma continued as a lone advocate of British-style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and dismissing Okuma.\n\nRejecting the British model, [[Iwakura Tomomi|Iwakura]] and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the [[Constitution of the German Empire|Prussian constitutional system]]. One of the Meiji oligarchy, [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] (1841\u20131909), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan's constitution. He led a constitutional study mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the [[United States Constitution]] as \"too liberal\", and the British system as too unwieldy, and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism.\n\nIto was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Ito as prime minister. The positions of chancellor (or chief-minister), [[Sadaijin|minister of the left]], and [[Udaijin|minister of the right]], which had existed since the seventh century as advisory positions to the Emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]] was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the Emperor.\n\nTo further strengthen the authority of the State, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of [[Yamagata Aritomo]] (1838\u20131922), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Japanese army and was to become the first constitutional [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The [[Supreme War Council (Japan)|Supreme War Council]] developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the Emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials.\n\nThe [[Meiji Constitution|Constitution of the Empire of Japan]] was enacted on November 29, 1890.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Meiji-Constitution|title=Meiji Constitution {{!}} 1889, Japan|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref> It was a form of mixed [[Constitutional_monarchy|constitutional]] and [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hein|first1=Patrick|title=How the Japanese became foreign to themselves : the impact of globalization on the private and public spheres in Japan|date=2009|publisher=Lit|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3643100856|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5QJsvhHwjVMC&lpg=PA72&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The [[Emperor of Japan]] was legally the [[Supreme leader|supreme leader]], and the Cabinet were his followers. The Prime Minister would be elected by a [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]]. In reality, the Emperor was [[head of state]] but the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] was the actual head of government. \n\nClass distinctions were mostly eliminated during modernization to create a [[representative democracy]]. The [[samurai]] lost their status as the only class with military privileges. However, during the [[Meiji period]], most leaders in Japanese society (politics, business and military) were ex-samurai or descendants of [[samurai]]. \n\nThe 1889 [[Constitution of the Empire of Japan|Meiji Constitution]] made relatively small concessions to [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|civil rights]] and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Emperor shared his authority and give rights and liberties to his subjects. It provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a popularly elected [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] with a very limited franchise of male citizens who were over twenty-five years of age and paid fifteen yen in national taxes (approximately 1% of the population). The [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] was composed of nobility and imperial appointees. A cabinet was responsible to the Emperor and independent of the legislature. The Diet could approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the Emperor. The Meiji Constitution lasted as the fundamental law until 1947. \n\nIn the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extra-constitutional body of [[genr\u014d]] (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genro made decisions reserved for the Emperor, and the genro, not the Emperor, controlled the government politically.\n\nThroughout the period, however, political problems usually were solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever-larger role in the political process as a result. Between 1891 and 1895, Ito served as Prime Minister with a cabinet composed mostly of genro who wanted to establish a government party to control the House of Representatives. Although not fully realized, the trend toward party politics was well established.\n\n== Society ==\n{{expand section|with=an overview of art and design style changes in the Meiji era, and their indelible influence on (and later recursively by) European [[Art Nouveau]]|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Ginza in 1880s.JPG|thumb|[[Ginza]] in 1880s.]]\n[[File:Iwakura und Damen.jpg|thumb|Japanese of the era (circa 1872).]]\n\nOn its return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred people from the old court nobility, former daimyo, and samurai who had provided valuable service to the Emperor were organized into a new peerage, the [[Kazoku]], consisting of five ranks: prince, [[Marquess|marquis]], [[count]], [[viscount]], and [[baron]].\n\nIn the transition between the [[Edo period]] and the Meiji era, the [[Ee ja nai ka]] movement, a spontaneous outbreak of ecstatic behavior, took place.\n\nIn 1885, noted public intellectual [[Yukichi Fukuzawa]] wrote the influential essay \"[[Datsu-A Ron|Leaving Asia]]\", arguing that Japan should orient itself at the \"civilized countries of the West\", leaving behind the \"hopelessly backward\" Asian neighbors, namely [[Korea]] and China. This essay certainly encouraged the economic and technological rise of Japan in the Meiji era, but it also may have laid the intellectual foundations for later Japanese [[colonialism]] in the region.\n\nThe Meiji era saw a flowering of public discourse on the direction of Japan. Works like [[Nakae Ch\u014dmin]]'s A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government<ref>Nakae, C. and Tsukui, N. and Hammond, J. A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government. 1984.</ref> debated how best to blend the new influences coming from the West with local Japanese culture. Grassroots movements like the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] called for the establishment of a formal legislature, civil rights, and greater pluralism in the Japanese political system. Journalists, politicians, and writers actively participated in the movement, which attracted an array of interest groups, including women's rights activists.<ref>Hane, M. Reflections on the Way to the Gallows: Rebel Women in Prewar Japan. University of California Press. 1988.</ref>\n\nThe elite class of the Meiji era adapted many aspects of Victorian taste, as seen in the construction of Western-style pavilions and reception rooms called ''y\u014dkan or y\u014dma'' in their homes. These parts of Meiji homes were displayed in popular magazines of the time, such as ''Ladies' Graphic,'' which portrayed the often empty rooms of the homes of the aristocracy of all levels, including the imperial palaces. Integrating Western cultural forms with an assumed, untouched native Japanese spirit was characteristic of Meiji society, especially at the top levels, and represented Japan's search for a place within a new world power system in which European colonial empires dominated.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Was Meiji Taste in Interiors \"Orientalist?\"|last = Sand|first = Jordan|date = 2000|journal = Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique|publisher = Duke University Press|issue = 3|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pos/summary/v008/8.3sand.html|volume = 8|pages = 637\u2013673|doi = 10.1215/10679847-8-3-637}}</ref>\n\n=== Fashion ===\n[[File:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}), 1880\u20131890, the [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\nThe production of [[kimono]] started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]]'s descriptions of Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles.

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as Meiji era leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin).\n\nIn 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the US to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1877, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories.\n\nModern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.<ref>G.C. Allen, Short Economic History of Modern Japan (1972)</ref>  Due to the importing of new textile manufacturing technology from Europe, between 1886 and 1897, Japan's total value of yarn output rose from 12 million to 176 million yen. In 1886, 62% of yarn in Japan was imported; by 1902, most yarn was produced locally. By 1913, Japan was producing 672 million pounds of yarn per year, becoming the fourth largest exporter of cotton yarn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor|last=Landes|first=David S.|publisher=Norton|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=379\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe first railway was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872; and railway was rapidly developed throughout Japan well into the twentieth century. The introduction of railway transportation led to more efficient production due to the decline in transport costs; allowing for manufacturing firms to move into more populated interior regions of Japan in search for labour input. The railway also enabled a new-found access to raw materials that had previously been too difficult or costly to transport.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=John P.|date=September 2014|title=Railroad Expansion and Industrialization: Evidence from Meiji Japan|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume= 74|issue=3|pages=863\u2013886|via=CRKN Cambridge University Press Journals|doi=10.1017/S002205071400062X}}</ref>\n\nThere were at least two reasons for the speed of Japan's modernization: the employment of more than 3,000 foreign experts (called ''[[o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'' or 'hired foreigners') in a variety of specialist fields such as teaching English, science, engineering, the army and navy, among others; and the dispatch of many Japanese students overseas to Europe and America, based on the fifth and last article of the Charter Oath of 1868: 'Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule.' This process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government, enhancing the power of the great [[zaibatsu]] firms such as [[Mitsui]] and [[Mitsubishi]].\n\nHand in hand, the zaibatsu and government guided the nation, borrowing technology from the West. Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with textiles. The economic structure became very [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]], importing raw materials and exporting finished products\u2014a reflection of Japan's relative poverty in raw materials.\n\nJapan emerged from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]]\u2013[[Emperor of Japan|Tenn\u014d]] ([[Kei\u014d]]\u2013Meiji) transition in 1868 as the first Asian industrialized nation. Domestic commercial activities and limited foreign trade had met the demands for material culture until the Kei\u014d era, but the modernized Meiji era had radically different requirements. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. The private sector\u2014in a nation with an abundance of aggressive entrepreneurs\u2014welcomed such change.\n\n[[File:Tokyo Industrial Exhibition.JPG|thumb|1907 Tokyo Industrial Exhibition]]\n\nEconomic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the yen, banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conducive to an advanced capitalist economy took time, but was completed by the 1890s. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons.\n\nMany of the former daimyo, whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries. Those who had been informally involved in foreign trade before the Meiji Restoration also flourished. Old bakufu-serving firms that clung to their traditional ways failed in the new business environment.\n\nThe government initially was involved in economic modernization, providing a number of \"model factories\" to facilitate the transition to the modern era. After the first twenty years of the Meiji era, the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. Stimulated by wars and through cautious economic planning, Japan emerged from World War I as a major industrial nation.\n\nIn 1885, the Meiji government sponsored a telegraph system, throughout Japan, situating the telegraphs in all major Japanese cities at the time.\n\n== Military ==\n{{main|Japanese military modernization of 1868\u20131931|Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Navy}}\n\n===Overview===\nUndeterred by opposition, the Meiji leaders continued to modernize the nation through government-sponsored telegraph cable links to all major Japanese cities and the Asian mainland and construction of railroads, shipyards, munitions factories, mines, textile manufacturing facilities, factories, and experimental agriculture stations. Greatly concerned about national security, the leaders made significant efforts at military modernization, which included establishing a small standing army, a large reserve system, and compulsory militia service for all men. Foreign military systems were studied, foreign advisers, especially French ones, were brought in, and Japanese cadets sent abroad to Europe and the United States to attend military and naval schools.\n\n===Early Meiji period (1868\u201377)===\nIn 1854, after Admiral Matthew C. Perry forced the signing of the [[Treaty of Kanagawa]], Japanese elites took the position that they needed to modernize the state's military capacities, or risk further coercion from Western powers.<ref>Gordon (2000).</ref> The Tokugawa shogunate did not officially share this point of view, however, as evidenced by the imprisonment of the Governor of Nagasaki, Shanan Takushima for voicing his views of military reform and weapons modernization.<ref name=gs08>GlobalSecurity.org (2008).</ref>\n\nIn 1868, the Japanese government established the Tokyo Arsenal. This arsenal was responsible for the development and manufacture of small arms and associated ammunition.<ref name=gs08/> The same year, [[\u014cmura Masujir\u014d]] established Japan's first military academy in Kyoto. \u014cmura further proposed military [[billets]] be filled by all classes of people including farmers and merchants. The ''sh\u014dgun'' class,{{clarify|reason=Thre was a \"sh\u014dgun class\"?|date=January 2018}} not happy with \u014cmura's views on conscription, assassinated him the following year.<ref>Shinsengumihq.com, n.d.</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Japan expanded its military production base by opening another arsenal in Osaka. The Osaka Arsenal was responsible for the production of machine guns and ammunition.<ref>National Diet Library (2008).</ref> Also, four gunpowder facilities also were opened at this site. Japan's production capacity gradually expanded.\n\nIn 1872, Yamagata Aritomo and [[Saig\u014d J\u016bd\u014d]], both new field marshals, founded the Corps of the Imperial Guards. This corps was composed of the warrior classes from the [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] clans.<ref name=gs08/> Also, in the same year, the hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years, when in January the Conscription Law of 1873 was passed. This law required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves.<ref name=gs08/> This monumental law, signifying the beginning of the end for the samurai class, initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. Avoidance methods included maiming, self-mutilation, and local uprisings.<ref>Kublin (1949) p.32.</ref>  The samurai were generally resentful of the new, western-style military and at first, refused to stand in formation with the peasant class.<ref name=gs08/>\n\n[[File:MikadoWithFrenchMission.jpg|thumb|Emperor Meiji receives the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872\u20131880)|second French Military Mission to Japan]] (1872).]]\n\nIn conjunction with the new conscription law, the Japanese government began modeling their ground forces after the French military. Indeed, the new Japanese army used the same rank structure as the French.<ref>Kublin (1949) p.31.</ref> The enlisted corps ranks were: private, noncommissioned officers, and officers. The private classes were: j\u014dt\u014d-hei or upper soldier, itt\u014d-sotsu or first-class soldier, and nit\u014d-sotsu or second-class soldier. The noncommissioned officer class ranks were: goch\u014d or corporal, guns\u014d or sergeant, s\u014dch\u014d or sergeant major, and tokumu-s\u014dch\u014d or special sergeant major. Finally, the officer class is made up of: sh\u014di or second lieutenant, ch\u016bi or first lieutenant, tai or captain, sh\u014dsa or major, ch\u016bsa or lieutenant colonel, taisa or colonel, sh\u014dsh\u014d or major general, ch\u016bj\u014d or lieutenant general, taish\u014d or general, and gensui or field marshal.<ref name=gs08/> The French government also contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks.<ref name=gs08/>\n\nDespite the Conscription Law of 1873, and all the reforms and progress, the new Japanese army was still untested. That all changed in 1877, when [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] led the last rebellion of the samurai in Ky\u016bsh\u016b. In February 1877, Saig\u014d left Kagoshima with a small contingent of soldiers on a journey to Tokyo. Kumamoto castle was the site of the first major engagement when garrisoned forces fired on Saig\u014d's army as they attempted to force their way into the castle. Rather than leave an enemy behind him, Saig\u014d laid siege to the castle. Two days later, Saig\u014d's rebels, while attempting to block a mountain pass, encountered advanced elements of the national army en route to reinforce Kumamoto castle. After a short battle, both sides withdrew to reconstitute their forces. A few weeks later the national army engaged Saig\u014d's rebels in a frontal assault at what now is called the Battle of Tabaruzuka. During this eight-day-battle, Saig\u014d's nearly ten thousand strong army battled hand-to-hand the equally matched national army. Both sides suffered nearly four thousand casualties during this engagement. Due to conscription, however, the Japanese army was able to reconstitute its forces, while Saig\u014d's was not. Later, forces loyal to the emperor broke through rebel lines and managed to end the siege on [[Kumamoto Castle]] after fifty-four days. Saig\u014d's troops fled north and were pursued by the national army. The national army caught up with Saig\u014d at Mt. [[Enodake]]. Saig\u014d's army was outnumbered seven-to-one, prompting a mass surrender of many samurai. The remaining five hundred samurai loyal to Saig\u014d escaped, travelling south to Kagoshima.  The rebellion ended on September 24, 1877, following the final engagement with Imperial forces which resulted in the deaths of the remaining forty samurai including Saig\u014d, who, having suffered a fatal bullet wound in the abdomen, was honourably beheaded by his retainer. The national army's victory validated the current course of the modernization of the Japanese army as well as ended the era of the samurai.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{main|Foreign relations of Meiji Japan}}\n\nWhen the United States Navy ended Japan's [[Sakoku|sakoku policy]], and thus its isolation, the latter found itself defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality. Following the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident]], Japan released the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident|Chinese coolies from a western ship]] in 1872, after which the [[Qing dynasty|Qing imperial government of China]] gave thanks to Japan.\n\nFollowing Japan's victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), Japan broke through as an international power with a victory against Russia in [[Manchuria]] (north-eastern China) in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Allied with Britain since the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] signed in London on January 30, 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I, seizing German-held territory in China and the Pacific in the process, but otherwise remained largely out of the conflict.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], a weakened Europe left a greater share in international markets to the United States and Japan, which emerged greatly strengthened. Japanese competition made great inroads into hitherto-European-dominated markets in Asia, not only in China, but even in European colonies such as India and [[Indonesia]], reflecting the development of the Meiji era.\n\nThe final years of the Meiji era were also marked by the annexation of [[Korea]] in 1911; Japan's [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupation]] of the peninsula nation would persist until Japan's loss in [[World War II]] in 1945, during the middle of the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], and would have lasting negative repercussions on foreign relations between Japan and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]].\n\n==Conversion table==\nTo convert any [[Gregorian calendar]] year between 1868 and 1912 to [[Japanese calendar]] year in Meiji era, 1867 needs to be subtracted from the year in question.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Meiji|| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15\n|-\n|AD|| 1868 || 1869 || 1870 || 1871 || 1872 || 1873 || 1874 || 1875 || 1876 || 1877 || 1878 || 1879 || 1880 || 1881 || 1882\n|-\n!Meiji|| 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30\n|-\n|AD|| 1883 || 1884 || 1885 || 1886 || 1887 || 1888 || 1889 || 1890 || 1891 || 1892 || 1893 || 1894 || 1895 || 1896 || 1897\n|-\n!Meiji|| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36 || 37 || 38 || 39 || 40 || 41 || 42 || 43 || 44 || 45\n|-\n|AD|| 1898 || 1899 || 1900 || 1901 || 1902 || 1903 || 1904 || 1905 || 1906 || 1907 || 1908 || 1909 || 1910 || 1911 || 1912\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Japan|History}}\n* [[Japanese nationalism]]\n* [[List of political figures of Meiji Japan]]\n* [[Amakusa coalfield]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{loc}}\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0080440118000063|title=Castles and the Militarisation of Urban Society in Imperial Japan|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume=28|pages=107\u2013134|year=2018|last1=Benesch|first1=Oleg|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|access-date=November 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120055147/http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|archive-date=November 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}\n* GlobalSecurity.org (2008).

As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically-different ideas, the changes to Japan were profound, and affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded to the reign of [[Emperor Meiji]]. It was preceded by the [[Kei\u014d]] era and was succeeded by the [[Taish\u014d]] era, upon the accession of [[Emperor Taish\u014d]].\n\n== Meiji Restoration ==\n{{main|Meiji Restoration}} \n{{see also|Abolition of the han system}}\n\nOn February 3, 1867, the 14-year-old [[Emperor Meiji|Prince Mutsuhito]] succeeded his father, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]], to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] as the 122nd emperor.\n\nOn November 9, 1867, then-''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] tendered his resignation to the Emperor, and formally stepped down ten days later.<ref>Takano, p. 256.</ref> [[Meiji Restoration|Imperial restoration]] occurred the next year on January 3, 1868, with the formation of [[Meiji government|the new government]]. The [[fall of Edo]] in the summer of 1868 marked the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and a new era, ''Meiji'', was proclaimed.\n\nThe first reform was the promulgation of the [[Five Charter Oath]] in 1868, a general statement of the aims of the [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji leaders]] to boost morale and win financial support for the [[Government of Meiji Japan|new government]]. Its five provisions consisted of:\n\n1. Deliberative assembly shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion\n\n2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of the affairs of state\n\n3. The common people, no less than the civil and military of officials, shall each be allowed to pursue his own calling so that there may be no discontent. \n\n4. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of nature.\n\n5. Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule\n\n\nImplicit in the Charter Oath was an end to exclusive political rule by the [[sh\u014dgun|bakufu]] (a ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s direct administration including officers), and a move toward more democratic participation in government. To implement the Charter Oath, a rather short-lived constitution with eleven articles was drawn up in June 1868. Besides providing for a new [[Daij\u014d-kan|Council of State]], legislative bodies, and systems of ranks for nobles and officials, it limited office tenure to four years, allowed public balloting, provided for a new taxation system, and ordered new local administrative rules.\n\n[[File:MeijiJoukyou.jpg|thumb|left|The fifteen-year-old [[Meiji Emperor]], moving from [[Kyoto]] to Tokyo at the end of 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]]]]\n\nThe Meiji government assured the foreign powers that it would follow the old treaties negotiated by the bakufu and announced that it would act in accordance with international law. Mutsuhito, who was to reign until 1912, selected a new reign title\u2014''Meiji'', or Enlightened Rule\u2014to mark the beginning of a new era in Japanese history. To further dramatize the new order, the capital was relocated from [[Kyoto]], where it had been situated since 794, to [[Tokyo]] (Eastern Capital), the new name for [[Edo]]. In a move critical for the consolidation of the new regime, most ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' voluntarily surrendered their land and census records to the Emperor in the [[Abolition of the han system|abolition of the Han system]], symbolizing that the land and people were under the Emperor's jurisdiction.\n\nConfirmed in their hereditary positions, the daimyo became governors, and the central government assumed their administrative expenses and paid [[samurai]] stipends. The han were replaced with [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] in 1871, and authority continued to flow to the national government. Officials from the favored former han, such as [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], and [[Hizen]] staffed the new ministries. Formerly [[Kuge|old court nobles]], and lower-ranking but more radical samurai, replaced bakufu appointees and daimyo as a new ruling class appeared.\n\n[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Meiji]] in his fifties.]]\n\nIn as much as the Meiji Restoration had sought to return the Emperor to a preeminent position, efforts were made to establish a [[Shinto]]-oriented state much like it was 1,000 years earlier. Since Shinto and Buddhism [[Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d|had molded into a syncretic belief]] in the prior one-thousand years and Buddhism had been closely connected with the shogunate, this involved the separation of Shinto and Buddhism ([[shinbutsu bunri]]) and the associated destruction of various Buddhist temples and related violence ([[haibutsu kishaku]]). Furthermore, a new [[State Shinto]] had to be constructed for the purpose. In 1871, the [[Office of Shinto Worship]] ([[:ja:\u795e\u7947\u7701]]) was established, ranking even above the Council of State in importance. The ''[[kokutai]]'' ideas of the Mito school were embraced, and the divine ancestry of the [[Imperial Household of Japan|Imperial House]] was emphasized. The government supported Shinto teachers, a small but important move. Although the Office of Shinto Worship was demoted in 1872, by 1877 the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]] controlled all Shinto shrines and certain Shinto sects were given state recognition. Shinto was released from Buddhist administration and its properties restored. Although Buddhism suffered from state sponsorship of Shinto, it had its own resurgence. Christianity also was legalized, and Confucianism remained an important ethical doctrine. Increasingly, however, Japanese thinkers identified with Western ideology and methods.\n\n== Politics ==\n{{main|Meiji oligarchy|Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji Constitution}}\n\nA major proponent of representative government was [[Itagaki Taisuke]] (1837\u20131919), a powerful [[Tosa Province|Tosa]] leader who had resigned from the Council of State over the [[Seikanron|Korean affair]] in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful, rather than rebellious, means to gain a voice in government. He started a school and a movement aimed at establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]] and a [[legislative assembly]]. Such movements were called [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|The Freedom and People's Rights Movement]]. Itagaki and others wrote the [[Tosa Memorial]] ([[:ja:\u6c11\u64b0\u8b70\u9662\u8a2d\u7acb\u5efa\u767d\u66f8]]) in 1874, criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government.\n\nBetween 1871 and 1873, a series of [[Land Tax Reform (Japan 1873)|land and tax laws]] were enacted as the basis for modern fiscal policy. Private ownership was legalized, deeds were issued, and lands were assessed at fair market value with taxes paid in cash rather than in kind as in pre-Meiji days and at slightly lower rates.\n\nDissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide [[Aikokusha]] (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the [[Liberal Party of Japan (1881)|Jiy\u016bt\u014d]] (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines.\n\n[[File:Japanese Parliament in session.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of [[National Diet]], showing Minister speaking at the tribune from which members address the House.]]\n\nIn 1882, [[\u014ckuma Shigenobu]] established the [[Rikken Kaishint\u014d]] (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the [[Rikken Teiseit\u014d]] (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisions within and among them. The Jiy\u016bt\u014d, which had opposed the Kaishinto, was disbanded in 1884 and \u014ckuma resigned as Kaishint\u014d president.\n\nGovernment leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that [[constitutional government]] should someday be established. The [[Nagato Province|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] leader [[Kido Takayoshi]] had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. While acknowledging the realities of political pressure, however, the oligarchy was determined to keep control. Thus, modest steps were taken.\n\nThe Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed [[Chamber of Elders]] (Genr\u014din) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The Emperor declared that \"constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages\" as he ordered the [[Genr\u014d|Council of Elders]] to draft a constitution.\n\nThree years later, the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority, these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level, and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns. In 1880 delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the [[League for the Establishment of a National Assembly|Kokkai Kisei D\u014dmei]].\n\nAlthough the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for \"people's rights\", it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The [[Public Assembly Law, 1880|Public Assembly Law]] (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings.\n\nWithin the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, Okuma continued as a lone advocate of British-style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and dismissing Okuma.\n\nRejecting the British model, [[Iwakura Tomomi|Iwakura]] and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the [[Constitution of the German Empire|Prussian constitutional system]]. One of the Meiji oligarchy, [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] (1841\u20131909), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan's constitution. He led a constitutional study mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the [[United States Constitution]] as \"too liberal\", and the British system as too unwieldy, and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism.\n\nIto was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Ito as prime minister. The positions of chancellor (or chief-minister), [[Sadaijin|minister of the left]], and [[Udaijin|minister of the right]], which had existed since the seventh century as advisory positions to the Emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]] was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the Emperor.\n\nTo further strengthen the authority of the State, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of [[Yamagata Aritomo]] (1838\u20131922), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Japanese army and was to become the first constitutional [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. The [[Supreme War Council (Japan)|Supreme War Council]] developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the Emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials.\n\nThe [[Meiji Constitution|Constitution of the Empire of Japan]] was enacted on November 29, 1890.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Meiji-Constitution|title=Meiji Constitution {{!}} 1889, Japan|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en}}</ref> It was a form of mixed [[Constitutional_monarchy|constitutional]] and [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hein|first1=Patrick|title=How the Japanese became foreign to themselves : the impact of globalization on the private and public spheres in Japan|date=2009|publisher=Lit|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3643100856|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5QJsvhHwjVMC&lpg=PA72&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The [[Emperor of Japan]] was legally the [[Supreme leader|supreme leader]], and the Cabinet were his followers. The Prime Minister would be elected by a [[Privy Council of Japan|Privy Council]]. In reality, the Emperor was [[head of state]] but the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] was the actual head of government. \n\nClass distinctions were mostly eliminated during modernization to create a [[representative democracy]]. The [[samurai]] lost their status as the only class with military privileges. However, during the [[Meiji period]], most leaders in Japanese society (politics, business and military) were ex-samurai or descendants of [[samurai]]. \n\nThe 1889 [[Constitution of the Empire of Japan|Meiji Constitution]] made relatively small concessions to [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement|civil rights]] and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Emperor shared his authority and give rights and liberties to his subjects. It provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a popularly elected [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] with a very limited franchise of male citizens who were over twenty-five years of age and paid fifteen yen in national taxes (approximately 1% of the population). The [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] was composed of nobility and imperial appointees. A cabinet was responsible to the Emperor and independent of the legislature. The Diet could approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the Emperor. The Meiji Constitution lasted as the fundamental law until 1947. \n\nIn the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extra-constitutional body of [[genr\u014d]] (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genro made decisions reserved for the Emperor, and the genro, not the Emperor, controlled the government politically.\n\nThroughout the period, however, political problems usually were solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever-larger role in the political process as a result. Between 1891 and 1895, Ito served as Prime Minister with a cabinet composed mostly of genro who wanted to establish a government party to control the House of Representatives. Although not fully realized, the trend toward party politics was well established.\n\n== Society ==\n{{expand section|with=an overview of art and design style changes in the Meiji era, and their indelible influence on (and later recursively by) European [[Art Nouveau]]|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Ginza in 1880s.JPG|thumb|[[Ginza]] in 1880s.]]\n[[File:Iwakura und Damen.jpg|thumb|Japanese of the era (circa 1872).]]\n\nOn its return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred people from the old court nobility, former daimyo, and samurai who had provided valuable service to the Emperor were organized into a new peerage, the [[Kazoku]], consisting of five ranks: prince, [[Marquess|marquis]], [[count]], [[viscount]], and [[baron]].\n\nIn the transition between the [[Edo period]] and the Meiji era, the [[Ee ja nai ka]] movement, a spontaneous outbreak of ecstatic behavior, took place.\n\nIn 1885, noted public intellectual [[Yukichi Fukuzawa]] wrote the influential essay \"[[Datsu-A Ron|Leaving Asia]]\", arguing that Japan should orient itself at the \"civilized countries of the West\", leaving behind the \"hopelessly backward\" Asian neighbors, namely [[Korea]] and China. This essay certainly encouraged the economic and technological rise of Japan in the Meiji era, but it also may have laid the intellectual foundations for later Japanese [[colonialism]] in the region.\n\nThe Meiji era saw a flowering of public discourse on the direction of Japan. Works like [[Nakae Ch\u014dmin]]'s A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government<ref>Nakae, C. and Tsukui, N. and Hammond, J. A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government. 1984.</ref> debated how best to blend the new influences coming from the West with local Japanese culture. Grassroots movements like the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] called for the establishment of a formal legislature, civil rights, and greater pluralism in the Japanese political system. Journalists, politicians, and writers actively participated in the movement, which attracted an array of interest groups, including women's rights activists.<ref>Hane, M. Reflections on the Way to the Gallows: Rebel Women in Prewar Japan. University of California Press. 1988.</ref>\n\nThe elite class of the Meiji era adapted many aspects of Victorian taste, as seen in the construction of Western-style pavilions and reception rooms called ''y\u014dkan or y\u014dma'' in their homes. These parts of Meiji homes were displayed in popular magazines of the time, such as ''Ladies' Graphic,'' which portrayed the often empty rooms of the homes of the aristocracy of all levels, including the imperial palaces. Integrating Western cultural forms with an assumed, untouched native Japanese spirit was characteristic of Meiji society, especially at the top levels, and represented Japan's search for a place within a new world power system in which European colonial empires dominated.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Was Meiji Taste in Interiors \"Orientalist?\"|last = Sand|first = Jordan|date = 2000|journal = Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique|publisher = Duke University Press|issue = 3|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pos/summary/v008/8.3sand.html|volume = 8|pages = 637\u2013673|doi = 10.1215/10679847-8-3-637}}</ref>\n\n=== Fashion ===\n[[File:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}), 1880\u20131890, the [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\nThe production of [[kimono]] started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]]'s descriptions of Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles.

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as Meiji era leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin).\n\nIn 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the US to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1877, used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories.\n\nModern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.<ref>G.C. Allen, Short Economic History of Modern Japan (1972)</ref>  Due to the importing of new textile manufacturing technology from Europe, between 1886 and 1897, Japan's total value of yarn output rose from 12 million to 176 million yen. In 1886, 62% of yarn in Japan was imported; by 1902, most yarn was produced locally. By 1913, Japan was producing 672 million pounds of yarn per year, becoming the fourth largest exporter of cotton yarn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor|last=Landes|first=David S.|publisher=Norton|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=379\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe first railway was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872; and railway was rapidly developed throughout Japan well into the twentieth century. The introduction of railway transportation led to more efficient production due to the decline in transport costs; allowing for manufacturing firms to move into more populated interior regions of Japan in search for labour input. The railway also enabled a new-found access to raw materials that had previously been too difficult or costly to transport.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=John P.|date=September 2014|title=Railroad Expansion and Industrialization: Evidence from Meiji Japan|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume= 74|issue=3|pages=863\u2013886|via=CRKN Cambridge University Press Journals|doi=10.1017/S002205071400062X}}</ref>\n\nThere were at least two reasons for the speed of Japan's modernization: the employment of more than 3,000 foreign experts (called ''[[o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'' or 'hired foreigners') in a variety of specialist fields such as teaching English, science, engineering, the army and navy, among others; and the dispatch of many Japanese students overseas to Europe and America, based on the fifth and last article of the Charter Oath of 1868: 'Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule.' This process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government, enhancing the power of the great [[zaibatsu]] firms such as [[Mitsui]] and [[Mitsubishi]].\n\nHand in hand, the zaibatsu and government guided the nation, borrowing technology from the West. Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with textiles. The economic structure became very [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]], importing raw materials and exporting finished products\u2014a reflection of Japan's relative poverty in raw materials.\n\nJapan emerged from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]]\u2013[[Emperor of Japan|Tenn\u014d]] ([[Kei\u014d]]\u2013Meiji) transition in 1868 as the first Asian industrialized nation. Domestic commercial activities and limited foreign trade had met the demands for material culture until the Kei\u014d era, but the modernized Meiji era had radically different requirements. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. The private sector\u2014in a nation with an abundance of aggressive entrepreneurs\u2014welcomed such change.\n\n[[File:Tokyo Industrial Exhibition.JPG|thumb|1907 Tokyo Industrial Exhibition]]\n\nEconomic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the yen, banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conducive to an advanced capitalist economy took time, but was completed by the 1890s. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons.\n\nMany of the former daimyo, whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries. Those who had been informally involved in foreign trade before the Meiji Restoration also flourished. Old bakufu-serving firms that clung to their traditional ways failed in the new business environment.\n\nThe government initially was involved in economic modernization, providing a number of \"model factories\" to facilitate the transition to the modern era. After the first twenty years of the Meiji era, the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. Stimulated by wars and through cautious economic planning, Japan emerged from World War I as a major industrial nation.\n\nIn 1885, the Meiji government sponsored a telegraph system, throughout Japan, situating the telegraphs in all major Japanese cities at the time.\n\n== Military ==\n{{main|Japanese military modernization of 1868\u20131931|Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Navy}}\n\n===Overview===\nUndeterred by opposition, the Meiji leaders continued to modernize the nation through government-sponsored telegraph cable links to all major Japanese cities and the Asian mainland and construction of railroads, shipyards, munitions factories, mines, textile manufacturing facilities, factories, and experimental agriculture stations. Greatly concerned about national security, the leaders made significant efforts at military modernization, which included establishing a small standing army, a large reserve system, and compulsory militia service for all men. Foreign military systems were studied, foreign advisers, especially French ones, were brought in, and Japanese cadets sent abroad to Europe and the United States to attend military and naval schools.\n\n===Early Meiji period (1868\u201377)===\nIn 1854, after Admiral Matthew C.

The Osaka Arsenal was responsible for the production of machine guns and ammunition.<ref>National Diet Library (2008).</ref> Also, four gunpowder facilities also were opened at this site. Japan's production capacity gradually expanded.\n\nIn 1872, Yamagata Aritomo and [[Saig\u014d J\u016bd\u014d]], both new field marshals, founded the Corps of the Imperial Guards. This corps was composed of the warrior classes from the [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]], [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] clans.<ref name=gs08/> Also, in the same year, the hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years, when in January the Conscription Law of 1873 was passed. This law required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves.<ref name=gs08/> This monumental law, signifying the beginning of the end for the samurai class, initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. Avoidance methods included maiming, self-mutilation, and local uprisings.<ref>Kublin (1949) p.32.</ref>  The samurai were generally resentful of the new, western-style military and at first, refused to stand in formation with the peasant class.<ref name=gs08/>\n\n[[File:MikadoWithFrenchMission.jpg|thumb|Emperor Meiji receives the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872\u20131880)|second French Military Mission to Japan]] (1872).]]\n\nIn conjunction with the new conscription law, the Japanese government began modeling their ground forces after the French military. Indeed, the new Japanese army used the same rank structure as the French.<ref>Kublin (1949) p.31.</ref> The enlisted corps ranks were: private, noncommissioned officers, and officers. The private classes were: j\u014dt\u014d-hei or upper soldier, itt\u014d-sotsu or first-class soldier, and nit\u014d-sotsu or second-class soldier. The noncommissioned officer class ranks were: goch\u014d or corporal, guns\u014d or sergeant, s\u014dch\u014d or sergeant major, and tokumu-s\u014dch\u014d or special sergeant major. Finally, the officer class is made up of: sh\u014di or second lieutenant, ch\u016bi or first lieutenant, tai or captain, sh\u014dsa or major, ch\u016bsa or lieutenant colonel, taisa or colonel, sh\u014dsh\u014d or major general, ch\u016bj\u014d or lieutenant general, taish\u014d or general, and gensui or field marshal.<ref name=gs08/> The French government also contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks.<ref name=gs08/>\n\nDespite the Conscription Law of 1873, and all the reforms and progress, the new Japanese army was still untested. That all changed in 1877, when [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] led the last rebellion of the samurai in Ky\u016bsh\u016b. In February 1877, Saig\u014d left Kagoshima with a small contingent of soldiers on a journey to Tokyo. Kumamoto castle was the site of the first major engagement when garrisoned forces fired on Saig\u014d's army as they attempted to force their way into the castle. Rather than leave an enemy behind him, Saig\u014d laid siege to the castle. Two days later, Saig\u014d's rebels, while attempting to block a mountain pass, encountered advanced elements of the national army en route to reinforce Kumamoto castle. After a short battle, both sides withdrew to reconstitute their forces. A few weeks later the national army engaged Saig\u014d's rebels in a frontal assault at what now is called the Battle of Tabaruzuka. During this eight-day-battle, Saig\u014d's nearly ten thousand strong army battled hand-to-hand the equally matched national army. Both sides suffered nearly four thousand casualties during this engagement. Due to conscription, however, the Japanese army was able to reconstitute its forces, while Saig\u014d's was not. Later, forces loyal to the emperor broke through rebel lines and managed to end the siege on [[Kumamoto Castle]] after fifty-four days. Saig\u014d's troops fled north and were pursued by the national army. The national army caught up with Saig\u014d at Mt. [[Enodake]]. Saig\u014d's army was outnumbered seven-to-one, prompting a mass surrender of many samurai. The remaining five hundred samurai loyal to Saig\u014d escaped, travelling south to Kagoshima.  The rebellion ended on September 24, 1877, following the final engagement with Imperial forces which resulted in the deaths of the remaining forty samurai including Saig\u014d, who, having suffered a fatal bullet wound in the abdomen, was honourably beheaded by his retainer. The national army's victory validated the current course of the modernization of the Japanese army as well as ended the era of the samurai.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{main|Foreign relations of Meiji Japan}}\n\nWhen the United States Navy ended Japan's [[Sakoku|sakoku policy]], and thus its isolation, the latter found itself defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality. Following the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident]], Japan released the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident|Chinese coolies from a western ship]] in 1872, after which the [[Qing dynasty|Qing imperial government of China]] gave thanks to Japan.\n\nFollowing Japan's victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895), Japan broke through as an international power with a victory against Russia in [[Manchuria]] (north-eastern China) in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Allied with Britain since the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] signed in London on January 30, 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I, seizing German-held territory in China and the Pacific in the process, but otherwise remained largely out of the conflict.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], a weakened Europe left a greater share in international markets to the United States and Japan, which emerged greatly strengthened. Japanese competition made great inroads into hitherto-European-dominated markets in Asia, not only in China, but even in European colonies such as India and [[Indonesia]], reflecting the development of the Meiji era.\n\nThe final years of the Meiji era were also marked by the annexation of [[Korea]] in 1911; Japan's [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupation]] of the peninsula nation would persist until Japan's loss in [[World War II]] in 1945, during the middle of the [[Sh\u014dwa period]], and would have lasting negative repercussions on foreign relations between Japan and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]].\n\n==Conversion table==\nTo convert any [[Gregorian calendar]] year between 1868 and 1912 to [[Japanese calendar]] year in Meiji era, 1867 needs to be subtracted from the year in question.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Meiji|| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15\n|-\n|AD|| 1868 || 1869 || 1870 || 1871 || 1872 || 1873 || 1874 || 1875 || 1876 || 1877 || 1878 || 1879 || 1880 || 1881 || 1882\n|-\n!Meiji|| 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30\n|-\n|AD|| 1883 || 1884 || 1885 || 1886 || 1887 || 1888 || 1889 || 1890 || 1891 || 1892 || 1893 || 1894 || 1895 || 1896 || 1897\n|-\n!Meiji|| 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36 || 37 || 38 || 39 || 40 || 41 || 42 || 43 || 44 || 45\n|-\n|AD|| 1898 || 1899 || 1900 || 1901 || 1902 || 1903 || 1904 || 1905 || 1906 || 1907 || 1908 || 1909 || 1910 || 1911 || 1912\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Japan|History}}\n* [[Japanese nationalism]]\n* [[List of political figures of Meiji Japan]]\n* [[Amakusa coalfield]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{loc}}\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0080440118000063|title=Castles and the Militarisation of Urban Society in Imperial Japan|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume=28|pages=107\u2013134|year=2018|last1=Benesch|first1=Oleg|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|access-date=November 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120055147/http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/133333/1/Benesch_Castles_and_the_Militarisation_of_Urban_Society_in_Imperial_Japan_TRHS_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf|archive-date=November 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}\n* GlobalSecurity.org (2008).

Shiva is worshipped as Bhaktajaneswarar, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]''. His consort [[Parvati]] is depicted as Manonmani Amman. The temple is located on the Panruti - Kedilam road. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil saint poets known as the [[nayanmars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''. The temple is closely associated with [[Sundarar]], who is believed to have attained grace at this place.\n\nThe temple complex covers an area of two acres and all its shrines are enclosed with concentric rectangular walls. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Bhaktajaneswarar, his consort Manonmani Amman and Ranganathar being the most prominent.\n\nThe temple has three daily rituals at various times from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and many yearly festivals on its calendar. Sundarar Janana festival during the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil month]] of ''Aavani'' (August - September) and Sundarar Guru Poojai during the month of Aadi are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple.\n\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by [[Cholas]], with later additions from different ruling dynasties. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the [[Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]] of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Legend and history==\n[[File:Thirunavalur (11).jpg |250px|thumb|left|The main shrines of the temple]]\n<ref name=dinamalar/>\nAs per [[Hindu]] legend, during the churning of the [[Ocean of milk]], a sperm fell at this place to originate as a \"Naval\" tree. It came to be known as Jambuvanam and over the period of several eons, a temple formed in the place. The place thus came to be known as Navalur while presiding deity came to be known as Thirunavleesan.\n\nAs per another legend, Sukra (Venus) obtained the diving elixir that could bring back dead people. During the fight between Devas, the celestial deities and [[Asura]]s, the demons, Sukra helped the Asuras by bringing them back to life repeatedly. The Devas complained it to Shiva, who swallowed Sukra. He then brought him back to life and installed him as one of the [[Navagrahas]], the planetary deities. He also instructed him to help devotees based on the deeds. Sundarar, an 8th-century saivite saint was born in the place and believed to have attained divinity by worshipping Shiva at the place.\n\nThe place is also believed to be the one where Adisesha got back his original colour attained on account of the poison. Brahma is believed to have worhsipped the deity during [[Dvapara Yuga]], while Sivapriyar, who went on to become [[Chandeshvara Nayanar|Chandekeswarar]] worshipped the deity during [[Treta Yuga]].<ref name=\"dinamalar\"/>\n\nThe original structure is believed to be existent from time immemorial, while the later additions are believed to have been built by [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]], while the present masonry structure was built during the 16th century. There are inscriptions from later [[Chola]] emperors like [[Rajaraja Chola I]] (985\u20131014), [[Kulothunga Chola I]] (1070\u20131120) and [[Rajendra Chola III]] (1246\u20131279).<ref>{{cite web|title=Navalur|url=http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/koil_view.php?koil_idField=264|publisher=Thevaaram.org|year=2011|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nBhaktajaneswarar temple is located in a village called [[Tirunavalur block|Thirunavalur]] on Viluppuram - Kedilam main road. The temple has a flat entrance tower facing South, and all the shrines of the temple are enclosed in concentric rectangular granite walls. The central shrine is approached through pillared halls. The central shrine facing East houses the image of Bhaktajaneswarar in the form of [[Lingam]] (an iconic form of Shiva). The shrine of Manonmani Amman, facing South, is located in separate shrine around the first precicnt. The central shrine is approached through a Mahamandapam and Arthamandapam. As in other Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu, the shrines of [[Vinayaka]], [[Murugan]], [[Navagraha]], Chandekeswara and [[Durga]] are located around the precinct of the main shrine. The second precinct also has a shrine of [[Ranganatha]] and a garden around the periphery of the compound wall. The shrine of [[Sundarar]] is located in the north eastern corner of the precinct.

The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Bhaktajaneswarar, his consort Manonmani Amman and Ranganathar being the most prominent.\n\nThe temple has three daily rituals at various times from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and many yearly festivals on its calendar. Sundarar Janana festival during the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil month]] of ''Aavani'' (August - September) and Sundarar Guru Poojai during the month of Aadi are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple.\n\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by [[Cholas]], with later additions from different ruling dynasties. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the [[Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]] of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Legend and history==\n[[File:Thirunavalur (11).jpg |250px|thumb|left|The main shrines of the temple]]\n<ref name=dinamalar/>\nAs per [[Hindu]] legend, during the churning of the [[Ocean of milk]], a sperm fell at this place to originate as a \"Naval\" tree. It came to be known as Jambuvanam and over the period of several eons, a temple formed in the place. The place thus came to be known as Navalur while presiding deity came to be known as Thirunavleesan.  \n\nAs per another legend, Sukra (Venus) obtained the diving elixir that could bring back dead people. During the fight between Devas, the celestial deities and [[Asura]]s, the demons, Sukra helped the Asuras by bringing them back to life repeatedly. The Devas complained it to Shiva, who swallowed Sukra. He then brought him back to life and installed him as one of the [[Navagrahas]], the planetary deities. He also instructed him to help devotees based on the deeds. Sundarar, an 8th-century saivite saint was born in the place and believed to have attained divinity by worshipping Shiva at the place.\n\nThe place is also believed to be the one where Adisesha got back his original colour attained on account of the poison. Brahma is believed to have worhsipped the deity during [[Dvapara Yuga]], while Sivapriyar, who went on to become [[Chandeshvara Nayanar|Chandekeswarar]] worshipped the deity during [[Treta Yuga]].<ref name=\"dinamalar\"/>\n\nThe original structure is believed to be existent from time immemorial, while the later additions are believed to have been built by [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]], while the present masonry structure was built during the 16th century. There are inscriptions from later [[Chola]] emperors like [[Rajaraja Chola I]] (985\u20131014), [[Kulothunga Chola I]] (1070\u20131120) and [[Rajendra Chola III]] (1246\u20131279).<ref>{{cite web|title=Navalur|url=http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/koil_view.php?koil_idField=264|publisher=Thevaaram.org|year=2011|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nBhaktajaneswarar temple is located in a village called [[Tirunavalur block|Thirunavalur]] on Viluppuram - Kedilam main road. The temple has a flat entrance tower facing South, and all the shrines of the temple are enclosed in concentric rectangular granite walls. The central shrine is approached through pillared halls. The central shrine facing East houses the image of Bhaktajaneswarar in the form of [[Lingam]] (an iconic form of Shiva). The shrine of Manonmani Amman, facing South, is located in separate shrine around the first precicnt. The central shrine is approached through a Mahamandapam and Arthamandapam. As in other Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu, the shrines of [[Vinayaka]], [[Murugan]], [[Navagraha]], Chandekeswara and [[Durga]] are located around the precinct of the main shrine. The second precinct also has a shrine of [[Ranganatha]] and a garden around the periphery of the compound wall. The shrine of [[Sundarar]] is located in the north eastern corner of the precinct. Sundarar is sported in standing posture along with his two consorts on either sides.<ref name=dinamalar/> \n \n==Religious importance and festivals==\n[[File:Thirunavalur (14).jpg |250x|thumb|Sculpted images on the roof of the sanctum]]\n[[Sundarar]], an 8th-century Tamil ''Saivite'' poet, venerated Bhaktajaneswarar in ten verses in ''[[Tevaram]]'', compiled as the ''[[Tirumurai|Ninth Tirumurai]]''. As the temple is revered in ''Tevaram'', it is classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]'', one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. During three days of March, the Sun rays fall directly on the image in the sanctum.<ref name=R/> \n\nThe temple priests perform the ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed three times a day; ''Kalasanthi'' at 8:00&nbsp;a.m., ''Uchikalam'' at 12:00&nbsp;a.m. and ''Sayarakshai'' at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: ''[[abhisheka]]'' (sacred bath), ''alangaram'' (decoration), ''[[Naivedhya|naivethanam]]'' (food offering) and ''deepa aradanai'' (waving of lamps) for Bhaktajaneswarar and Gnanambigai. Unlike other shiva temples, anointing with oil is not performed in the temple.<ref name=R/> There are weekly rituals like ''{{lang|te-Latn|somavaram}}'' (Monday) and ''{{lang|te-Latn|sukravaram}}'' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like ''[[pradosha]]m'', and monthly festivals like ''[[amavasya|amavasai]]'' (new moon day), ''kiruthigai'', ''[[pournami (festival)|pournami]]'' (full moon day) and ''sathurthi''. Sundarar Janana festival during the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil month]] of ''Aavani'' (August - September) and Sundarar Guru Poojai during the month of Aadi are the most important festivals of the temple.<ref name=dinamalar>{{cite web|title=Sri Bhaktajaneswarar temple|url=http://temple.dinamalar.com/New.php?id=685|publisher=[[Dinamalar]]|year=2014|accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=R>{{cite book|title=An introduction to religion and Philosophy - T\u00e9var\u00e1m and Tivviyappirapantam|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.jZY9lup2kZl6TuXGlZQdjZY2lZpy.TVA_BOK_0006115|last=R.|first=Dr. Vijayalakshmy|\npublisher=International Institute of Tamil Studies| location=Chennai|year=2001|edition=1st|pages=342\u20133}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Thirunavalur temple}}\n{{Famous Shiva temples|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Viluppuram district]]\n[[Category:Shiva temples in Viluppuram district]]\n[[Category:Padal Petra Stalam]]\n", "name_user": "Titodutta", "label": "safe", "comment": "Remove parent category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaktajaneswarar_temple"}

The sealed room in which Uri was placed had an aperture from which he could have peeked out, and his confederate Shipi was in and about the laboratory and could have conveyed signals to him. The same was true in another test of clairvoyance, where Geller passed twice but surprisingly guessed eight out of ten times the top face of a die that was placed in a closed metal box. The probability of this happening by chance alone was, we are told, one in a million.

The drawings he was asked to reproduce were placed on a wall opposite the peep hole which the investigators Targ and Puthoff had stuffed with cotton gauze. In addition to this error, the investigators had also allowed Geller access to a two-way intercom enabling Geller to listen to the investigators' conversation during the times when they were choosing and/or displaying the target drawings.

Geller's trickery was exposed in large measure by the magician James Randi.

Sometimes Geller would prepare a spoon or key beforehand by bending it back and forth several times to the point where it was nearly ready to break. Later, by merely stroking it gently, he could cause it to double over. On other occasions Geller, or his accomplices, would use sleight-of-hand maneuvers to substitute bent objects in the place of straight ones.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Geller published his first autobiography, ''My Story'', and acknowledged that, in his early career, his manager talked him into adding a magic trick to make his performances last longer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uri-geller.com/books/my-story/ms13.htm |title=13 |publisher=Uri-geller.com |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref> This trick involved Geller appearing to guess audience members' car registration numbers, when his manager had given them to him ahead of time.

Hyman, a University of Oregon psychologist (and amateur magician), added that the think tank's work was \"incredibly sloppy\". Geller was not psychic but a very gifted conjurer, Hyman concluded, employing classic mentalist\u2019s tricks that would and should have been exposed by more objective methods. Over the course of his six-week stint at SRI (for which he was paid 100$ a day and all expenses), Geller had not even been searched for magnets, something that any good researcher would have known to do to instantly identify a fake.

They have pointed out that the pictures drawn by Geller did not match what they were supposed to correspond to but appeared, rather, to be responses to verbal cues. What constituted a \"hit\" is open to dispute. The conditions under which the experiments were conducted were extremely loose, even chaotic at times. The sealed room in which Uri was placed had an aperture from which he could have peeked out, and his confederate Shipi was in and about the laboratory and could have conveyed signals to him. The same was true in another test of clairvoyance, where Geller passed twice but surprisingly guessed eight out of ten times the top face of a die that was placed in a closed metal box. The probability of this happening by chance alone was, we are told, one in a million. Critics maintained that the protocol of this experiment was, again, poorly designed, that Geller could have peeked into the box, and that dozens of other tests from which there were no positive results were not reported.\"</ref>\n\nCritics of the experiments include [[psychology|psychologists]] [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Richard Kammann, who published a description of how Geller could have cheated in an informal test of his so-called psychic powers in 1977.<ref>Marks, David and Kammann, Richard (Summer 1977) \"The Non-Psychic Powers of Uri Geller\".

The drawings he was asked to reproduce were placed on a wall opposite the peep hole which the investigators Targ and Puthoff had stuffed with cotton gauze. In addition to this error, the investigators had also allowed Geller access to a two-way intercom enabling Geller to listen to the investigators' conversation during the times when they were choosing and/or displaying the target drawings. These basic errors indicate the high importance of ensuring that psychologists, magicians or other people with an in-depth knowledge of perception, who are trained in methods for blocking sensory cues, be present during the testing of psychics.<ref name=\"Marks 2000\"/> Marks, after evaluating the experiments, wrote that none of Geller's paranormal claims had been demonstrated in scientifically controlled conditions, concluding that \"Geller has no psychic ability whatsoever.

It was founded by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]]. The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the rest of the band; he said in 1997, \"I was in awe of [frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songs], and [I was] intimidated. I thought it was best that I kept my songs to myself.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\">di Perna, Alan. \"Absolutely Foobulous!\". ''Guitar World''.

They followed that with a show at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig to aid the finances of the investigation into the rape and murder of [[The Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name=\"Breakout\" /> Foo Fighters undertook its first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]]. The band's first single, \"[[This Is a Call]]\", was released in June 1995,<ref name=AMG /> and its debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'' was released the next month. \"[[I'll Stick Around]]\", \"[[For All the Cows]]\", and \"[[Big Me]]\" were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the [[Reading Festival]] in England in August.<ref name=\"Breakout\" />\n\n=== ''The Colour and the Shape'' (1996\u20131997) ===\nAfter touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered Bear Creek Studio in [[Woodinville, Washington]], with producer [[Gil Norton]] to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album. He wanted Goldsmith to play for the tour even though it would not be his drumming but Grohl's on the album. Feeling betrayed, Goldsmith left the band.<ref>\"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one,\" he points out. \"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record.

Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', in May 1997. The album included the singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Walking After You]]\"\n\nPat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band, claiming exhaustion and burnout, but agreed to stay with the band until a replacement could be found for him. Four months later in September at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], Smear simultaneously announced to the public his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]].<ref name=\"Kerrang 1997\">Johnson, Lisa. \"Classic interview: October 1997\".

However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't\". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting the band to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day.<ref name=\"Burn away\">Beebee, Steve. \"Burn Away\".

The album spawned several singles, including \"[[Learn to Fly]]\", the band's first single to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Other singles included \"[[Stacked Actors]]\", \"[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]\", \"[[Next Year]]\" and \"[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]\".\n\nBefore the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label.

After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, the album \"just didn't sound right\" and the band had no confidence in the album to sell many records. With the album not reaching their expectations, and much infighting amongst the members, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely as the animosity grew amongst the members. Grohl reconvened with Hawkins, Shiflett and Mendel to have them play at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], with Queens of the Stone Age playing one day and Foo Fighters the following. After the Queens of the Stone Age played, Hawkins and Grohl talked about retrying the ''One by One'' album and had agreed to finishing it and seeing where they would go from there. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, [[Virginia]].<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as \"Million Dollar Demos\", has never been heard in its entirety, except for fragments that were leaked.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archivedate=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe final album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Grohl said in 2005, \"I love being in a rock band, but I don't know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s for the rest of my life.\" Grohl noted that the band's acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group's sound.<ref>Chick, Steve. \"Foo Fighters: 'Touring the UK?

The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the rest of the band; he said in 1997, \"I was in awe of [frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songs], and [I was] intimidated. I thought it was best that I kept my songs to myself.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\">di Perna, Alan. \"Absolutely Foobulous!\". ''Guitar World''.

They followed that with a show at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig to aid the finances of the investigation into the rape and murder of [[The Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name=\"Breakout\" /> Foo Fighters undertook its first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]]. The band's first single, \"[[This Is a Call]]\", was released in June 1995,<ref name=AMG /> and its debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'' was released the next month. \"[[I'll Stick Around]]\", \"[[For All the Cows]]\", and \"[[Big Me]]\" were released as subsequent singles.

While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album. He wanted Goldsmith to play for the tour even though it would not be his drumming but Grohl's on the album. Feeling betrayed, Goldsmith left the band.<ref>\"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one,\" he points out. \"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record. The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record. But then, behind my back, Dave re-recorded the whole record without telling me. I found out through Nate, who, well, I won't get into that. But I thought, This is bullshit.\" Roberts, Michael. \"[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2 Bring Back That Sunny Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103091941/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2/ |date=November 3, 2012 }}\".

The album included the singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Walking After You]]\"\n\nPat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band, claiming exhaustion and burnout, but agreed to stay with the band until a replacement could be found for him.

However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't\". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood.

Other singles included \"[[Stacked Actors]]\", \"[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]\", \"[[Next Year]]\" and \"[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]\".\n\nBefore the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know?

Shiva is worshipped as Atulya Nadheswarar, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]''. His consort [[Parvati]] is depicted as Azhagiya Ponnazhagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil saint poets known as the [[Nayanars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.\n\nThe temple complex covers two acres, built on a granite hill and it houses a seven tier gateway tower known as ''[[gopurams]]''. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Atulya Nadheswarar and his consort Azhagiya Ponnazhagi being the most prominent.\n\nThe temple has four daily rituals at various times from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated during Vaikasi (May - June) is the most prominent festival.\n\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by [[Pallavas]], with later expansion by [[Cholas]], while the present masonry structure was built during the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] during the 16th century. There are three rock-cut caves from the Pallava regime during the 10th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the [[Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]] of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]].\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:Arkandanallur3.JPG|250px|left|thumb|Image of the Annamalaiyar and Amman shrine of the temple]]\nAs per Hindu legend, [[Vishnu]] wanted to propitiate the sins caused by slaying [[Mahabali]] during [[Vamana]] avatar. He prayed Shiva for the same at various Shiva temples. His sins were cleared while worshipping Shiva. There is an image of Vishnu in a sculpture showing the legend. As per another legend, [[Sambandar]], the 7th century Saiva saint [[Nayanmar]], visited the place and sung praises of Atulya Natheswarar.
