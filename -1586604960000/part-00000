Choosing the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed greatly affects the probability that a user will see and click on each ad.

Choosing the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed greatly affects the probability that a user will see and click on each ad.

Along with managing artist such as [[Jimmie Allen]] and [[Matt Stell]] in the country music industry he previously was an American [[country music]] singer himself. Formerly, a solo artist charting three singles through [[Broken Bow Records]] imprint Stoney Creek.\n\n==History==\nHailing from Jackson, Tennessee, Ash came to Nashville chasing the music of his heroes \u2014 Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks, and Jerry Lee Lewis. He quickly landed in the studio as the first recording artist signed to Broken Bow Records imprint, Stoney Creek, and began making music with the man behind Chesney\u2019s hits, producer Buddy Cannon. From Buddy, Ash learned that writing and finding good songs is the key to any successful music career. This lesson would serve Ash well as he eventually moved into the producer\u2019s chair himself.\n\nBowers signed to Stoney Creek Records, a sister label to [[Broken Bow Records]], in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ash Bowers |url=http://www.digitalrodeo.com/ashbowers |work=Digital Rodeo |accessdate=8 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015200133/http://www.digitalrodeo.com/AshBowers |archivedate=15 October 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"cst\">{{cite web |title=Ash Bowers signs with Stoney Creek |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=3011 |work=[[Country Standard Time]] |accessdate=8 September 2009}}</ref> In August 2009, Bowers released his debut single \"Stuck\", written by [[Frank J.

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave a favorable review, saying that he could identify with the song's theme of wanting to leave a small town and adding, \"Even if somebody doesn\u2019t leave that hometown they feel \u2018stuck\u2019 in, they certainly can use this song as a weekend party anthem\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Bjorke |first=Matt |title=Ash Bowers - \"Stuck\" |url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/ash-bowers-stuck- |date=2009-08-24 |work=Roughstock |accessdate=8 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014204153/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/ash-bowers-stuck- |archivedate=14 October 2009 }}</ref> His debut album was to have been produced by [[Buddy Cannon]].<ref name=\"cst\"/> Two more singles were released from the project: \"Ain't No Stopping Her Now\" and \"I Still Believe in That\", but the album was never released.\n\nUltimately, Ash decided to focus on his songwriting and soon found success with Keith Urban, Montgomery Gentry, Dustin Lynch and Randy Houser all recording his songs. Ash then co-founded Wide Open Music, a publishing and management venture with his friend, Steve Williams. \n\nIn 2016, Ash took fellow songwriter Jimmie Allen under his wing, and signed him to Wide Open Music before helping Jimmie land a record deal at Ash\u2019s former label home, Stoney Creek. Together, they began writing and recording songs that would form the basis of [[Jimmie Allen]]'s debut album ''[[Mercury Lane]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theboot.com/jimmie-allen-debut-album-mercury-lane-details-information/ | title=Everything we know about Jimmie Allen's debut album, 'Mercury Lane' | work=The Boot | date=October 5, 2018 | accessdate=October 17, 2018 | author=Liv Stecker}}</ref>, which Ash co-produced with Eric Torres.

Along with managing artist such as [[Jimmie Allen]] and [[Matt Stell]] in the country music industry he previously was an American [[country music]] singer himself. Formerly, a solo artist charting three singles through [[Broken Bow Records]] imprint Stoney Creek.\n\n==History==\nHailing from Jackson, Tennessee, Ash came to Nashville chasing the music of his heroes \u2014 Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks, and Jerry Lee Lewis. He quickly landed in the studio as the first recording artist signed to Broken Bow Records imprint, Stoney Creek, and began making music with the man behind Chesney\u2019s hits, producer Buddy Cannon. From Buddy, Ash learned that writing and finding good songs is the key to any successful music career. This lesson would serve Ash well as he eventually moved into the producer\u2019s chair himself.\n\nBowers signed to Stoney Creek Records, a sister label to [[Broken Bow Records]], in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ash Bowers |url=http://www.digitalrodeo.com/ashbowers |work=Digital Rodeo |accessdate=8 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015200133/http://www.digitalrodeo.com/AshBowers |archivedate=15 October 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"cst\">{{cite web |title=Ash Bowers signs with Stoney Creek |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=3011 |work=[[Country Standard Time]] |accessdate=8 September 2009}}</ref> In August 2009, Bowers released his debut single \"Stuck\", written by [[Frank J.

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave a favorable review, saying that he could identify with the song's theme of wanting to leave a small town and adding, \"Even if somebody doesn\u2019t leave that hometown they feel \u2018stuck\u2019 in, they certainly can use this song as a weekend party anthem\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Bjorke |first=Matt |title=Ash Bowers - \"Stuck\" |url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/ash-bowers-stuck- |date=2009-08-24 |work=Roughstock |accessdate=8 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014204153/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/ash-bowers-stuck- |archivedate=14 October 2009 }}</ref> His debut album was to have been produced by [[Buddy Cannon]].<ref name=\"cst\"/> Two more singles were released from the project: \"Ain't No Stopping Her Now\" and \"I Still Believe in That\", but the album was never released.\n\nUltimately, Ash decided to focus on his songwriting and soon found success with Keith Urban, Montgomery Gentry, Dustin Lynch and Randy Houser all recording his songs. Ash then co-founded Wide Open Music, a publishing and management venture with his friend, Steve Williams. \n\nIn 2016, Ash took fellow songwriter Jimmie Allen under his wing, and signed him to Wide Open Music before helping Jimmie land a record deal at Ash\u2019s former label home, Stoney Creek. Together, they began writing and recording songs that would form the basis of [[Jimmie Allen]]'s debut album ''[[Mercury Lane]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theboot.com/jimmie-allen-debut-album-mercury-lane-details-information/ | title=Everything we know about Jimmie Allen's debut album, 'Mercury Lane' | work=The Boot | date=October 5, 2018 | accessdate=October 17, 2018 | author=Liv Stecker}}</ref>, which Ash co-produced with Eric Torres.

{"title_page": "Ramming", "text_new": "[[File:Olympias.1.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Naval ram|ram]] of [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']], a reconstruction of an ancient [[Athens|Athenian]] [[trireme]].]]\nIn warfare, '''ramming''' is a technique used in air, sea, and land combat. The term originated from [[battering ram]], a siege weapon used to bring down fortifications by hitting it with the force of the ram's momentum, and ultimately from male [[sheep]]. Thus, in warfare, ramming refers to hitting a target by running oneself into the target.\n\nToday, hand-held battering rams are one tool among many used by law enforcement and military personnel for [[door breaching]].<ref>[http://www.eacourier.com/articles/2008/09/02/news/doc48b74312b84bd650787578.txt Eastern Arizona Courier.

Includes winged decoration of the goddess of Victory.]]\n[[File:USS Caron (DD-970) collision.jpg|thumb|View from US destroyer ''Caron'' at the moment of ramming by Soviet light frigate (FFL 824) on 12 February 1988]]\nThe ram was commonly used in antiquity, and was an important part of the armament of the [[galley]]s of [[Imperial Rome]]. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used their [[trireme]] vessels for ramming as well. In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], rams were largely unknown, as the lack of a [[keel]] and the flat shape of the [[junk (ship)|junk]]'s bow was not conducive to the build of an elongated underwater spur.\n\nThe ram's first recorded use in modern times between major warships, however, was in the [[American Civil War]], at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]], when the armored [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] warship {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} rammed the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] frigate {{USS|Cumberland|1842|2}}, sinking her almost immediately.\n\nAnother significant success of the ram in wartime was at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|1866 battle of Lissa]], between [[Italy]] and [[Austria]]. The Italian ironclad ''Re d'Italia'' had been damaged aft by gunfire, and had no rudder. Lying helpless in the water, she was struck amidships by the Austrian ''Ferdinand Max'', the flagship of the Austrian Commander-in-Chief Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff|Tegetthoff]]. The Austrian ship retreated unharmed as the Italian vessel rolled over and sank.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Pacific]], the Peruvian ironclad {{ship||Huascar|ship|2}} repeatedly rammed the Chilean corvette {{ship||Esmeralda|1855|2}}, sinking the wooden steam- and wind-powered ship.\n\nDuring World War I, {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} rammed and sunk German submarine {{SMS|U-29|Germany|2|sub=y}}. This was an incidental use of the ship's bow, however. In 1918, the British [[troop ship]] [[RMS Olympic|HMT ''Olympic'']] rammed {{SMU|U-103}} in which the submarine sustained such heavy damage that its crew was forced to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] and abandon ship.\n\nIn World War II, naval ships often rammed other vessels, though this was often due to circumstances, as considerable damage could be caused to the attacking ship. The damage that lightly constructed [[destroyer]]s took from the tactic led to it being officially discouraged by the [[Royal Navy]] from early 1943, after {{HMS|Hesperus|H57|6}} was dry-docked for three months following sinking {{GS|U-357||2}} in December 1942 and {{HMS|Harvester|H19|6}} was torpedoed and sunk following damaging her propellers during the ramming of {{GS|U-444||2}} in March 1943. {{USS|Buckley|DE-51|6}} rammed {{GS|U-66|1940|2}}; and {{HMS|Easton}} rammed {{GS|U-458||2}}.\n\nOn 29 January 1943 the Japanese submarine {{Jsub|I-1|1924|2}} was rammed and wrecked by the [[New Zealand]] [[naval trawler]]s, {{HMNZS|Kiwi|T102|2}} and {{HMNZS|Moa|T233|2}} in shallow water at Kamimbo Bay, [[Guadalcanal]], during [[Operation Ke]]. The submarine of 2,135 tons was much larger and more heavily armed than the minesweeping trawlers of 607 tons each.\n\nOn 5 November 1942 the {{ship|Finnish submarine|Vetehinen}} rammed the Soviet submarine ''\u0429 305'' in the Sea of \u00c5land and sank it. ''Vetehinen'' was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact, ''Vetehinen'' launched a torpedo, which missed probably due being fired at too short distance. ''Vetehinen'' then opened fire with its deck guns and managed to damage the Soviet submarine, which by then had started an emergency dive. The captain of ''Vetehinen'', determined not to let the submarine escape, ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel, which at last was a success.\n\nDuring anti-submarine action, ramming was an alternative if the destroyer was too close to the surfaced submarine for her main guns to fire into the water. The tactic was used by the famous British anti-submarine specialist Captain [[Frederic John Walker]] from December 1941 to the end of the war.\n\nThe British destroyer {{HMS|Campbeltown|I42|6}} (formerly USS ''Buchanan'', supplied under [[Lend-Lease]]) was disguised as a German destroyer for the purpose of ramming the gates of the Normandie dry dock at [[St. Nazaire]] on 28 March 1942. This was to prevent the Normandie dock ever being used by the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}. It was the only dock on the Nazi-occupied Atlantic coast capable of repairing such a large vessel. The operation was a success, and a large explosive [[time bomb]] charge hidden in the bow of the ship exploded the next day, putting the dock out of commission for five years.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 1943, while returning from a \"[[Tokyo Express]]\" night reinforcement mission in the [[Solomon_Islands_campaign|Solomon Islands]], the Japanese destroyer ''[[Japanese_destroyer_Amagiri_(1930)|Amagiri]]'' spotted USN [[PT boats]] at a range of about 1,000 yards. Rather than open fire--and give away their position--the destroyer captain, Lieutenant Commander Kohei Hanami, turned to intercept and closed in the darkness at 30-knots.  [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|''PT-109'']] commanded by Lt. [[John F Kennedy]] was rammed and crushed by the slower less maneuverable Japanese destroyer.<ref>http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/05109.htm</ref> \n\nLt. Commander [[Gerard Broadmead Roope|Gerard Roope]], the captain of the [[G and H-class destroyer|G-class destroyer]] {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}, was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for the 1940 ramming of the German cruiser {{Ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} following a close-range action in bad weather off the Norwegian coast. More recent claims suggest that ''Admiral Hipper'' was actually attempting to ram ''Glowworm'' and the two ships simply collided.\n\nDuring the [[Cod Wars]] between Britain and Iceland, unarmed [[fishing trawlers]] found themselves opposed by Icelandic Coastguard vessels and converted trawlers. As well as [[Royal Navy]] coastguard vessels, Britain sent large, ocean-going [[tugboat|tugs]] and [[Frigate|frigates]] to protect them and there were numerous ramming incidents against both sides, sometimes with very serious consequences.\n\nIn 1988, two US naval ships, destroyer {{USS|Caron|DD-970|2}} and cruiser {{USS|Yorktown|CG-48|2}}, were lightly rammed by Soviet [[Mirka-class frigate|Mirka II]]-class light frigate (FFL 824) and [[Burevestnik-class frigate|Burevestnik]]-class frigate ''Bezzavetny'' (FFG 811) inside contested Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, near the port of [[Foros, Ukraine|Foros]]. None of the ships involved suffered significant damage.\n\nOn March 30, 2020, the Venezuelan patrol boat [[Venezuelan patrol boat Naiguat\u00e1|''Naiguat\u00e1'']] rammed the cruise ship ''[[RCGS Resolute]]'' after failing to damage it with a volley of gunfire. The ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was badly damaged from striking the strengthened hull of the ''Resolute'', built to break ice, and she sank shortly afterwards.\n\n==Air warfare==\n{{main|Aerial ramming}}{{Unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}\nRamming in air combat is a last-ditch tactic that was used when all else had failed. The ramming pilot could use his entire aircraft as a ram or he could try to destroy the enemy's controls using the propeller or wing to chop into the enemy's tail or wing. Ramming took place when a pilot ran out of ammunition, yet was still eager to destroy an enemy, or when his plane had already been damaged beyond saving. Most ramming occurred when the attacker's aircraft was economically, strategically, or tactically less valuable than the enemy's, such as by pilots flying obsolescent aircraft against superior ones or by single-engine aircraft against multiple-engine bombers.

The term originated from [[battering ram]], a siege weapon used to bring down fortifications by hitting it with the force of the ram's momentum, and ultimately from male [[sheep]]. Thus, in warfare, ramming refers to hitting a target by running oneself into the target.\n\nToday, hand-held battering rams are one tool among many used by law enforcement and military personnel for [[door breaching]].<ref>[http://www.eacourier.com/articles/2008/09/02/news/doc48b74312b84bd650787578.txt Eastern Arizona Courier.

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used their [[trireme]] vessels for ramming as well. In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], rams were largely unknown, as the lack of a [[keel]] and the flat shape of the [[junk (ship)|junk]]'s bow was not conducive to the build of an elongated underwater spur.\n\nThe ram's first recorded use in modern times between major warships, however, was in the [[American Civil War]], at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]], when the armored [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] warship {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} rammed the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] frigate {{USS|Cumberland|1842|2}}, sinking her almost immediately.\n\nAnother significant success of the ram in wartime was at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|1866 battle of Lissa]], between [[Italy]] and [[Austria]]. The Italian ironclad ''Re d'Italia'' had been damaged aft by gunfire, and had no rudder. Lying helpless in the water, she was struck amidships by the Austrian ''Ferdinand Max'', the flagship of the Austrian Commander-in-Chief Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff|Tegetthoff]]. The Austrian ship retreated unharmed as the Italian vessel rolled over and sank.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Pacific]], the Peruvian ironclad {{ship||Huascar|ship|2}} repeatedly rammed the Chilean corvette {{ship||Esmeralda|1855|2}}, sinking the wooden steam- and wind-powered ship.\n\nDuring World War I, {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} rammed and sunk German submarine {{SMS|U-29|Germany|2|sub=y}}. This was an incidental use of the ship's bow, however. In 1918, the British [[troop ship]] [[RMS Olympic|HMT ''Olympic'']] rammed {{SMU|U-103}} in which the submarine sustained such heavy damage that its crew was forced to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] and abandon ship.\n\nIn World War II, naval ships often rammed other vessels, though this was often due to circumstances, as considerable damage could be caused to the attacking ship. The damage that lightly constructed [[destroyer]]s took from the tactic led to it being officially discouraged by the [[Royal Navy]] from early 1943, after {{HMS|Hesperus|H57|6}} was dry-docked for three months following sinking {{GS|U-357||2}} in December 1942 and {{HMS|Harvester|H19|6}} was torpedoed and sunk following damaging her propellers during the ramming of {{GS|U-444||2}} in March 1943. {{USS|Buckley|DE-51|6}} rammed {{GS|U-66|1940|2}}; and {{HMS|Easton}} rammed {{GS|U-458||2}}.\n\nOn 29 January 1943 the Japanese submarine {{Jsub|I-1|1924|2}} was rammed and wrecked by the [[New Zealand]] [[naval trawler]]s, {{HMNZS|Kiwi|T102|2}} and {{HMNZS|Moa|T233|2}} in shallow water at Kamimbo Bay, [[Guadalcanal]], during [[Operation Ke]]. The submarine of 2,135 tons was much larger and more heavily armed than the minesweeping trawlers of 607 tons each.\n\nOn 5 November 1942 the {{ship|Finnish submarine|Vetehinen}} rammed the Soviet submarine ''\u0429 305'' in the Sea of \u00c5land and sank it. ''Vetehinen'' was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact, ''Vetehinen'' launched a torpedo, which missed probably due being fired at too short distance. ''Vetehinen'' then opened fire with its deck guns and managed to damage the Soviet submarine, which by then had started an emergency dive. The captain of ''Vetehinen'', determined not to let the submarine escape, ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel, which at last was a success.\n\nDuring anti-submarine action, ramming was an alternative if the destroyer was too close to the surfaced submarine for her main guns to fire into the water.

Leaving, she sees [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] at a table with a group of men. She pauses, and there is an awkward attempt at small talk. Finally leaving, she waves and calls, \"Toodle-oo!\" The men crudely comment on her, and Tony pretends she is an old girlfriend. She is mortified by her behavior, and acknowledges to her therapist, [[List of The Sopranos characters#Elliot Kupferberg|Dr. Elliot Kupferberg]], that in order to evade her responsibility as a therapist, she behaved like \"a ditsy young girl.\"\n\n[[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]] throws a party for a few friends in [[Livia Soprano|Livia]]'s house. When a lot of people turn up, there is drug abuse and heavy drinking. The police arrive. A police contact of Tony's alerts him. He finds Meadow drunk and drives her home. Her parents do not know how to punish her. She prompts them to withdraw her credit card for three weeks, although they will provide cash for necessities like gas. She walks away, smiling to herself.\n\nAt first, [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] defends Meadow, saying she is showing her independence. But when she sees the state of the house, she is furious. Tony and [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] tell her to stop interfering. Janice says she ought to leave, but she and Carmela later reconcile and she is persuaded to continue to stay at the house. Meadow overhears their argument. When Tony goes to the house to have the locks changed, Meadow is kneeling on the floor, scrubbing. Tony turns away, perplexed by this remorse.\n\nJackie Aprile's elder brother [[List of The Sopranos characters#Richie Aprile|Richie]] is released after ten years' imprisonment. He says he has changed, taken up meditation and learned yoga, but he cannot accept other changes: that a younger man, Tony, is boss, and that he does not immediately get the same benefits as before. When Tony says these things will come in time, Richie says, \"What's mine is not yours to give me.\" He demands payments from a former associate, [[List of The Sopranos characters#Soprano crime family|\"Beansie\" Gaeta]], now the proprietor of some pizzerias. Beansie refuses; Richie viciously assaults him. One night, he waits in a parking lot, draws his gun, and tells Beansie to show him proper respect. Beansie manages to escape. Later, thinking it is safe, he returns to his car. Richie drives up fast and rams into him; then, as he lies on the ground, drives over him. In the hospital, Beansie is told he may never walk again. Tony tells Richie emphatically, \"I'm the one who calls the shots,\" and if he does not show respect they \"have a problem, a bad one.\"\n\nRichie meets with [[Junior Soprano|Junior]], and says, \"I'm yours, Junior. Whatever, whoever. You just say it.\" He happens to meet Janice at a yoga class, and tries to revive the intimacy they had years ago.\n\n==First appearances==\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Richie Aprile|Richie Aprile]]''': The late Jackie Aprile, Sr.'s older brother, who is paroled from prison after a 10-year sentence.\n* '''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Peter \"Beansie\" Gaeta|Peter \"Beansie\" Gaeta]]''': a pizzeria owner and Mafia associate of Richie Aprile, Jackie Aprile, Sr., and [[Tony Soprano]].\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Elliot Kupferberg|Dr. Elliot Kupferberg]]''': Dr. Melfi's colleague and psychotherapist.\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|Dr. Douglas Schreck]]''': Junior Soprano's cardiologist.\n\n==Title reference==\n* \"[[Parting phrase|Toodle-oo]]\" is an informal form of \"good-bye\".

Leaving, she sees [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] at a table with a group of men. She pauses, and there is an awkward attempt at small talk. Finally leaving, she waves and calls, \"Toodle-oo!\" The men crudely comment on her, and Tony pretends she is an old girlfriend. She is mortified by her behavior, and acknowledges to her therapist, [[List of The Sopranos characters#Elliot Kupferberg|Dr. Elliot Kupferberg]], that in order to evade her responsibility as a therapist, she behaved like \"a ditsy young girl.\" \n\n[[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]] throws a party for a few friends in [[Livia Soprano|Livia]]'s house. When a lot of people turn up, there is drug abuse and heavy drinking. The police arrive. A police contact of Tony's alerts him. He finds Meadow drunk and drives her home. Her parents do not know how to punish her. She prompts them to withdraw her credit card for three weeks, although they will provide cash for necessities like gas. She walks away, smiling to herself.\n\nAt first, [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] defends Meadow, saying she is showing her independence. But when she sees the state of the house, she is furious. Tony and [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] tell her to stop interfering. Janice says she ought to leave, but she and Carmela later reconcile and she is persuaded to continue to stay at the house. Meadow overhears their argument. When Tony goes to the house to have the locks changed, Meadow is kneeling on the floor, scrubbing. Tony turns away, perplexed by this remorse.\n\nJackie Aprile's elder brother [[List of The Sopranos characters#Richie Aprile|Richie]] is released after ten years' imprisonment. He says he has changed, taken up meditation and learned yoga, but he cannot accept other changes: that a younger man, Tony, is boss, and that he does not immediately get the same benefits as before. When Tony says these things will come in time, Richie says, \"What's mine is not yours to give me.\" He demands payments from a former associate, [[List of The Sopranos characters#Soprano crime family|\"Beansie\" Gaeta]], now the proprietor of some pizzerias. Beansie refuses; Richie viciously assaults him. One night, he waits in a parking lot, draws his gun, and tells Beansie to show him proper respect. Beansie manages to escape. Later, thinking it is safe, he returns to his car. Richie drives up fast and rams into him; then, as he lies on the ground, drives over him. In the hospital, Beansie is told he may never walk again. Tony tells Richie emphatically, \"I'm the one who calls the shots,\" and if he does not show respect they \"have a problem, a bad one.\"\n\nRichie meets with [[Junior Soprano|Junior]], and says, \"I'm yours, Junior. Whatever, whoever. You just say it.\" He happens to meet Janice at a yoga class, and tries to revive the intimacy they had years ago.\n\n==First appearances==\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Richie Aprile|Richie Aprile]]''': The late Jackie Aprile, Sr.'s older brother, who is paroled from prison after a 10-year sentence.\n* '''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Peter \"Beansie\" Gaeta|Peter \"Beansie\" Gaeta]]''': a pizzeria owner and Mafia associate of Richie Aprile, Jackie Aprile, Sr., and [[Tony Soprano]].\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Elliot Kupferberg|Dr. Elliot Kupferberg]]''': Dr. Melfi's colleague and psychotherapist.\n* '''[[List of The Sopranos characters#Friends and family|Dr. Douglas Schreck]]''': Junior Soprano's cardiologist.\n\n==Title reference==\n* \"[[Parting phrase|Toodle-oo]]\" is an informal form of \"good-bye\".

Specific chemical substances such as [[oxytocin]] are studied in the context of their roles in producing human experiences and behaviors that are associated with [[love]].\n\n==Evolutionary psychology==\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] has proposed several explanations for love. Monkey infants and children are for a very long time dependent on parental help. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote mutual parental support of children for an extended time period. Another is that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s may cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase risks during [[childbirth]]. This would favor exclusive long-term relationships reducing the risk of contracting an STD.<ref>The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell B. and [[Bruce J. Ellis]].</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of evolutionary psychology the experiences and behaviors associated with love can be investigated in terms of how they have been shaped by human evolution.<ref>\"Evolutionary psychology: the emperor's new paradigm\" by D. J. Buller in ''Trends Cogn. Sci.'' (2005) Volume 9 pages 277-283.</ref> For example, it has been suggested that human language has been selected during evolution as a type of \"mating signal\" that allows potential mates to judge reproductive fitness.<ref>[http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000137/ The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515134230/http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000137/ |date=15 May 2007 }} by Geoffrey F. Miller in ''Psycoloquy'' (2001) 12,#8.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Miller described evolutionary psychology as a starting place for further research: \"Cognitive neuroscience could try to localize courtship adaptations in the brain. Most importantly, we need much better observations concerning real-life human courtship, including the measurable aspects of courtship that influence mate choice, the reproductive (or at least sexual) consequences of individual variation in those aspects, and the social-cognitive and emotional mechanisms of falling in love.\" Since [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|Darwin's]] time there have been similar speculations about the [[evolution]] of human interest in music also as a potential signaling system for attracting and judging the fitness of potential mates.<ref>[http://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/new_papers2/miller%202000%20music.DOC Evolution of human music through sexual selection] by G.

Brown (Eds.), ''The origins of music'', MIT Press, (2000). pp. 329-360.</ref> It has been suggested that the human capacity to experience love has been evolved as a signal to potential mates that the partner will be a good parent and be likely to help pass genes to future generations.<ref>[http://www.duke.edu/~haufe/mate.pdf Sexual selection and mate choice in evolutionary psychology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920210137/http://www.duke.edu/~haufe/mate.pdf |date=20 September 2011 }} by C.

These three behavioural repertoires appear to be based on brain systems that are largely distinct yet interrelated, and they interact in specific ways to orchestrate reproduction, using both hormones and monoamines.&nbsp;... Animal studies indicate that elevated activity of dopaminergic pathways can stimulate a cascade of reactions, including the release of testosterone and oestrogen (Wenkstern et al. 1993; Kawashima &Takagi 1994; Ferrari & Giuliana 1995; Hull et al. 1995, 1997, 2002; Szezypka et al. 1998; Wersinger & Rissman 2000). Likewise, increasing levels of testosterone and oestrogen promote dopamine release&nbsp;...This positive relationship between elevated activity of central dopamine, elevated sex steroids and elevated sexual arousal and sexual performance (Herbert 1996; Fiorino et al. 1997; Liu et al. 1998; Pfaff 2005) also occurs in humans (Walker et al. 1993; Clayton et al. 2000; Heaton 2000).&nbsp;... This parental attachment system has been associated with the activity of the neuropeptides, oxytocin (OT) in the nucleus accumbens and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the ventral pallidum&nbsp;...

Specific chemical substances such as [[oxytocin]] are studied in the context of their roles in producing human experiences and behaviors that are associated with [[love]].\n\n==Evolutionary psychology==\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] has proposed several explanations for love. Monkey infants and children are for a very long time dependent on parental help. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote mutual parental support of children for an extended time period. Another is that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s may cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase risks during [[childbirth]]. This would favor exclusive long-term relationships reducing the risk of contracting an STD.<ref>The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2005.

Ellis]].</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of evolutionary psychology the experiences and behaviors associated with love can be investigated in terms of how they have been shaped by human evolution.<ref>\"Evolutionary psychology: the emperor's new paradigm\" by D. J. Buller in ''Trends Cogn. Sci.'' (2005) Volume 9 pages 277-283.</ref> For example, it has been suggested that human language has been selected during evolution as a type of \"mating signal\" that allows potential mates to judge reproductive fitness.<ref>[http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000137/ The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515134230/http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000137/ |date=15 May 2007 }} by Geoffrey F.

Most importantly, we need much better observations concerning real-life human courtship, including the measurable aspects of courtship that influence mate choice, the reproductive (or at least sexual) consequences of individual variation in those aspects, and the social-cognitive and emotional mechanisms of falling in love.\" Since [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|Darwin's]] time there have been similar speculations about the [[evolution]] of human interest in music also as a potential signaling system for attracting and judging the fitness of potential mates.<ref>[http://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/new_papers2/miller%202000%20music.DOC Evolution of human music through sexual selection] by G.

These three behavioural repertoires appear to be based on brain systems that are largely distinct yet interrelated, and they interact in specific ways to orchestrate reproduction, using both hormones and monoamines.&nbsp;... Animal studies indicate that elevated activity of dopaminergic pathways can stimulate a cascade of reactions, including the release of testosterone and oestrogen (Wenkstern et al. 1993; Kawashima &Takagi 1994; Ferrari & Giuliana 1995; Hull et al. 1995, 1997, 2002; Szezypka et al. 1998; Wersinger & Rissman 2000).
