After FCW folded in 2012, Leppan wrestled in its successor [[WWE NXT|NXT]] under the name Adam Rose, before moving to WWE's main roster in early 2014. After a series of scandals, Leppan was released by the promotion in April 2016 and wrestled in the international independent circuit until his retirement in June 2019.\n\n== Early life ==\nAccording to his wife, Adam wanted to wrestle from the age of 10. A school drop-out, Leppan ran away from home when he was 14, then spent two years living on the streets and in abandoned buildings. Leppan later described that he had been \"spiraling out of control\" during that period, which was full of violence and alcohol, and only the thought of becoming a wrestler had helped him escape. Leppan also said that he had rejected being part of a family despite having loving parents. Leppan's mother later successfully managed to entice Leppan to return home to Johannesburg from [[Durban]] with the prospect of beginning wrestling classes.<ref name=E60>{{Cite episode |title= WWE: Behind the Curtain |series=E:60 |series-link=E:60 |network=[[ESPN]] |date=5 May 2015  |last1=Houser |first1=Ben |last2=Schaap |first2=Jeremy |last3=McCormick |first3= Matt}}</ref><ref name=Moon>{{cite news|last1=Mooneyham|first1=Mike|title=Adam Rose's inspirational story: From the streets to WWE|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20150510/PC20/150519904|newspaper=[[The Post and Courier]]|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\n=== Independent circuit (1995\u20132010) ===\nLeppan made his professional wrestling debut in 1995 at the age of 15<ref name=\"Fishman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/29/2774936/south-african-friends-looking.html |title=South African friends looking to reunite in WWE |date=29 April 2012 |last=Fishman |first=Scott |accessdate=30 April 2012 |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67JcIIk6E?url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/29/2774936/south-african-friends-looking.html |archivedate=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name=Moon/> He eventually wrestled on the South African [[independent circuit]] as Z-Max, a character based on ''[[The Karate Kid]]'' .<ref name=E60/>\n\nHe worked in Philadelphia with [[Justin Gabriel|Paul Lloyd Jr.]], known as the tag team Pure Juice.

After FCW folded in 2012, Leppan wrestled in its successor [[WWE NXT|NXT]] under the name Adam Rose, before moving to WWE's main roster in early 2014. After a series of scandals, Leppan was released by the promotion in April 2016 and wrestled in the international independent circuit until his retirement in June 2019.\n\n== Early life ==\nAccording to his wife, Adam wanted to wrestle from the age of 10. A school drop-out, Leppan ran away from home when he was 14, then spent two years living on the streets and in abandoned buildings. Leppan later described that he had been \"spiraling out of control\" during that period, which was full of violence and alcohol, and only the thought of becoming a wrestler had helped him escape. Leppan also said that he had rejected being part of a family despite having loving parents. Leppan's mother later successfully managed to entice Leppan to return home to Johannesburg from [[Durban]] with the prospect of beginning wrestling classes.<ref name=E60>{{Cite episode |title= WWE: Behind the Curtain |series=E:60 |series-link=E:60 |network=[[ESPN]] |date=5 May 2015  |last1=Houser |first1=Ben |last2=Schaap |first2=Jeremy |last3=McCormick |first3= Matt}}</ref><ref name=Moon>{{cite news|last1=Mooneyham|first1=Mike|title=Adam Rose's inspirational story: From the streets to WWE|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20150510/PC20/150519904|newspaper=[[The Post and Courier]]|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\n=== Independent circuit (1995\u20132010) ===\nLeppan made his professional wrestling debut in 1995 at the age of 15<ref name=\"Fishman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/29/2774936/south-african-friends-looking.html |title=South African friends looking to reunite in WWE |date=29 April 2012 |last=Fishman |first=Scott |accessdate=30 April 2012 |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67JcIIk6E?url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/29/2774936/south-african-friends-looking.html |archivedate=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name=Moon/> He eventually wrestled on the South African [[independent circuit]] as Z-Max, a character based on ''[[The Karate Kid]]'' .<ref name=E60/>\n\nHe worked in Philadelphia with [[Justin Gabriel|Paul Lloyd Jr.]], known as the tag team Pure Juice.

His LEDs were Schottky diodes formed by point contacts or silver paint; junction diodes were not available. He worked at liquid nitrogen temperature, where much less of the recombination energy is lost to nonradiative processes than at room temperature, and observed peak emission close to the band gaps of the compounds, confirming that the light was recombination radiation. His LEDs emitted enough infrared light to play music from a phonograph record, but the light wasn\u2019t visible, and scientists\u2019 interest in GaAs remained mainly focused on fast electronic devices. }}</ref> The 2000 and 2014 [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Prizes in Physics]] were awarded for further advances in closely related fields.<ref name=Gross />\n\nBraunstein was raised in New York City.

GaAs, GaSb, and InP are examples of [[III-V semiconductors]]. The III-V semiconductors absorb and emit light much more strongly than silicon, which is the best-known semiconductor.

His LEDs were Schottky diodes formed by point contacts or silver paint; junction diodes were not available. He worked at liquid nitrogen temperature, where much less of the recombination energy is lost to nonradiative processes than at room temperature, and observed peak emission close to the band gaps of the compounds, confirming that the light was recombination radiation. His LEDs emitted enough infrared light to play music from a phonograph record, but the light wasn\u2019t visible, and scientists\u2019 interest in GaAs remained mainly focused on fast electronic devices. }}</ref> The 2000 and 2014 [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Prizes in Physics]] were awarded for further advances in closely related fields.<ref name=Gross />\n\nBraunstein was raised in New York City.
