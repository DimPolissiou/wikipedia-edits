A{{music|b}} and F serve as upper leading-tones back to G and E, respectively, rather than B{{music|natural}} and F serving as the lower and upper leading-tones to C and E.\n\n==Application==\nIn jazz, chord substitutions can be applied by [[composer]]s, [[arranger]]s, or performers. Composers may use chord substitutions when they are basing a new jazz tune on an existing chord progression from an old [[jazz standard]] or a song from a musical; arrangers for a [[big band]] or jazz orchestra may use chord substitutions in their arrangement of a tune, to add harmonic interest or give a different \"feel\" to a song; and instrumentalists may use chord substitutions in their performance of a song.\n\nJazz \"[[comping]]\" instruments (piano, guitar, organ, vibes) often use chord substitution to add harmonic interest to a jazz tune with slow harmonic change. For example, the jazz standard chord progression of \"[[rhythm changes]]\" uses a simple eight bar chord progression in the bridge with the chords III7, VI7, II7, V7; in the key of B{{music|b}}, these chords are D7, G7, C7, and F7 (each for two bars).  A jazz guitarist might add a \"ii-V7\" aspect to each chord, which would make the progression: \"a minor, D7, d minor, G7, g minor, C7, c minor, F7. Alternatively, tritone substitutions could be applied to the progression.\n\n{{quote|Note that both the back door progression and {{music|#}}II{{music|dim}}7, when substituted for V7, introduces notes that seem wrong or anachronistic to the V7 chord (such as the [[eleventh|fourth]] and the [[major seventh]]). They work only because the ''given'' instances of those chords are familiar to the ear; hence when an improviser uses them against the V7, the listener's ear hears the given precedents for the event, instead of the conflict with the V7.|Coker (1997), p.82<ref name=\"Coker\"/>}}\n\nTheoretically, any chord can substitute for any other chord, as long as the new chord supports the melody. In practice, though, only a few options sound musically and stylistically appropriate to a given melody. This technique is used in music such as [[bebop]] or [[jazz fusion|fusion]] to provide more sophisticated harmony, or to create a new-sounding re-harmonization of an old [[jazz standard]].\n\nJazz soloists and improvisers also use chord substitutions to help them add interest to their improvised solos. Jazz soloing instruments that can play chords, such as jazz guitar, piano, and organ players may use substitute chords to develop a [[chord solo]] over an existing jazz tune with slow-moving harmonies. Also, jazz improvisers may use chord substitution as a mental framework to help them create more interesting-sounding solos. For example, a saxophonist playing an improvised solo over the basic \"rhythm changes\" bridge (in B{{music|b}}, this is \"D7, G7, C7, and F7\", each for two bars) might think of a more complex progression that uses substitute chords (e.g., \"a minor, D7, d minor, G7, g minor, C7, c minor, F7). In doing so, this implies the substitute chords over the original progression, which adds interest for listeners.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Coltrane changes]]\n*[[Mu chord]]\n*[[Passing chord]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*R., Ken (2012).

A{{music|b}} and F serve as upper leading-tones back to G and E, respectively, rather than B{{music|natural}} and F serving as the lower and upper leading-tones to C and E.\n\n==Application==\nIn jazz, chord substitutions can be applied by [[composer]]s, [[arranger]]s, or performers. Composers may use chord substitutions when they are basing a new jazz tune on an existing chord progression from an old [[jazz standard]] or a song from a musical; arrangers for a [[big band]] or jazz orchestra may use chord substitutions in their arrangement of a tune, to add harmonic interest or give a different \"feel\" to a song; and instrumentalists may use chord substitutions in their performance of a song.\n\nJazz \"[[comping]]\" instruments (piano, guitar, organ, vibes) often use chord substitution to add harmonic interest to a jazz tune with slow harmonic change. For example, the jazz standard chord progression of \"[[rhythm changes]]\" uses a simple eight bar chord progression in the bridge with the chords III7, VI7, II7, V7; in the key of B{{music|b}}, these chords are D7, G7, C7, and F7 (each for two bars).  A jazz guitarist might add a \"ii-V7\" aspect to each chord, which would make the progression: \"a minor, D7, d minor, G7, g minor, C7, c minor, F7. Alternatively, tritone substitutions could be applied to the progression.\n\n{{quote|Note that both the back door progression and {{music|#}}II{{music|dim}}7, when substituted for V7, introduces notes that seem wrong or anachronistic to the V7 chord (such as the [[eleventh|fourth]] and the [[major seventh]]). They work only because the ''given'' instances of those chords are familiar to the ear; hence when an improviser uses them against the V7, the listener's ear hears the given precedents for the event, instead of the conflict with the V7.|Coker (1997), p.82<ref name=\"Coker\"/>}}\n\nTheoretically, any chord can substitute for any other chord, as long as the new chord supports the melody. In practice, though, only a few options sound musically and stylistically appropriate to a given melody. This technique is used in music such as [[bebop]] or [[jazz fusion|fusion]] to provide more sophisticated harmony, or to create a new-sounding re-harmonization of an old [[jazz standard]].\n\nJazz soloists and improvisers also use chord substitutions to help them add interest to their improvised solos. Jazz soloing instruments that can play chords, such as jazz guitar, piano, and organ players may use substitute chords to develop a [[chord solo]] over an existing jazz tune with slow-moving harmonies. Also, jazz improvisers may use chord substitution as a mental framework to help them create more interesting-sounding solos. For example, a saxophonist playing an improvised solo over the basic \"rhythm changes\" bridge (in B{{music|b}}, this is \"D7, G7, C7, and F7\", each for two bars) might think of a more complex progression that uses substitute chords (e.g., \"a minor, D7, d minor, G7, g minor, C7, c minor, F7). In doing so, this implies the substitute chords over the original progression, which adds interest for listeners.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Coltrane changes]]\n*[[Mu chord]]\n*[[Passing chord]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*R., Ken (2012).

Partnered with [[Lee Wan Wah]], they advance to the semi finals stage, but lost to South Korean pair [[Lee Dong-soo]] and [[Yoo Yong-sung]] in the rubber game. The duo played in the bronze medal match against another South Korean [[Ha Tae-kwon]] and [[Kim Dong-moon]], but lost in straight game with the score 2\u201315, 8\u201315.\n\nIn [[Badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens]], Choong and Lee had a bye in the first round and defeated [[Pramote Teerawiwatana]] and [[Tesana Panvisvas]] of Thailand in the second. In the quarterfinals, they lost to [[Lee Dong-soo]] & [[Yoo Yong-sung]] of South Korea 11\u201315, 15\u201311, 15\u20139.\n\nIn [[Badminton at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing]], Choong and Lee competed as the fourth seeded, however they lost to eventual bronze medalist from South Korea [[Lee Jae-jin (badminton)|Lee Jae-jin]] and [[Hwang Ji-man]] in the first round with the score 22\u201320, 13\u201321, 16\u201321.\n\nChoong played in the [[2008 Thomas Cup]] series (men's world team championship) for the [[Malaysia national badminton team|Malaysian]] team. In the quarter-final, where Malaysia faced Japan, Choong paired with [[Koo Kien Keat]] to defeat [[Shuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Shintaro Ikeda]] 21\u201313, 21\u201311. However, due to illness Choong could not take part in the semi-final showdown against defending champion [[China national badminton team|China]] which Malaysia narrowly lost 2\u20133.\n\nAfter a six-year relationship with [[China]]'s doubles star [[Zhang Jiewen]], Choong and Zhang were married in January 2010. The wedding reception was celebrated on 1 May 2010 in Genting Highlands. They plan to take a honeymoon in Paris, where the 2010 Badminton World Championships will be held.<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=/2010/5/2/sports/6175177&sec=sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505105650/http://thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=%2F2010%2F5%2F2%2Fsports%2F6175177&sec=sports |date=5 May 2010 }}, Paris perfect for Tan Fook's honeymoon and last fling at glory, The Star Online Sports</ref> They have two children together.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/badminton/2018/06/26/former-player-tan-fook-hopes-to-fulfil-dream-by-producing-world-and-olympic-champs/|title=Badminton: Tan Fook hopes to fulfil dream by producing world and Olympic champs {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\n=== World Championships ===\n''Men's doubles''\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!Year\n!Venue\n!Partner\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Result\n|- style=\"background:#F3E6D7\"\n| align=\"center\" |[[2007 BWF World Championships \u2013 Men's Doubles|2007]]\n| align=\"left\" |[[Putra Indoor Stadium]], [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]\n| align=\"left\" |{{Flagicon|MAS}} [[Lee Wan Wah]]\n| align=\"left\" |{{Flagicon|INA}} [[Markis Kido]]<br>{{Flagicon|INA}} [[Hendra Setiawan]]\n| align=\"left\" |20-22, 26-28\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:white\" |[[File:Med_3.png|Bronze]] '''Bronze'''\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#F3E6D7\"\n| align=\"center\" |[[2001 IBF World Championships \u2013 Men's Doubles|2001]]\n| align=\"left\" |[[Palacio Municipal de Deportes San Pablo|Palacio de Deportes de San Pablo]], [[Seville, Spain]]\n| align=\"left\" |{{Flagicon|MAS}} Lee Wan Wah\n| align=\"left\" |{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Ha Tae-kwon]]<br>{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Kim Dong-moon]]\n| align=\"left\" |7-15, 15-9, 10-15\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:white\" |[[File:Med_3.png|Bronze]] '''Bronze'''\n|-\n|}\n\n=== World Cup ===\n''Men's doubles''\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!

Partnered with [[Lee Wan Wah]], they advance to the semi finals stage, but lost to South Korean pair [[Lee Dong-soo]] and [[Yoo Yong-sung]] in the rubber game. The duo played in the bronze medal match against another South Korean [[Ha Tae-kwon]] and [[Kim Dong-moon]], but lost in straight game with the score 2\u201315, 8\u201315.\n\nIn [[Badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens]], Choong and Lee had a bye in the first round and defeated [[Pramote Teerawiwatana]] and [[Tesana Panvisvas]] of Thailand in the second. In the quarterfinals, they lost to [[Lee Dong-soo]] & [[Yoo Yong-sung]] of South Korea 11\u201315, 15\u201311, 15\u20139.\n\nIn [[Badminton at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing]], Choong and Lee competed as the fourth seeded, however they lost to eventual bronze medalist from South Korea [[Lee Jae-jin (badminton)|Lee Jae-jin]] and [[Hwang Ji-man]] in the first round with the score 22\u201320, 13\u201321, 16\u201321.\n\nChoong played in the [[2008 Thomas Cup]] series (men's world team championship) for the [[Malaysia national badminton team|Malaysian]] team. In the quarter-final, where Malaysia faced Japan, Choong paired with [[Koo Kien Keat]] to defeat [[Shuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Shintaro Ikeda]] 21\u201313, 21\u201311. However, due to illness Choong could not take part in the semi-final showdown against defending champion [[China national badminton team|China]] which Malaysia narrowly lost 2\u20133.\n\nAfter a six-year relationship with [[China]]'s doubles star [[Zhang Jiewen]], Choong and Zhang were married in January 2010.

The enemy broke off the action and headed North, to lead the Glowworm on to his supporting forces. The Commanding Officer, whilst correctly appreciating the intentions of the enemy, at once gave chase.

Five torpedoes were fired and later the remaining five, but without success. The Glowworm was badly hit; one gun was out of action and her speed was much reduced, but with the other three guns still firing she closed and rammed the Admiral Hipper.

Because the process yields [[Equivalent_(chemistry)|equivalent]] amounts of chlorine and sodium hydroxide (two moles of sodium hydroxide per mole of chlorine), it is necessary to find a use for these products in the same proportion. For every mole of chlorine produced, one mole of hydrogen is produced. Much of this hydrogen is used to produce [[hydrochloric acid]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], or is combusted for power and/or steam production.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[R. Norris Shreve]]|author2=[[Joseph Brink]]|title=Chemical Process Industries|date=1977|page=219|edition=4th|ASIN=B000OFVCCG}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cell room of a chlorine-caustic soda plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920]]\n\n==Process systems==\nThree production methods are in use. While the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] cell method produces chlorine-free sodium hydroxide, the use of several tonnes of mercury leads to serious environmental problems. In a normal production cycle a few hundred pounds of mercury per year are emitted, which accumulate in the environment. Additionally, the chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced via the mercury-cell chloralkali process are themselves contaminated with trace amounts of mercury. The membrane and diaphragm method use no mercury, but the sodium hydroxide contains chlorine, which must be removed.\n\nThe performance of these devices is governed by the considerations of [[electrochemical engineering]].\n\n===Membrane cell===\nThe most common chloralkali process involves the electrolysis of [[aqueous]] [[sodium chloride]] (a brine) in a [[Sodium hydroxide#Production|membrane cell]]. A membrane, such as one made from [[Nafion#Chlor-alkali_production_cell_membrane|Nafion]], Flemion or Aciplex, is used to prevent the reaction between the chlorine and hydroxide ions.\n\n[[Image:Chloralkali_membrane.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|Basic membrane cell used in the [[electrolysis]] of brine. At the anode ('''A'''), chloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>) is oxidized to chlorine. The ion-selective membrane ('''B''') allows the counterion Na+ to freely flow across, but prevents anions such as hydroxide (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) and chloride from diffusing across. At the cathode ('''C'''), water is reduced to hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The net process is the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of NaCl into industrially useful products sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and chlorine gas.]]\n\nSaturated brine is passed into the first chamber of the cell where the [[chloride]] ions are [[redox|oxidised]] at the [[anode]], losing electrons to become [[chlorine]] gas ('''A''' in figure):\n:2Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + 2[[electron|e<sup>\u2212</sup>]]\n\nAt the [[cathode]], positive [[hydrogen ion]]s pulled from water molecules are [[redox|reduced]] by the electrons provided by the electrolytic current, to hydrogen gas, releasing [[hydroxide]] ions into the solution ('''C''' in figure):\n:2{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub> + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe ion-permeable [[ion exchange membrane]] at the center of the cell allows the [[sodium]] ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) to pass to the second chamber where they react with the hydroxide ions to produce [[caustic soda]] (NaOH) ('''B''' in figure).<ref name = Du/> The overall reaction for the electrolysis of brine is thus:\n:2NaCl + 2{{chem|H|2|O}} \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + {{chem|H|2}} + 2NaOH\n\n===Diaphragm cell===\nIn the diaphragm cell process, there are two compartments separated by a permeable diaphragm, often made of [[asbestos|asbestos fibers]]. Brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows into the cathode compartment. Similarly to the Membrane Cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode to produce chlorine, and at the cathode, water is split into caustic soda and hydrogen. The diaphragm prevents the reaction of the caustic soda with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation.\n\n===Mercury cell===\n{{main|Castner\u2013Kellner process}}\n[[File:HgNaOHElectrolysis.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Mercury cell for chloralkali process]]\n\nIn the mercury-cell process, also known as the [[Castner\u2013Kellner process]], a saturated brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a [[Sodium amalgam|sodium-mercury amalgam]] with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the electrolytic cell. Chlorine is produced at the anode and bubbles out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about [[mercury poisoning]] from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see [[Ontario Minamata disease]]) and Japan (see [[Minamata disease]]).\n\n==Unpartitioned cell==\nWithout a membrane, the chlorine and hydroxide ions react, and the chlorine [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to form chloride and [[hypochlorite]] ions:\n:{{chem|Cl|2}} + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + ClO<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nAbove about 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[chlorate]] can be formed:\n:3{{chem|Cl|2}} + 6OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 5Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|ClO|3}}<sup>\u2212</sup> + 3{{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nIf current is interrupted while the cathode is submerged, cathodes that are attacked by hypochlorites, such as those made from stainless steel, will [[corrosion|dissolve]] in unpartitioned cells.\n\nIf producing hydrogen and oxygen gases is not a priority, the addition of 0.18% [[Sodium chromate|sodium]] or [[potassium chromate]] to the electrolyte will improve the efficiency of producing the other products.<ref name=\"Thom1911\">{{cite book |title=Applied Electrochemistry |author=Thompson, M. de Kay |publisher=The MacMillan Company |year=1911 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom/page/89 89]-90 |url=https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom}}</ref>\n\n==Electrodes==\nDue to the corrosive nature of chlorine production, the anode (where the chlorine is formed) must be non-reactive and has been made from platinum metal<ref name=\"Faraday1849\">{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |year=1849 |title=Experimental Researches In Electricity |volume=1 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14986/14986-h/14986-h.htm |location=London |publisher=The University of London |author-link=Michael Faraday}}</ref>, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday's time)<ref name=\"Faraday1849\" />, platinized titanium.<ref name=\"Land1972\">{{cite journal |title=Anodic chlorate formation on platinized titanium |author=Landolt, D.; Ibl, N. |journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=201-210 |publisher=Chapman and Hall Ltd. |doi=10.1007/BF02354977}}</ref> A [[Mixed_metal_oxide_electrode|mixed metal oxide clad titanium anode]] (also called a dimensionally stable anode) is the industrial standard today.

The diaphragm prevents the reaction of the caustic soda with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation.\n\n===Mercury cell===\n{{main|Castner\u2013Kellner process}}\n[[File:HgNaOHElectrolysis.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Mercury cell for chloralkali process]]\n\nIn the mercury-cell process, also known as the [[Castner\u2013Kellner process]], a saturated brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a [[Sodium amalgam|sodium-mercury amalgam]] with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the electrolytic cell. Chlorine is produced at the anode and bubbles out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about [[mercury poisoning]] from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see [[Ontario Minamata disease]]) and Japan (see [[Minamata disease]]).\n\n==Unpartitioned cell==\nWithout a membrane, the chlorine and hydroxide ions react, and the chlorine [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to form chloride and [[hypochlorite]] ions:\n:{{chem|Cl|2}} + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + ClO<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nAbove about 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[chlorate]] can be formed:\n:3{{chem|Cl|2}} + 6OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 5Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|ClO|3}}<sup>\u2212</sup> + 3{{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nIf current is interrupted while the cathode is submerged, cathodes that are attacked by hypochlorites, such as those made from stainless steel, will [[corrosion|dissolve]] in unpartitioned cells.\n\nIf producing hydrogen and oxygen gases is not a priority, the addition of 0.18% [[Sodium chromate|sodium]] or [[potassium chromate]] to the electrolyte will improve the efficiency of producing the other products.<ref name=\"Thom1911\">{{cite book |title=Applied Electrochemistry |author=Thompson, M. de Kay |publisher=The MacMillan Company |year=1911 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom/page/89 89]-90 |url=https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom}}</ref>\n\n==Electrodes==\nDue to the corrosive nature of chlorine production, the anode (where the chlorine is formed) must be non-reactive and has been made from platinum metal<ref name=\"Faraday1849\">{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |year=1849 |title=Experimental Researches In Electricity |volume=1 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14986/14986-h/14986-h.htm |location=London |publisher=The University of London |author-link=Michael Faraday}}</ref>, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday's time)<ref name=\"Faraday1849\" />, platinized titanium<ref name=\"Land1972\">{{cite journal |title=Anodic chlorate formation on platinized titanium |author=Landolt, D.; Ibl, N. |journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=201-210 |publisher=Chapman and Hall Ltd. |doi=10.1007/BF02354977}}</ref>.

The cathode (where hydroxide forms) can be made from unalloyed titanium, graphite, or a more easily oxidized metal such as stainless steel or [[nickel]].\n\n==Laboratory procedure==\nElectrolysis can be done with beakers, one containing a brine solution (salt water) and one containing pure water connected by a [[salt bridge]]. Anodes are made ideally from [[platinum group metal]]s, which resist corrosion.

The [[Mystic River Bascule Bridge]] crosses the river in the center of the village.  According to the Mystic River Historical Society, the name \"Mystic\" is derived from the Pequot term \"missi-tuk\", describing a large river whose waters are driven into waves by tides or wind.

Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century. (Leigh Fought, 2007. ''A History of Mystic, Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town'' p. 13).</ref> lived in this portion of southeastern [[Connecticut]]. They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007). The Society of Colonial War in the State of Connecticut.  Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

Morgan (ship)|Charles W. Morgan]]''. The village is located on the Mystic River, which flows into [[Long Island Sound]], providing access to the sea. The [[Mystic River Bascule Bridge]] crosses the river in the center of the village.  According to the Mystic River Historical Society, the name \"Mystic\" is derived from the Pequot term \"missi-tuk\", describing a large river whose waters are driven into waves by tides or wind. The population was 4,205 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Mystic CDP, Connecticut| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Pequot War|Mystic massacre}}\n{{One source|section|date=September 2016}}\nBefore the 17th century, the [[Pequot people]]<ref>For many years, historians believed that they migrated in the 16th century from eastern New York. Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century. (Leigh Fought, 2007. ''A History of Mystic, Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town'' p. 13).</ref> lived in this portion of southeastern [[Connecticut]]. They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007). The Society of Colonial War in the State of Connecticut.  Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

He attended the Methodist Primary School, Enugu, and the College of the Immaculate Conception (CIC), also in Enugu. He is a graduate of the College of Medicine, University of Nigeria (Enugu Campus). He had his post-graduate training in the State University of New York and the Inter-faith Medical Center/Down State Medical Center, Brooklyn New York (Obstetrics and Gynecology).

He was a maternal and fetal medicine specialist with the Maternal and Fetal Medicine Associates, Principal Practicing Group, Orlando, Florida. \n\n'''Professional Societies''': \nHe belonged to a number of professional societies such as the Society for Perinatal Obstetricians, American Society for Cell Biology, Society for Gynecologic Investigations, American Institute for Ultrasound in Medicine, and Licensure of California, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Florida and District of Columbia. He is a member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Enugu State. \n\n==Political career==\nDr. Nnamani\u2019s first foray in national politics was his election as the National President of the Nigerian Medical Students Association (NIMSA). He was elected Governor of Enugu State of Nigeria and re-elected for a second term in 2003. His eight years tenure witnessed many groundbreaking projects including the sprawling new permanent campus of the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT), the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital and College of Medicine at Parklane, Enugu, the Enugu Campus of the Nigerian Law School, the Ebeano Tunnel, dualization of Rangers Avenue and Chime Avenue, opening of a new route linking Nza Street and Chime Avenue in Enugu, the new State Judiciary headquarters, the International Conference Centre project, the Enugu State Building in Abuja, amongst others.\n\nHe was first elected to the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria representing the Enugu East Senatorial District and served from 2007 to 2011. He  re-contested for the seat in the April 2011 elections, this time on the platform of the People for Democratic Change (PDC), but lost in controversial circumstances. He vied for the same seat again in the 2015 elections and was widely projected to win when, to the consternation of the populace, his main challenger was surprisingly declared as the winner, this time provoking spontaneous mass protests that rocked the capital city of Enugu for days. \n\n==Return to the Senate==\n\nFollowing overtures from the Enugu State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he returned to the party in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://punchng.com/ex-enugu-governor-nnamani-ditches-pdc-returns-to-pdp/ |title=Ex-Enugu governor, Nnamani, ditches PDC, returns to PDP |publisher=Punch |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref> Ahead of the 2019 general elections, he rested mounting speculations over his political future when he picked the senatorial nomination form of the party for Enugu East Senatorial District. At the senatorial primary election held on 2 October 2018 he polled 601 votes to easily beat six other contestants, amongst them the then incumbent Senator Gilbert Nnaji, who polled 69 votes. He soon embarked on a vigorous street-to-street campaign that enlivened Enugu metropolis as the people surged out to cheer him up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theeasterner.com.ng/enugu-goes-abuzz-as-chimaroke-flags-off-campaign/ |title=Enugu goes abuzz as Chimaroke flags off campaign |publisher=The Easterner |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref> He also took his campaign to all the development centers in the 6 local government councils of the senatorial district as well as the major markets, reconfirming his reputation as a crowd puller. In the ensuing National Assembly elections of 23 February 2019, he won with a wide margin. Nnamani scored a total of 128,843 votes to trounce his closest rival, Prince Lawrence Ozoemeka Ezeh, who garnered 14,225 votes while Uchenna Agbo of APGA came third with 1,586 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/02/25/ex-gov-nnamani-wins-enugu-east-senatorial-election/ |title=Ex-Gov Nnamani wins Enugu East Senatorial Election |publisher=Thisday |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref> Nnamani has repeatedly credited his smooth return journey to the Senate to the strong backing he received from the Governor of his state, Rt. Hon. Lawrence Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (aka Gburugburu). He received his certificate of return as a senator-elect from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 14 March 2019 and assumed office on 11 June 2019 following the inauguration of the 9th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He was subsequently appointed as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Cooperation and Integration in Africa/NEPAD and Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Drugs and Narcotics,in addition to membership of the following Senate Committees: Health, Foreign Affairs, Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA), Diaspora and NGOs, Land Transport as well as Women Affairs. \n\n==Highlights of Governance==\n'''Education'''\n\nAs governor, Dr. Nnamani established District Education Centers in the state, conceived and built the permanent campus of the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT), constructed and handed over to the Federal Government, the Enugu Campus of the Nigerian Law School, and also constructed and handed over to the Nigerian Air Force, the Airforce Comprehensive High School at Agbani. His administration established new special science schools in different parts of the state, carried out the renovation of public primary and secondary schools and provided them with school desks and teachers\u2019 tables and chairs.\n\n'''Health'''\n\nBeing a medical doctor, it was no surprise that health was a top priority to Governor Nnamani. His administration established four district hospitals and 19 cottage hospitals in the state. A partnership with the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) saw to the rehabilitation and upgrade of many healthcare facilities under the Partnership for Transforming Health Systems (PATHS I & II). The flagship project of the administration in the health sector, however, was apparently the transformation of the former General Hospital at Parklane, GRA, Enugu, into the present ESUT Teaching Hospital and ESUT College of Medicine. The massive project involved the construction of new buildings, refurbishing of existing ones and the provision of modern equipment that enabled the facility to pass the accreditation of the relevant authorities in the health cum education sectors.\n\n'''Infrastructure'''\n\nRoad construction and rehabilitation was one area that won the Nnamani administration early popular acclaim. Among the rural road network undertaken by the administration were the Opi-Nsukka Road, Awgu-Ndeabor Road, Ozalla-Agbani Road, Agbani-Akpugo-Amagunze Road, Amechi-Obeagu-Amodu-Umueze Road, Oghe-Aguobu-Umumba Road, Aguobu-Ugwuoba Road, Oji-Awgu Road, Nsukka urban roads, University of Nigeria roads, Nsukka-Ibagwa Road, Obolo Afor-Ogrute Road, etc. There were also new road infrastructures like the Nyaba Bridge, and the Ebeano bypass linking NBL Ama Brewery at 9th Mile Corner with the Enugu-Onitsha expressway. In the Enugu metropolis, the Nnamani era witnessed the dualization of Chime Avenue as well as Rangers Avenue, Ebeano Tunnel connecting the busy Ogui Road and Garden Avenue, a new route linking Nza Street in Independence Layout with the Upper Chime Avenue in New Haven, amongst the streets rehabilitated in Abakpa Nike, Trans Ekulu, Achara Lawyout I and II, Uwani, Coal Camp and so on.\n\n'''Electricity'''\n\nThe administration pursued a policy of lighting up the rural communities with the provision of electricity. Over 130 rural communities benefitted from this intervention.\n\n'''Water Supply'''\n\nThe administration improved public water supply in the state. Some of the interventions in the sector included the Ozalla Ezimo Water Scheme in Udenu LGA, expansion of Enugu Urban water supply, expansion of the Ajali River water works, reactivation of the Ede-Obala booster station for water supply to Nsukka town, Agbani/Amodu water reservoir, revival of Awhum water scheme, and the construction of hundreds of motorized boreholes in the rural communities across the state.\n\n'''Reforms in Locality Administration'''\n\nThe administration consciously pursued a policy of enhanced mass participation in the political process and bringing governance closer to the people in the grassroots. Governor Nnamani carried out far-reaching reforms in locality administration which have continued to define the structure of grassroots politics and governance in Enugu State. Following a democratic process, his administration created 56 development centres out of the 17 local government areas of the state, complete with the simultaneous construction of 39 headquarters for the new development centres, while the existing 17 council secretariats served as headquarters for the remaining 17 development centres. Over 200 new autonomous communities were also created (each with its own Town Union and Traditional Ruler), the first time since the creation of Enugu State, thus bringing the total number of autonomous communities in Enugu State to 367 as at May 2007. These reforms went hand in hand with the Community County Council (CCC) initiative, later refocused as the Community Development County Councils (CDCC), a rural development partnership between the rural communities and the State Government. The administration established the Ministry of Poverty Reduction and Human Development which has evolved into a grassroots poverty management scheme in the state. There was also the Local Empowerment and Environmental Management Projects (LEEMP), another bilateral rural development partnership with the World Bank/UK Government that focused on the construction and grading of rural feeder roads and other poverty eradication projects in the rural communities.\n\n==Honours==\nHis academic honours include - Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Diplomate of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, D.Sc. (Honoris Causa), University of Nigeria; Distinguished Fellow of the Nigerian Law School, D.Sc (Honoris Causa), Babcock University, Illisan Remo, Ogun State, Adjunct Professor (Political Science), Babcock University, Illisan Remo, Ogun State, Honorary Fellow of the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria, Ijanikan, Lagos, and Distinguished Fellow of the West African College of Surgeons.\n\n==Public Speaking==\nGovernor Nnamani was well known for his intellectual engagements on the travails and prospects of an emerging democracy like Nigeria.

He was a maternal and fetal medicine specialist with the Maternal and Fetal Medicine Associates, Principal Practicing Group, Orlando, Florida. \n\n'''Professional Societies''': \nHe belonged to a number of professional societies such as the Society for Perinatal Obstetricians, American Society for Cell Biology, Society for Gynecologic Investigations, American Institute for Ultrasound in Medicine, and Licensure of California, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Florida and District of Columbia. He is a member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Enugu State. \n\n==Political career==\nDr. Nnamani\u2019s first foray in national politics was his election as the National President of the Nigerian Medical Students Association (NIMSA). He was elected Governor of Enugu State of Nigeria and re-elected for a second term in 2003. His eight years tenure witnessed many groundbreaking projects including the sprawling new permanent campus of the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT), the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital and College of Medicine at Parklane, Enugu, the Enugu Campus of the Nigerian Law School, the Ebeano Tunnel, dualization of Rangers Avenue and Chime Avenue, opening of a new route linking Nza Street and Chime Avenue in Enugu, the new State Judiciary headquarters, the International Conference Centre project, the Enugu State Building in Abuja, amongst others.\n\nHe was first elected to the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria representing the Enugu East Senatorial District and served from 2007 to 2011. He  re-contested for the seat in the April 2011 elections, this time on the platform of the People for Democratic Change (PDC), but lost in controversial circumstances. He vied for the same seat again in the 2015 elections and was widely projected to win when, to the consternation of the populace, his main challenger was surprisingly declared as the winner, this time provoking spontaneous mass protests that rocked the capital city of Enugu for days. \n\n==Return to the Senate==\n\nFollowing overtures from the Enugu State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he returned to the party in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://punchng.com/ex-enugu-governor-nnamani-ditches-pdc-returns-to-pdp/ |title=Ex-Enugu governor, Nnamani, ditches PDC, returns to PDP |publisher=Punch |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref> Ahead of the 2019 general elections, he rested mounting speculations over his political future when he picked the senatorial nomination form of the party for Enugu East Senatorial District. At the senatorial primary election held on 2 October 2018 he polled 601 votes to easily beat six other contestants, amongst them the then incumbent Senator Gilbert Nnaji, who polled 69 votes. He soon embarked on a vigorous street-to-street campaign that enlivened Enugu metropolis as the people surged out to cheer him up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theeasterner.com.ng/enugu-goes-abuzz-as-chimaroke-flags-off-campaign/ |title=Enugu goes abuzz as Chimaroke flags off campaign |publisher=The Easterner |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref> He also took his campaign to all the development centers in the 6 local government councils of the senatorial district as well as the major markets, reconfirming his reputation as a crowd puller. In the ensuing National Assembly elections of 23 February 2019, he won with a wide margin. Nnamani scored a total of 128,843 votes to trounce his closest rival, Prince Lawrence Ozoemeka Ezeh, who garnered 14,225 votes while Uchenna Agbo of APGA came third with 1,586 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/02/25/ex-gov-nnamani-wins-enugu-east-senatorial-election/ |title=Ex-Gov Nnamani wins Enugu East Senatorial Election |publisher=Thisday |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref> Nnamani has repeatedly credited his smooth return journey to the Senate to the strong backing he received from the Governor of his state, Rt. Hon. Lawrence Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (aka Gburugburu). He received his certificate of return as a senator-elect from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 14 March 2019 and assumed office on 11 June 2019 following the inauguration of the 9th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He was subsequently appointed as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Cooperation and Integration in Africa/NEPAD and Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Drugs and Narcotics,in addition to membership of the following Senate Committees: Health, Foreign Affairs, Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA), Diaspora and NGOs, Land Transport as well as Women Affairs. \n\n==Highlights of Governance==\n'''Education'''\n\nAs governor, Dr. Nnamani established District Education Centers in the state, conceived and built the permanent campus of the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT), constructed and handed over to the Federal Government, the Enugu Campus of the Nigerian Law School, and also constructed and handed over to the Nigerian Air Force, the Airforce Comprehensive High School at Agbani. His administration established new special science schools in different parts of the state, carried out the renovation of public primary and secondary schools and provided them with school desks and teachers\u2019 tables and chairs.\n\n'''Health'''\n\nBeing a medical doctor, it was no surprise that health was a top priority to Governor Nnamani. His administration established four district hospitals and 19 cottage hospitals in the state. A partnership with the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) saw to the rehabilitation and upgrade of many healthcare facilities under the Partnership for Transforming Health Systems (PATHS I & II). The flagship project of the administration in the health sector, however, was apparently the transformation of the former General Hospital at Parklane, GRA, Enugu, into the present ESUT Teaching Hospital and ESUT College of Medicine. The massive project involved the construction of new buildings, refurbishing of existing ones and the provision of modern equipment that enabled the facility to pass the accreditation of the relevant authorities in the health cum education sectors.\n\n'''Infrastructure'''\n\nRoad construction and rehabilitation was one area that won the Nnamani administration early popular acclaim. Among the rural road network undertaken by the administration were the Opi-Nsukka Road, Awgu-Ndeabor Road, Ozalla-Agbani Road, Agbani-Akpugo-Amagunze Road, Amechi-Obeagu-Amodu-Umueze Road, Oghe-Aguobu-Umumba Road, Aguobu-Ugwuoba Road, Oji-Awgu Road, Nsukka urban roads, University of Nigeria roads, Nsukka-Ibagwa Road, Obolo Afor-Ogrute Road, etc. There were also new road infrastructures like the Nyaba Bridge, and the Ebeano bypass linking NBL Ama Brewery at 9th Mile Corner with the Enugu-Onitsha expressway. In the Enugu metropolis, the Nnamani era witnessed the dualization of Chime Avenue as well as Rangers Avenue, Ebeano Tunnel connecting the busy Ogui Road and Garden Avenue, a new route linking Nza Street in Independence Layout with the Upper Chime Avenue in New Haven, amongst the streets rehabilitated in Abakpa Nike, Trans Ekulu, Achara Lawyout I and II, Uwani, Coal Camp and so on.\n\n'''Electricity'''\n\nThe administration pursued a policy of lighting up the rural communities with the provision of electricity. Over 130 rural communities benefitted from this intervention.\n\n'''Water Supply'''\n\nThe administration improved public water supply in the state. Some of the interventions in the sector included the Ozalla Ezimo Water Scheme in Udenu LGA, expansion of Enugu Urban water supply, expansion of the Ajali River water works, reactivation of the Ede-Obala booster station for water supply to Nsukka town, Agbani/Amodu water reservoir, revival of Awhum water scheme, and the construction of hundreds of motorized boreholes in the rural communities across the state.\n\n'''Reforms in Locality Administration'''\n\nThe administration consciously pursued a policy of enhanced mass participation in the political process and bringing governance closer to the people in the grassroots. Governor Nnamani carried out far-reaching reforms in locality administration which have continued to define the structure of grassroots politics and governance in Enugu State. Following a democratic process, his administration created 56 development centres out of the 17 local government areas of the state, complete with the simultaneous construction of 39 headquarters for the new development centres, while the existing 17 council secretariats served as headquarters for the remaining 17 development centres. Over 200 new autonomous communities were also created (each with its own Town Union and Traditional Ruler), the first time since the creation of Enugu State, thus bringing the total number of autonomous communities in Enugu State to 367 as at May 2007. These reforms went hand in hand with the Community County Council (CCC) initiative, later refocused as the Community Development County Councils (CDCC), a rural development partnership between the rural communities and the State Government. The administration established the Ministry of Poverty Reduction and Human Development which has evolved into a grassroots poverty management scheme in the state. There was also the Local Empowerment and Environmental Management Projects (LEEMP), another bilateral rural development partnership with the World Bank/UK Government that focused on the construction and grading of rural feeder roads and other poverty eradication projects in the rural communities.\n\n==Honours==\nHis academic honours include - Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Diplomate of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, D.Sc. (Honoris Causa), University of Nigeria; Distinguished Fellow of the Nigerian Law School, D.Sc (Honoris Causa), Babcock University, Illisan Remo, Ogun State, Adjunct Professor (Political Science), Babcock University, Illisan Remo, Ogun State, Honorary Fellow of the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria, Ijanikan, Lagos, and Distinguished Fellow of the West African College of Surgeons.\n\n==Public Speaking==\nGovernor Nnamani was well known for his intellectual engagements on the travails and prospects of an emerging democracy like Nigeria.

Chillingham cattle are small, with upright horns in both males and females.  Bulls weigh around {{Convert|300|kg||abbr=on}}, cows about {{Convert|280|kg||abbr=on}}. They are white with coloured ears (they may also have some colour on feet, nose and around the eyes). In the case of Chillingham cattle, the ear-colour is red &ndash; in most White Park animals the ears are black (which is [[Dominance (genetics)|genetically dominant]] over red in cattle). Chillingham cattle are of generally primitive conformation while White Parks are of classical British beef conformation.\nA brief review of academic studies on the Chillingham cattle is available.<ref>[http://chillinghamwildcattle.com/science/ The Wild Beasts of Chillingham]</ref>\n\n==Description of the Northumberland habitat==\n[[File:Chillingham Wild Cattle - Chillingham Park policies.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A view of the grazing in Chillingham Park]]\nTo many visitors, the most striking element of the historic [[habitat]] at Chillingham is the widespread occurrence of large [[oak]] trees amongst grassland ([[wood pasture]]), providing a glimpse of Britain as many think it appeared in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times. However, most of these trees were only planted in the 1780s - early 19th century,<ref>Hall, SJG (2010) Caring for the legend of the wild bull: an interpretation of the Georgian landscape of Chillingham Park, Northumberland. Garden History 38,213-230.</ref> and the truly ancient trees of the park are the streamside [[alder]] trees, which were probably [[coppice]]d in the mid-18th century. They were probably hundreds of years old even then and the stems now growing are themselves around 250 years old.<ref>Hall, SJG & Bunce, RGH (2011) Mature trees as keystone structures in Holarctic ecosystems - a quantitative species comparison in a northern English park.

Just to the east of the park is the summit of [[Ros Hill]]. The cattle are not visible from this viewpoint, which does however give an impressive view over much of north Northumberland. With support from [[Defra]], a network of paths has been created around the periphery of Chillingham Park.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Country Walk Summary - Chillingham Estate  | publisher = [[Natural England]] | date = | year = | url = http://cwr.naturalengland.org.uk/Default.aspx?Module=CountryWalkDetails&Site=5927 | access-date = 27 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry and history of the Chillingham cattle==\n\n[[File:Edwin Landseer- The Wild Cattle of Chillingham.JPG|thumb|120px|[[Sir Edwin Landseer]]: ''The Wild Cattle of Chillingham'' (1867, oil on canvas).]]\n\nAccording to earlier publicity material produced by the Chillingham Wild Cattle Association, Chillingham cattle bear some similarities to the extinct ancestral species [[aurochs]], ''Bos primigenius primigenius'', based upon [[Skull|cranial]] geometrics and the positioning of their horns relative to the skull formation. They further claim that Chillingham cattle may be direct descendants of the primordial ox \"''which roamed these islands before the dawn of history''\";<ref>Dowager Countess of Tankerville, patron, Chillingham Wild Cattle Association, ''The Wild White Cattle of Chillingham'', Chillingham, Alnwick, England</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Dowager Countess of Tankerville |title=The Wild White Cattle of Chillingham |publisher=White Park Cattle Society Ltd |url=http://www.whitepark.org.uk/chillingham.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208084049/http://www.whitepark.org.uk/chillingham.htm |archivedate=8 December 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> moreover, according to Tankerville, these characteristics differed from the cattle brought into England by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. It is now considered much more likely that they are descended from medieval husbanded cattle that were impounded when Chillingham Park was enclosed. But in the absence of adequate genetic or archaeological evidence, these proposed origins must remain purely speculative.<ref>\"Bos primigenius in Britain: or, why do fairy cows have red ears?\", http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_1_113/ai_86063329/pg_3, Jessica Hemming, April, 2002, accessed September 13, 2006</ref> However, the traditional view that these cattle have an unbroken line of descent, without intervening domestication, from the wild-living aurochs was already being called into question in the 1800s.<ref>Hall, SJG (2010) Caring for the legend of the wild bull: an interpretation of the Georgian landscape of Chillingham Park, Northumberland. Garden History 38,213-230.</ref>\nOver the years a large popular literature has built up relating to the herd, which has been analyzed in relation to prevalent concepts of ownership and attitudes of people towards big, charismatic animals.<ref>Ritvo, H (1992) Race, breed and myths of origin: Chillingham cattle as ancient Britons. Representations 39,1-22.</ref> [[Simon Schama]] described the famous contemporary woodcut by [[Thomas Bewick]] <ref>Schama, S. (2002) A history of Britain. The fate of empire 1776-2000. London: BBC Worldwide, p.126)</ref> as \"an image of massive power ... the great, perhaps the greatest icon of British natural history, and one loaded with moral, national and historical sentiment as well as purely zoological fascination\".\n\nThe first written record of the herd dates from 1645, but the Chillingham herd is claimed by some to have been in this site for at least seven centuries. Before the 13th century, this breed is claimed to have \"roamed the great forest which extended from the North Sea coast to the Clyde estuary\" according to the Countess of Tankerville. During the 13th century, the King of England licensed [[Chillingham Castle]] to become \"castellated and crenellated\" and a [[Dry stone|drystone wall]] may well have been built then to enclose the herd. At that time, there was particular concern about [[Scotland|Scottish]] marauders, which explains also the massive build-up of fortification of the nearby [[Dunstanburgh Castle]] at the same time.<ref>C. M. Hogan, ''History and architecture of Dunstanburgh Castle'', Lumina Technologies, Aberdeen, Scotland, July, 2006</ref>\n\nThe wall that visitors see at Chillingham was built in the early 19th century to enclose the {{convert|1500|acre|ha}} of Chillingham Park. As of 2009, the cattle have {{Convert|330|acre|ha}} to roam and the rest of the ground is woodland or farmland.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Wild cattle of Chillingham.jpg|thumb|Wild cattle of Chillingham - Photograph c1890]]\nChillingham bulls contributed genetically to [[White Park cattle|White Park]] herds in the early 20th century, but the Chillingham herd has remained pure. Some degree of genetic affinity between Chillingham and White Park cattle would therefore be predicted, but this has not been investigated.  On historical grounds<ref>Hall, SJG (2010) Caring for the legend of the wild bull: an interpretation of the Georgian landscape of Chillingham Park, Northumberland. Garden History 38,213-230.</ref> they are probably particularly closely related to the [[Vaynol cattle]] breed.\n\nThe first genetic work was conducted from the early 1960s when, in connection with the development of blood typing techniques for cattle parentage testing, Dr. J. G. Hall of the Animal Breeding Research Organisation (Edinburgh) studied the blood groups of the Chillingham herd.<ref>Hall SJG & Hall JG, 1988, \"Inbreeding and population dynamics of the Chillingham cattle (Bos taurus)\": Journal of Zoology, London, 216, pp&nbsp;479\u2013493</ref> The herd was found to be remarkably homozygous, and this is what would be expected from their long history of inbreeding.

Chillingham cattle are small, with upright horns in both males and females.  Bulls weigh around {{Convert|300|kg||abbr=on}}, cows about {{Convert|280|kg||abbr=on}}. They are white with coloured ears (they may also have some colour on feet, nose and around the eyes). In the case of Chillingham cattle, the ear-colour is red &ndash; in most White Park animals the ears are black (which is [[Dominance (genetics)|genetically dominant]] over red in cattle). Chillingham cattle are of generally primitive conformation while White Parks are of classical British beef conformation.\nA brief review of academic studies on the Chillingham cattle is available.<ref>[http://chillinghamwildcattle.com/science/ The Wild Beasts of Chillingham]</ref>\n\n==Description of the Northumberland habitat==\n[[File:Chillingham Wild Cattle - Chillingham Park policies.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A view of the grazing in Chillingham Park]]\nTo many visitors, the most striking element of the historic [[habitat]] at Chillingham is the widespread occurrence of large [[oak]] trees amongst grassland ([[wood pasture]]), providing a glimpse of Britain as many think it appeared in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times. However, most of these trees were only planted in the 1780s - early 19th century,<ref>Hall, SJG (2010) Caring for the legend of the wild bull: an interpretation of the Georgian landscape of Chillingham Park, Northumberland. Garden History 38,213-230.</ref> and the truly ancient trees of the park are the streamside [[alder]] trees, which were probably [[coppice]]d in the mid-18th century. They were probably hundreds of years old even then and the stems now growing are themselves around 250 years old.<ref>Hall, SJG & Bunce, RGH (2011) Mature trees as keystone structures in Holarctic ecosystems - a quantitative species comparison in a northern English park. Plant Ecology & Diversity 4(2-3), 243-250.</ref> A [[biodiversity|diversity]] of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s find a habitat here, due to the absence of the [[intensive farming]] found in most other places in [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nThe Northumberland site is also home to a variety of other [[species]] including [[red squirrel]], [[fox]], and [[badger]], as well as [[roe deer]] and [[fallow deer]].<ref>''The Wild Cattle of Chillingham'', brochure of the Chillingham Wild Cattle Association, Chillingham, Alnwick, UK</ref>  There are approximately 55 [[bird]] species, including [[common buzzard]]s, [[European green woodpecker]]s, and the [[Eurasian nuthatch]] which claims this latitude as its northernmost range in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAn on-site warden at the park leads small groups on foot to find the Chillingham cattle herd; on some days they are evident in one of the easily accessible meadows, while on rare occasions they can be difficult to find without a fair bit of walking, given the tangled woodlands and the amount of space they have for roaming. Just to the east of the park is the summit of [[Ros Hill]]. The cattle are not visible from this viewpoint, which does however give an impressive view over much of north Northumberland. With support from [[Defra]], a network of paths has been created around the periphery of Chillingham Park.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Country Walk Summary - Chillingham Estate  | publisher = [[Natural England]] | date = | year = | url = http://cwr.naturalengland.org.uk/Default.aspx?Module=CountryWalkDetails&Site=5927 | access-date = 27 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ancestry and history of the Chillingham cattle==\n\n[[File:Edwin Landseer- The Wild Cattle of Chillingham.JPG|thumb|120px|[[Sir Edwin Landseer]]: ''The Wild Cattle of Chillingham'' (1867, oil on canvas).]]\n\nAccording to earlier publicity material produced by the Chillingham Wild Cattle Association, Chillingham cattle bear some similarities to the extinct ancestral species [[aurochs]], ''Bos primigenius primigenius'', based upon [[Skull|cranial]] geometrics and the positioning of their horns relative to the skull formation. They further claim that Chillingham cattle may be direct descendants of the primordial ox \"''which roamed these islands before the dawn of history''\";<ref>Dowager Countess of Tankerville, patron, Chillingham Wild Cattle Association, ''The Wild White Cattle of Chillingham'', Chillingham, Alnwick, England</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Dowager Countess of Tankerville |title=The Wild White Cattle of Chillingham |publisher=White Park Cattle Society Ltd |url=http://www.whitepark.org.uk/chillingham.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208084049/http://www.whitepark.org.uk/chillingham.htm |archivedate=8 December 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> moreover, according to Tankerville, these characteristics differed from the cattle brought into England by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. It is now considered much more likely that they are descended from medieval husbanded cattle that were impounded when Chillingham Park was enclosed. But in the absence of adequate genetic or archaeological evidence, these proposed origins must remain purely speculative.<ref>\"Bos primigenius in Britain: or, why do fairy cows have red ears?\", http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_1_113/ai_86063329/pg_3, Jessica Hemming, April, 2002, accessed September 13, 2006</ref> However, the traditional view that these cattle have an unbroken line of descent, without intervening domestication, from the wild-living aurochs was already being called into question in the 1800s<ref>Hall, SJG (2010) Caring for the legend of the wild bull: an interpretation of the Georgian landscape of Chillingham Park, Northumberland. Garden History 38,213-230.</ref>.\nOver the years a large popular literature has built up relating to the herd, which has been analyzed in relation to prevalent concepts of ownership and attitudes of people towards big, charismatic animals.<ref>Ritvo, H (1992) Race, breed and myths of origin: Chillingham cattle as ancient Britons. Representations 39,1-22.</ref> [[Simon Schama]] described the famous contemporary woodcut by [[Thomas Bewick]] <ref>Schama, S. (2002) A history of Britain. The fate of empire 1776-2000. London: BBC Worldwide, p.126)</ref> as \"an image of massive power ... the great, perhaps the greatest icon of British natural history, and one loaded with moral, national and historical sentiment as well as purely zoological fascination\".\n\nThe first written record of the herd dates from 1645, but the Chillingham herd is claimed by some to have been in this site for at least seven centuries. Before the 13th century, this breed is claimed to have \"roamed the great forest which extended from the North Sea coast to the Clyde estuary\" according to the Countess of Tankerville. During the 13th century, the King of England licensed [[Chillingham Castle]] to become \"castellated and crenellated\" and a [[Dry stone|drystone wall]] may well have been built then to enclose the herd. At that time, there was particular concern about [[Scotland|Scottish]] marauders, which explains also the massive build-up of fortification of the nearby [[Dunstanburgh Castle]] at the same time.<ref>C. M. Hogan, ''History and architecture of Dunstanburgh Castle'', Lumina Technologies, Aberdeen, Scotland, July, 2006</ref>\n\nThe wall that visitors see at Chillingham was built in the early 19th century to enclose the {{convert|1500|acre|ha}} of Chillingham Park. As of 2009, the cattle have {{Convert|330|acre|ha}} to roam and the rest of the ground is woodland or farmland.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Wild cattle of Chillingham.jpg|thumb|Wild cattle of Chillingham - Photograph c1890]]\nChillingham bulls contributed genetically to [[White Park cattle|White Park]] herds in the early 20th century, but the Chillingham herd has remained pure. Some degree of genetic affinity between Chillingham and White Park cattle would therefore be predicted, but this has not been investigated.  On historical grounds<ref>Hall, SJG (2010) Caring for the legend of the wild bull: an interpretation of the Georgian landscape of Chillingham Park, Northumberland.
