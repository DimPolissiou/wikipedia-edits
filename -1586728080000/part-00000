The abbey is dedicated to Our Lady of the Hermits, the title being derived from the circumstances of its foundation, for the first inhabitant of the region was [[Saint Meinrad]], a [[hermit]]. It is a [[territorial abbey]] and, therefore, not part of a [[diocese]], subject to a [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]. It has been a major resting point on the [[Way of St. James]] for centuries.\n\n== History ==\nMeinrad was educated at the abbey school on [[Reichenau Island]], in [[Lake Constance]], under his kinsmen, Abbots Hatto and Erlebald, where he became a monk and was ordained a priest. After some years at Reichenau, and at a dependent [[priory]] on [[Lake Zurich]], he embraced an eremitical life and established his [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] on the slopes of the mountain of [[Etzel (mountain)|Etzel]]. He died on January 21, 861, at the hands of two robbers who thought that the hermit had some precious treasures, but during the next 80 years the place was never without one or more hermits emulating Meinrad's example. One of them, named Eberhard, previously [[provost (religion)|Provost]] of [[Strassburg]], erected in 934 a monastery and church there, of which he became first abbot. \n\nThe church was miraculously consecrated, so the legend runs, in 948, by Christ himself assisted by the [[Four Evangelists]], [[St. Peter]], and St. [[Gregory the Great]]. This event was investigated and confirmed by [[Pope Leo VIII]] and subsequently ratified by many of his successors, the last ratification being by [[Pope Pius VI]] in 1793, who confirmed the acts of all his predecessors. \n\nIn 965 Gregory, the third Abbot of Einsiedeln, was made a prince of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by Emperor [[Otto I]], and his successors continued to enjoy the same dignity up to the cessation of the empire in the beginning of the 19th century. In 1274 the abbey, with its dependencies, was created an independent [[principality]] by [[Rudolf I of Germany]], over which the abbot exercised temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction. It remained independent until 1798, the year of the French invasion. It is still a territorial abbey, meaning that it is located in a territory that is not part of any diocese which the abbot governs \"as its proper pastor\" ([https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1C.HTM Canon 370, ''Codex Juris Canonici'']) with the same authority as a diocesan bishop.\n\nFor the learning and piety of its monks, Einsiedeln has been famous for a thousand years, and many saints and scholars have lived within its walls. The study of letters, printing, and music have greatly flourished there, and the abbey has contributed largely to the glory of the Benedictine Order. It is true that discipline declined somewhat in the fifteenth century and the rule became relaxed, but Ludovicus II, a monk of [[St. Gall]] who was Abbot of Einsiedeln 1526-44, succeeded in restoring the stricter observance. \n\nIn the 16th century the religious disturbances caused by the spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Switzerland were a source of trouble for some time. [[Zwingli]] himself was at Einsiedeln for a while, and used the opportunity for protesting against the famous pilgrimages, but the storm passed over and the abbey was left in peace. Abbot Augustine I (1600\u201329) was the leader of the movement which resulted in the erection of the [[Swiss Congregation]] of the Order of St. Benedict in 1602, and he also did much for the establishment of unrelaxed observance in the abbey and for the promotion of a high standard of scholarship and learning amongst his monks. \n\n[[File:Einsiedeln - Kloster - Innenansicht 2013-01-26 14-39-54 (P7700).JPG|thumb|upright|Nave of the abbey church]]\n[[File:Kloster Einsiedeln MG 2740.JPG|thumb|upright|Details of the ceiling paintings]]\n[[File:Kloster Einsiedeln MG 2745.JPG|thumb|upright|Details of the ceiling paintings]]\nThe pilgrimages, just mentioned, which have never ceased since the days of St Meinrad, have tended to make Einsiedeln the rival even of [[Rome]], the [[Basilica della Santa Casa|Holy House of Loreto]] and [[Santiago de Compostela]], serving as a major stopping point on the [[Way of St. James]] leading there. Pilgrimages constitute one of the features for which the abbey is chiefly celebrated. The pilgrims number around one million, from all parts of Catholic Europe or even further. The statue of Our Lady from the 15th century, enthroned in the little chapel erected by Eberhard, is the object of their devotion. It is the subject of the earliest preserved print of pilgrimage, by the [[Master E.S.]] in 1466.<ref>Schmidt, Suzanne Karr.

The millennium of St Meinrad was kept there with great splendour in 1861 as well as that of the Benedictine monastery in 1934. The great church has been many times rebuilt, the last time by Abbot Maurus between the years 1704 and 1719. The last big renovation ended after more than twenty years in 1997. The [[library]] contains nearly 250,000 volumes and many priceless manuscripts. The work of the monks is divided chiefly between prayer, work and study. At pilgrimage times the number of confessions heard is very large. \n\nIn 2013 the community numbered 60 monks. Attached to the abbey are a seminary and a college for about 360 pupils who are partially taught by the monks, who also provide [[spiritual direction]] for six convents of [[Religious Sister]]s.\n\n==Expansion to America==\nIn 1854, when the monastery was again facing suppression, a colony was sent to the United States from Einsiedeln to minister to the local German-speaking population and to develop a place of refuge, if needed. The delegation started a new foundation, now [[St. Meinrad Archabbey]] in [[St. Meinrad, Indiana]], which became part of the [[Swiss-American Congregation]] formed in 1881. As of 01 April 2018, the Swiss-American Congregation consists of 14 monasteries from Canada to Guatemala, five of which were founded from St. Meinrad Archabbey and its daughter houses.\n\n==School==\nOne of the abbey's apostolates is a school (''Gymnasium'') for the seventh to twelfth grades which has existed in its present form since 1848.  It is the continuation of a tradition of education that dates to the early Middle Ages. Its distinguished alumni include [[Gall Morel]], [[Franz Fassbind]], [[Philipp Etter]], [[Hans H\u00fcrlimann]] and his son [[Thomas H\u00fcrlimann]], [[Bruno Frick]], and [[Anatole Taubman]].\n\n==Fahr Monastery==\n{{main|Fahr Monastery}}\nLocated in separate cantons, Einsiedeln Abbey and [[Fahr Monastery]], a community of Benedictine nuns, form a [[double monastery]], both under the authority of the Abbot of Einsiedeln.\n\n==Ufenau island, Einsiedlerhaus and Endingen area in Rapperswil==\n{{main|Ufenau|Einsiedlerhaus}}\nThe western lake shore town wall respectively the fortifications of [[Rapperswil]] probably were built in the early 13th century by the [[Counts of Rapperswil]]. The so-called ''Endingen'' area in Rapperswil was given as a fief by the Einsiedeln Abbey which is still owner of the land, including the site where the [[Kapuzinerkloster Rapperswil|Capuchin monastery]] was built. That's why the adjoint building traditionally was named ''[[Einsiedlerhaus]]'', meaning \"house of the Einsiedeln abbey\". Historians mention a 10th-century ferry station located there \u2013 in 981 AD as well as the abbey's vineyard on the [[Lindenhof (Rapperswil)|Lindenhof hill]] \u2013 between [[Kempraten]] on [[Kempratnerbucht]], the [[L\u00fctzelau]] and [[Ufenau]] islands and assumably present [[Hurden]]. The ferry services allowed the pilgrims towards Einsiedeln to cross the lake before the prehistoric [[Holzbr\u00fccke Rapperswil-Hurden]] at the [[Seedamm]] isthmus was re-built between 1358 and 1360. Endingen, the ''Einsiedlerhaus'', and even the lake area are still in the possession of the Einsiedeln abbey, as well as the Ufenau island.<ref name=\"kapuzinerkloster\">{{cite web|url=http://klosterrapperswil.ch/das-einsiedlerhaus-in-rapperswil-wechselt-den-besitzer/|title=Das Einsiedlerhaus in Rapperswil wechselt den Besitzer|publisher=[[Kapuzinerkloster Rapperswil]], published by Markus Turnherr, [[Rathaus Rapperswil#Stadtarchiv|Stadtarchivar]], in [[Obersee Nachrichten]] |author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-09-12}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The abbey's library contains the [[Versus de scachis]], the earliest mention of chess in Western literature.<ref>The Earliest Evidence of Chess in Western Literature: The Einsiedeln Verses, Helena M.

It was under the office of the Secretary of State. On 1 January 1935, the ministry was merged with the [[Prussian Ministry of Agriculture, Domains and Forestry]], founded in 1879. In 1938 it was renamed \"Reich and Prussian Ministry of Food and Agriculture\". After the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of National Socialism]] in 1945 and the [[occupation of Germany|occupation]], the [[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture]] was established in 1949 as a successor in the western [[Federal Republic of Germany]].\n\n== History ==\nIn March 1919, the [[Reichsern\u00e4hrungsamt]] was the first to establish the \"Reich Ministry of Food\". This was combined with the Reich Ministry of Economics in September 1919 and re-founded during the [[Kapp Putsch]] in March 1920 under the name \"Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture\". In the same year, the ministry moved into the [[Palace of Prince Alexander and Prince George]] at 72 Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin.  From 1924, four large-format paintings by [[August Weber]] were on loan in the building, and since 1945 they have been lost.\n\nAfter the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi's seized power]] on January 30, 1933, the ministry was initially led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]].  Coerced into resignation during June 1933, Hugenburg was succeeded by [[Kurt Schmitt]] and [[Walther Darr\u00e9]].<ref>Hans Kehrl: ''Krisenmanager im Dritten Reich.'' </ref> The latter took over on June 30, 1933 as \"[[Reichsbauernf\u00fchrer]]\" the management of the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture,<ref>Horst Gies: ''NSDAP und landwirtschaftliche Organisationen in der Endphase der Weimarer Republik.'' </ref> where he was in this function also created for the [[Gleichschaltung]] of agriculture [[Reichsn\u00e4hrstand]]. The Nazi Darr\u00e9, took personal leadership of the official party apparatus belonging to the Agricultural Policy Office (from 1936 \"[[Reich Office for Agrarian Policy]]\", and then from 1942 \"[[Reich Office for the country people]]\").  The office was responsible for the management and supervision of the Reichsn\u00e4hrstandes.<ref>Rudolf Kluge, Heinrich Kr\u00fcger: ''Verfassung und Verwaltung im Gro\u00dfdeutschen Reich''. </ref> \n\nThe RMEL, as it were, took over the state's supervision of the Reichsn\u00e4hrstand organization.<ref>Horst Gies: ''Die Rolle des Reichsn\u00e4hrstandes im nationalsozialistischen Herrschaftssystem.'' </ref> As a result, individual areas of responsibility were gradually transferred to other NS authorities. Thus, in 1934, by founding the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Reich Forestry Office under the leadership of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was established as the highest Reich authority for forestry and hunting, timber management, nature conservation and nature conservation.<ref name=\"Tauber 286f\">Joachim Tauber u.&nbsp;a.</ref> The Reich Forestry was in turn united on January 1, 1935 with the [[Prussian State Forestry]].<ref>[[Joachim Radkau]] u.&nbsp;a. </ref>  Goring's deputy and de facto head of German Forestry was [[Walter von Keudell]], and then from 1937 [[Friedrich Alpers]]. Furthermore, in the years 1934 and 1935, the agricultural vocational and technical education were spun off into the [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture]] a directorate of the [[Reich Ministry of the Interior]]. On September 22, 1938, it also followed by decree of the Reich Minister, that all research institutes derived from the fishing industry would be collected in one [[Reich Institute for Fisheries]].\n\n== Reich Minister ==\n{{Officeholder table start\n| showorder          = y\n| showimage          = y\n| officeholder_title = Reichsminister\n| showtermlenght     = y\n| showelection

It was under the office of the Secretary of State. On 1 January 1935, the ministry was merged with the [[Prussian Ministry of Agriculture, Domains and Forestry]], founded in 1879. In 1938 it was renamed \"Reich and Prussian Ministry of Food and Agriculture\". After the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of National Socialism]] in 1945 and the [[occupation of Germany|occupation]], the [[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture]] was established in 1949 as a successor in the western [[Federal Republic of Germany]].\n\n== History ==\nIn March 1919, the [[Reichsern\u00e4hrungsamt]] was the first to establish the \"Reich Ministry of Food\". This was combined with the Reich Ministry of Economics in September 1919 and re-founded during the [[Kapp Putsch]] in March 1920 under the name \"Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture\". In the same year, the ministry moved into the [[Palace of Prince Alexander and Prince George]] at 72 Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin.  From 1924, four large-format paintings by [[August Weber]] were on loan in the building, and since 1945 they have been lost.\n\nAfter the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi's seized power]] on January 30, 1933, the ministry was initially led by [[Alfred Hugenberg]].  Coerced into resignation during June 1933, Hugenburg was succeeded by [[Kurt Schmitt]] and [[Walther Darr\u00e9]].<ref>Hans Kehrl: ''Krisenmanager im Dritten Reich.'' </ref> The latter took over on June 30, 1933 as \"[[Reichsbauernf\u00fchrer]]\" the management of the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture,<ref>Horst Gies: ''NSDAP und landwirtschaftliche Organisationen in der Endphase der Weimarer Republik.'' </ref> where he was in this function also created for the [[Gleichschaltung]] of agriculture [[Reichsn\u00e4hrstand]]. The Nazi Darr\u00e9, took personal leadership of the official party apparatus belonging to the Agricultural Policy Office (from 1936 \"[[Reich Office for Agrarian Policy]]\", and then from 1942 \"[[Reich Office for the country people]]\").  The office was responsible for the management and supervision of the Reichsn\u00e4hrstandes.<ref>Rudolf Kluge, Heinrich Kr\u00fcger: ''Verfassung und Verwaltung im Gro\u00dfdeutschen Reich''. </ref> \n\nThe RMEL, as it were, took over the state's supervision of the Reichsn\u00e4hrstand organization.<ref>Horst Gies: ''Die Rolle des Reichsn\u00e4hrstandes im nationalsozialistischen Herrschaftssystem.'' </ref> As a result, individual areas of responsibility were gradually transferred to other NS authorities. Thus, in 1934, by founding the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Reich Forestry Office under the leadership of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was established as the highest Reich authority for forestry and hunting, timber management, nature conservation and nature conservation.<ref name=\"Tauber 286f\">Joachim Tauber u.&nbsp;a.</ref> The Reich Forestry was in turn united on January 1, 1935 with the [[Prussian State Forestry]].<ref>[[Joachim Radkau]] u.&nbsp;a. </ref>  Goring's deputy and de facto head of German Forestry was [[Walter von Keudell]], and then from 1937 [[Friedrich Alpers]]. Furthermore, in the years 1934 and 1935, the agricultural vocational and technical education were spun off into the [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture]] a directorate of the [[Reich Ministry of the Interior]]. On September 22, 1938, it also followed by decree of the Reich Minister, that all research institutes derived from the fishing industry would be collected in one [[Reich Institute for Fisheries]].\n\n== Reich Minister ==\n{{Officeholder table start\n| showorder          = y\n| showimage          = y\n| officeholder_title = Reichsminister\n| showtermlenght     = y\n| showelection

If both [[allele]]s of this gene are mutated early in life, the protein is inactivated and results in development of [[retinoblastoma]] cancer, hence the name 'Rb'. Retinal cells are not sloughed off or replaced, and are subjected to high levels of mutagenic [[UV radiation]], and thus most pRb knock-outs occur in retinal tissue (but it has also been documented in certain skin cancers in patients from New Zealand where the amount of UV radiation is significantly higher).\n\nTwo forms of retinoblastoma were noticed: a bilateral, familial form and a unilateral, sporadic form. Sufferers of the former were six times more likely to develop other types of cancer later in life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinerman RA, Tucker MA, Tarone RE, Abramson DH, Seddon JM, Stovall M, Li FP, Fraumeni JF | display-authors = 6 | title = Risk of new cancers after radiotherapy in long-term survivors of retinoblastoma: an extended follow-up | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 2272\u20139 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15800318 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.054 }}</ref> This highlighted the fact that mutated Rb could be inherited and lent support for the [[two-hit hypothesis]]. This states that only one working allele of a [[tumour suppressor gene]] is necessary for its function (the mutated gene is [[recessive]]), and so both need to be mutated before the cancer phenotype will appear.

Rb is able to bind to transcription factors in the E2F family and thereby inhibit their function. When Rb is chronically activated, it leads to the [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] of the necessary DNA replication factors. Within 72\u201396 hours of active Rb induction in A2-4 cells, the target DNA replication factor proteins\u2014MCMs, RPA34, [[DBF4]], RFCp37, and RFCp140\u2014all showed decreased levels. Along with decreased levels, there was a simultaneous and expected inhibition of DNA replication in these cells. This process, however, is reversible. Following induced knockout of Rb, cells treated with [[cisplatin]], a DNA-damaging agent, were able to continue proliferating, without cell cycle arrest, suggesting Rb plays an important role in triggering chronic S-phase arrest in response to genotoxic stress.\n\nOne such example of E2F-regulated genes repressed by Rb are [[cyclin E]] and [[cyclin A]]. Both of these cyclins are able to bind to [[Cdk2]] and facilitate entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Through the repression of expression of cyclin E and cyclin A, Rb is able to inhibit the [[G1/S transition]].\n\n=== Repression mechanisms of E2Fs ===\nThere are at least three distinct mechanisms in which pRb can repress transcription of E2F-regulated [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]]. Though these mechanisms are known, it is unclear which are the most important for the control of the cell cycle.\n\nE2Fs are a family of proteins whose binding sites are often found in the promoter regions of genes for cell proliferation or progression of the cell cycle. [[E2F1]] to [[E2F5]] are known to associate with proteins in the pRb-family of proteins while E2F6 and [[E2F7]] are independent of pRb. Broadly, the E2Fs are split into activator E2Fs and repressor E2Fs though their role is more flexible than that on occasion. The activator E2Fs are E2F1, [[E2F2]] and [[E2F3]] while the  repressor E2Fs are [[E2F4]], E2F5 and E2F6. Activator E2Fs along with E2F4 bind exclusively to pRb. pRb is able to bind to the activation domain of the activator E2Fs which blocks their activity, repressing transcription of the genes controlled by that E2F-promoter.\n\n==== Blocking of pre-initiation complex assembly ====\nThe [[Transcription preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]] (PIC) assembles in a stepwise fashion on the promoter of genes to initiate transcription. The [[TFIID]] binds to the [[TATA box]] in order to begin the assembly of the [[TFIIA]], recruiting other transcription factors and components needed in the PIC. Data suggests that pRb is able to repress transcription by both Rb being recruited to the promoter as well as having a target present in [[TFIID]].\n\nThe presence of pRb may change the conformation of the TFIIA/IID complex into a less active version with a decreased binding affinity. pRb can also directly interfere with their association as proteins, preventing TFIIA/IID from forming an active complex.\n\n==== Modification of chromatin structure ====\npRb acts as a recruiter that allows for the binding of proteins that alter chromatin structure onto the site E2F-regulated promoters. Access to these E2F-regulated promoters by transcriptional factors is blocked by the formation of [[nucleosomes]] and their further packing into chromatin. Nucleosome formation is regulated by post-translational modifications to [[histone]] tails. Acetylation leads to the disruption of nucleosome structure. Proteins called [[Histone acetyltransferase|histone acetyltransferases]] (HATs) are responsible for acetylating histones and thus facilitating the association of transcription factors on DNA promoters. Deacetylation, on the other hand, leads to nucleosome formation and thus makes it more difficult for transcription factors to sit on promoters. [[Histone deacetylase|Histone deacetylases]] (HDACs) are the proteins responsible for facilitating nucleosome formation and are therefore associated with transcriptional repressors proteins.\n\nRb interacts with the histone deacetylases [[HDAC1]] and [[HDAC3]]. Rb binds to HDAC1 in its pocket domain in a region that is independent to its E2F-binding site. Rb recruitment of histone deacetylases leads to the repression of genes at E2F-regulated promoters due to nucleosome formation. Some genes activated during the G1/S transition such as cyclin E are repressed by HDAC during early to mid-G1 phase. This suggests that HDAC-assisted repression of cell cycle progression genes is crucial for the ability of Rb to arrest cells in G1. To further add to this point, the HDAC-Rb complex is shown to be disrupted by cyclin D/Cdk4 which levels increase and peak during the late G1 phase.\n\n== Senescence induced by Rb ==\nSenescence in cells is a state in which cells are metabolically active but are no longer able to replicate. Rb is an important regulator of senescence in cells and since this prevents proliferation, senescence is an important antitumor mechanism. Rb may occupy E2F-regulated promoters during senescence. For example, Rb was detected on the cyclin A and [[PCNA]] promoters in senescent cells.\n\n=== S-phase arrest ===\nCells respond to stress in the form of DNA damage, activated oncogenes, or sub-par growing conditions, and can enter a senescence-like state called \"premature senescence\". This allows the cell to prevent further replication during periods of damaged DNA or general unfavorable conditions. DNA damage in a cell can induce Rb activation. Rb's role in repressing the transcription of cell cycle progression genes leads to the S phase arrest that prevents replication of damaged DNA.\n\n== Activation and inactivation ==\n{{see also|cyclin-dependent kinase|DREAM complex}}\nWhen it is time for a cell to enter S phase, complexes of [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active.<ref name=\"M\u00fcnger and Howley\"/> When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. cyclin E and cyclin A), which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases, and a molecule called proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or [[PCNA]], which speeds DNA replication and [[DNA repair|repair]] by helping to attach [[DNA polymerase|polymerase]] to DNA.<ref name=\"Funk\"/><ref name=\"Greenblatt\"/><ref name=\"Das\"/><ref name=\"Korenjak and Brehm\"/><ref name=\"M\u00fcnger and Howley\"/><ref name=\"De Veylder\"/><ref name=\"Das\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Das SK, Hashimoto T, Shimizu K, Yoshida T, Sakai T, Sowa Y, Komoto A, Kanazawa K | display-authors = 6 | title = Fucoxanthin induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in human colon carcinoma cells through up-regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1726 | issue = 3 | pages = 328\u201335 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16236452 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2005.09.007 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bartkova\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartkova J, Gr\u00f8n B, Dabelsteen E, Bartek J | title = Cell-cycle regulatory proteins in human wound healing | journal = Archives of Oral Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 125\u201332 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12642231 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-9969(02)00202-9 }}</ref>\n\n=== Inactivation ===\nSince the 1990s, Rb was known to be inactivated via phosphorylation.

Furthermore, triple knockout, p16 addition, and Cdk 4/6 inhibitor addition experiments confirmed that Cyclin D- Cdk 4/6 is the sole phosphorylator of Rb.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout early G1, mono-phosphorylated Rb exists as 14 different isoforms (the 15th phosphorylation site is not conserved in primates in which the experiments were performed).

While the exact mechanism is unknown, one hypothesis is that binding to the C-terminus tail opens the pocket subunit, allowing access to all phosphorylation sites. This process is hysteretic and irreversible, and it is thought accumulation of mono-phosphorylated Rb induces the process. The bistable, switch like behavior of Rb can thus be modeled as a bifurcation point:<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Passing_the_restriction_point_triggers_immediate_hyper-phosphorylation_of_mono-phosphorylated_Rb.png|thumb|Hyper-phosphorylation of mono-phosphorylated Rb is an irreversible event that allows entry into S phase.]]\n\n=== Control of Rb function by phosphorylation ===\nPresence of un-phosphorylated Rb drives cell cycle exit and maintains senescence. At the end of mitosis, PP1 dephosphorylates hyper-phosphorylated Rb directly to its un-phosphorylated state. Furthermore, when cycling C2C12 myoblast cells differentiated (by being placed into a differentiation medium), only un-phosphorylated Rb was present. Additionally, these cells had a markedly decreased growth rate and concentration of DNA replication factors (suggesting G0 arrest).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis function of un-phosphorylated Rb gives rise to a hypothesis for the lack of cell cycle control in cancerous cells: Deregulation of Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6 phosphorylates un-phosphorylated Rb in senescent cells to mono-phosphorylated Rb, causing them to enter G1. The mechanism of the switch for Cyclin E activation is not known, but one hypothesis is that it is a metabolic sensor. Mono-phosphorylated Rb induces an increase in metabolism, so the accumulation of mono-phosphorylated Rb in previously G0 cells then causes hyper-phosphorylation and mitotic entry. Since any un-phosphorylated Rb is immediately phosphorylated, the cell is then unable to exit the cell cycle, resulting in continuous division.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDNA damage to G0 cells activates Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6, resulting in mono-phosphorylation of un-phosphorylated Rb. Then, active mono-phosphorylated Rb causes repression of E2F-targeted genes specifically. Therefore, mono-phosphorylated Rb is thought to play an active role in DNA damage response, so that E2F gene repression occurs until the damage is fixed and the cell can pass the restriction point. As a side note, the discovery that damages causes Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6 activation even in G0 cells should be kept in mind when patients are treated with both DNA damaging chemotherapy and Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6 inhibitors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Activation ===\nDuring the M-to-G1 transition, pRb is then progressively dephosphorylated by [[PP1]], returning to its growth-suppressive hypophosphorylated state Rb.<ref name=\"M\u00fcnger and Howley\"/><ref name=\"Vietri2006\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vietri M, Bianchi M, Ludlow JW, Mittnacht S, Villa-Moruzzi E | title = Direct interaction between the catalytic subunit of Protein Phosphatase 1 and pRb | journal = Cancer Cell International | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 3 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16466572 | pmc = 1382259 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2867-6-3 }}</ref>\n\nRb family proteins are components of the [[DREAM complex]] composed of DP, E2F4/5, RB-like (p130/p107) And MuvB (Lin9:Lin37:Lin52:RbAbP4:Lin54). The DREAM complex is assembled in Go/G1 and maintains quiescence by assembling at the promoters of > 800 cell-cycle genes and mediating transcriptional repression. Assembly of DREAM requires DYRK1A (Ser/Thr kinase) dependant phosphorylation of the MuvB core component, Lin52 at Serine28. This mechanism is crucial for recruitment of p130/p107 to the MuvB core and thus DREAM assembly.\n\n== Consequences of Rb loss ==\nConsequences of loss of Rb function is dependent on cell type and cell cycle status, as Rb's tumor suppressive role changes depending on the state and current identity of the cell. \n\nIn G0 quiescent stem cells, Rb is proposed to maintain G0 arrest although the mechanism remains largely unknown. Loss of Rb leads to exit from quiescence and an increase in the number of cells without loss of cell renewal capacity.

Embryonic hair cells require Rb, among other important proteins, to exit the cell-cycle and stop dividing, which allows maturation of the auditory system. Once wild-type mammals have reached adulthood, their cochlear hair cells become incapable of proliferation. In studies where the gene for Rb is deleted in mice cochlea, hair cells continue to proliferate in early adulthood. Though this may seem to be a positive development, Rb-knockdown mice tend to develop severe hearing loss due to degeneration of the [[organ of Corti]]. For this reason, Rb seems to be instrumental for completing the development of mammalian [[hair cell]]s and keeping them alive.<ref name=\"pmid16648263\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sage C, Huang M, Vollrath MA, Brown MC, Hinds PW, Corey DP, Vetter DE, Chen ZY | display-authors = 6 | title = Essential role of retinoblastoma protein in mammalian hair cell development and hearing | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 19 | pages = 7345\u201350 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16648263 | pmc = 1450112 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0510631103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.7345S }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid18178626\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber T, Corbett MK, Chow LM, Valentine MB, Baker SJ, Zuo J | title = Rapid cell-cycle reentry and cell death after acute inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene product in postnatal cochlear hair cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | pages = 781\u20135 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18178626 | pmc = 2206613 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0708061105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105..781W }}</ref> However, it is clear that without Rb, hair cells have the ability to proliferate, which is why Rb is known as a [[tumor]] suppressor.

Rb is able to bind to transcription factors in the E2F family and thereby inhibit their function. When Rb is chronically activated, it leads to the [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] of the necessary DNA replication factors. Within 72\u201396 hours of active Rb induction in A2-4 cells, the target DNA replication factor proteins\u2014MCMs, RPA34, [[DBF4]], RFCp37, and RFCp140\u2014all showed decreased levels. Along with decreased levels, there was a simultaneous and expected inhibition of DNA replication in these cells. This process, however, is reversible. Following induced knockout of Rb, cells treated with [[cisplatin]], a DNA-damaging agent, were able to continue proliferating, without cell cycle arrest, suggesting Rb plays an important role in triggering chronic S-phase arrest in response to genotoxic stress.\n\nOne such example of E2F-regulated genes repressed by Rb are [[cyclin E]] and [[cyclin A]]. Both of these cyclins are able to bind to [[Cdk2]] and facilitate entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Through the repression of expression of cyclin E and cyclin A, Rb is able to inhibit the [[G1/S transition]].\n\n=== Repression mechanisms of E2Fs ===\nThere are at least three distinct mechanisms in which pRb can repress transcription of E2F-regulated [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]]. Though these mechanisms are known, it is unclear which are the most important for the control of the cell cycle.\n\nE2Fs are a family of proteins whose binding sites are often found in the promoter regions of genes for cell proliferation or progression of the cell cycle. [[E2F1]] to [[E2F5]] are known to associate with proteins in the pRb-family of proteins while E2F6 and [[E2F7]] are independent of pRb. Broadly, the E2Fs are split into activator E2Fs and repressor E2Fs though their role is more flexible than that on occasion. The activator E2Fs are E2F1, [[E2F2]] and [[E2F3]] while the  repressor E2Fs are [[E2F4]], E2F5 and E2F6. Activator E2Fs along with E2F4 bind exclusively to pRb. pRb is able to bind to the activation domain of the activator E2Fs which blocks their activity, repressing transcription of the genes controlled by that E2F-promoter.\n\n==== Blocking of pre-initiation complex assembly ====\nThe [[Transcription preinitiation complex|preinitiation complex]] (PIC) assembles in a stepwise fashion on the promoter of genes to initiate transcription. The [[TFIID]] binds to the [[TATA box]] in order to begin the assembly of the [[TFIIA]], recruiting other transcription factors and components needed in the PIC. Data suggests that pRb is able to repress transcription by both Rb being recruited to the promoter as well as having a target present in [[TFIID]].\n\nThe presence of pRb may change the conformation of the TFIIA/IID complex into a less active version with a decreased binding affinity. pRb can also directly interfere with their association as proteins, preventing TFIIA/IID from forming an active complex.\n\n==== Modification of chromatin structure ====\npRb acts as a recruiter that allows for the binding of proteins that alter chromatin structure onto the site E2F-regulated promoters. Access to these E2F-regulated promoters by transcriptional factors is blocked by the formation of [[nucleosomes]] and their further packing into chromatin. Nucleosome formation is regulated by post-translational modifications to [[histone]] tails. Acetylation leads to the disruption of nucleosome structure. Proteins called [[Histone acetyltransferase|histone acetyltransferases]] (HATs) are responsible for acetylating histones and thus facilitating the association of transcription factors on DNA promoters. Deacetylation, on the other hand, leads to nucleosome formation and thus makes it more difficult for transcription factors to sit on promoters. [[Histone deacetylase|Histone deacetylases]] (HDACs) are the proteins responsible for facilitating nucleosome formation and are therefore associated with transcriptional repressors proteins.\n\nRb interacts with the histone deacetylases [[HDAC1]] and [[HDAC3]]. Rb binds to HDAC1 in its pocket domain in a region that is independent to its E2F-binding site. Rb recruitment of histone deacetylases leads to the repression of genes at E2F-regulated promoters due to nucleosome formation. Some genes activated during the G1/S transition such as cyclin E are repressed by HDAC during early to mid-G1 phase. This suggests that HDAC-assisted repression of cell cycle progression genes is crucial for the ability of Rb to arrest cells in G1. To further add to this point, the HDAC-Rb complex is shown to be disrupted by cyclin D/Cdk4 which levels increase and peak during the late G1 phase.\n\n== Senescence induced by Rb ==\nSenescence in cells is a state in which cells are metabolically active but are no longer able to replicate. Rb is an important regulator of senescence in cells and since this prevents proliferation, senescence is an important antitumor mechanism. Rb may occupy E2F-regulated promoters during senescence. For example, Rb was detected on the cyclin A and [[PCNA]] promoters in senescent cells.\n\n=== S-phase arrest ===\nCells respond to stress in the form of DNA damage, activated oncogenes, or sub-par growing conditions, and can enter a senescence-like state called \"premature senescence\". This allows the cell to prevent further replication during periods of damaged DNA or general unfavorable conditions. DNA damage in a cell can induce Rb activation. Rb's role in repressing the transcription of cell cycle progression genes leads to the S phase arrest that prevents replication of damaged DNA.\n\n== Activation and inactivation ==\n{{see also|cyclin-dependent kinase|DREAM complex}}\nWhen it is time for a cell to enter S phase, complexes of [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active.<ref name=\"M\u00fcnger and Howley\"/> When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. cyclin E and cyclin A), which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases, and a molecule called proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or [[PCNA]], which speeds DNA replication and [[DNA repair|repair]] by helping to attach [[DNA polymerase|polymerase]] to DNA.<ref name=\"Funk\"/><ref name=\"Greenblatt\"/><ref name=\"Das\"/><ref name=\"Korenjak and Brehm\"/><ref name=\"M\u00fcnger and Howley\"/><ref name=\"De Veylder\"/><ref name=\"Das\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Das SK, Hashimoto T, Shimizu K, Yoshida T, Sakai T, Sowa Y, Komoto A, Kanazawa K | display-authors = 6 | title = Fucoxanthin induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in human colon carcinoma cells through up-regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1726 | issue = 3 | pages = 328\u201335 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16236452 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2005.09.007 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bartkova\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartkova J, Gr\u00f8n B, Dabelsteen E, Bartek J | title = Cell-cycle regulatory proteins in human wound healing | journal = Archives of Oral Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 125\u201332 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12642231 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-9969(02)00202-9 }}</ref>\n\n=== Inactivation ===\nSince the 1990s, Rb was known to be inactivated via phosphorylation.

Importantly, different mono-phosphorylated forms of RB have distinct transcriptional outputs that are extended beyond E2F regulation. <ref name=\"Sanidas\" />\n\n==== Hyper-phosphorylation ====\nAfter a cell passes the restriction point, Cyclin E - Cdk 2 hyper-phosphorylates all mono-phosphorylated isoforms. While the exact mechanism is unknown, one hypothesis is that binding to the C-terminus tail opens the pocket subunit, allowing access to all phosphorylation sites. This process is hysteretic and irreversible, and it is thought accumulation of mono-phosphorylated Rb induces the process. The bistable, switch like behavior of Rb can thus be modeled as a bifurcation point:<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Passing_the_restriction_point_triggers_immediate_hyper-phosphorylation_of_mono-phosphorylated_Rb.png|thumb|Hyper-phosphorylation of mono-phosphorylated Rb is an irreversible event that allows entry into S phase.]]\n\n=== Control of Rb function by phosphorylation ===\nPresence of un-phosphorylated Rb drives cell cycle exit and maintains senescence. At the end of mitosis, PP1 dephosphorylates hyper-phosphorylated Rb directly to its un-phosphorylated state. Furthermore, when cycling C2C12 myoblast cells differentiated (by being placed into a differentiation medium), only un-phosphorylated Rb was present. Additionally, these cells had a markedly decreased growth rate and concentration of DNA replication factors (suggesting G0 arrest).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis function of un-phosphorylated Rb gives rise to a hypothesis for the lack of cell cycle control in cancerous cells: Deregulation of Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6 phosphorylates un-phosphorylated Rb in senescent cells to mono-phosphorylated Rb, causing them to enter G1. The mechanism of the switch for Cyclin E activation is not known, but one hypothesis is that it is a metabolic sensor. Mono-phosphorylated Rb induces an increase in metabolism, so the accumulation of mono-phosphorylated Rb in previously G0 cells then causes hyper-phosphorylation and mitotic entry. Since any un-phosphorylated Rb is immediately phosphorylated, the cell is then unable to exit the cell cycle, resulting in continuous division.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDNA damage to G0 cells activates Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6, resulting in mono-phosphorylation of un-phosphorylated Rb. Then, active mono-phosphorylated Rb causes repression of E2F-targeted genes specifically. Therefore, mono-phosphorylated Rb is thought to play an active role in DNA damage response, so that E2F gene repression occurs until the damage is fixed and the cell can pass the restriction point. As a side note, the discovery that damages causes Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6 activation even in G0 cells should be kept in mind when patients are treated with both DNA damaging chemotherapy and Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6 inhibitors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Activation ===\nDuring the M-to-G1 transition, pRb is then progressively dephosphorylated by [[PP1]], returning to its growth-suppressive hypophosphorylated state Rb.<ref name=\"M\u00fcnger and Howley\"/><ref name=\"Vietri2006\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vietri M, Bianchi M, Ludlow JW, Mittnacht S, Villa-Moruzzi E | title = Direct interaction between the catalytic subunit of Protein Phosphatase 1 and pRb | journal = Cancer Cell International | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 3 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16466572 | pmc = 1382259 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2867-6-3 }}</ref>\n\nRb family proteins are components of the [[DREAM complex]] composed of DP, E2F4/5, RB-like (p130/p107) And MuvB (Lin9:Lin37:Lin52:RbAbP4:Lin54). The DREAM complex is assembled in Go/G1 and maintains quiescence by assembling at the promoters of > 800 cell-cycle genes and mediating transcriptional repression. Assembly of DREAM requires DYRK1A (Ser/Thr kinase) dependant phosphorylation of the MuvB core component, Lin52 at Serine28. This mechanism is crucial for recruitment of p130/p107 to the MuvB core and thus DREAM assembly.\n\n== Consequences of Rb loss ==\nConsequences of loss of Rb function is dependent on cell type and cell cycle status, as Rb's tumor suppressive role changes depending on the state and current identity of the cell. \n\nIn G0 quiescent stem cells, Rb is proposed to maintain G0 arrest although the mechanism remains largely unknown. Loss of Rb leads to exit from quiescence and an increase in the number of cells without loss of cell renewal capacity. In cycling progenitor cells, Rb plays a role at the G1, S, and G2 checkpoints and promotes differentiation.

Once wild-type mammals have reached adulthood, their cochlear hair cells become incapable of proliferation. In studies where the gene for Rb is deleted in mice cochlea, hair cells continue to proliferate in early adulthood.

Ships that carry this sort of cargo are called general cargo ships. \n\n== Description ==\nThe term ''break bulk'' derives from the phrase '''breaking bulk'''\u2014the extraction of a portion of the [[cargo]] of a [[ship]] or the beginning of the unloading process from the ship's holds.  These goods may not be in [[shipping container]]s. Break bulk cargo is transported in [[bag]]s, [[box]]es, [[crate]]s, [[Drum (container)|drums]], or [[barrel]]s.  [[Unit load]]s of items secured to a [[pallet]] or skid are also used.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 31. {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\nA break-in-bulk point is a place where goods are transferred from one mode of transport to another, for example the docks where goods transfer from ship to truck.\n\nBreak bulk was the most common form of cargo for most of the history of shipping. Since the late 1960s the volume of break bulk cargo has declined dramatically worldwide as [[containerization]] has grown. Moving cargo on and off ship in containers is much more efficient, allowing ships to spend less time in port. Break bulk cargo also suffered from greater theft and damage.\n\n{{:List of cargo types}}\n\n==Loading and unloading==\n[[File:Queens Wharf, Port Adelaide, before 1927.jpeg|thumb|Mixed cargo being loaded into ships at [[Port Adelaide]] circa 1927]]\n[[File:L\u00f6schen von Fassgut, Accra auf Reede, in der Luke 1958-59.jpg|thumb|Unloading barrels from a ship, Accra, circa 1958]]\n[[File:Gladstone Star in Nelson.jpg|thumb|right|A refrigerated general cargo ship. ''Gladstone Star'' was built in 1957 and scrapped in 1982.]]\n\nAlthough cargo of this sort can be delivered straight from a truck or train onto a ship, the most common way is for the cargo to be delivered to the dock in advance of the arrival of the ship and for the cargo to be stored in [[warehouse]]s. When the ship arrives the cargo is then taken from the warehouse to the [[quay]] and then lifted on board by either the ship's gear ([[derrick]]s or [[Crane (machine)#Vessel .28Deck.29 crane|cranes]]) or by the dockside [[Crane (machine)#Harbor cranes|cranes]]. The discharge of the ship is the reverse of the loading operation.\n\nLoading and discharging by break bulk is labour-intensive. The cargo is brought to the quay next to the ship and then each individual item is lifted on board separately. Some items such as sacks or bags can be loaded in batches by using a sling or [[cargo net]] and others such as cartons can be loaded onto trays before being lifted on board. Once on board each item must be stowed separately.\n\n<!-- {{Howto|section|date=January 2010}} -->\nBefore any loading takes place, any signs of the previous cargo are removed. The holds are swept, washed if necessary and any damage to them repaired. [[Dunnage]] is laid ready for the cargo or is just put in bundles ready for the [[stevedore]]s to lay out as the cargo is loaded.\n\nThere are many sorts of break bulk cargo but amongst them are:\n\n===Bagged cargo===\n[[Bag]]ged [[cargo]] (e.g. coffee in sacks) is stowed on double dunnage and kept clear of the ship's sides and bulk heads. Bags are kept away from pillars and stanchions by covering it with matting or waterproof paper.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 32: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Baled goods===\nBaled goods are stowed on single dunnage at least {{convert|50|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} thick. The bales must be clean with all the bands intact. Stained or oily bales are rejected. All fibres can absorb oil and are liable to spontaneous combustion. As a result, they are kept clear of any new paintwork. Bales close to the deckhead are covered to prevent damage by dripping sweat.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 33: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Barrels and casks===\n[[Wood]]en [[barrel]]s are stowed on their sides on \"beds\" of dunnage which keeps the middle of the side (the bilge) off the deck and they are stowed with the bung at the top. To prevent movement, wedges called quoins are put in on top of the \"beds\". Barrels should be stowed fore and aft and not athwart ships. Once the first tier has been loaded the next tier of barrels fits into the hollows between the barrels, this is known as stowing \"bilge and cantline\".<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 35: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\nBarrels which are also known as casks or tuns are primarily use for transporting liquids such as wine, water, brandy, whiskey, and even oil.  They are usually built in spherical shape to make it easier to roll and have less friction when changing direction.\n\n===Corrugated boxes===\n{{Main|Corrugated box design|strapping}}\n[[Corrugated fiberboard|Corrugated]] [[Box#Packaging box|boxes]] are stowed on a good layer of dunnage and kept clear of any moisture. Military and weather-resistant grades of [[corrugated fiberboard]] are available.  They are not overstowed with anything other than similar boxes. They are frequently loaded on [[pallet]]s to form a [[unit load]]; if so the slings that are used to load the cargo are frequently left on to facilitate discharge.<ref name=\"Young page 37\">''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 37: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Wooden shipping containers===\n[[Wooden box]]es or [[crate]]s are stowed on double dunnage in the holds and single dunnage in the 'tween decks. Heavy boxes are given bottom stowage. The loading slings are often left on to aid discharge.<ref name=\"Young page 37\" />\n\n===Drums===\n[[File:Loading paper rolls in the port of Hamina (Finland) March 2016.jpg|thumb|Loading paper rolls in the port of [[Hamina]] (Finland) March 2016]]\n{{Main|Drum (container)}}\nMetal drums are stowed on end with dunnage between tiers, in the longitudinal space of the ship.<ref>{{cite book|title=Notes on Cargo Work |first1=J. F. |last1=Kemp |first2=Peter |last2=Young |year=1971 |edition=3rd |page=38 |isbn=0-85309-040-8}}</ref>\n\n===Paper reels===\nReels or rolls are generally stowed on their sides and care is taken to make sure they are not crushed.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 39: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Motor vehicles===\n[[Automobiles]] are lifted on board and then secured using [[Lashing (ropework)|lashings]]. Great care is taken to prevent damage.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 40: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>  Vehicles are prepared by removing hazardous liquids ([[gasoline]], etc.). This is in contrast to [[Roll-on/roll-off#Car carriers|ro-ro]] ([[roll-on/roll-off]]) vessels where vehicles are driven on and off the ship under their own power.\n\n===Steel girders===\n{{Main|Girder|Structural steel}}\nAny long heavy items are stowed fore and aft. If they are stowed athwart ships they are liable to shift if the ship rolls heavily and pierce the side of the ship.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\nThe biggest disadvantage with break bulk is that it requires more resources at the wharf at both ends of the transport\u2014longshoremen, loading cranes, warehouses, transport vehicles\u2014and often takes up more dock space due to multiple vessels carrying multiple loads of break bulk cargo.  Indeed, the decline of break bulk did not start with containerisation; rather, the advent of tankers and bulk carriers reduced the need for transporting liquids in barrels and grains in sacks. Such tankers and carriers use specialised ships and shore facilities to deliver larger amounts of cargo to the dock and effect faster turnarounds with fewer personnel once the ship arrives; however, they do require large initial investments in ships, machinery, and training, slowing their spread to areas where funds to overhaul port operations and/or training for dock personnel in the handling of cargo on the newer vessels may not be available.  As modernization of ports and shipping fleets spreads across the world, the advantages of using containerization and specialized ships over break-bulk has sped the overall decline of break-bulk operations around the world.  In all, the new systems have reduced costs as well as spillage and turnaround times; in the case of containerisation, damage and theft as well.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\nBreak bulk continues to hold an advantage in areas where port development has not kept pace with shipping technology; break-bulk shipping requires relatively minimal shore facilities\u2014a wharf for the ship to tie to, dock workers to assist in unloading, warehouses to store materials for later reloading onto other forms of transport. As a result, there are still some areas where break-bulk shipping continues to thrive.  Goods shipped break-bulk can also be offloaded onto smaller vessels and [[lighter (ship)|lighters]] for transport into even the most minimally-developed port which the normally large [[container ship]]s, tankers, and bulk carriers might not be able to access due to size and/or water depth.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}  In addition, some ports capable of accepting larger container ships/tankers/bulk transporters still require goods to be offloaded in break-bulk fashion; for example, in the outlying islands of [[Tuvalu]], fuel oil for the power stations is delivered in bulk but has to be offloaded in barrels.<ref>[http://www.e8.org/Projects/Fiji/Attendees_fichiers/Presentation%20Tuvalu%20Electricity%20Corporation.pdf Tuvalu Electricity Corporation Presentation], Taaku Sekielu and Polu Tanei (PDF)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Marc Levinson, ''[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]'' (Princeton Univ.

Break bulk cargo also suffered from greater theft and damage.\n\n{{:List of cargo types}}\n\n==Loading and unloading==\n[[File:Queens Wharf, Port Adelaide, before 1927.jpeg|thumb|Mixed cargo being loaded into ships at [[Port Adelaide]] circa 1927]]\n[[File:L\u00f6schen von Fassgut, Accra auf Reede, in der Luke 1958-59.jpg|thumb|Unloading barrels from a ship, Accra, circa 1958]]\n[[File:Gladstone Star in Nelson.jpg|thumb|right|A refrigerated general cargo ship. ''Gladstone Star'' was built in 1957 and scrapped in 1982.]]\n\nAlthough cargo of this sort can be delivered straight from a truck or train onto a ship, the most common way is for the cargo to be delivered to the dock in advance of the arrival of the ship and for the cargo to be stored in [[warehouse]]s. When the ship arrives the cargo is then taken from the warehouse to the [[quay]] and then lifted on board by either the ship's gear ([[derrick]]s or [[Crane (machine)#Vessel .28Deck.29 crane|cranes]]) or by the dockside [[Crane (machine)#Harbor cranes|cranes]]. The discharge of the ship is the reverse of the loading operation.\n\nLoading and discharging by break bulk is labour-intensive. The cargo is brought to the quay next to the ship and then each individual item is lifted on board separately. Some items such as sacks or bags can be loaded in batches by using a sling or [[cargo net]] and others such as cartons can be loaded onto trays before being lifted on board. Once on board each item must be stowed separately.\n\n<!-- {{Howto|section|date=January 2010}} -->\nBefore any loading takes place, any signs of the previous cargo are removed. The holds are swept, washed if necessary and any damage to them repaired. [[Dunnage]] is laid ready for the cargo or is just put in bundles ready for the [[stevedore]]s to lay out as the cargo is loaded.\n\nThere are many sorts of break bulk cargo but amongst them are:\n\n===Bagged cargo===\n[[Bag]]ged [[cargo]] (e.g. coffee in sacks) is stowed on double dunnage and kept clear of the ship's sides and bulk heads. Bags are kept away from pillars and stanchions by covering it with matting or waterproof paper.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 32: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Baled goods===\nBaled goods are stowed on single dunnage at least {{convert|50|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} thick. The bales must be clean with all the bands intact. Stained or oily bales are rejected. All fibres can absorb oil and are liable to spontaneous combustion. As a result, they are kept clear of any new paintwork. Bales close to the deckhead are covered to prevent damage by dripping sweat.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 33: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Barrels and casks===\n[[Wood]]en [[barrel]]s are stowed on their sides on \"beds\" of dunnage which keeps the middle of the side (the bilge) off the deck and they are stowed with the bung at the top. To prevent movement, wedges called quoins are put in on top of the \"beds\". Barrels should be stowed fore and aft and not athwart ships. Once the first tier has been loaded the next tier of barrels fits into the hollows between the barrels, this is known as stowing \"bilge and cantline\".<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 35: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\nBarrels which are also known as casks or tuns are primarily use for transporting liquids such as wine, water, brandy, whiskey, and even oil.  They are usually built in spherical shape to make it easier to roll and have less friction when changing direction.\n\n===Corrugated boxes===\n{{Main|Corrugated box design|strapping}}\n[[Corrugated fiberboard|Corrugated]] [[Box#Packaging box|boxes]] are stowed on a good layer of dunnage and kept clear of any moisture. Military and weather-resistant grades of [[corrugated fiberboard]] are available.  They are not overstowed with anything other than similar boxes. They are frequently loaded on [[pallet]]s to form a [[unit load]]; if so the slings that are used to load the cargo are frequently left on to facilitate discharge.<ref name=\"Young page 37\">''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 37: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Wooden shipping containers===\n[[Wooden box]]es or [[crate]]s are stowed on double dunnage in the holds and single dunnage in the 'tween decks. Heavy boxes are given bottom stowage. The loading slings are often left on to aid discharge.<ref name=\"Young page 37\" />\n\n===Drums===\n[[File:Loading paper rolls in the port of Hamina (Finland) March 2016.jpg|thumb|Loading paper rolls in the port of [[Hamina]] (Finland) March 2016]]\n{{Main|Drum (container)}}\nMetal drums are stowed on end with dunnage between tiers, in the longitudinal space of the ship.<ref>{{cite book|title=Notes on Cargo Work |first1=J. F. |last1=Kemp |first2=Peter |last2=Young |year=1971 |edition=3rd |page=38 |isbn=0-85309-040-8}}</ref>\n\n===Paper reels===\nReels or rolls are generally stowed on their sides and care is taken to make sure they are not crushed.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 39: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>\n\n===Motor vehicles===\n[[Automobiles]] are lifted on board and then secured using [[Lashing (ropework)|lashings]]. Great care is taken to prevent damage.<ref>''Notes on Cargo Work'' by J. F. Kemp and Peter Young, 1971 (3rd edition); page 40: {{ISBN|0-85309-040-8}}.</ref>  Vehicles are prepared by removing hazardous liquids ([[gasoline]], etc.). This is in contrast to [[Roll-on/roll-off#Car carriers|ro-ro]] ([[roll-on/roll-off]]) vessels where vehicles are driven on and off the ship under their own power.\n\n===Steel girders===\n{{Main|Girder|Structural steel}}\nAny long heavy items are stowed fore and aft. If they are stowed athwart ships they are liable to shift if the ship rolls heavily and pierce the side of the ship.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\nThe biggest disadvantage with break bulk is that it requires more resources at the wharf at both ends of the transport\u2014longshoremen, loading cranes, warehouses, transport vehicles\u2014and often takes up more dock space due to multiple vessels carrying multiple loads of break bulk cargo.  Indeed, the decline of break bulk did not start with containerisation; rather, the advent of tankers and bulk carriers reduced the need for transporting liquids in barrels and grains in sacks. Such tankers and carriers use specialised ships and shore facilities to deliver larger amounts of cargo to the dock and effect faster turnarounds with fewer personnel once the ship arrives; however, they do require large initial investments in ships, machinery, and training, slowing their spread to areas where funds to overhaul port operations and/or training for dock personnel in the handling of cargo on the newer vessels may not be available.  As modernization of ports and shipping fleets spreads across the world, the advantages of using containerization and specialized ships over break-bulk has sped the overall decline of break-bulk operations around the world.  In all, the new systems have reduced costs as well as spillage and turnaround times; in the case of containerisation, damage and pilfering as well.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}\n\nBreak bulk continues to hold an advantage in areas where port development has not kept pace with shipping technology; break-bulk shipping requires relatively minimal shore facilities\u2014a wharf for the ship to tie to, dock workers to assist in unloading, warehouses to store materials for later reloading onto other forms of transport. As a result, there are still some areas where break-bulk shipping continues to thrive.  Goods shipped break-bulk can also be offloaded onto smaller vessels and [[lighter (ship)|lighters]] for transport into even the most minimally-developed port which the normally large [[container ship]]s, tankers, and bulk carriers might not be able to access due to size and/or water depth.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}  In addition, some ports capable of accepting larger container ships/tankers/bulk transporters still require goods to be offloaded in break-bulk fashion; for example, in the outlying islands of [[Tuvalu]], fuel oil for the power stations is delivered in bulk but has to be offloaded in barrels.<ref>[http://www.e8.org/Projects/Fiji/Attendees_fichiers/Presentation%20Tuvalu%20Electricity%20Corporation.pdf Tuvalu Electricity Corporation Presentation], Taaku Sekielu and Polu Tanei (PDF)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Marc Levinson, ''[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]'' (Princeton Univ.

It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.\n\n==Origins and history==\nEarly mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:<ref>{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin? | access-date=2016-01-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204224225/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | archive-date=2016-02-04 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.<br>\n'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | ''Love's Labour's Lost'', William Shakespeare}}\n\nAn 1866 article describes a \"hog latin\" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin.

'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing,\" although the jargon is dog Latin.\n\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: \"They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129214016/http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ |date=2016-01-29 }}<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too.

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience.

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.
