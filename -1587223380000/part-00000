{"title_page": "Crossover experiment (chemistry)", "text_new": "In [[chemistry]], a '''crossover experiment''' is a method used to study the [[Reaction mechanism|mechanism]] of a [[chemical reaction]]. In a crossover experiment, two similar but distinguishable reactants simultaneously undergo a reaction as part of the same reaction mixture. The products formed will either correspond directly to one of the two reactants (non-crossover products) or will include components of both reactants (crossover products). The aim of a crossover experiment is to determine whether or not a reaction process involves a stage where the components of each reactant have an opportunity to exchange with each other.\n\nThe results of crossover experiments are often straightforward to analyze, making them one of the most useful and most frequently applied methods of mechanistic study. In [[organic chemistry]] crossover experiments are most often used to distinguish between [[Intramolecular reaction|intramolecular]] and [[intermolecular]] reactions.<ref name=\"One\">Carroll, Felix A.; Perspectives on Structure and Mechanism in Organic Chemistry; Brooks/Cole Publishing, Pacific Grove, CA, 1998.</ref><ref name=\"Two\">Brucker, Reinhard; Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reaction Mechanisms; Academic Press, San Diego, 2002.</ref><ref>http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/en/ch/12/oc/vlu_organik/aufklaerung/aufklaerung_e_kreuz_kinetik.vlu.html</ref>\n[[Inorganic chemistry|Inorganic]] and [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] chemists rely heavily on crossover experiments, and in particular [[isotopic labeling]] experiments, for support or contradiction of proposed mechanisms.<ref name=\"Three\">Crabtree, Robert H.; The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals; Third Ed.

Many mechanistic studies include both crossover experiments and measurements of [[Reaction rate|rate]] and [[kinetic isotope effect]]s.\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nCrossover experiments allow for experimental study of a reaction mechanism. [[Reaction mechanism|Mechanistic]] studies are of interest to theoretical and experimental chemists for a variety of reasons including prediction of [[Stereochemistry|stereochemical]] outcomes, optimization of reaction conditions for rate and selectivity, and design of improved [[Catalysis|catalysts]] for better turnover number, robustness, etc.<ref name=\"Five\">{{cite book|author=Xiaoping Sun|title=Organic Mechanisms: Reactions, Methodology, and Biological Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMYI54-h4kkC|date=5 June 2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-50791-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Six\">Eldik,R. ''Chem. Rev.'' '''2005''', ''105'', 1917.</ref> Since a mechanism cannot be directly observed or determined solely based on the reactants or products, mechanisms are challenging to study experimentally. Only a handful of experimental methods are capable of providing information about the mechanism of a reaction, including crossover experiments, studies of the kinetic isotope effect, and rate variations by substituent. The crossover experiment has the advantage of being conceptually straightforward and relatively easy to design, carry out, and interpret. In modern mechanistic studies, crossover experiments and KIE studies are commonly used in conjunction with [[Computational chemistry|computational]] methods.<ref name=\"Seven\">Crabtree, R. H.; ''Dalton Trans.'', '''2013''', ''42'', 4104.</ref>\n\n== Theory ==\n[[File:General Crossover Experiment Scheme Claisen.png|550px|center]]\nThe concept underlying the crossover experiment is a basic one: provided that the labeling method chosen does not affect the way a reaction proceeds, a shift in the labeling as observed in the products can be attributed to the reaction mechanism. The most important limitation in crossover experiment design is therefore that the labeling not affect the reaction mechanism itself.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\nIt can be difficult to know whether or not the changes made to reactants for a crossover experiment will affect the mechanism by which the reaction proceeds. This is particularly true since the aim of the crossover experiment is to provide insight into the mechanism that would allow these types of predictions. There is always the possibility that a label will alter the course of the reaction.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\nIn practice, crossover experiments aim to use the least change possible between the usual conditions of the reaction being studied and the conditions of the crossover experiment. This principle favors isotopic labeling, since changing the isotope of one atom in a molecule is the smallest change that can be both easily enacted and traced in the reaction. If the isotope is placed in the molecule at a position directly involved in the mechanism of the reaction, a [[kinetic isotope effect]] is expected. This can be used to study aspects of the mechanism independently or alongside a crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Two\" /><ref name=\"Seven\" /> The kinetic isotope effect is a change in the rate of reaction based on the change in isotope, not a change in the mechanism of the reaction itself, so isotopic labeling generally satisfies the requirements for a valid crossover experiment. In crossover experiments that do not use isotopic labeling, addition or subtraction of a methyl substituent at a position not involved in any proposed mechanism for the reaction is typically expected to give a valid crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n== Design ==\n\nIn designing a crossover experiment the first task is to propose possible mechanisms for the reaction being studied. Based on these possible mechanisms, the goal is to determine either a traditional crossover experiment or an isotope scrambling experiment that will enable the researcher to distinguish between the two or more possible mechanisms. Often many methods of mechanistic study will have to be employed to support or discount all of the mechanisms proposed. However, in some cases a crossover experiment alone will be able to distinguish between the main possibilities, for example in the case of intramolecular vs. intermolecular organic reaction mechanisms.\n\nThe mechanism of the thermal [[Claisen rearrangement]] has been studied by crossover experiment and serves as an excellent example of how to apply this technique.<ref name=\"Eight\">{{cite book|author=Aditi Sangal|title=Krishna's Advanced Organic Chemistry; Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH6vVI4C3PMC|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|isbn=978-81-8283-078-3}}</ref> Before the mechanism was determined, it was proposed that the reaction could proceed via an intermolecular or intramolecular route.<ref name=\"One\" /> \n[[File:Claisen possible mechanisms.png|475px|center]]\nLooking at these two proposed mechanisms, it is clear that a crossover experiment will be suitable for distinguishing between them, as is generally the case for inter- and intramolecular mechanisms. The next step in crossover experiment design is to propose labeled reactants. For a non-isotopic labeling method the smallest perturbation to the system will be by addition of a methyl group at an unreactive position.\n\nPredicting the products given by each mechanism will show whether or not a given crossover experiment design can distinguish between the mechanisms in question. This is particularly relevant when employing an isotopic label. It is possible that labeling at one position could distinguish between only two of several possible mechanisms, while placing the isotopic label at a different position could distinguish between three potential mechanisms or provide insight into transition states or intermediates, etc. After the interpretational value is established it is relevant to consider the practical aspects, such as whether or not the synthesis of the proposed reactant is possible, and how easy or difficult it is to distinguish the predicted products for each proposed mechanism and starting materials.\n\nFor the Claisen rearrangement, labeling by addition of a single methyl group produces an under-labeled system. The resulting crossover experiment would not be useful as a mechanistic study since the products of an intermolecular or intramolecular mechanism are identical.\n[[File:Claisen Rearrangemetn Under-labeled.png|530px|center]] \nTo have a sufficiently labeled system, both \u201chalves\u201d of the molecule that would separate in an intermolecular mechanism must be labeled. This is known as a doubly labeled system, and is generally the requirement for a crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /> Predicting the products of each mechanism then shows that the crossover products are distinct from the non-crossover products. Once this has been established and the products predicted, the experiment can be carried out and the products characterized. When isotopic labeling is used the products are often more varied and the distribution of the label more convoluted. In this case it is also important to explicitly predict the relative amounts of the label expected to appear at each position depending on the mechanism.\n[[File:Claisen Rearrangement Doubly Labeled System.png|530px|center]] \nWhen the crossover experiment on the Claisen rearrangement is carried out only non-crossover products are observed. Based on this the mechanism is determined to be intramolecular, as depicted in the standard [[Arrow pushing|arrow-pushing]] mechanism for this rearrangement.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Nine\" />\n\n== Isotopic labeling experiment ==\n\nAn isotopic labeling experiment is an experiment used in mechanistic study that employs isotopes as labels and traces these labels in the products. Isotopic labeling experiments are commonly considered to be a type of crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /> However, there are far more possibilities for the manner of labeling and potential products in an isotopic labeling experiment than in a traditional crossover experiment. The classification of an isotopic labeling experiment as a crossover experiment is based on the similar underlying concept, goal, and design principles in the two experiments rather than on direct similarity. An isotopic labeling experiment can be designed to be directly analogous to a traditional crossover experiment, but there are many additional ways of carrying out isotopic labeling experiments.\n\nAlthough isotopic labeling experiments have the advantage of using the smallest perturbation to the reaction system, they are limited by the possibility of isotopic exchange with solvent or other species present in the reaction mixture. If the isotopic label exchanges with another isotope of the same atom in the solvent, the results of an isotopic labeling experiment are unusable. This limits the use of deuterium labeling at certain positions in protic solvents, for example. However, this exchange can be useful when investigating interaction with the solvent of a reaction, since isotopic labeling can detect this interaction.\n\nIsotopic labeling experiments have been carried out on the thermal Claisen rearrangement. When the terminal carbon is labeled with <sup>14</sup>C, there is only one product, with the isotopic label appearing at the benzylic position. Since the expected product of an intermolecular mechanism is not observed the conclusion matches that of the traditional crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Nine\">{{cite book|author1=Francis A. Carey|author2=Richard J. Sundberg|title=Advanced Organic Chemistry: Part A: Structure and Mechanisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5dYyJMBhCoC|date=13 June 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-44897-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Claisen Rearrangement Isotopic Labeling.png|500px|center]]\n\n== Characterization ==\n\nA major advantage of the crossover experiment is that the results of the experiment are obtained by direct characterization of the product. The techniques involved are therefore those already familiar to the experimental chemist. [[Mass spectrometry]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] are the two most common ways of determining the products and their relative ratios. NMR spectroscopy is particularly useful for isotopic labeling studies that use isotopes of hydrogen or carbon.\n\nIR spectroscopy can be useful in specialized situations, such as when <sup>13</sup>CO was used to probe the mechanism of alkyl insertion into metal-carbon monoxide bonds to form metal-acyl complexes. Tracking the <sup>13</sup>CO in the products was accomplished using [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR spectroscopy]] because the greater mass of <sup>13</sup>C compared to <sup>12</sup>C produces a distinctive shift of the \u03bd(CO) stretching frequency to lower energy.<ref name=\"Three\" />\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\nThe products that are expected from any given mechanism are determined during the design of the crossover experiment. This can be quite complicated to establish, but it makes for straightforward interpretation of the results. If the observed products match those predicted by a given mechanism, then it is reasonable to conclude that mechanism is operating in the reaction. If the results do not match any expected distribution, it is necessary to consider alternate mechanisms and/or the possibility that the labeling has affected the way the reaction proceeds.\n\nFor crossover experiments used to distinguish between intermolecular and intramolecular reactions, the absence of crossover products is less conclusive than the presence of crossover products. This is because solvent cage effects could be masking an intermolecular mechanism.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Four\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nCrossover experiments have several limitations. Although useful for distinguishing between proposed reaction mechanisms, they are limited in their ability to provide insight into a mechanism beyond what has already been proposed. The design of a useful crossover experiment relies on having a proposed mechanism on which to base predictions of the label distribution in the products. If the results do not match any expected outcome, the actual mechanism is not obvious from the crossover experiment results. An additional limitation is of course that some systems are just not suitable for crossover experiments. This could be the case if addition of a label alters the mechanism or stops the reaction entirely, if there is no proposed mechanism, if isotopic labels exchange with solvent molecules, or if it is not feasible to synthesize the labeled species necessary for a crossover experiment.\n\n=== Solvent cage effect ===\n\nOne of the major limitations of the crossover experiment is that it cannot rule out the possibility that solvent cage effects are masking a dissociation mechanism. If crossover products are observed, the evidence that the mechanism cannot be purely intramolecular is conclusive. However, a lack of crossover products is not conclusive evidence that the mechanism is solely intramolecular.

This is an appropriate representation of a reaction in a crossover experiment occurring via an intermolecular mechanism and forming crossover products as expected. \n[[File:Solventcagelongfinal.png|800px|center]] \nWhen the timescale of the reaction is faster than or on the same order as the timescale of the solvent cage effect this is a more accurate representation of the same crossover experiment as above. Although a dissociative or intermolecular mechanism is occurring, no crossover occurs because the timescale of the reaction is sufficiently short that the dissociated fragment remains trapped within the solvent cage.\n[[File:Solventcageshortfinal.png|520px|center]]\n\nThe effect of the solvent cage on crossover experiments is not a purely theoretical concept. One of the first pieces of experimental evidence for the existence of the solvent cage was the observation of the solvent cage effect on a crossover experiment.

Catalytic mechanisms are particularly challenging to study in cases where no metal complex at all aside from the pre-catalyst can be isolated. In the 2013 themed issue of Dalton Transactions entitled \u201cMechanistic Organometallic Chemistry,\u201d guest editor [[Robert H. Crabtree]] recounts a story in which at the midpoint of 20th century the founder of metal carbonyl hydride chemistry referred to organometallic mechanisms as \u201cchemical philosophy.\u201d<ref name=\"Seven\" /> The themed issue goes on to present seventeen examples of modern mechanistic studies of organometallic reactions. In many cases, crossover experiments, isotope scrambling experiments, kinetic isotope effects, and computational studies are used in conjunction to clarify even a few aspects of an organometallic mechanism.\n\nCrossover experiments provide such uniquely useful insight into inorganic mechanisms that on occasion unusual isotopes are employed for an essential crossover experiment. In the work of E.L. Muetterties on dirhenium decacarbonyl, a crossover experiment was carried out using <sup>185</sup>Re and <sup>187</sup>Re to determine the mechanism of substitution reactions of rhenium carbonyl dimers. Mass spectrometry was used to distinguish between these isotopes in the products.

In catalytic cycles that form C-H or C-C bonds reductive elimination is often the final product-forming step.<ref name=\"Seventeen\">{{cite book|author=Royal Society of Chemistry (Great Britain). Faraday Division|title=Quantum Inorganic Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5Xu3vHzKk4C|year=2003|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-85404-967-7}}</ref>\nSquare planar d<sup>8</sup> metal complexes are often the active catalysts in C-H or C-C bond forming reactions, and reductive elimination from these species is well understood. There are several known mechanisms for reductive elimination from square planar d<sup>8</sup> complexes. In a dissociative mechanism one ligand dissociates and reductive elimination occurs from a three-coordinate intermediate. In a nondissociative mechanism reductive elimination occurs from the square planar complex itself. The ligands undergoing reductive elimination must be ''cis'' to each other or otherwise must rearrange to be ''cis'' before they can reductively eliminate. Finally, in an associative mechanism a fifth ligand associates and reductive elimination occurs between two adjacent groups on the resulting square pyramidal complex.<ref name=\"Three\" />\n\nRegardless of the specific mechanism, it is consistently true that reductive elimination is an intramolecular process that couples two adjacent ligands. Although this may now seem obvious, when organometallic mechanisms were first being studied there was no proof of these restrictions. A series of crossover experiments experiment reported by [[John Kenneth Stille|J. Stille]] were among the first experiments to demonstrate that reductive elimination is an intramolecular process and that non-adjacent groups do not reductively eliminate.<ref name=\"Three\" /><ref name=\"Eighteen\">Gillie, S. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1980''', ''102'', 4933.</ref><ref name= \"Nineteen\">http://www.ilpi.com/organomet/reductive.html</ref>\nSeveral square planar d<sup>8</sup> palladium species were used in the study, with each one having two bound phosphine ligands and two bound methyl groups. One complex, Pd(dppe)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, was locked in a ''cis''-confirmation by the chelating phosphine 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe). A second complex, Pd(transphos)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> was locked in a trans-confirmation by \u201ctransphos,\u201d a chelating phosphine with a rigid aromatic linker.<ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n[[File:Three palladium complexes.png|460px|center]]\n\nThe complexes with ''cis''-methyl groups were already known to undergo reductive elimination to form ethane. A crossover experiment was performed on both Pd(dppe)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. In both cases no crossover products were observed, proving the intramolecular nature of reductive elimination.<ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n[[File:Stille crossover.png|540px|center]]\n\nUnlike the two ''cis''-confirmation complexes, Pd(transphos)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> did not undergo reductive elimination even when heated to 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, addition of methyl iodide to Pd(transphos)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> immediately produced ethane. To determine whether or not this reductive elimination was also constrained to only adjacent ligands, an isotope labeling experiment was carried out. The only product was the deuterium-labeled product of ''cis''-elimination. This led to the final conclusion that only ligands adjacent to each other on the metal complex are capable of reductively eliminating.<ref name=\"Three\" /><ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n[[File:Isotope labeling reductive elimination Stille.png|540px|center]]\n\nThis study also tracked and analyzed reaction rate data, demonstrating the value of employing multiple strategies in a concerted effort to gain as much information as possible about a chemical process. Among other rate experiments, the reaction rates of the ''cis''-trans isomerism were followed as solvent and concentration of excess phosphine ligand were varied. These results were used to establish a mechanism for this isomerization in square planar d<sup>8</sup> palladium species that consists of solvent or phosphine association followed by pseudorotation and subsequent dissociation of the solvent or phosphine.<ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n\n== Biochemistry ==\n\nThe mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions can also be studied using crossover experiments. Examples of the application of this technique in [[biochemistry]] include the study of reactions catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphohexose-4,6-dehydratases, the aconitase-catalyzed elimination of water from citrate, and various reactions catalyzed by coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzymes, among others. Unlike isotope labeling studies in organic and organometallic chemistry, which typically use deuterium when an isotope of hydrogen is desired, biochemical crossover experiments frequently employ [[tritium]].<ref name=\"Twenty\">Silverman, Richard B.; The Organic Chemistry of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions; Academic Press, London, 2002.</ref> This is due to the fact that tritium is radioactive and can be tracked using the [[autoradiograph]]s of gels in [[gel electrophoresis]].\n\n=== Mechanism of aconitase action ===\n\nIsotope labeling experiments and crossover experiments were essential to early efforts to understand the mechanism of [[aconitase]] action. Isotope scrambling experiments using tritium, deuterium, and <sup>18</sup>O were carried out on the aconitase hydratase reaction by I.A. Rose and E.L. O'Connell.<ref name=\"TwentyOne\">Rose, I.A.; O'Connell, E.L. ''J. Biol. Chem.'' '''1967''', ''242'', 870. http://www.jbc.org/content/242/8/1870.long</ref> Using the results of these experiments it was possible to construct a general mechanism for the reaction.

This reaction produced both unlabeled ''cis''-aconitate and 2-methyl-[3-<sup>3</sup>H]isocitrate. The ability of the reaction to produce intermolecular transfer of tritium at this position indicates that the proton removed from citrate does not exchange with solvent. A similar experiment reacting [2-<sup>18</sup>OH]isocitrate with aconitase failed to produce isotopically labeled citrate, demonstrating that the hydroxyl group, unlike the removed proton, exchanges with solvent every turnover.<ref name=\"Twenty\" /><ref name=\"TwentyOne\" />\n[[File:Aconitase Tritium Crossover Scheme.png|530px|center]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Kinetic isotope effect]] \n* [[Isotopic labeling]] \n* [[Reaction mechanism]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n", "text_old": "In [[chemistry]], a '''crossover experiment''' is a method used to study the [[Reaction mechanism|mechanism]] of a [[chemical reaction]].

H.; ''Dalton Trans.'', '''2013''', ''42'', 4104.</ref>\n\n== Theory ==\n[[File:General Crossover Experiment Scheme Claisen.png|550px|center]]\nThe concept underlying the crossover experiment is a basic one: provided that the labeling method chosen does not affect the way a reaction proceeds, a shift in the labeling as observed in the products can be attributed to the reaction mechanism. The most important limitation in crossover experiment design is therefore that the labeling not affect the reaction mechanism itself.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\nIt can be difficult to know whether or not the changes made to reactants for a crossover experiment will affect the mechanism by which the reaction proceeds. This is particularly true since the aim of the crossover experiment is to provide insight into the mechanism that would allow these types of predictions. There is always the possibility that a label will alter the course of the reaction.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\nIn practice, crossover experiments aim to use the least change possible between the usual conditions of the reaction being studied and the conditions of the crossover experiment. This principle favors isotopic labeling, since changing the isotope of one atom in a molecule is the smallest change that can be both easily enacted and traced in the reaction. If the isotope is placed in the molecule at a position directly involved in the mechanism of the reaction, a [[kinetic isotope effect]] is expected. This can be used to study aspects of the mechanism independently or alongside a crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Two\" /><ref name=\"Seven\" /> The kinetic isotope effect is a change in the rate of reaction based on the change in isotope, not a change in the mechanism of the reaction itself, so isotopic labeling generally satisfies the requirements for a valid crossover experiment. In crossover experiments that do not use isotopic labeling, addition or subtraction of a methyl substituent at a position not involved in any proposed mechanism for the reaction is typically expected to give a valid crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n== Design ==\n\nIn designing a crossover experiment the first task is to propose possible mechanisms for the reaction being studied. Based on these possible mechanisms, the goal is to determine either a traditional crossover experiment or an isotope scrambling experiment that will enable the researcher to distinguish between the two or more possible mechanisms. Often many methods of mechanistic study will have to be employed to support or discount all of the mechanisms proposed. However, in some cases a crossover experiment alone will be able to distinguish between the main possibilities, for example in the case of intramolecular vs. intermolecular organic reaction mechanisms.\n\nThe mechanism of the thermal [[Claisen rearrangement]] has been studied by crossover experiment and serves as an excellent example of how to apply this technique.<ref name=\"Eight\">{{cite book|author=Aditi Sangal|title=Krishna's Advanced Organic Chemistry; Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH6vVI4C3PMC|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|isbn=978-81-8283-078-3}}</ref> Before the mechanism was determined, it was proposed that the reaction could proceed via an intermolecular or intramolecular route.<ref name=\"One\" /> \n[[File:Claisen possible mechanisms.png|475px|center]]\nLooking at these two proposed mechanisms, it is clear that a crossover experiment will be suitable for distinguishing between them, as is generally the case for inter- and intramolecular mechanisms. The next step in crossover experiment design is to propose labeled reactants. For a non-isotopic labeling method the smallest perturbation to the system will be by addition of a methyl group at an unreactive position.\n\nPredicting the products given by each mechanism will show whether or not a given crossover experiment design can distinguish between the mechanisms in question. This is particularly relevant when employing an isotopic label. It is possible that labeling at one position could distinguish between only two of several possible mechanisms, while placing the isotopic label at a different position could distinguish between three potential mechanisms or provide insight into transition states or intermediates, etc. After the interpretational value is established it is relevant to consider the practical aspects, such as whether or not the synthesis of the proposed reactant is possible, and how easy or difficult it is to distinguish the predicted products for each proposed mechanism and starting materials.\n\nFor the Claisen rearrangement, labeling by addition of a single methyl group produces an under-labeled system. The resulting crossover experiment would not be useful as a mechanistic study since the products of an intermolecular or intramolecular mechanism are identical.\n[[File:Claisen Rearrangemetn Under-labeled.png|530px|center]] \nTo have a sufficiently labeled system, both \u201chalves\u201d of the molecule that would separate in an intermolecular mechanism must be labeled. This is known as a doubly labeled system, and is generally the requirement for a crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /> Predicting the products of each mechanism then shows that the crossover products are distinct from the non-crossover products. Once this has been established and the products predicted, the experiment can be carried out and the products characterized. When isotopic labeling is used the products are often more varied and the distribution of the label more convoluted. In this case it is also important to explicitly predict the relative amounts of the label expected to appear at each position depending on the mechanism.\n[[File:Claisen Rearrangement Doubly Labeled System.png|530px|center]] \nWhen the crossover experiment on the Claisen rearrangement is carried out only non-crossover products are observed. Based on this the mechanism is determined to be intramolecular, as depicted in the standard [[Arrow pushing|arrow-pushing]] mechanism for this rearrangement.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Nine\" />\n\n== Isotopic labeling experiment ==\n\nAn isotopic labeling experiment is an experiment used in mechanistic study that employs isotopes as labels and traces these labels in the products. Isotopic labeling experiments are commonly considered to be a type of crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /> However, there are far more possibilities for the manner of labeling and potential products in an isotopic labeling experiment than in a traditional crossover experiment. The classification of an isotopic labeling experiment as a crossover experiment is based on the similar underlying concept, goal, and design principles in the two experiments rather than on direct similarity. An isotopic labeling experiment can be designed to be directly analogous to a traditional crossover experiment, but there are many additional ways of carrying out isotopic labeling experiments.\n\nAlthough isotopic labeling experiments have the advantage of using the smallest perturbation to the reaction system, they are limited by the possibility of isotopic exchange with solvent or other species present in the reaction mixture. If the isotopic label exchanges with another isotope of the same atom in the solvent, the results of an isotopic labeling experiment are unusable. This limits the use of deuterium labeling at certain positions in protic solvents, for example. However, this exchange can be useful when investigating interaction with the solvent of a reaction, since isotopic labeling can detect this interaction.\n\nIsotopic labeling experiments have been carried out on the thermal Claisen rearrangement. When the terminal carbon is labeled with <sup>14</sup>C, there is only one product, with the isotopic label appearing at the benzylic position. Since the expected product of an intermolecular mechanism is not observed the conclusion matches that of the traditional crossover experiment.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Nine\">{{cite book|author1=Francis A. Carey|author2=Richard J. Sundberg|title=Advanced Organic Chemistry: Part A: Structure and Mechanisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5dYyJMBhCoC|date=13 June 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-44897-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Claisen Rearrangement Isotopic Labeling.png|500px|center]]\n\n== Characterization ==\n\nA major advantage of the crossover experiment is that the results of the experiment are obtained by direct characterization of the product. The techniques involved are therefore those already familiar to the experimental chemist. [[Mass spectrometry]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] are the two most common ways of determining the products and their relative ratios. NMR spectroscopy is particularly useful for isotopic labeling studies that use isotopes of hydrogen or carbon.\n\nIR spectroscopy can be useful in specialized situations, such as when <sup>13</sup>CO was used to probe the mechanism of alkyl insertion into metal-carbon monoxide bonds to form metal-acyl complexes. Tracking the <sup>13</sup>CO in the products was accomplished using [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR spectroscopy]] because the greater mass of <sup>13</sup>C compared to <sup>12</sup>C produces a distinctive shift of the \u03bd(CO) stretching frequency to lower energy.<ref name=\"Three\" />\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\nThe products that are expected from any given mechanism are determined during the design of the crossover experiment. This can be quite complicated to establish, but it makes for straightforward interpretation of the results. If the observed products match those predicted by a given mechanism, then it is reasonable to conclude that mechanism is operating in the reaction. If the results do not match any expected distribution, it is necessary to consider alternate mechanisms and/or the possibility that the labeling has affected the way the reaction proceeds.\n\nFor crossover experiments used to distinguish between intermolecular and intramolecular reactions, the absence of crossover products is less conclusive than the presence of crossover products. This is because solvent cage effects could be masking an intermolecular mechanism.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Four\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nCrossover experiments have several limitations. Although useful for distinguishing between proposed reaction mechanisms, they are limited in their ability to provide insight into a mechanism beyond what has already been proposed. The design of a useful crossover experiment relies on having a proposed mechanism on which to base predictions of the label distribution in the products. If the results do not match any expected outcome, the actual mechanism is not obvious from the crossover experiment results. An additional limitation is of course that some systems are just not suitable for crossover experiments. This could be the case if addition of a label alters the mechanism or stops the reaction entirely, if there is no proposed mechanism, if isotopic labels exchange with solvent molecules, or if it is not feasible to synthesize the labeled species necessary for a crossover experiment.\n\n=== Solvent cage effect ===\n\nOne of the major limitations of the crossover experiment is that it cannot rule out the possibility that solvent cage effects are masking a dissociation mechanism. If crossover products are observed, the evidence that the mechanism cannot be purely intramolecular is conclusive. However, a lack of crossover products is not conclusive evidence that the mechanism is solely intramolecular. Provided that the reaction is carried out in solvent, it is always possible that solvent cage effects are preventing the formation of crossover products.<ref name=\"One\" /><ref name=\"Four\" />\n\nWhen a molecule is dissolved in a [[solvent]] it is appropriate to view the solvent as creating a \u201ccage\u201d around the molecule. The amount of time it takes a given molecule to \u201cescape\u201d this solvent cage varies with the size of the molecule and the strength of the intermolecular forces of the solvent, but is considered to be on the order of 1 x 10<sup>\u221210</sup> seconds.<ref name=\"Ten\">Horspool, William M.; Lenci, Francesco, Eds; CRC Handbook of Organic Photochemistry and Photobiology; CRC Press, 2004.</ref> If a reaction occurs faster than the molecules are able to escape the solvent cage, then only non-crossover products will be observed, masking the true reaction mechanism.<ref name=\"Four\" />\n\nWhen the timescale of the reaction is much slower than the timescale of the solvent cage effect, dissociated species are able to escape the solvent cage and form crossover products. This is an appropriate representation of a reaction in a crossover experiment occurring via an intermolecular mechanism and forming crossover products as expected. \n[[File:Solventcagelongfinal.png|800px|center]] \nWhen the timescale of the reaction is faster than or on the same order as the timescale of the solvent cage effect this is a more accurate representation of the same crossover experiment as above. Although a dissociative or intermolecular mechanism is occurring, no crossover occurs because the timescale of the reaction is sufficiently short that the dissociated fragment remains trapped within the solvent cage.\n[[File:Solventcageshortfinal.png|520px|center]]\n\nThe effect of the solvent cage on crossover experiments is not a purely theoretical concept. One of the first pieces of experimental evidence for the existence of the solvent cage was the observation of the solvent cage effect on a crossover experiment. Since radical recombinations occur on very short timescales compared to non-radical reactions, the solvent cage effect is particularly relevant to [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] chemistry.<ref name=\"Four\" /> Lyons and Levy were the first to demonstrate the effect of the solvent cage on a radical crossover experiment.

Methylation reactions in which a sulfonyl anion acts as a nucleophile and a methyl (arenesulfonate) serves as an electrophile were known to occur, but it was proposed that they could proceed either intermolecularly or intramolecularly.<ref name=\"Two\" />\n[[File:Eschenmoser Figure 1.png|475px|center]]\n\nReacting the protio and doubly labeled deutero sulfonyl anions simultaneously in a crossover experiment gave a 1:1:1:1 mixture of crossover and non-crossover products, clearly indicating that the reaction proceeds via an intermolecular mechanism. This result was surprising, since the intramolecular mechanism would proceed through a cyclic transition state resembling a six-membered ring, which is known to be a favored transition state in many organic mechanisms.

Crabtree]] recounts a story in which at the midpoint of 20th century the founder of metal carbonyl hydride chemistry referred to organometallic mechanisms as \u201cchemical philosophy.\u201d<ref name=\"Seven\" /> The themed issue goes on to present seventeen examples of modern mechanistic studies of organometallic reactions. In many cases, crossover experiments, isotope scrambling experiments, kinetic isotope effects, and computational studies are used in conjunction to clarify even a few aspects of an organometallic mechanism.\n\nCrossover experiments provide such uniquely useful insight into inorganic mechanisms that on occasion unusual isotopes are employed for an essential crossover experiment. In the work of E.L. Muetterties on dirhenium decacarbonyl, a crossover experiment was carried out using <sup>185</sup>Re and <sup>187</sup>Re to determine the mechanism of substitution reactions of rhenium carbonyl dimers. Mass spectrometry was used to distinguish between these isotopes in the products. In the same study, crossover experiments were also carried out using <sup>13</sup>CO and <sup>12</sup>CO.<ref name=\"Fifteen\">Stolzenberg, A. M.; E. L. Muetterties.  ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.''

In catalytic cycles that form C-H or C-C bonds reductive elimination is often the final product-forming step.<ref name=\"Seventeen\">{{cite book|author=Royal Society of Chemistry (Great Britain). Faraday Division|title=Quantum Inorganic Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5Xu3vHzKk4C|year=2003|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-85404-967-7}}</ref>\nSquare planar d<sup>8</sup> metal complexes are often the active catalysts in C-H or C-C bond forming reactions, and reductive elimination from these species is well understood. There are several known mechanisms for reductive elimination from square planar d<sup>8</sup> complexes. In a dissociative mechanism one ligand dissociates and reductive elimination occurs from a three-coordinate intermediate. In a nondissociative mechanism reductive elimination occurs from the square planar complex itself. The ligands undergoing reductive elimination must be ''cis'' to each other or otherwise must rearrange to be ''cis'' before they can reductively eliminate. Finally, in an associative mechanism a fifth ligand associates and reductive elimination occurs between two adjacent groups on the resulting square pyramidal complex.<ref name=\"Three\" />\n\nRegardless of the specific mechanism, it is consistently true that reductive elimination is an intramolecular process that couples two adjacent ligands. Although this may now seem obvious, when organometallic mechanisms were first being studied there was no proof of these restrictions. A series of crossover experiments experiment reported by [[John Kenneth Stille|J. Stille]] were among the first experiments to demonstrate that reductive elimination is an intramolecular process and that non-adjacent groups do not reductively eliminate.<ref name=\"Three\" /><ref name=\"Eighteen\">Gillie, S. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1980''', ''102'', 4933.</ref><ref name= \"Nineteen\">http://www.ilpi.com/organomet/reductive.html</ref>\nSeveral square planar d<sup>8</sup> palladium species were used in the study, with each one having two bound phosphine ligands and two bound methyl groups. One complex, Pd(dppe)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, was locked in a ''cis''-confirmation by the chelating phosphine 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe). A second complex, Pd(transphos)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> was locked in a trans-confirmation by \u201ctransphos,\u201d a chelating phosphine with a rigid aromatic linker.<ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n[[File:Three palladium complexes.png|460px|center]]\n\nThe complexes with ''cis''-methyl groups were already known to undergo reductive elimination to form ethane. A crossover experiment was performed on both Pd(dppe)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. In both cases no crossover products were observed, proving the intramolecular nature of reductive elimination.<ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n[[File:Stille crossover.png|540px|center]]\n\nUnlike the two ''cis''-confirmation complexes, Pd(transphos)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> did not undergo reductive elimination even when heated to 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, addition of methyl iodide to Pd(transphos)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> immediately produced ethane. To determine whether or not this reductive elimination was also constrained to only adjacent ligands, an isotope labeling experiment was carried out. The only product was the deuterium-labeled product of ''cis''-elimination. This led to the final conclusion that only ligands adjacent to each other on the metal complex are capable of reductively eliminating.<ref name=\"Three\" /><ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n[[File:Isotope labeling reductive elimination Stille.png|540px|center]]\n\nThis study also tracked and analyzed reaction rate data, demonstrating the value of employing multiple strategies in a concerted effort to gain as much information as possible about a chemical process. Among other rate experiments, the reaction rates of the ''cis''-trans isomerism were followed as solvent and concentration of excess phosphine ligand were varied. These results were used to establish a mechanism for this isomerization in square planar d<sup>8</sup> palladium species that consists of solvent or phosphine association followed by pseudorotation and subsequent dissociation of the solvent or phosphine.<ref name=\"Eighteen\" />\n\n== Biochemistry ==\n\nThe mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions can also be studied using crossover experiments. Examples of the application of this technique in [[biochemistry]] include the study of reactions catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphohexose-4,6-dehydratases, the aconitase-catalyzed elimination of water from citrate, and various reactions catalyzed by coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzymes, among others. Unlike isotope labeling studies in organic and organometallic chemistry, which typically use deuterium when an isotope of hydrogen is desired, biochemical crossover experiments frequently employ [[tritium]].<ref name=\"Twenty\">Silverman, Richard B.; The Organic Chemistry of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions; Academic Press, London, 2002.</ref> This is due to the fact that tritium is radioactive and can be tracked using the [[autoradiograph]]s of gels in [[gel electrophoresis]].\n\n=== Mechanism of aconitase action ===\n\nIsotope labeling experiments and crossover experiments were essential to early efforts to understand the mechanism of [[aconitase]] action. Isotope scrambling experiments using tritium, deuterium, and <sup>18</sup>O were carried out on the aconitase hydratase reaction by I.A. Rose and E.L. O'Connell.<ref name=\"TwentyOne\">Rose, I.A.; O'Connell, E.L. ''J. Biol. Chem.'' '''1967''', ''242'', 870. http://www.jbc.org/content/242/8/1870.long</ref> Using the results of these experiments it was possible to construct a general mechanism for the reaction. Further work has been done to refine this mechanism since these early experiments.<ref name=\"TwentyTwo\">Glusker, J.P. ''J. Mol. Biol.'' '''1968''', ''38'', 149.</ref><ref name=\"TwentyThree\">Villafranca, J.J. ''J. Biol. Chem.'' '''1971''', ''249'', 6149.</ref>\n\nOne such isotope scrambling experiment was the reaction of [2''R''-<sup>3</sup>H]citrate with aconitase in the presence of 2-methyl-''cis''-aconitate. This reaction produced both unlabeled ''cis''-aconitate and 2-methyl-[3-<sup>3</sup>H]isocitrate. The ability of the reaction to produce intermolecular transfer of tritium at this position indicates that the proton removed from citrate does not exchange with solvent. A similar experiment reacting [2-<sup>18</sup>OH]isocitrate with aconitase failed to produce isotopically labeled citrate, demonstrating that the hydroxyl group, unlike the removed proton, exchanges with solvent every turnover.<ref name=\"Twenty\" /><ref name=\"TwentyOne\" />\n[[File:Aconitase Tritium Crossover Scheme.png|530px|center]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Kinetic isotope effect]] \n* [[Isotopic labeling]] \n* [[Reaction mechanism]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Endocylic->Endocyclic -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_experiment_(chemistry)"}

Measurements of the oestrogens seemed to be the answer and he received a National Research Scholarship to work in Edinburgh under Professor Guy Marrian FRS, one of the discoverers of oestrogens.\n\nHis aim was to develop a chemical method for measuring the oestrogens in the urine and was given a position in the newly established Clinical Endocrinology Research Unit in Edinburgh, later to be appointed its Assistant Director. Notwithstanding Marrian's attempts at dissuading him from this project, Brown persisted and the essential problems were solved within a few months but a fully validated method was not published until 1955. This published paper has been cited over 1000 times and was awarded a full Citation Classic by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]].\n\nUsing this new method of measurement, Brown confirmed the elegant patterns of oestrogen production throughout the [[menstrual cycle]] which had been shown previously using labour-intensive bioassays. This work led to a PhD and The Lancet requested the privilege of publishing the results obtained during the menstrual cycle, conception, pregnancy, lactation and return to fertility. His method was the \"gold standard\" for measuring these hormones for almost 20 years until superseded by [[radioimmunoassays]] on blood. He also collaborated with Arnold Klopper in developing a urinary [[Pregnanediol]] assay in non-pregnant women which was awarded a half Citation Classic.\n\nPossibly one of the greatest contributions made by Brown in his early days in Edinburgh was the use of human [[gonadotrophin]] for the induction of ovulation. Working with colleagues there they purified these hormones and later developed the International Standard Reference Preparation facilitating their widespread usage. The Edinburgh unit was the second in the world to use human gonadotrophins for ovulation induction in humans but Brown, later working in Melbourne, would properly rationalise their usage.\n\nBoyer Brown's interest in reproduction began in the 1940s in [[New Zealand]] when he observed the rapid progress being made in animal reproduction at the time. This progress was made possible by understanding the phenomenon of oestrus which enabled the fertile time of the animal ovarian cycle and ovulation to be determined with precision (oestrus causes the female to accept the male only at the most fertile time of the cycle). He reasoned that an equally accurate method for timing ovulation in the human would allow the same progress to be made. Furthermore, as Nature uses the interaction between oestrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries to manifest oestrus, measurement of these hormones was the most likely method of achieving his aim. Consequently, he joined the research team in Edinburgh of Professor Guy Marrian who was one of the men who isolated and characterised the oestrogens. During the 1950s the team was successful in developing methods for accurately measuring the metabolites of the oestrogens, progesterone and luteinising hormone in urine and, for the first time, documented the precise patterns of these hormones throughout the fertile ovulatory cycle and related these patterns to ovulation and fertility.\n\n===Later work===\nHaving established a reputation in the field, James Brown was involved in practically every major development in human reproduction since then until his retirement in 1985. He was a member of Dr [[Gregory Pincus]]'s think-tank for the development of the [[oral contraceptive pill]] and performed the early work on its action. He was surprised that the pill was so quickly and universally adopted by women without an adequate study of its safety and possible long-term effects. At the same time he was pioneering work on assisted reproduction including the use of timed intercourse (as used by Nature in the phenomenon of oestrus) and [[clomiphene]] and human gonatrophin for women with deficient ovarian activity. The Swedes won the race to be the first to use human gonadotrophin but reported a startling multiple pregnancy and hyperstimulation rate.\n\nHe was involved in the assessment of the oral contraceptive but in 1962 turned down an offer by Dr Geoffrey Pincus, its originator, to work with him. Instead he went to help set up the Endocrine Clinic at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, as a safe and highly effective method achieving pregnancy in [[anovulatory]] women and developed the Threshold Hypothesis of gonadothrophin action. In 1962 James Brown joined the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne. With colleagues, he developed methods for the safe use of human gonadotrophin with the minimum of multiple pregnancies, and for a time produced all the gonadotrophin for clinical use in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and parts of Canada. It was from these clinical results that he developed the incremental system of gonadotrophin therapy and propounded the threshold hypothesis of gonadotrophin action on the ovary. The threshold hypothesis explained, for the first time, how only one follicle is usually selected for ovulation in the human, but it took 20 years for the explanation to be universally accepted. The pregnancy rate achieved with gonadotrophin therapy has not been bettered. The key to this success was in mimicking the hormone patterns of the natural cycle as closely as possible, a point which is still not fully appreciated today. He continually improved the sensitivity, speed and convenience of the methods for measuring oestrogen and progesterone metabolites in urine, so that the lowest concentrations found in the human could be measured. In the early 1970s, the rest of the world changed to blood assays for monitoring ovarian and pituitary activity. The validation of these blood assays depended on demonstrating that the hormone patterns obtained were the same as those obtained by the urinary assays.\n\nDuring a [[sabbatical|sabbatical year]] in 1970, Brown gained a D.Sc. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boyer|first=Brown, James|date=1970|title=Oestrogen assay methods and clinical applications|hdl=1842/22785|language=en}}</ref>from the [[University of Edinburgh]] and delivered 63 lectures and demonstrations in Europe and the USA.\n\nIn 1971 he was given a Personal Chair in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Melbourne and was a member of the IVF team led by Carl Wood. His work and understanding of ovarian function was linked to the development of the early techniques for egg pick up in IVF and were used in the first successful IVF pregnancy in Britain.\n\nDuring the 1970s he studied the effects of the [[intrauterine device]] on ovarian and menstrual function and was a member of the Melbourne [[In Vitro Fertilisation]] (IVF) team led by Prof Carl Wood. With infertility due to anovulation now fully treatable, James Brown joined Professor Carl Wood's team which was developing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for achieving pregnancy in women with occluded [[fallopian tubes]]. During the next 7 years he provided the expertise for timing egg pick-up for IVF and also was the optimist that success would ultimately come. His methods for timing egg pick-up were also used for achieving the first IVF pregnancy in Britain. Although he is one of the \"fathers\" of IVF in Melbourne, he is critical of some of the bizarre applications of IVF, of some of its subsequent developments and its low pregnancy rates.\n\nOther interests include research on hormone-dependent cancers, notably cancers of the breast, [[endometrium]] and ovaries. As much time was devoted to cancer research as to reproduction. Studies were conducted during the 1950s on the effect of endocrine ablation as a treatment for breast cancer. Later, with colleagues at [[Harvard University]], a large international study was conducted on risk factors in the development of breast cancer. This work was awarded the Prix Antoine Lacassagne from Paris in 1986 as the most important contribution to the study of breast cancer for that year.\n\nJames Brown met Doctors John and [[Evelyn Billings]] in 1962 and immediately appreciated the rightness of their findings and aims. The research that followed and the way it fitted in with his other studies is described in his booklet \"Studies in Human Reproduction\".<ref>Brown, J.B. (2000). Studies on Human Reproduction: Ovarian Activity and Fertility and the Billings Ovulation Method.</ref> As blood is not suitable for the serial assays required for long-term monitoring of ovarian activity, particularly at home, and his laboratory was apparently the only one in the world which was able to perform the urinary assays, he spent his latter years developing the Home Ovarian Monitor. This system uses urine, was simple enough for women to measure their hormone production at home, and could be used by assisted reproduction clinics to maintain daily control of their treatments. As a final note, the quest for the equivalent of the phenomenon of oestrus in the human is now ended; it is contained in the concepts of the Basic Infertile Pattern (BIP), the oestrogen rise (ER) and the progesterone change (PC) which have come from the work of John and Lyn Billings.\n\n==Accomplishments==\nProfessor James Brown published more than 220 articles in scientific journals. He was runner up in 1970 as having made the most important contributions to endocrinology in the [[British Commonwealth]]. He was the recipient of the Senior Organon Prize in 1978 and with Harvard Colleagues won the 1986 Prix Antoine Lacassagne from Paris for the most important contribution to the study of breast cancer for that year\n\nBrown retired from the University in 1985 and was accorded the title of Emeritus Professor. Nonetheless he continued to work in the field. He concentrated on simplifying the Ovarian Hormone Monitor, improving the effectiveness and acceptability of natural family planning and developing more effective methods of pregnancy achievement than IVF, for those couples who have sufficient numbers of sperm and no tubal problems.\n\nHe had established in 1962, a close working and personal relationship with Drs John and Lyn Billings who developed the concept of fertility recognition through the changes in [[cervical mucus]] secretion, forming the basis of [[Natural Family Planning]]. He validated their findings and continued to work closely with them especially in his latter years when he developed the Home Ovarian Monitor \u2013 a kit that can be easily used at home even by those without any laboratory training, to check their hormonal status. This was a quantum leap from his early methods where one fully trained worker could do only 10 assays per week. Working with the Billings, the availability, simplicity and low cost of this facility enabled him to study literally hundreds of thousands of cycles in women in various stages of their reproductive lives and develop a theory of ovarian function which takes account of these findings. More than 2000 women years of experience have been accumulated with the monitor using it for both pregnancy achievement and avoidance.\n\nRight up to the time of his death Brown continued to work on various scientific projects and was involved with the [[World Health Organization]]'s Special Programme of Research in Human Reproduction.\n\nPerhaps his professional life could best be summed up by a closing editorial comment made in 2003 in response to a letter he had published in Fertility and Sterility, the Journal of the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]]:\n\n\"...In these days of hype, grossness and glitz, Dr Brown is a model of scientific practice who is even more imposing by the low profile that he has been able to keep over the last two decades. Perhaps these are the ideals and values for which we need to renew our subscription.\"\n\n==Recognition==\n*1958 [[American Cancer Society]] Fellowship\n*1970 Runner-up in award for having made the most important contribution in endocrinology in the British Commonwealth\n*1978 Senior Organon Prize (joint winner with Henry Burger)\n*1981 Lecture Laurentian Hormone Conference USA\n*1981 Fellow (Ad Eundem) Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\n*1986 Prix Antione Lacassagne, Paris, in conjunction with Harvard colleagues\n*2003 Member of the Order of Australia (AM) \"for service to clinical research into women's health and reproductive issues and the development of the Home Ovarian Monitor\".\n*1952 PhD Edinburgh;\n*1958 American Cancer Society Fellowship;\n*1961 Lecture, Laurentian Hormone Conference, USA;\n*1970 D.Sc.

This published paper has been cited over 1000 times and was awarded a full Citation Classic by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]].\n\nUsing this new method of measurement, Brown confirmed the elegant patterns of oestrogen production throughout the [[menstrual cycle]] which had been shown previously using labour-intensive bioassays. This work led to a PhD and The Lancet requested the privilege of publishing the results obtained during the menstrual cycle, conception, pregnancy, lactation and return to fertility. His method was the \"gold standard\" for measuring these hormones for almost 20 years until superseded by [[radioimmunoassays]] on blood. He also collaborated with Arnold Klopper in developing a urinary [[Pregnanediol]] assay in non-pregnant women which was awarded a half Citation Classic.\n\nPossibly one of the greatest contributions made by Brown in his early days in Edinburgh was the use of human [[gonadotrophin]] for the induction of ovulation. Working with colleagues there they purified these hormones and later developed the International Standard Reference Preparation facilitating their widespread usage. The Edinburgh unit was the second in the world to use human gonadotrophins for ovulation induction in humans but Brown, later working in Melbourne, would properly rationalise their usage.\n\nBoyer Brown's interest in reproduction began in the 1940s in [[New Zealand]] when he observed the rapid progress being made in animal reproduction at the time. This progress was made possible by understanding the phenomenon of oestrus which enabled the fertile time of the animal ovarian cycle and ovulation to be determined with precision (oestrus causes the female to accept the male only at the most fertile time of the cycle). He reasoned that an equally accurate method for timing ovulation in the human would allow the same progress to be made. Furthermore, as Nature uses the interaction between oestrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries to manifest oestrus, measurement of these hormones was the most likely method of achieving his aim. Consequently, he joined the research team in Edinburgh of Professor Guy Marrian who was one of the men who isolated and characterised the oestrogens. During the 1950s the team was successful in developing methods for accurately measuring the metabolites of the oestrogens, progesterone and luteinising hormone in urine and, for the first time, documented the precise patterns of these hormones throughout the fertile ovulatory cycle and related these patterns to ovulation and fertility.\n\n===Later work===\nHaving established a reputation in the field, James Brown was involved in practically every major development in human reproduction since then until his retirement in 1985. He was a member of Dr [[Gregory Pincus]]'s think-tank for the development of the [[oral contraceptive pill]] and performed the early work on its action. He was surprised that the pill was so quickly and universally adopted by women without an adequate study of its safety and possible long-term effects. At the same time he was pioneering work on assisted reproduction including the use of timed intercourse (as used by Nature in the phenomenon of oestrus) and [[clomiphene]] and human gonatrophin for women with deficient ovarian activity. The Swedes won the race to be the first to use human gonadotrophin but reported a startling multiple pregnancy and hyperstimulation rate.\n\nHe was involved in the assessment of the oral contraceptive but in 1962 turned down an offer by Dr Geoffrey Pincus, its originator, to work with him. Instead he went to help set up the Endocrine Clinic at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, as a safe and highly effective method achieving pregnancy in [[anovulatory]] women and developed the Threshold Hypothesis of gonadothrophin action. In 1962 James Brown joined the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne. With colleagues, he developed methods for the safe use of human gonadotrophin with the minimum of multiple pregnancies, and for a time produced all the gonadotrophin for clinical use in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and parts of Canada. It was from these clinical results that he developed the incremental system of gonadotrophin therapy and propounded the threshold hypothesis of gonadotrophin action on the ovary. The threshold hypothesis explained, for the first time, how only one follicle is usually selected for ovulation in the human, but it took 20 years for the explanation to be universally accepted. The pregnancy rate achieved with gonadotrophin therapy has not been bettered. The key to this success was in mimicking the hormone patterns of the natural cycle as closely as possible, a point which is still not fully appreciated today. He continually improved the sensitivity, speed and convenience of the methods for measuring oestrogen and progesterone metabolites in urine, so that the lowest concentrations found in the human could be measured. In the early 1970s, the rest of the world changed to blood assays for monitoring ovarian and pituitary activity. The validation of these blood assays depended on demonstrating that the hormone patterns obtained were the same as those obtained by the urinary assays.\n\nDuring a [[sabbatical|sabbatical year]] in 1970, Brown gained a D.Sc. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boyer|first=Brown, James|date=1970|title=Oestrogen assay methods and clinical applications|hdl=1842/22785|language=en}}</ref>from the [[University of Edinburgh]] and delivered 63 lectures and demonstrations in Europe and the USA.\n\nIn 1971 he was given a Personal Chair in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Melbourne and was a member of the IVF team led by Carl Wood. His work and understanding of ovarian function was linked to the development of the early techniques for egg pick up in IVF and were used in the first successful IVF pregnancy in Britain.\n\nDuring the 1970s he studied the effects of the [[intrauterine device]] on ovarian and menstrual function and was a member of the Melbourne [[In Vitro Fertilisation]] (IVF) team led by Prof Carl Wood. With infertility due to anovulation now fully treatable, James Brown joined Professor Carl Wood's team which was developing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for achieving pregnancy in women with occluded [[fallopian tubes]]. During the next 7 years he provided the expertise for timing egg pick-up for IVF and also was the optimist that success would ultimately come. His methods for timing egg pick-up were also used for achieving the first IVF pregnancy in Britain. Although he is one of the \"fathers\" of IVF in Melbourne, he is critical of some of the bizarre applications of IVF, of some of its subsequent developments and its low pregnancy rates.\n\nOther interests include research on hormone-dependent cancers, notably cancers of the breast, [[endometrium]] and ovaries. As much time was devoted to cancer research as to reproduction. Studies were conducted during the 1950s on the effect of endocrine ablation as a treatment for breast cancer. Later, with colleagues at [[Harvard University]], a large international study was conducted on risk factors in the development of breast cancer. This work was awarded the Prix Antoine Lacassagne from Paris in 1986 as the most important contribution to the study of breast cancer for that year.\n\nJames Brown met Doctors John and [[Evelyn Billings]] in 1962 and immediately appreciated the rightness of their findings and aims. The research that followed and the way it fitted in with his other studies is described in his booklet \"Studies in Human Reproduction\".<ref>Brown, J.B. (2000). Studies on Human Reproduction: Ovarian Activity and Fertility and the Billings Ovulation Method.</ref> As blood is not suitable for the serial assays required for long-term monitoring of ovarian activity, particularly at home, and his laboratory was apparently the only one in the world which was able to perform the urinary assays, he spent his latter years developing the Home Ovarian Monitor. This system uses urine, was simple enough for women to measure their hormone production at home, and could be used by assisted reproduction clinics to maintain daily control of their treatments. As a final note, the quest for the equivalent of the phenomenon of oestrus in the human is now ended; it is contained in the concepts of the Basic Infertile Pattern (BIP), the oestrogen rise (ER) and the progesterone change (PC) which have come from the work of John and Lyn Billings.\n\n==Accomplishments==\nProfessor James Brown published more than 220 articles in scientific journals. He was runner up in 1970 as having made the most important contributions to endocrinology in the [[British Commonwealth]]. He was the recipient of the Senior Organon Prize in 1978 and with Harvard Colleagues won the 1986 Prix Antoine Lacassagne from Paris for the most important contribution to the study of breast cancer for that year\n\nBrown retired from the University in 1985 and was accorded the title of Emeritus Professor. Nonetheless he continued to work in the field. He concentrated on simplifying the Ovarian Hormone Monitor, improving the effectiveness and acceptability of natural family planning and developing more effective methods of pregnancy achievement than IVF, for those couples who have sufficient numbers of sperm and no tubal problems.\n\nHe had established in 1962, a close working and personal relationship with Drs John and Lyn Billings who developed the concept of fertility recognition through the changes in [[cervical mucus]] secretion, forming the basis of [[Natural Family Planning]]. He validated their findings and continued to work closely with them especially in his latter years when he developed the Home Ovarian Monitor \u2013 a kit that can be easily used at home even by those without any laboratory training, to check their hormonal status. This was a quantum leap from his early methods where one fully trained worker could do only 10 assays per week. Working with the Billings, the availability, simplicity and low cost of this facility enabled him to study literally hundreds of thousands of cycles in women in various stages of their reproductive lives and develop a theory of ovarian function which takes account of these findings. More than 2000 women years of experience have been accumulated with the monitor using it for both pregnancy achievement and avoidance.\n\nRight up to the time of his death Brown continued to work on various scientific projects and was involved with the [[World Health Organization]]'s Special Programme of Research in Human Reproduction.\n\nPerhaps his professional life could best be summed up by a closing editorial comment made in 2003 in response to a letter he had published in Fertility and Sterility, the Journal of the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]]:\n\n\"...In these days of hype, grossness and glitz, Dr Brown is a model of scientific practice who is even more imposing by the low profile that he has been able to keep over the last two decades. Perhaps these are the ideals and values for which we need to renew our subscription.\"\n\n==Recognition==\n*1958 [[American Cancer Society]] Fellowship\n*1970 Runner-up in award for having made the most important contribution in endocrinology in the British Commonwealth\n*1978 Senior Organon Prize (joint winner with Henry Burger)\n*1981 Lecture Laurentian Hormone Conference USA\n*1981 Fellow (Ad Eundem) Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\n*1986 Prix Antione Lacassagne, Paris, in conjunction with Harvard colleagues\n*2003 Member of the Order of Australia (AM) \"for service to clinical research into women's health and reproductive issues and the development of the Home Ovarian Monitor\".\n*1952 PhD Edinburgh;\n*1958 American Cancer Society Fellowship;\n*1961 Lecture, Laurentian Hormone Conference, USA;\n*1970 D.Sc.

Leading up to the [[2019 French Open|French Open]], Khachanov's record for the year was ten wins and twelve losses and he had failed to reach a single tournament semifinal.\n\nAt the French Open, Khachanov won his first three rounds to set up a last-16 encounter with his idol [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]]. Khachanov beat del Potro for the first time to reach his first major quarterfinal, where he lost to [[Dominic Thiem]]. Khachanov's maiden Slam quarterfinal saw him enter the top-10 for the first time as world No. 9.\n\nIn August, Khachanov reached his first tournament semifinal of the year after beating [[Alexander Zverev]] in the quarterfinals of the [[2019 Rogers Cup \u2013 Men's Singles|Montreal Masters]]. In the semifinals, he was defeated by compatriot [[Daniil Medvedev]].\n\nAfter the Rogers Cup, Khachanov notably reached the semifinals of the [[2019 China Open (tennis)|China Open]]. He failed to defend his title at the [[2019 Rolex Paris Masters|Paris Masters]], losing in the second round to [[Jan-Lennard Struff]], and dropped out of the top 10.\n\n===2020===\nKhachanov entered the [[2020 ASB Classic|Auckland Open]] as third-seeded, losing the first match against [[John Millman]]. He then joined team Russia, also consisting of [[Daniil Medvedev|Medvedev]], [[Teymuraz Gabashvili|Gabashvili]] and [[Konstantin Kravchuk|Kravchuk]], at the [[2020 ATP Cup|ATP Cup]]. He beat four out of five players, with his team progressing to the semifinals.\n\n==Playing Style==\nKhachanov is an [[Tennis strategy#Offensive baseliner|aggressive baseliner]], known for his hard-hitting groundstrokes and serve. He generally aims to be offensive, setting up winners with his serve, or using his forehand to dictate rallies. He uses Wilson H22 racquets with 18X20 string pattern that is not available to general public. His racquets are painted as Wilson Blade 98.  \n\nKhachanov's signature shot is his forehand, which he hits with great speed and spin and he uses to move opponents around and produce winners. He is known to run around his backhand to inside-out and inside-in forehands as well, due to his weaker backhand wing. Khachanov uses intelligent point construction to either hit outright winners or wear opponents down with consistent offense. Additionally, his strong serve and one-two combination with his serve and forehand allow him to hold serve easily, and concentrate on breaking opponents.\n\nKhachanov's weaknesses include his lack of variety, and to a lesser extent his defense at the baseline. His defensive game is significantly weaker than his aggressive game, and he often struggles when put under pressure quickly during rallies. Additionally, his net game and variety of shot, such as his slice, have been cited as rooms for improvement to become a more all-round player.\n==Endorsements==\nKhachanov uses Wilson H22 racquets with a 18X20 string pattern that is not available to the general public. His racquets are painted as Wilson Blade 98. He also endorses Nike appeals and shoes  \n\n==Personal life==\nIn April 2016, he married Veronika Shkliaeva.<ref>[http://www.tennisnow.com/Blogs/NET-POSTS/June-2017/Khachanov-Married-and-Dangerous.aspx Khachanov: Married and Dangerous]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hTl74F-Dw4|title=\u00ab\u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u00bb. \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0425\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0448\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0443 \u0427\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e\u043c|trans-title=\"One year since marriage\".

Leading up to the [[2019 French Open|French Open]], Khachanov's record for the year was ten wins and twelve losses and he had failed to reach a single tournament semifinal.\n\nAt the French Open, Khachanov won his first three rounds to set up a last-16 encounter with his idol [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]]. Khachanov beat del Potro for the first time to reach his first major quarterfinal, where he lost to [[Dominic Thiem]]. Khachanov's maiden Slam quarterfinal saw him enter the top-10 for the first time as world No. 9.\n\nIn August, Khachanov reached his first tournament semifinal of the year after beating [[Alexander Zverev]] in the quarterfinals of the [[2019 Rogers Cup \u2013 Men's Singles|Montreal Masters]]. In the semifinals, he was defeated by compatriot [[Daniil Medvedev]].\n\nAfter the Rogers Cup, Khachanov notably reached the semifinals of the [[2019 China Open (tennis)|China Open]]. He failed to defend his title at the [[2019 Rolex Paris Masters|Paris Masters]], losing in the second round to [[Jan-Lennard Struff]], and dropped out of the top 10.\n\n===2020===\nKhachanov entered the [[2020 ASB Classic|Auckland Open]] as third-seeded, losing the first match against [[John Millman]]. He then joined team Russia, also consisting of [[Daniil Medvedev|Medvedev]], [[Teymuraz Gabashvili|Gabashvili]] and [[Konstantin Kravchuk|Kravchuk]], at the [[2020 ATP Cup|ATP Cup]]. He beat four out of five players, with his team progressing to the semifinals.\n\n==Playing Style==\nKhachanov is an [[Tennis strategy#Offensive baseliner|aggressive baseliner]], known for his hard-hitting groundstrokes and serve. He generally aims to be offensive, setting up winners with his serve, or using his forehand to dictate rallies. He uses Wilson H22 racquets with 18X20 string pattern that is not available to general public. His racquets are painted as Wilson Blade 98.  \n\nKhachanov's signature shot is his forehand, which he hits with great speed and spin and he uses to move opponents around and produce winners. He is known to run around his backhand to inside-out and inside-in forehands as well, due to his weaker backhand wing. Khachanov uses intelligent point construction to either hit outright winners or wear opponents down with consistent offense. Additionally, his strong serve and one-two combination with his serve and forehand allow him to hold serve easily, and concentrate on breaking opponents.\n\nKhachanov's weaknesses include his lack of variety, and to a lesser extent his defense at the baseline. His defensive game is significantly weaker than his aggressive game, and he often struggles when put under pressure quickly during rallies. Additionally, his net game and variety of shot, such as his slice, have been cited as rooms for improvement to become a more all-round player.\n==Endorsments==\nKhachanov uses Wilson H22 racquets with a 18X20 string pattern that is not available to the general public. His racquets are painted as Wilson Blade 98. He also endorses Nike appeals and shoes  \n\n==Personal life==\nIn April 2016, he married Veronika Shkliaeva.<ref>[http://www.tennisnow.com/Blogs/NET-POSTS/June-2017/Khachanov-Married-and-Dangerous.aspx Khachanov: Married and Dangerous]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hTl74F-Dw4|title=\u00ab\u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u00bb. \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0425\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0448\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0443 \u0427\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e\u043c|trans-title=\"One year since marriage\".

{"title_page": "Pagan religions of Azerbaijan", "text_new": "{{Azeris}}\nVery little is known about pre-Christian and pre-Islamic mythology in Eastern Transcaucasia; sources are mostly Hellenic historians like [[Strabo]] and based on archaeological evidence.\n\n== Dualism ==\n\n=== Barhail ===\nBarhail was one of two major gods.<ref>\"Munisnameh\", Abu Bakr ibn Khusraw al-Ustad</ref>  He keeps sun on his right hand and moon on left hand. His right hand shows [[East]] and left hand shows [[West]]. If he drops his right hand for a while, world will fall under darkness forever. He decides if days should be longer or shorter.\n\n=== Sabail ===\nSabail was one of two major gods. He was protector of sea and wind. He  stands perpendicular to Barhail. His left hand keeps ocean apart from continents, prevents floods. His right hand keeps weather calm, if he droppes that hand, typhoons and storms can occur.\n\n== Sun, moon and sky ==\n[[Strabo]] names the gods of the sun, the sky, and above of all, the moon, and equates them to the Greek gods [[Helios]], [[Zeus]], and [[Selene]] respectively:<ref>[[Strabo]]. ''Geography''. (translated into Russian by G.Stratanovsky). St. Petersburg: 1964. Vol. XI. 4,7</ref> \n{{quotation|\n As for gods, they honour [[Helius]], [[Zeus]], and [[Selene]], but especially [[Selene]]; her temple is near [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]. The office of priest is held by the man who, after the king, is held in highest honour; he has charge of the sacred land, which is extensive and well-populated, and also of the temple slaves, many of whom are subject to religious frenzy and utter prophecies\n|text=|sign=|source=}}\n\n== Sacrifice ==\nAccording to [[Strabo]], [[human sacrifice]] was widely used in pre-Christian Albania:\n{{quotation|\nAnd any one of those who, becoming violently possessed, wanders alone in the forests, is by the priest arrested, bound with sacred fetters, and sumptuously maintained during that year, and then led forth to the sacrifice that is performed in honour of the goddess, and, being anointed, is sacrificed along with other victims. The sacrifice is performed as follows: Some person holding a sacred lance, with which it is the custom to sacrifice human victims, comes forward out of the crowd and strikes the victim through the side into the heart, he being not without experience in such a task; and when the victim falls, they draw auguries from his fall and declare them before the public; and when the body is carried to a certain place, they all trample upon it, thus using it as a means of purification.\n}}\n\n== Ancestor worship ==\nUnlike many pagan nations, [[Caucasian Albanians]] did not practice worship of ancestors. As [[Strabo]] states:\n{{quotation|\nThe Albanians are surpassingly respectful to old age, not merely to their parents, but to all other old people. And when people die it is impious to be concerned about them or even to mention them. Indeed, they bury their money with them, and therefore live in poverty, having no patrimony.\n}}\n\n== Sacred islands ==\nIn East [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], sacred lands existed in islands of Caspian Sea. [[Pomponius Mela]] wrote:\n{{quotation|\nTalge [Cheleken], on the Caspian Sea, is fertile without being cultivated and is abundant in every root crop and fruit, but the local peoples consider it an abomination and a sacrilege to touch what grows there. They think that these things have been prepared by the gods and must be saved for the gods. Alongside those coasts that we have called deserted lie a number of equally deserted islands, which, being without names of their own, are called the Scythian Islands <ref>[[Mela]], Pomponius. ''Chorographia'' Article: 3.6.58</ref> \n}}\n\n== Sacred mountains ==\nLike [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] and [[Tengrist]] practices, local inhabitants considered several mountains as sacred. List of sacred mountains according to local legends:<ref>Nadir Mammadov. \"Settlement names of Azerbaijan\" (oronimics). Baku, \"Azern\u0259shr\", 1993</ref>\n* [[Babada\u011f (Azerbaijan)|Babada\u011f]] is the [[Caucasus Mountains#Notable peaks|fourth highest peak in the Caucasus]] in [[Azerbaijan]] at 3,629 meters. It is located north of [[\u0130smay\u0131ll\u0131]]. At the top is a [[Pir (Zoroastrianism)|pir]] dedicated to Hasrat Baba\u2014a person revered as a holy man\u2014who is believed to have lived during the period when the area was known as Caucasian Albania. Babada\u011f means \"Grandfather Mountain\".\n* [[Mount Avey]] is one of the peaks and a whitish-gray ridge in the [[Small Caucasus Mountains]] located between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Gazakh]] district.

His right hand shows [[East]] and left hand shows [[West]]. If he drops his right hand for a while, world will fall under darkness forever. He decides if days should be longer or shorter.\n\n=== Sabail ===\nSabail was one of two major gods. He was protector of sea and wind. He  stands perpendicular to Barhail. His left hand keeps ocean apart from continents, prevents floods. His right hand keeps weather calm, if he droppes that hand, typhoons and storms can occur.\n\n== Sun, moon and sky ==\n[[Strabo]] names the gods of the sun, the sky, and above of all, the moon, and equates them to the Greek gods [[Helios]], [[Zeus]], and [[Selene]] respectively:<ref>[[Strabo]]. ''Geography''. (translated into Russian by G.Stratanovsky). St. Petersburg: 1964. Vol. XI. 4,7</ref> \n{{quotation|\n As for gods, they honour [[Helius]], [[Zeus]], and [[Selene]], but especially [[Selene]]; her temple is near [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]. The office of priest is held by the man who, after the king, is held in highest honour; he has charge of the sacred land, which is extensive and well-populated, and also of the temple slaves, many of whom are subject to religious frenzy and utter prophecies\n|text=|sign=|source=}}\n\n== Sacrifice ==\nAccording to [[Strabo]], [[human sacrifice]] was widely used in pre-Christian Albania:\n{{quotation|\nAnd any one of those who, becoming violently possessed, wanders alone in the forests, is by the priest arrested, bound with sacred fetters, and sumptuously maintained during that year, and then led forth to the sacrifice that is performed in honour of the goddess, and, being anointed, is sacrificed along with other victims. The sacrifice is performed as follows: Some person holding a sacred lance, with which it is the custom to sacrifice human victims, comes forward out of the crowd and strikes the victim through the side into the heart, he being not without experience in such a task; and when the victim falls, they draw auguries from his fall and declare them before the public; and when the body is carried to a certain place, they all trample upon it, thus using it as a means of purification.\n}}\n\n== Ancestor worship ==\nUnlike many pagan nations, [[Caucasian Albanians]] did not practice worship of ancestors. As [[Strabo]] states:\n{{quotation|\nThe Albanians are surpassingly respectful to old age, not merely to their parents, but to all other old people. And when people die it is impious to be concerned about them or even to mention them. Indeed, they bury their money with them, and therefore live in poverty, having no patrimony.\n}}\n\n== Sacred islands ==\nIn East [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], sacred lands existed in islands of Caspian Sea. [[Pomponius Mela]] wrote:\n{{quotation|\nTalge [Cheleken], on the Caspian Sea, is fertile without being cultivated and is abundant in every root crop and fruit, but the local peoples consider it an abomination and a sacrilege to touch what grows there. They think that these things have been prepared by the gods and must be saved for the gods. Alongside those coasts that we have called deserted lie a number of equally deserted islands, which, being without names of their own, are called the Scythian Islands <ref>[[Mela]], Pomponius.

Before he did, his grandfather woke because of the noise that the device was making. He saw him teleport to another world. When Erick was in the Dinosaur world, he found Dinosaurs and he was happy he was there. He found a baby dinosaur surrounded by [[hunter]]s and a girl named Kaia wanted to rescue the baby dinosaur. Long Xiang appeared to the crowd of hunters. They bowed to him because they saw him wear the device. The leader of the hunters wanted to get rid of Long Xiang and the baby dinosaur. Long Xiang made the baby dinosaur grow into a taller dinosaur. The dinosaur sent the leader of the hunters to the sky. The dinosaur turned back into a baby dinosaur. Long Xiang and Feng Ling started a new journey together the very end of the beginning of the series. As the journey went on they met a girl named A Guo, and a boy named Yu. All four of the children formed as a team to stop all the evil that happens, especially The Tako of Kim country. Then try to reach the goal to protect all the dinosaurs in the dinosaur world and let all the dinosaurs live in peace and stop all evil that is caused by villains who kidnapped the princess and try to take over the dinosaur world.
