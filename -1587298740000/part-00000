The song is the opening track on their 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and was also released as a single coupled with \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\". The song reached the top of the charts in the United States{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=57}} and peaked at No. 4 in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|everyHit.com|2009}}\n\n==Origin and meaning==\n\"Come Together\" was inspired by a request from [[Timothy Leary]] to write a song for his [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|campaign]] for [[governor of California]] against [[Ronald Reagan]], which promptly ended when Leary was sent to prison for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]:{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=314}}\n\n{{quote|The thing was created in the studio. It's gobbledygook; Come Together was an expression that Leary had come up with for his attempt at being president or whatever he wanted to be, and he asked me to write a campaign song. I tried and tried, but I couldn't come up with one. But I came up with this, Come Together, which would've been no good to him\u2014you couldn't have a campaign song like that, right?{{sfn|Sheff|2000}}}}\n\nBeatles historian Jonathan Gould has suggested that the song has only a single \"pariah-like protagonist\" and Lennon was \"painting another sardonic self-portrait\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Jonathan |title=Can't Buy Me Love: The Beatles, Britain and America |publisher=[[Piatkus]] |location=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7499-2988-6 |page=575}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nLennon played [[rhythm guitar]] and [[electric piano]] and sang the [[lead vocals]], [[Paul McCartney]] played [[bass guitar|bass]], [[George Harrison]] played [[lead guitar]] and [[Ringo Starr]] played [[drums]]. It was produced by [[George Martin]] and recorded in late July 1969 at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=181}} In the intro and after each chorus, Lennon says \"shoot me\", which is accompanied by echoing handclaps and a distinctive drum part by Starr as well as McCartney's prominent bass riff.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=181}} The famous Beatles' \"walrus\" from \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" and \"[[Glass Onion]]\" returns in the line \"he got walrus gumboot\", followed by \"he got [[Yoko Ono|Ono]] sideboard\". Bluesman [[Muddy Waters]] is also mentioned in the song.\n\nMusic critic [[Ian MacDonald]] reports that McCartney sang a backing vocal,{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=358}} but [[recording engineer]] [[Geoff Emerick]] said that Lennon did all the vocals himself, and when a frustrated McCartney asked Lennon, \"What do you want me to do on this track, John?\", Lennon replied, \"Don't worry, I'll do the overdubs on this.\"{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=285}}\n\nIn a 1970 interview with [[Ray Connolly]] of the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', McCartney expressed his disappointment about not singing with Lennon.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=132}} He told Connolly:\n\n{{quote|text=Even on ''Abbey Road'' we don't do harmonies like we used to. I think it's sad. On \"Come Together\" I would have liked to sing harmony with John, and I think he would have liked me to, but I was too embarrassed to ask him, and I don't work to the best of my abilities in that situation.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=553}}}}\n\n==Release and legacy==\n\"Come Together\" was released as a double A-side with \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\" and as the opening track of ''[[Abbey Road]]''. The single was released on 6 October 1969 in the US, was on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for 16 weeks, and reached No. 1. The single released on 31 October 1969 in the UK, reaching No. 4.\n\nThe first take of the song, recorded on 21 July 1969, with slightly different lyrics, was released in 1996 on the outtake compilation ''[[Anthology 3]]''.<ref name=\"winn 307\">{{cite book |last=Winn |first=John C. |title=That Magic Feeling: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume Two, 1966\u20131970 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-45239-9 |page=307}}</ref>\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Come Together\" at No. 202 on their list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\"{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2007}} and No. 9 on their list of the Beatles' 100 Greatest Songs.<ref name=RollingStone100>{{cite web|title=9.

Before recording, Lennon and McCartney deliberately slowed the song down and added a heavy bass riff in order to make the song more original.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=553}} The case was settled out of court in 1973, with Levy's lawyers agreeing that Lennon would compensate by recording three Big Seven songs for his next album.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=210}} A brief version of \"[[Ya Ya]]\" with Lennon and his son Julian was released on the album ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' in 1974. \"You Can't Catch Me\" and another version of \"Ya Ya\" were released on Lennon's 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'', but the third, \"[[Angel Baby (Rosie and the Originals song)|Angel Baby]]\", remained unreleased until after Lennon's death. Levy again sued Lennon for breach of contract, and was eventually awarded $6,795. Lennon countersued after Levy released an album of Lennon material using tapes that were in his possession and was eventually awarded $84,912.96. The album was called ''Roots''.{{sfn|Self|1992}}\n\n==Personnel==\nPersonnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]:{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=355}}\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar, [[Rhodes piano|electric piano]], handclaps\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 backing vocal, bass guitar\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums, [[maraca]]s\n\nThe availability of separate tracks from the original Beatles multi-tracks (due to release of ''[[The Beatles Rock Band|Rock Band]]'') have made fresh investigation of the Beatles personnel data possible. One of the discoveries is that on the verses of \"Come Together\", the backing vocals are sung by McCartney. However, in an interview with ''Music Radar'', Geoff Emerick stated that McCartney did not sing on the choruses: \"Initially, Paul played the electric piano part, but John kind of looked over his shoulder and studied what he was playing. When it came time to record it, John played the electric piano instead of Paul. Paul might have been miffed, but I think he was more upset about not singing on the choruses\u2014John did his own backing vocals.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/geoff-emerick-on-the-beatles-in-the-studio-219542 |title=Geoff Emerick on The Beatles in the studio |last1=Bosso |first1=Joe |date=6 February 2014 |website=musicradar.com |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |access-date=17 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Cover versions==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Come Together\n|cover=Ike-Tina-Turner-Come-Together-Single.jpg|caption=French picture sleeve| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Ike & Tina Turner]] & [[The Ikettes]]\n| album      = [[Come Together (Ike & Tina Turner album)|Come Together]]\n| B-side     = [[Honky Tonk Women]]\n| released   = January 1970\n| format     = 7-inch single\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = R&B, Soul, blues rock\n| length     = 3:37\n| label      = [[Minit Records|Minit]]/[[Liberty Records|Liberty]]\n| writer     = [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n| producer   = [[Ike Turner]]\n| prev_title = \n| prev_year  = \n| next_title = \n| next_year  = \n|misc={{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Ike & Tina Turner]]\n | type       = single\n | prev_title = I Wanna Jump\n | prev_year  = 1969\n | title      = Come Together\n | year       = 1970\n | next_title = [[I Want to Take You Higher]]\n | next_year  = 1970\n}}\n{{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[The Ikettes]]\n | type       = single\n | prev_title = Make 'Em Wait\n | prev_year  = 1968\n | title      = Come Together\n | year       = 1970\n | next_title = [[I Want to Take You Higher]]\n | next_year  = 1970\n}}}}\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Come Together\n| cover      = Cometogetheraero.JPG\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Aerosmith]]\n| album      = [[Sgt.

It was Lennon's only full-length concert performance after leaving the Beatles. He was backed by the band [[Elephant's Memory]].<ref>Edmonson, Jacqueline. ''John Lennon: A Biography''. 2010, ABC-CLIO, {{ISBN|978-0-313-37938-3}}, p. 149</ref> This version of the song appears on the concert album ''[[Live in New York City (John Lennon album)|Live in New York City]]'', recorded on 30 August 1972 and released in 1986.\n\n===Aerosmith version===\nAmerican [[hard rock]] band [[Aerosmith]] performed one of the most successful cover versions of \"Come Together\". It was recorded in 1978 and appeared in the movie and on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', in which the band also appeared. The single was an immediate success, reaching number 23 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, following on the heels of a string of [[Top 40]] hits for the band in the mid-1970s. However, it would be the last Top 40 hit for the band for nearly a decade.\n\nAnother recording of the song was released several months later on Aerosmith's live album ''[[Live! Bootleg (Aerosmith album)|Live! Bootleg]]''. The song also featured on ''[[Aerosmith's Greatest Hits]]'', the band's first [[single (music)|singles]] compilation released in 1980. The song has also surfaced on a number of Aerosmith compilations and live albums since then, as well as on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)#Soundtracks|Armageddon]]''.\n\n===Michael Jackson version===\n[[Michael Jackson]] recorded a version in 1988 for his movie ''[[Moonwalker]]'' and released this version on his 1995 album ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I|HIStory]]'' and as the B-Side for his 1992 single \"[[Remember the Time]]\". The song was also featured during his 1996 performances of the [[HIStory World Tour]] along with his song \"[[D.S. (song)|D.S.]]\".\n\n===Other versions===\n* [[Paul McCartney]] was also part of a different version of the song with [[Noel Gallagher]] and [[Paul Weller]] on an updated version for the 1995 ''[[The Help Album|Help]]'' charity record, under the name the Smokin' Mojo Filters. Weller performed the lead vocal duties, with McCartney and Gallagher providing backing vocals, harmonies and bass and guitar. This version made it to No. 19 on the British chart in December 1995. In 2005 Weller recorded a new version of the song as part of a double A-sided single.\n* [[George Martin]] recorded a version of the song with vocals by [[Robin Williams]] and [[Bobby McFerrin]] for his 1998 album ''[[In My Life (George Martin album)|In My Life]]''.\n* [[Joe Cocker]] recorded a version of the song for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]'' in 2007.\n* [[Arctic Monkeys]] performed a cover of the song during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]]. A live recording (albeit from a rehearsal), from the [[London Olympic Stadium]] on 23 July 2012, was featured on the soundtrack album of the ceremony, ''[[Isles of Wonder (album)|Isles of Wonder]]''. It charted at No. 21 in the UK.\n* [[Gary Clark Jr.]] and [[Junkie XL]] recorded a version of the song for the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.

The song is the opening track on their 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and was also released as a single coupled with \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\". The song reached the top of the charts in the United States{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=57}} and peaked at No. 4 in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|everyHit.com|2009}}\n\n==Origin and meaning==\n\"Come Together\" was inspired by a request from [[Timothy Leary]] to write a song for his [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|campaign]] for [[governor of California]] against [[Ronald Reagan]], which promptly ended when Leary was sent to prison for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]:{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=314}}\n\n{{quote|The thing was created in the studio. It's gobbledygook; Come Together was an expression that Leary had come up with for his attempt at being president or whatever he wanted to be, and he asked me to write a campaign song. I tried and tried, but I couldn't come up with one. But I came up with this, Come Together, which would've been no good to him\u2014you couldn't have a campaign song like that, right?{{sfn|Sheff|2000}}}}\n\nBeatles historian Jonathan Gould has suggested that the song has only a single \"pariah-like protagonist\" and Lennon was \"painting another sardonic self-portrait\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Jonathan |title=Can't Buy Me Love: The Beatles, Britain and America |publisher=[[Piatkus]] |location=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7499-2988-6 |page=575}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nLennon played [[rhythm guitar]] and [[electric piano]] and sang the [[lead vocals]], [[Paul McCartney]] played [[bass guitar|bass]], [[George Harrison]] played [[lead guitar]] and [[Ringo Starr]] played [[drums]]. It was produced by [[George Martin]] and recorded in late July 1969 at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=181}} In the intro and after each chorus, Lennon says \"shoot me\", which is accompanied by echoing handclaps and a distinctive drum part by Starr as well as McCartney's prominent bass riff.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=181}} The famous Beatles' \"walrus\" from \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" and \"[[Glass Onion]]\" returns in the line \"he got walrus gumboot\", followed by \"he got [[Yoko Ono|Ono]] sideboard\". Bluesman [[Muddy Waters]] is also mentioned in the song.\n\nMusic critic [[Ian MacDonald]] reports that McCartney sang a backing vocal,{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=358}} but [[recording engineer]] [[Geoff Emerick]] said that Lennon did all the vocals himself, and when a frustrated McCartney asked Lennon, \"What do you want me to do on this track, John?\", Lennon replied, \"Don't worry, I'll do the overdubs on this.\"{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=285}}\n\nIn a 1970 interview with [[Ray Connolly]] of the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', McCartney expressed his disappointment about not singing with Lennon.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=132}} He told Connolly:\n\n{{quote|text=Even on ''Abbey Road'' we don't do harmonies like we used to. I think it's sad. On \"Come Together\" I would have liked to sing harmony with John, and I think he would have liked me to, but I was too embarrassed to ask him, and I don't work to the best of my abilities in that situation.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=553}}}}\n\n==Release and legacy==\n\"Come Together\" was released as a double A-side with \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\" and as the opening track of ''[[Abbey Road]]''. The single was released on 6 October 1969 in the US, was on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for 16 weeks, and reached No. 1. The single released on 31 October 1969 in the UK, reaching No. 4.\n\nThe first take of the song, recorded on 21 July 1969, with slightly different lyrics, was released in 1996 on the outtake compilation ''[[Anthology 3]]''.<ref name=\"winn 307\">{{cite book |last=Winn |first=John C. |title=That Magic Feeling: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume Two, 1966\u20131970 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-45239-9 |page=307}}</ref>\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked \"Come Together\" at No. 202 on their list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\"{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2007}} and No. 9 on their list of the Beatles' 100 Greatest Songs.<ref name=RollingStone100>{{cite web|title=9.

Before recording, Lennon and McCartney deliberately slowed the song down and added a heavy bass riff in order to make the song more original.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=553}} The case was settled out of court in 1973, with Levy's lawyers agreeing that Lennon would compensate by recording three Big Seven songs for his next album.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=210}} A brief version of \"[[Ya Ya]]\" with Lennon and his son Julian was released on the album ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' in 1974. \"You Can't Catch Me\" and another version of \"Ya Ya\" were released on Lennon's 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'', but the third, \"[[Angel Baby (Rosie and the Originals song)|Angel Baby]]\", remained unreleased until after Lennon's death. Levy again sued Lennon for breach of contract, and was eventually awarded $6,795. Lennon countersued after Levy released an album of Lennon material using tapes that were in his possession and was eventually awarded $84,912.96. The album was called ''Roots''.{{sfn|Self|1992}}\n\n==Personnel==\nPersonnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]:{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=355}}\n* [[John Lennon]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar, [[Rhodes piano|electric piano]], handclaps\n* [[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 backing vocal, bass guitar\n* [[George Harrison]] \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar\n* [[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 drums, [[maraca]]s\n\nThe availability of separate tracks from the original Beatles multi-tracks (due to release of ''[[The Beatles Rock Band|Rock Band]]'') have made fresh investigation of the Beatles personnel data possible. One of the discoveries is that on the verses of \"Come Together\", the backing vocals are sung by McCartney. However, in an interview with ''Music Radar'', Geoff Emerick stated that McCartney did not sing on the choruses: \"Initially, Paul played the electric piano part, but John kind of looked over his shoulder and studied what he was playing. When it came time to record it, John played the electric piano instead of Paul. Paul might have been miffed, but I think he was more upset about not singing on the choruses\u2014John did his own backing vocals.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/geoff-emerick-on-the-beatles-in-the-studio-219542 |title=Geoff Emerick on The Beatles in the studio |last1=Bosso |first1=Joe |date=6 February 2014 |website=musicradar.com |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |access-date=17 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Cover versions==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Come Together\n|cover=Ike-Tina-Turner-Come-Together-Single.jpg|caption=French picture sleeve| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Ike & Tina Turner]] & [[The Ikettes]]\n| album      = [[Come Together (Ike & Tina Turner album)|Come Together]]\n| B-side     = [[Honky Tonk Women]]\n| released   = January 1970\n| format     = 7-inch single\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = R&B, Soul, blues rock\n| length     = 3:37\n| label      = [[Minit Records|Minit]]/[[Liberty Records|Liberty]]\n| writer     = [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]]\n| producer   = [[Ike Turner]]\n| prev_title = \n| prev_year  = \n| next_title = \n| next_year  = \n|misc={{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Ike & Tina Turner]]\n | type       = single\n | prev_title = I Wanna Jump\n | prev_year  = 1969\n | title      = Come Together\n | year       = 1970\n | next_title = [[I Want to Take You Higher]]\n | next_year  = 1970\n}}\n{{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[The Ikettes]]\n | type       = single\n | prev_title = Make 'Em Wait\n | prev_year  = 1968\n | title      = Come Together\n | year       = 1970\n | next_title = [[I Want to Take You Higher]]\n | next_year  = 1970\n}}}}\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Come Together\n| cover      = Cometogetheraero.JPG\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Aerosmith]]\n| album      = [[Sgt.

It was Lennon's only full-length concert performance after leaving the Beatles. He was backed by the band [[Elephant's Memory]].<ref>Edmonson, Jacqueline. ''John Lennon: A Biography''. 2010, ABC-CLIO, {{ISBN|978-0-313-37938-3}}, p. 149</ref> This version of the song appears on the concert album ''[[Live in New York City (John Lennon album)|Live in New York City]]'', recorded on 30 August 1972 and released in 1986.\n\n===Aerosmith version===\nAmerican [[hard rock]] band [[Aerosmith]] performed one of the most successful cover versions of \"Come Together\". It was recorded in 1978 and appeared in the movie and on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', in which the band also appeared. The single was an immediate success, reaching number 23 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, following on the heels of a string of [[Top 40]] hits for the band in the mid-1970s. However, it would be the last Top 40 hit for the band for nearly a decade.\n\nAnother recording of the song was released several months later on Aerosmith's live album ''[[Live! Bootleg (Aerosmith album)|Live! Bootleg]]''. The song also featured on ''[[Aerosmith's Greatest Hits]]'', the band's first [[single (music)|singles]] compilation released in 1980. The song has also surfaced on a number of Aerosmith compilations and live albums since then, as well as on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)#Soundtracks|Armageddon]]''.\n\n===Michael Jackson version===\n[[Michael Jackson]] recorded a version in 1988 for his movie ''[[Moonwalker]]'' and released this version on his 1995 album ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I|HIStory]]'' and as the B-Side for his 1992 single \"[[Remember the Time]]\". The song was also featured during his 1996 performances of the [[HIStory World Tour]] along with his song \"[[D.S. (song)|D.S.]]\".\n\n===Other versions===\n* [[Paul McCartney]] was also part of a different version of the song with [[Noel Gallagher]] and [[Paul Weller]] on an updated version for the 1995 ''[[The Help Album|Help]]'' charity record, under the name the Smokin' Mojo Filters. Weller performed the lead vocal duties, with McCartney and Gallagher providing backing vocals, harmonies and bass and guitar. This version made it to No. 19 on the British chart in December 1995. In 2005 Weller recorded a new version of the song as part of a double A-sided single.\n* [[George Martin]] recorded a version of the song with vocals by [[Robin Williams]] and [[Bobby McFerrin]] for his 1998 album ''[[In My Life (George Martin album)|In My Life]]''.\n* [[Joe Cocker]] recorded a version of the song for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]'' in 2007.\n* [[Arctic Monkeys]] performed a cover of the song during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]].

A CGI heart monitor was shown over the titles. The 49 second sequence shows the patient's point of view and their journey through the department into [[resuscitation|resus]]. The heartbeat turned into [[electric arc]]s, possibly as a result of a [[defibrillator]] being used as the bed moves around the hospital. The theme is used again in second episode of series 30, this time inter-cut with scenes of Connie Beauchamp ([[Amanda Mealing]]) performing CPR on Charlie Fairhead ([[Derek Thompson (actor)|Derek Thompson]]) and also Lofty ([[Lee Mead]]) travelling through the Emergency Department.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty Series 30 special opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=UoXHureeKWc|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131992 (S4\u20136)===\nSeries 4, in 1989, launched with a new title sequence, opening with an ambulance travelling in daytime. Different activities are then shown, including the ambulance clinicians, hospital equipment, a patient being treated and a blood pressure gauge, all separated by flashes of blue light. The next part of the sequence features new camera shots of the patient's journey into resus.\n\n===1992\u20131993 (S7)===\nSeries 7 from 1992 to 1993 saw a sequence returning to the original style, with the ambulance coming over the hill and a new heartbeat line moving across the bottom of the screen. As the ambulance arrives, the staff come out of the department to move the patient to resus.\n\n===1993\u20131997 (S8\u201311)===\nIn September 1993 (Series 8), the titles were revamped, based on the series 4 style, with the ambulance. Clips showed accidents and the ambulance journey instead of the patient's journey. Whilst the ambulance is being driven, a series of clips are superimposed. The sequence ends with the ambulance arriving at casualty. The ''Casualty'' logo flashes up on the screen when the screen blurs out. The sequence was tinted blue. These lasted until February 1997 when series 11 ended.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 1995 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=A2VykArQ0QA|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132000 (S12\u201314)===\n[[File:Casualty Logo 1997.svg|right|thumb|175px|''Casualty'' logo 1997\u20132006]]\n\nAgain September 1997 saw a new look, with fragments of glass flying and a sequence utilising footage of medical staff, hospital equipment and patients' relatives. The sequence ends as all the pieces of glass that were shattered in the first few seconds of the sequence are re-formed into a single pane, which spells out the new ''Casual+y'' logo. Minor edits were made when these titles were shortened towards the end of 1998 for series 13 but they remained essentially the same until series 14 ended in March 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 1998 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=VYI5rBMj9Qc|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132001 (S15)===\nA more arty sequence appeared in September 2000 (series 15), with a fast forward technique, featuring a clock ticking through the night, an airbag deploying, the ambulance, speeding through evening traffic and patients arriving at reception. The second half of the sequence focuses on a patient being treated in Resus from a bird's-eye perspective. The sequence ends in slow motion as the patient recovers and his relatives crowd round his bed, before the people and equipment disappear, leaving the distinctive chequered flooring of the department and the ''Casual+y'' logo. The original 1986 theme tune remained, but as the 'September 1998' shortened version again.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2000 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=pWCiK_vG0yA|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2001\u20132002 (S16)===\nA new theme tune marked the arrival of series 16 in September 2001, with a distinct change to the opening titles. For the first time, the focus was on the characters, who were presented posing to the camera against a blurred dark background. The only 'medical' references were the glimpses of an ambulance and a heart rate graphic in the opening seconds of the titles. The same logo introduced in 1997 remains at the end.\n\n===2002\u20132006 (S17\u201320)===\nSeries 17, starting in September 2002, saw a return to a generic medical-themed title. The focus was on the international symbol of medical aid, the red cross, shown at different sizes moving around the screen, often filled with footage such as paramedics and a patient being given [[CPR]], against a stark white background. This sequence was also filled with abstract graphics, elements of the ''Casual+y'' logo and footage of medical emergencies. The logo is formed by the merging of the various crosses & abstract shapes at the end of the sequence. Similarly to the titles of September 2001 \u2013 June 2002 (which featured the characters), the 1997 logo remained at the end until these credits were replaced in September 2006 (series 21).<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2002 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=gJvjUXRCsF4|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132011 (S21\u201326)===\n[[File:Casualty Logo.svg|right|thumb|175px|''Casualty'' logo 2006\u20132014]]\n\nBrand new titles were introduced in series 21 \u2013 this also marked the usage of a brand new ''Casual+y'' logo \u2013 using stop-frame footage of the ambulance on its journey, followed by images of characters and equipment, mixed with footage of a patient being taken to resus. The sequence was tinted in a turquoise hue and interrupted by a flashing amber graphic, reminiscent of the heart rate line from the original titles sequence. Series 21 saw the use of an orchestral-style variation of the theme tune, though this reverted to the previous version used since series 16.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2006 opening titles|url= http://www.hellocharlie.com/work/view/casualty|work= Hello Charlie |accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2012\u20132013 (S26\u201328)===\nSeries 26 returned after its Christmas break in January 2012, filmed in high-definition for the first time, to coincide with the move to Cardiff's [[Roath Lock]]. A new opening sequence was introduced, reminiscent of the early opening titles, in homage to the show's roots. The variant of the theme music used since series 16 (except series 21) remained in use.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2012 opening titles|url= https://vimeo.com/43887861|work= Giggle Media|accessdate= 2 January 2017|date= 2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\n===2014\u20132016 (S28\u2013S30)===\nOn 4 January 2014, the theme tune received a revamp and had a resemblance to the original 1986 theme tune. The closing credits were a continuation of the new updated theme tune. As of 8 February 2014, new titles were used and so was a new CASUAL+Y logo.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2014 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=pjbL8BYYRR4 |author= Peter Anderson Studios |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2016\u20132018 (S31\u2013S33)===\nOn 27 August 2016, the 30th anniversary episode and series 31 opener, the theme tune and opening titles received a complete revamp with a darker effect as scenes around the hospital are shown with Charlie being the only character in shot with the opening titles ending with the logo and title cards. The theme tune features the BBC Wales Orchestra performing background instruments.<ref>{{cite web |title= BBC Casualty 2016 opening titles |url=http://peterandersonstudio.co.uk/work/titles/casualty-2016/|work= Peter Anderson Studios |accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2018\u2013present (S33\u2013present)===\n\nFrom Episode 13, which aired on 17th November 2018, new titles were used. The theme tune remained the same.\n===Closing theme===\n\n====1986\u20132001====\nThe original closing credit music was known for being slightly different from its opening music. It was originally over one minute in length and over the years was shortened. The original music also had a lead in, known for being haunting and emotional. At the beginning it was not used in every episode. Between series 1\u20139, it was only used during emotional endings, for example when Duffy was raped and Sandra Mute being killed off. Between series 9\u201312, it was mainly used to close every episode. In September 1998, the closing theme was moved up a [[semitone]], making the tune even more haunting. The end theme was reduced further in 2000 to go with BBC guidelines. Usage of this tune ended with series 15 in April 2001.\n\n====2001\u20132013====\nWhen the theme tune was updated in 2001, the closing credit music was a shortened version of the opening music. The main change was the lead-in music: two versions were used in the twelve years. Series 21 saw the theme tune being changed for a single series; it was made orchestral and only lasted one series. When Adam left the series at the end of series 25, a sad piano-based version was used. It has only ever been used on that one occasion.\n\nWhen the theme tune changed for series 21 in September 2006, the closing credits were essentially a continuation of the opening tune. Dramatic and edgy, it was more akin to the original 1986 theme and the current 2014 theme.\n\n====2014\u2013present====\nWhen the series returned in 2014 after the Christmas break, the theme tune had received a revamp, more akin to the original. The closing credits had been slightly extended with sections from the original end theme returning, for example the final end notes.\n\nThe end lead in music, a short emotional piece building up to the credits, harked back to the original music which was used between series 1\u201315. There were a few variations used in episodes between 2014 and 2016. An emotional version using strings and violin, A version using trumpet and beeps and a much basic sounding version just using beeps, those that sound like medical machinery. This package was used mostly until towards the end of Series 30 when a new package was slowly introduced. The original pack is still used occasionally.\n\nTowards the end of series 30, a new package slowly introduced itself. The introduction of piano replaced the \"medical/beeps\" that had been heard. Again this package includes, an emotional build up (Connie breaks down after Hugo leaves with his father), a dramatic heartbeat build (Gemma stands in shock after running Lily over), a simple piano build up (Cal finds a cufflink, not his), and a romantic version (Ethan tells Alicia that he loves her at Christmas). There has also been a version based on the actual theme tune.\n\nEpisode 1 of series 31, and episode 15 featured incidental music. Earlier series of Casualty experimented with incidental music but very rarely. Episodes 1 and 2 of the 32nd series also featured a score by the series composer Jeremy Holland-Smith.\n\n====Music cues====\nFollowing the successful 30th anniversary celebrations and music composed by Jeremy Holland-Smith, it was decided to include regular musical 'cues' from Series 32 onwards as part of each episode. The music is conducted, arranged, and produced by Justine Barker. The music is often used to emphasise the significance of a part in the story, and there are multiple versions of these cues that have been produced. The music is generally formed of piano, strings, and guitar instruments, and whilst varied in structure, it contains themes that are resonant with the main theme tune of the show, allowing for use in many different circumstances across different episodes.\n\n==DVD releases==\nThe first three series of ''Casualty'' were released on DVD ''(Region 2, UK)'' by [[2 Entertain]]/Cinema Club. The third was released to coincide with the show's 20th anniversary celebrations. In Australia the first series was released by Umbrella Entertainment. There are no future DVD releases planned at present for the UK or Australia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:99%; left:0 auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|DVD title\n!rowspan=\"2\"|No. of discs\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year(s)\n!rowspan=\"2\"|No. of episodes\n!colspan=\"3\"|DVD release\n|-\n![[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n![[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n!rowspan=\"1\"|Notes\n|-\n| style=\"background:#de0002\"|\n|[[Casualty (series 1)|Casualty Series 1]]\n|4\n|1986\n|15\n|rowspan=1|10 April 2006<ref>{{cite web|title=Casualty \u2013 Series 1 DVD 1986|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Casualty-Series-DVD-Bernard-Gallagher/dp/B000E6D1O2|publisher=[[amazon.co.uk]]|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=2006-04-10}}</ref>\n|8 December 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Casualty \u2013 Series 1|url=http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/dvd/dvd-genres/drama-romance/casualty-series-1/380398|publisher=[[JB Hi-Fi]]|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#0080CA;\"|\n|[[Casualty (series 2)|Casualty Series 2]]\n|4\n|1987\n|15\n|10 July 2006<ref>{{cite web|title=Casualty \u2013 Series 2 DVD 1986|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Casualty-Series-DVD-Bernard-Gallagher/dp/B000FL79IK|publisher=[[amazon.co.uk]]|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=2006-07-10}}</ref>\n|{{N/A}}\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#F46B08;\"|\n|[[Casualty (series 3)|Casualty Series 3]]\n|3\n|1988\n|10\n|11 September 2006<ref>{{cite web|title=Casualty \u2013 Series 3 DVD|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Casualty-Series-DVD-Bernard-Gallagher/dp/B000HA46P8|publisher=[[amazon.co.uk]]|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=2006-09-11}}</ref>\n|{{N/A}}\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n==International broadcast==\nThe series is aired in [[Ireland]] on [[RT\u00c9 One]] airs Monday at 8.05am and Tuesday to Friday at 7.50am.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/player/|title=RT\u00c9 Player|website=[[RT\u00c9 Player]]|language=en|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\nAmerican viewers can watch the series on [[Britbox]], a subscription service U.S. streaming service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/uk/amp/news/britbox-the-one-stop-streaming-service-for-classic-british-tv|title=BritBox: the one-stop streaming service for classic British TV {{!}} TechRadar|website=[[TechRadar]]|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/02/bbc-itv-britbox-uk-launch/|title=BBC and ITV Will Launch Their US Streaming Service BritBox in Actual Britain|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations and related media==\n\n===''Holby City''===\n{{Main article|Holby City}}\n''Holby City'' began on 12 January 1999 as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''Casualty'' and is named after the fictional [[Holby City Hospital]] in which both series are set.

The final episode of series 6, which focused on a plane crash, was postponed until February 1992, after being initially scheduled for transmission on 20 December 1991 \u2013 one day before the 3rd anniversary of the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie disaster]].\n\nWhen the show moved back to Saturday nights in September 1992, the series length was extended to 24 episodes per year, and placed in a pre-watershed slot at approximately 8 pm.

Special events such as the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and sporting events sometimes see the schedule moved around. On most of these occasions, ''Casualty'' is taken [[Off-the-air|off-air]] for the night to make way for alternative shows. It has been known in the past that if an episode is in two parts, part one will be aired on the Saturday and part two on Sunday. It is broadcast across Europe via [[BBC Entertainment]] on the same date.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Casualty characters|Characters of Casualty}}\n''Casualty'' follows the professional and personal lives of the medical and ancillary staff of Holby City Hospital's emergency department. It features an ensemble cast of regular characters, and began with ten main characters in its [[Casualty (series 1)|first series]].

A CGI heart monitor was shown over the titles. The 49 second sequence shows the patient's point of view and their journey through the department into [[resuscitation|resus]]. The heartbeat turned into [[electric arc]]s, possibly as a result of a [[defibrillator]] being used as the bed moves around the hospital. The theme is used again in second episode of series 30, this time inter-cut with scenes of Connie Beauchamp ([[Amanda Mealing]]) performing CPR on Charlie Fairhead ([[Derek Thompson (actor)|Derek Thompson]]) and also Lofty ([[Lee Mead]]) travelling through the Emergency Department.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty Series 30 special opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=UoXHureeKWc|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131992 (S4\u20136)===\nSeries 4, in 1989, launched with a new title sequence, opening with an ambulance travelling in daytime. Different activities are then shown, including the ambulance clinicians, hospital equipment, a patient being treated and a blood pressure gauge, all separated by flashes of blue light. The next part of the sequence features new camera shots of the patient's journey into resus.\n\n===1992\u20131993 (S7)===\nSeries 7 from 1992 to 1993 saw a sequence returning to the original style, with the ambulance coming over the hill and a new heartbeat line moving across the bottom of the screen. As the ambulance arrives, the staff come out of the department to move the patient to resus.\n\n===1993\u20131997 (S8\u201311)===\nIn September 1993 (Series 8), the titles were revamped, based on the series 4 style, with the ambulance. Clips showed accidents and the ambulance journey instead of the patient's journey. Whilst the ambulance is being driven, a series of clips are superimposed. The sequence ends with the ambulance arriving at casualty. The ''Casualty'' logo flashes up on the screen when the screen blurs out. The sequence was tinted blue. These lasted until February 1997 when series 11 ended.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 1995 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=A2VykArQ0QA|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132000 (S12\u201314)===\n[[File:Casualty Logo 1997.svg|right|thumb|175px|''Casualty'' logo 1997\u20132006]]\n\nAgain September 1997 saw a new look, with fragments of glass flying and a sequence utilising footage of medical staff, hospital equipment and patients' relatives. The sequence ends as all the pieces of glass that were shattered in the first few seconds of the sequence are re-formed into a single pane, which spells out the new ''Casual+y'' logo. Minor edits were made when these titles were shortened towards the end of 1998 for series 13 but they remained essentially the same until series 14 ended in March 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 1998 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=VYI5rBMj9Qc|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132001 (S15)===\nA more arty sequence appeared in September 2000 (series 15), with a fast forward technique, featuring a clock ticking through the night, an airbag deploying, the ambulance, speeding through evening traffic and patients arriving at reception. The second half of the sequence focuses on a patient being treated in Resus from a bird's-eye perspective. The sequence ends in slow motion as the patient recovers and his relatives crowd round his bed, before the people and equipment disappear, leaving the distinctive chequered flooring of the department and the ''Casual+y'' logo. The original 1986 theme tune remained, but as the 'September 1998' shortened version again.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2000 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=pWCiK_vG0yA|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2001\u20132002 (S16)===\nA new theme tune marked the arrival of series 16 in September 2001, with a distinct change to the opening titles. For the first time, the focus was on the characters, who were presented posing to the camera against a blurred dark background. The only 'medical' references were the glimpses of an ambulance and a heart rate graphic in the opening seconds of the titles. The same logo introduced in 1997 remains at the end.\n\n===2002\u20132006 (S17\u201320)===\nSeries 17, starting in September 2002, saw a return to a generic medical-themed title. The focus was on the international symbol of medical aid, the red cross, shown at different sizes moving around the screen, often filled with footage such as paramedics and a patient being given [[CPR]], against a stark white background. This sequence was also filled with abstract graphics, elements of the ''Casual+y'' logo and footage of medical emergencies. The logo is formed by the merging of the various crosses & abstract shapes at the end of the sequence. Similarly to the titles of September 2001 \u2013 June 2002 (which featured the characters), the 1997 logo remained at the end until these credits were replaced in September 2006 (series 21).<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2002 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=gJvjUXRCsF4|accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132011 (S21\u201326)===\n[[File:Casualty Logo.svg|right|thumb|175px|''Casualty'' logo 2006\u20132014]]\n\nBrand new titles were introduced in series 21 \u2013 this also marked the usage of a brand new ''Casual+y'' logo \u2013 using stop-frame footage of the ambulance on its journey, followed by images of characters and equipment, mixed with footage of a patient being taken to resus. The sequence was tinted in a turquoise hue and interrupted by a flashing amber graphic, reminiscent of the heart rate line from the original titles sequence. Series 21 saw the use of an orchestral-style variation of the theme tune, though this reverted to the previous version used since series 16.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2006 opening titles|url= http://www.hellocharlie.com/work/view/casualty|work= Hello Charlie |accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2012\u20132013 (S26\u201328)===\nSeries 26 returned after its Christmas break in January 2012, filmed in high-definition for the first time, to coincide with the move to Cardiff's [[Roath Lock]]. A new opening sequence was introduced, reminiscent of the early opening titles, in homage to the show's roots. The variant of the theme music used since series 16 (except series 21) remained in use.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2012 opening titles|url= https://vimeo.com/43887861|work= Giggle Media|accessdate= 2 January 2017|date= 2012-06-12}}</ref>\n\n===2014\u20132016 (S28\u2013S30)===\nOn 4 January 2014, the theme tune received a revamp and had a resemblance to the original 1986 theme tune. The closing credits were a continuation of the new updated theme tune. As of 8 February 2014, new titles were used and so was a new CASUAL+Y logo.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC Casualty 2014 opening titles|url= https://youtube.com/watch?v=pjbL8BYYRR4 |author= Peter Anderson Studios |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate= 2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2016\u20132018 (S31\u2013S33)===\nOn 27 August 2016, the 30th anniversary episode and series 31 opener, the theme tune and opening titles received a complete revamp with a darker effect as scenes around the hospital are shown with Charlie being the only character in shot with the opening titles ending with the logo and title cards. The theme tune features the BBC Wales Orchestra performing background instruments.<ref>{{cite web |title= BBC Casualty 2016 opening titles |url=http://peterandersonstudio.co.uk/work/titles/casualty-2016/|work= Peter Anderson Studios |accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2018\u2013present (S33\u2013present)===\n\nFrom Episode 13, which aired on 17th November 2018, new titles were used. The theme tune remained the same.\n===Closing theme===\n\n====1986\u20132001====\nThe original closing credit music was known for being slightly different from its opening music. It was originally over one minute in length and over the years was shortened. The original music also had a lead in, known for being haunting and emotional. At the beginning it was not used in every episode. Between series 1\u20139, it was only used during emotional endings, for example when Duffy was raped and Sandra Mute being killed off. Between series 9\u201312, it was mainly used to close every episode. In September 1998, the closing theme was moved up a [[semitone]], making the tune even more haunting. The end theme was reduced further in 2000 to go with BBC guidelines. Usage of this tune ended with series 15 in April 2001.\n\n====2001\u20132013====\nWhen the theme tune was updated in 2001, the closing credit music was a shortened version of the opening music. The main change was the lead-in music: two versions were used in the twelve years. Series 21 saw the theme tune being changed for a single series; it was made orchestral and only lasted one series. When Adam left the series at the end of series 25, a sad piano-based version was used. It has only ever been used on that one occasion.\n\nWhen the theme tune changed for series 21 in September 2006, the closing credits were essentially a continuation of the opening tune. Dramatic and edgy, it was more akin to the original 1986 theme and the current 2014 theme.\n\n====2014\u2013present====\nWhen the series returned in 2014 after the Christmas break, the theme tune had received a revamp, more akin to the original. The closing credits had been slightly extended with sections from the original end theme returning, for example the final end notes.\n\nThe end lead in music, a short emotional piece building up to the credits, harked back to the original music which was used between series 1\u201315. There were a few variations used in episodes between 2014 and 2016. An emotional version using strings and violin, A version using trumpet and beeps and a much basic sounding version just using beeps, those that sound like medical machinery. This package was used mostly until towards the end of Series 30 when a new package was slowly introduced. The original pack is still used occasionally.\n\nTowards the end of series 30, a new package slowly introduced itself. The introduction of piano replaced the \"medical/beeps\" that had been heard. Again this package includes, an emotional build up (Connie breaks down after Hugo leaves with his father), a dramatic heartbeat build (Gemma stands in shock after running Lily over), a simple piano build up (Cal finds a cufflink, not his), and a romantic version (Ethan tells Alicia that he loves her at Christmas). There has also been a version based on the actual theme tune.\n\nEpisode 1 of series 31, and episode 15 featured incidental music. Earlier series of Casualty experimented with incidental music but very rarely. Episodes 1 and 2 of the 32nd series also featured a score by the series composer Jeremy Holland-Smith.\n\n====Music cues====\nFollowing the successful 30th anniversary celebrations and music composed by Jeremy Holland-Smith, it was decided to include regular musical 'cues' from Series 32 onwards as part of each episode. The music is conducted, arranged, and produced by Justine Barker. The music is often used to emphasise the significance of a part in the story, and there are multiple versions of these cues that have been produced.

En route, ''Art\u00e9sien'', which had originally been appointed to a shorter mission, found herself short on water, and Captain de Cardaillac requested permission to resupply at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]. Suffren gave permission but, unwilling to scatter his forces, ordered his entire squadron to move into [[Praia Harbor|Praia Harbour]]. Arriving there at 0830 the morning of 16 April, ''Art\u00e9sien'' spotted five British warship at anchor; she turned, signalling \"enemy ships in sight\".

On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref> \n\nIn the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.<ref name=cunat100>Cunat, p.100</ref> The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras. The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. D'Orves died the same day at 1600.<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref> \n\n\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

The British escort, comprising the 74-gun {{HMS|Ramillies|1763|6}}, under Captain Sir [[John Moutray]], and the frigates [[HMS Thetis (1773)|''Thetis'']] and [[HMS Southampton (1757)|''Southampton'']], fled before the vastly superior combined fleet. Suffren attempted to give chase, but the [[copper sheathing]] of the British warship gave them a decisive advantage, and he abandoned the pursuit to help with the capture of the merchantmen.<ref name=cunat42 />{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After the battle, Suffren wrote a letter to [[Antoine de Sartine]], [[Secretary of State of the Navy (France)|Secretary of State of the Navy]], to advocate for the French Navy to copper is own ships.<ref name=cunat44>Cunat, p.44</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], France and the [[Dutch Republic]] found themselves allied against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The Dutch expected the British to send an expeditionary force to try and capture their [[Dutch Cape Colony]], and Suffren was given command of a 5-ship squadron to reinforce it. The task force comprised the 74-gun [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1778)|''H\u00e9ros'']] (under Suffren) and [[French ship Annibal (1778)|''Annibal'']] (under [[Achille de Tr\u00e9migon|Tr\u00e9mignon]]), and the 64-gun [[French ship Art\u00e9sien|''Art\u00e9sien'']] (under Cardaillac), [[French ship Sphinx (1776)|''Sphinx'']] (under du Chilleau) and [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']] (under Forbin), <ref name=cunat48>Cunat, p.48</ref> as well as the 16-gun corvette [[French corvette Fortune (1780)|''Fortune'']] (under Captain de Lusignan), and seven transports <ref name=cunat49>Cunat, p.49</ref> carrying the [[107th Infantry Regiment (France)|R\u00e9giment de Pondich\u00e9ry]], under Brigadier General [[Thomas Conway]].<ref name=cunat63>Cunat, p.63</ref>\n\nThe squadron departed Brest on 22 marche 1781. En route, ''Art\u00e9sien'', which had originally been appointed to a shorter mission, found herself short on water, and Captain de Cardaillac requested permission to resupply at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]. Suffren gave permission but, unwilling to scatter his forces, ordered his entire squadron to move into [[Praia Harbor|Praia Harbour]]. Arriving there at 0830 the morning of 16 April, ''Art\u00e9sien'' spotted five British warship at anchor; she turned, signalling \"enemy ships in sight\". Understanding that random chance had put him in contact with [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]]'s squadron,<ref name=hennequin294>Hennequin, p.294</ref> Suffren ordered an immediate attack.<ref name=cunat50>Cunat, p.50</ref> At 1000, Suffren's squadron attacked, precipitating the [[Battle of Porto Praya]].

''Charmante'' returned to Lorient to bring the news of the engagement, while the other survivors sailed on to Isle de France. By 1780, Tronjoly was recalled to France, leaving d'Orves in command with a total of six ships of the line at his disposal.<ref name=cunat83 />\n\nSuffren arrived at Isle de France on 25 October 1780.<ref name=cunat94>Cunat, p.94</ref><ref name=hennequin297>Hennequin, p.297</ref> The island had been selected as the base for French operations in the Indian Ocean, falling under the overall command of [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau]].<ref name=cunat95>Cunat, p.95</ref>\n\nOn 7 December 1781, d'Orves led a 27-ship fleet to Ceylon, with his flag on ''Orient''. He had 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes at his disposal. En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref><ref group=Note>Present-day [[Chennai]]</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref> \n\nIn the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.<ref name=cunat100>Cunat, p.100</ref> The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras. The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. D'Orves died the same day at 1600.<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref> \n\n\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.
