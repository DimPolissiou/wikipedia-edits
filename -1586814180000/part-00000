While the term ''\"Romanesque\"'' refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], the trend in fact appeared throughout Western and Central Europe. The romanesque style is defined by large and bulky edifices that are typically made up of simple, compact, sparsely decorated geometric structures. Frequent features of the Romanesque church include [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] gained popularity. Interiors widened and the motifs of [[sculpture]]s took on more epic traits and themes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&dq=romanesque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Gothic architecture ====\n[[File:Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia, 2015-07-21, DD 21-23 HDR.jpg|thumb|[[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] in southern Colombia.]]\nISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION\nThe [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[\u00cele-de-France]] and subsequently spread throughout Europe. Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the romanesque era and decorations often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegorical]] features. The first [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es began to appear, all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, rigid walls to ensure structural stability. This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. [[Nave]] ceilings became higher and pillars and steeples grew taller. Many architects used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination which resulted in the collapse of several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. In [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, a style in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] would be built to the same height.\n\nGothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, as in the romanesque era, and many share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of detail and complexity in decoration. The [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, as well as the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d\u2019Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], and the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[England]] demonstrate the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.\n\nSome of the most well-known gothic churches remained unfinished for centuries, after the gothic style fell out of popularity. The construction of the  [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was begun in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842 is one such example.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gothic+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}</ref>\nISLAM IS A FAKE RELIGION\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches.

The term is often used by [[Christians]] to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used as an analogy to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.<ref>Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism \"The Manichaean Church\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref> In traditional [[Christian architecture]], a church interior is often structured in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center [[aisle]] and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the [[Church_architecture#Characteristics_of_the_early_Christian_church_building|bema]] and [[altar]].\n\nTowers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and, conversely, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.\n\nThe earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] (including [[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd|\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd]]}}) means \"belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''\" (\"Lord\"), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence \"''Kyriak\u00f3s o\u00edkos''\" ({{lang|grc|K\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}) (\"house of the Lord\", church), \"''Kyriak\u0113''\" ({{lang|grc|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae}}) (\"[the day] of the Lord\", i.e. [[Sunday]]), or \"''Kyriak\u0113 proseukh\u0113''\" ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae}}) (the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\").<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\">{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|''Cyrican'' is an Old English word for churches and church property]]\nIn standard Greek usage, the older word \"ecclesia\" ({{lang-el|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''ekkles\u00eda'', literally \"assembly\", \"congregation\", or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a \"[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch\"]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the \"'''C'''hurch\"]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''\u00e9glise'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').<ref name=\"OEtymDChurch\" />\n\nIn the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-\u00f3s/-\u0113/-\u00f3n'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof.

Besides serving as a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was frequently employed as a general gathering-place by the communities in which they were located, hosting such events as [[guild]] meetings, [[banquet]]s, [[mystery plays]], and [[fair]]s. Church grounds and buildings were also used for the threshing and storage of grain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}</ref>\n\n==== Romanesque architecture ====\nBetween 1000 and 1200 the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] style became popular across [[Europe]]. While the term ''\"Romanesque\"'' refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], the trend in fact appeared throughout Western and Central Europe. The romanesque style is defined by large and bulky edifices that are typically made up of simple, compact, sparsely decorated geometric structures. Frequent features of the Romanesque church include [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] gained popularity. Interiors widened and the motifs of [[sculpture]]s took on more epic traits and themes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&dq=romanesque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Gothic architecture ====\n[[File:Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia, 2015-07-21, DD 21-23 HDR.jpg|thumb|[[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] in southern Colombia.]]\n\nThe [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[\u00cele-de-France]] and subsequently spread throughout Europe. Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the romanesque era and decorations often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegorical]] features. The first [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es began to appear, all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, rigid walls to ensure structural stability. This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. [[Nave]] ceilings became higher and pillars and steeples grew taller. Many architects used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination which resulted in the collapse of several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. In [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, a style in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] would be built to the same height.\n\nGothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, as in the romanesque era, and many share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of detail and complexity in decoration. The [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, as well as the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d\u2019Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], and the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[England]] demonstrate the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.\n\nSome of the most well-known gothic churches remained unfinished for centuries, after the gothic style fell out of popularity. The construction of the  [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was begun in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842 is one such example.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gothic+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built. Typical features are columns and classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=70m1KbuD5YoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=renaissance+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWwu-Bo-TVAhUDORQKHfd9B3YQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=renaissance%20architecture&f=false|title=Renaissance Architecture|last=Anderson|first=Christy|date=2013-02-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780192842275|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]], where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the [[pulpit]].\n\n=== Baroque architecture ===\nThe [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style was first used in [[Italy]] around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence. The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] were replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the [[Rococo|rococo era]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=eaC7yKbxj8UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=baroque+architecture&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi14YH0rOTVAhXQERQKHZaZDEoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=baroque%20architecture&f=false|title=Pietro Da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture|last=Merz|first=J\u00f6rg Martin|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300111231|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Protestantism|Protestant parishes]] preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{main article|Church architecture}}\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]\nA common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dqIZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=Remarks on Church Architecture ...|last=Petit|first=John Louis|date=1841|publisher=J.

Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world.

The town was put together in the 1960s and 1970s as a [[new town]] on previously industrial and agricultural land and smaller towns. Like other [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] of the era, Telford was created from the merger of other, smaller settlements, most notably the towns of [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], [[Oakengates]], [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]] and [[Dawley]]. Many of the New Town's newer inhabitants were originally from [[Birmingham]] or [[Wolverhampton]].\n\n[[Telford Shopping Centre]], a modern shopping mall, was constructed at the new town's geographical centre, along with an extensive [[Telford Town Park|Town Park]]. The [[M54 motorway]] was completed in 1983, improving the town's road links with the [[West Midlands conurbation]].\n\nOn Telford's southern boundaries is the [[Ironbridge Gorge]], a scenic tourist destination and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The town advertises itself as \"The Birthplace of Industry\", due to it having [[Coalbrookdale]] and other places in the Ironbridge Gorge area, within its boundary.  These areas are internationally recognised as being important to the [[Industrial Revolution]], and being to a large extent constructed on the Shropshire Coalfield. Its influence was greatly used to further Birmingham\u2019s industry through innovations as well.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:SunnycroftWellington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunnycroft]] near Wellington]]\nEarly settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the [[Weald Moors]] (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman [[Watling Street]] was built.

Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council.

The ''Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order'' was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by {{convert|10143|acre|km2}} of \"land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington\".<ref>''London Gazette''.  13 December 1963.</ref> This Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]] who, in 1787, became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.\n\nMost of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by Commission for the New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council.

Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nCritics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover.

Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. The guilt in the narrator can be seen when the narrator confessed to the police that the body of the old man was under the floor boards. Even though the old man was dead, the body and heart of the dead man still seemed to haunt the narrator and convict him of his ungodly deeds. \"Since such processes of reasoning tend to convict the speaker of madness, it does not seem out of keeping that he is driven to confession...\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=E.

If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing deathwatch beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, \"[the old man] never wronged\", the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nCritics argue that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E. Arthur. \"Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\" in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales'', edited by William L. Howarth. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1971, p. 94.</ref> Their denial of insanity is based on their systematic actions and their precision, as they provide a rational explanation for irrational behavior.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\"/> This rationality, however, is undermined by their lack of motive (\"Object there was none. Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/> It is difficult to fully understand the narrator's true emotions about the blue eyed man because of this contradiction. It is said that \"At the same time he disclosed a deep psychological confusion\", referring to the narrator and his comment that \"Object there was none. Passion there was none\" and that the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=E.

Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\"; which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J. Hayes.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing deathwatch beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Paranoid schizophrenics very often experience auditory hallucinations. These auditory hallucinations are more often voices, but can also be sounds.<ref name=\"Zimmerman-p39-48\">ZIMMERMAN, BRETT. \u201c\u2018Moral Insanity\u2019 or Paranoid Schizophrenia: Poe's \u2018The Tell-Tale Heart.\u2019\u201d Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature, vol. 25, no. 2, 1992, pp. 39\u201348.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''.

His first printed work was a translation of [[Horace]]'s epistle to [[Maecenas]], published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.\n\nHis family tutor was [[Semyon Raich]], a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count [[Ostermann-Tolstoy]], to [[Munich]] to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.\n\nIn Munich he fell in love with [[Amalie Adlerberg|Amalie von Lerchenfeld]], the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem ''Tears'' or ''Slyozy'' (''Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...'') coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Am\u00e9lie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are ''K. N.'', and ''Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe\u2026'' Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822\u20131826), giving details of his [[frustration|frustrated]] love affair for Am\u00e9lie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron [[Alexander von Kr\u00fcdener]]), in January 1825. Am\u00e9lie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Kr\u00fcdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title ''K.B.'' (''Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe''), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Am\u00e9lie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer.<ref>Nikolayev, A.A., 'Zagaka \"K.B.\"', ''Neva'', 1988, No. 2, pp. 190-196.</ref> Tyutchev's last meeting with Am\u00e9lie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: \n<blockquote>\nYesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Kr\u00fcdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.<ref>F.I. Tyutchev, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniy i pis'ma'', 6 vols., Moscow, 2002-2005. VI, p. 416.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] and the philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]]. In 1826, he married the [[Bavaria]]n widow of a Russian diplomat [[Eleonore Peterson]], n\u00e9e Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter [[Anna Tiuttjev]].  Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness [[Ernestine von D\u00f6rnberg]], n\u00e9e von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. \n[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]\n\nIn 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).\n\nIn 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.\n\nTyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.\n\nAs a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.\n\nIn 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.\n\n==Political views==\n[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffel family|von Pfeffel]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]\nTyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.\n\nOn domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.\n\nHis fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: \n{{Quotation|\n:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?\n:For her no yardstick was created:\n:Her soul is of a special kind,\n:By faith alone appreciated.\n:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}\n\n== Poetry ==\n\nTyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.\n\nThe 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].\n\n== Sample of verse ==\n\n''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} \n[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]\n:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal\n:the way you dream, the things you feel.\n:Deep in your spirit let them rise\n:akin to stars in crystal skies\n:that set before the night is blurred:\n:delight in them and speak no word.\n\n:How can a heart expression find?\n:How should another know your mind?\n:Will he discern what quickens you?\n:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.\n:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:\n:drink at the source and speak no word.\n\n:Live in your inner self alone\n:within your soul a world has grown,\n:the magic of veiled thoughts that might\n:be blinded by the outer light,\n:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...\n:take in their song and speak no word. \n:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])\n\nIncidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem \u201cNous avons pu tous deux\u2026\u201d by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afanasy Fet]]\n* [[List of 19th-century Russian Slavophiles]]\n\n==References==\n*{{note|nasledstvo}} Literaturnoe nasledstvo.

Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. \n[[Image:Owstug.JPG|thumb|left|The manor of Tyutchev's father in the [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk region]]]]\n\nIn 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in ''[[Sovremennik]]'', a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).\n\nIn 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in [[Turin]]. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to [[St Petersburg]] in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.\n\nTyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.\n\nAs a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as ''bagatelles'', not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and others without any help from the author.\n\nIn 1850, he began an illicit affair with [[Elena Denisyeva]], over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\".<ref>I.V. Petrova; K.V. Pigarev; D.S. Merezhkovsky. Quoted in John Dewey, ''Mirror of the Soul. A Life of the Poet Fyodor Tyutchev'', Shaftesbury (Brimstone Press), 2010, p. 325.</ref> One of the poems, ''Last Love'', is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1873 and was interred at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg]]. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.\n\n==Political views==\n[[File:Tyutcheva.jpg|thumb|165px|Tyutchev's second wife, Baroness Ernestine [[Pfeffer family|von Pfeffer]]. Her father was a Bavarian Ambassador in Paris and London.]]\nTyutchev was a militant [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]], who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Ottoman Empire]] or [[Poland]], the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the [[Crimean War]] made him look critically at the Russian government as well.\n\nOn domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], particularly the [[Emancipation Reform of 1861]]. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.\n\nHis fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: \n{{Quotation|\n:Who would grasp Russia with the mind?\n:For her no yardstick was created:\n:Her soul is of a special kind,\n:By faith alone appreciated.\n:::::::::::(translated by John Dewey)}}\n\n== Poetry ==\n\nTyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. [[Occasional poetry|Occasional pieces]], translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.\n\nThe 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". [https://archive.is/20080227084942/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/001/241/1.htm] In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the [[Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Alexander Blok]].\n\n== Sample of verse ==\n\n''Silentium!'' is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in [[silence]] easier than aloud toward [[alterity|others]]. Like so many of his poems, its images are [[anthropomorphic]] and pulsing with [[pantheism]]. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" {{note|nasledstvo}} \n[[File:Fedor Tutchev.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky|Levitsky]], 1856.]]\n:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal\n:the way you dream, the things you feel.\n:Deep in your spirit let them rise\n:akin to stars in crystal skies\n:that set before the night is blurred:\n:delight in them and speak no word.\n\n:How can a heart expression find?\n:How should another know your mind?\n:Will he discern what quickens you?\n:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.\n:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:\n:drink at the source and speak no word.\n\n:Live in your inner self alone\n:within your soul a world has grown,\n:the magic of veiled thoughts that might\n:be blinded by the outer light,\n:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...\n:take in their song and speak no word. \n:::::::::::(trans. by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])\n\nIncidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, [[Georgi Catoire]] (the setting of the poem in the song ''Silentium''), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for [[Nikolai Medtner]]'s ''Night Wind'' piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by [[Rakhmaninov]] of Tyutchev's poem ''Spring Waters''. While the title of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian<ref>[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'.  At the end of [[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s film [[Stalker (1979 film)|''Stalker'']], a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician [[Bj\u00f6rk]] used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"[[The Dull Flame Of Desire]]\" from her album ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]''.The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] includes a setting of Tyutchev's French-language poem \u201cNous avons pu tous deux\u2026\u201d by the composer [[Isabelle Aboulker]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Afanasy Fet]]\n* [[List of 19th-century Russian Slavophiles]]\n\n==References==\n*{{note|nasledstvo}} Literaturnoe nasledstvo.
