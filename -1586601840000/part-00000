Reynolds (senator)|William H. Reynolds]], the building was constructed by [[Walter Chrysler]], the head of the [[Chrysler]] Corporation, and served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with [[40 Wall Street]] and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it; rather, Walter Chrysler decided to pay for it himself so that his children could inherit it.\n\nWhen the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from views of it as inane and unoriginal to the idea that it was modernist and iconic. Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style; and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the ''[[List of America's Favorite Architecture according to the AIA|List of America's Favorite Architecture]]'' by the [[American Institute of Architects]]. The building was designated a [[New York City landmark]] in 1978, and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Context ===\n[[File:Chrysler Building 2005 4.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A view of the Chrysler Building from the Empire State Building|The Chrysler Building from the [[Empire State Building]], both erected as part of New York City's 1920s building boom]]\n\nIn the mid-1920s, [[New York metropolitan area|New York's metropolitan area]] surpassed&nbsp;[[Greater London|London's]] as the [[List of largest cities throughout history|world's most populous metropolitan area]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iUhBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA197|title=America's Urban History|last=Boehm|first=Lisa Krissoff|last2=Corey|first2=Steven Hunt|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2014|isbn=978-1-317-81332-3|page=197|access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref> and its population exceeded ten million by the early 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demographia.com/db-nyuza1800.htm|title=New York Urbanized Area: Population & Density from 1800 (Provisional)|date=September 1, 2002|website=DEMOGRAPHIA|access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref> The era was characterized by profound social and technological changes.

The dimensions of each elevator were {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} deep by {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} The doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods.<ref name=\"in-arch\"/> When the doors are closed, they resemble \"tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies\" from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles \"an exquisite Art Deco room\".{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}} These elements were influenced by Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style.{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=171}} According to Vincent Curcio, \"these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building.\"{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}\n\nEven though the woods in the elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns, each cab had a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that \"if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [the elevators] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences on the design of the entire building.\"{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=428}}  The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to the cab.

Reynolds (senator)|William H. Reynolds]], the building was constructed by [[Walter Chrysler]], the head of the [[Chrysler]] Corporation, and served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with [[40 Wall Street]] and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it; rather, Walter Chrysler decided to pay for it himself so that his children could inherit it.\n\nWhen the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from views of it as inane and unoriginal to the idea that it was modernist and iconic.

There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the Zoning Law of 1916. This gives the building the appearance of a [[ziggurat]] on one side and a U-shaped [[palazzo]] on the other.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}} Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, above which the structure is funneled into a [[Maltese cross]] shape{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}} that \"blends the square shaft to the [[finial]]\", according to author and photographer [[Cervin Robinson]].{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}\n\nThe floor plans of the first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize the amount of rental space nearest ground level, which was seen as most desirable. The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. The area between floors 28 and 31 added \"visual interest to the middle of the building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial. They provide a base to the column of the tower, effecting a transition between the blocky lower stories and the lofty shaft.\"{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}\n\n==== Designs between setbacks ====\nThe ground floor exterior is covered in polished [[black granite]] from Shastone, while the three floors above it are done in [[white marble]] from Georgia. There are two main entrances, on Lexington Avenue and on 42nd Street, each three floors high with Shastone granite surrounding each [[proscenium]]-shaped entryway. At some distance into each main entryway, there are revolving doors located \"beneath intricately patterned metal and glass screens\", designed so as to embody the Art Deco tenet of amplifying the entrance's visual impact. A smaller side entrance on 43rd Street is only one story high.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}{{sfn|Kingston|2017|p=175}} There are storefronts consisting of large Nirosta-steel-framed windows at ground level, with office windows on the second through fourth floors.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}\n\nThe west and east elevations of the building contain the air shafts above the fourth floor, while the north and south sides contain the receding setbacks.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Below the 16th floor, the facade is clad with white brick interrupted by white-marble bands in a manner similar to a [[basket weaving]].{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=161}} The windows, arranged in grids, do not have [[window sill]]s, the frames being flush with the facade.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} Between the 16th and 24th floors, the exterior exhibits vertical white brick columns that are separated by windows on each floor. This visual effect is made possible by the presence of aluminum [[spandrel]]s between the columns of windows on each floor. There are abstract reliefs on the 20th through 22nd-floor spandrels, while the 24th floor contains {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} decorative pineapples.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}}\n\nAbove the third setback, consisting of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=3}} At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger.{{sfn|Curcio|2001|p=418}}{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}} The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders,{{sfn|Nash|McGrath|1999|p=63}} which symbolizes both the Chrysler Corporation and serves as a visual signature of the building's Art Deco design.<ref name=\"jayebee.com\"/><ref name=\"emporis\" /> The bonnet embellishments take the shape of [[Mercury (god)|Mercury's]] [[Petasos|winged helmet]] and resemble hood ornaments installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=96}}\n\nThe shaft of the tower was designed to emphasize both the horizontal and vertical: each of the tower's four sides contains three columns of windows, each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along the entirety of each side. The spandrels separating the windows contain \"alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick\", while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}}\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe interior of the building contains several innovative elements.

After burrowing their way through the liver tissue, they again use the [[Efferent arteriole|efferent blood stream]] to carry them to the [[lungs]]. There, they get stuck in the [[capillaries]] surrounding the lungs and they penetrate the lung [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]. It takes approximately 7 days to reach the lungs. Once the larvae are inside the lung, they migrate up the respiratory tree and are eventually [[cough]]ed up and swallowed by the host to reach the [[small intestine]] again as soon as 10 days after infection. There, the larvae undergo their first molt inside the host to reach the L4 stage by day 14 post-infection. Around day 25 post infection, they develop into the L5 stage. Worms reach adulthood 6 weeks after infection, and when both female and male worms are present in the same host, [[fertilized egg]]s are produced and secreted by the female worm.

There, the larvae undergo their first molt inside the host to reach the L4 stage by day 14 post-infection. Around day 25 post infection, they develop into the L5 stage.

The side skirts on previous models were removed, leaving the running gear exposed. There was a distinctive shape to the tracks with the top run angled upwards towards the front.\n\nOnly twelve were sold to British Army in 1935, which adopted the official name of Dragon, Medium, Mark IV: some of these went to France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|BEF]] at the start of WW2.{{sfn|Suttie|2015|page=needed}}. The UK versions were fitted with an [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]] 6-cylinder inline water-cooled diesel engine <!-- Possibly 8.1 litres, 95 bhp? --> as fitted to London buses (eg the [[AEC Q-type]]). Export versions were powered by an [[Armstrong-Siddeley Puma]] petrol 4-cylinder engine developing 91.5 bhp.\n\nIn 1935 the Army decided to concentrate on using wheeled vehicles for towing all the army's artillery (such as the [[Morris CDSW]] and later the [[Morris C8|Quad]], and the [[AEC Matador]]), and the procurement of tracked artillery tractors was dropped. Nevertheless, Mark IIIC Medium Dragons were still being used in 1942.<ref name=US_WD /><ref>Sound clip at IWM but perhaps not available: [https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80007628 Allied Lorries and Dragon Artillery Tractor Passing, North West Europe, 1945] - Light or Medium Dragon?</ref>\n\nA cargo version of the Medium Dragon Mark IV was also produced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vickers 6 ton Mark E-type Light Tank |last=Panzerserra |date=26 March 2013 |url=http://panzerserra.blogspot.com/2013/03/vickers-6-ton-mark-e-type-light-tank.html |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nVickers exported considerably more Mark IVs (and 6-ton tanks) to foreign armies.

The Medium Dragons towed a wide range of artillery, from 18-pounder to 60-pounder guns.\n\nFrom c1929 [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] also made the [[Vickers Light Dragon|Light Dragon]] tractor for towing light artillery, with a similar name but of a completely different design based on early versions of [[Light tanks of the United Kingdom|Vickers Light Tanks]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:NLS Haig - Artillery going through a cutting in the Canal du Nord.jpg|thumb|[[QF 18-pounder gun|18 pounder field gun]] and its limber being towed by six horses, 1918]] \nAlthough there had been previous efforts to motorise heavy artillery transport during WW1 (eg the [[Holt tractor]], the [[Gun Carrier Mark I]] and the Foster-Daimler Artillery Tractor to tow the 15-inch howitzer, the vast majority of British field artillery was still horse-drawn.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Royal Field Artillery 18-pounder battery towed into position on the Western Front, 1914 |accessdate=9 April 2020 |website=National Army Museum |url=https://collection.nam.ac.uk/detail.php?acc=2007-03-7-140}}</ref> ''See also [[Horses in World War I#Logistical support|Horses in World War I \u00a7 Logistical support]]''.\n\nMaj.-Gen.

She blackmails him into giving her \"private lessons\" on everything he learned during his time with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #2</ref> Finesse convinces Quicksilver to help her search for the Taskmaster, who might be her biological father. After arriving at what they thought was an abandoned training camp, they found it still in use and quickly captured the criminals they found there.

He also told them the truth where they were not mutants at all, but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary.

Wanda reveals to him that she is seeking answers about their true biological mother, Natalya Maximoff (who gave the twins to her relatives Marya and Django to spare them from a difficult life) and asks him to join her. He refuses and the two fight, although Wanda bests Quicksilver and tells him she never wants to see him again.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol.2 #9</ref> Natalya's spirit later summons Pietro during their final battle against a physical manifestation of Chaos. The twins reconcile after destroying the monster and Pietro is briefly able to meet his mother before she sacrifices herself to save witchcraft.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #14</ref> He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the [[Red Skull]], acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.{{issue|date=October 2016}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Quicksilver appears as a member of the Underground which is a resistance movement against Hydra, following their take over of the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> Quicksilver and Hercules lead a strike force to find the Cosmic Cube fragments so that they can use it to restore Captain America and the country to normal.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2</ref>\n\n===Marvel Legacy===\n\nDuring the \"Avengers: No Surrender\u201d Storyline, Quicksilver is one of the heroes remaining in the cosmic game between [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] and Challenger.<ref>'' Avengers'' #675</ref> He is frozen because of [[Scarlet Witch]]\u2019s attempt at reviving the frozen Vision,<ref>'' Avengers'' #677</ref> but the process was later reversed.<ref>''Avengers'' #678</ref> He later uses his extreme agility and [[Scarlet Witch]]'s powers to catch the beacon trapping his fellow Avengers, but in doing so he had pushed himself to the limit and apparently died.<ref>''Avengers'' #688</ref> But in the following mini-storyline of ''Quicksilver: No Surrender'', it is revealed that he became stuck in an alternate dimension, ultimately getting himself free and returning to the Avengers.<ref>''Quicksilver: No Surrender'' #1-5</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nQuicksilver was originally presented as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running at the [[speed of sound]]{{fact|date=February 2020}}, exposure to the [[High Evolutionary]]'s Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at [[Supersonic|supersonic speeds]] of up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 10 and resist the effects of [[friction]], reduced [[oxygen]], and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] impact while moving at super-speeds.{{issue|date=February 2020}} Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating [[cyclone]]-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]], because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought.{{issue|date=June 2016}} Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants.{{issue|date=May 2016}} It has been revealed that one of the reasons for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, \"Have you ever stood in line at a banking machine behind a person who didn't know how to use it?... Now, imagine, Doctor, that everyone you work with, everywhere you go, your entire world is filled with people who can't work cash machines.\"<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 1, issue #87: \"The X-Amination\"</ref>\n\nQuicksilver loses his powers of speed when his sister removes most of his powers but gains new powers courtesy of the Inhumans' [[Terrigen Mist]]. The mist gives Quicksilver the ability to displace himself out of mainstream time and space and \"jump\" into the future. The character can summon several time-displaced duplicates of himself and appear to teleport by \"jumping\" into the future and then returning to the present at a new location. By voluntarily embedding fragments of the Terrigen Crystals into his own body, the character could empower former mutants with extreme versions of their superhuman abilities. However, the effect was usually fatal. The crystals are subsequently forced from the character's body by the mutant [[Rictor]], leaving him without these abilities. After having a series of hallucinations, Quicksilver saw a woman in mortal danger and felt a desire to be a hero which made him regain his original powers in order to save the woman's life.<ref>''X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead'' #1</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that he actually was a normal child that was put through several experiments by the [[High Evolutionary]] which granted his powers in the first place.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 2) #4</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nIn the [[DC Comics|DC]]/Marvel crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Pietro first appears being brainwashed by [[Starro]] when the Avengers battle him. Thanks to a combination of Wanda's magic and [[Ms. Marvel]]'s powers, they manage to get Starro's probe off of him.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1</ref> When he and the other Avengers go to the [[DC Universe]], he becomes interested in the [[Speed Force]] and becomes obsessed with defeating [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], but he fails twice. During the final battle in the [[Savage Land]], he finally defeats the Flash, but only does so because there is no Speed Force in the Marvel Universe.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref> He makes an appearance in the final battle with [[Krona (DC Comics)|Krona]], but it is very brief. He also appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the limited series ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', [[Marvel Zombies|Earth-2149]] is contaminated with a [[virus]] that turns victims into flesh-eating ''[[zombie]]s'', with Quicksilver infected when bitten by a \"zombified\" [[Mystique (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Mystique]] (who at the time was impersonating his sister [[Scarlet Witch#Marvel Zombies|Wanda]]).

He also told them the truth where they were not mutants at all, but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary.

Wanda reveals to him that she is seeking answers about their true biological mother, Natalya Maximoff (who gave the twins to her relatives Marya and Django to spare them from a difficult life) and asks him to join her. He refuses and the two fight, although Wanda bests Quicksilver and tells him she never wants to see him again.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol.2 #9</ref> Natalya's spirit later summons Pietro during their final battle against a physical manifestation of Chaos. The twins reconcile after destroying the monster and Pietro is briefly able to meet his mother before she sacrifices herself to save witchcraft.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #14</ref> He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the [[Red Skull]], acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.{{issue|date=October 2016}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Quicksilver appears as a member of the Underground which is a resistance movement against Hydra, following their take over of the United States.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> Quicksilver and Hercules lead a strike force to find the Cosmic Cube fragments so that they can use it to restore Captain America and the country to normal.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2</ref>\n\n===Marvel Legacy===\n\nDuring the \"Avengers: No Surrender\u201d Storyline, Quicksilver is one of the heroes remaining in the cosmic game between [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] and Challenger.<ref>'' Avengers'' #675</ref> He is frozen because of [[Scarlet Witch]]\u2019s attempt at reviving the frozen Vision,<ref>'' Avengers'' #677</ref> but the process was later reversed.<ref>''Avengers'' #678</ref> He later uses his extreme agility and [[Scarlet Witch]]'s powers to catch the beacon trapping his fellow Avengers, but in doing so he had pushed himself to the limit and apparently died.<ref>''Avengers'' #688</ref> But in the following mini-storyline of ''Quicksilver: No Surrender'', it is revealed that he became stuck in an alternate dimension, ultimately getting himself free and returning to the Avengers.<ref>''Quicksilver: No Surrender'' #1-5</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nQuicksilver was originally presented as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running at the [[speed of sound]]{{fact|date=February 2020}}, exposure to the [[High Evolutionary]]'s Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at [[Supersonic|supersonic speeds]] of up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 10 and resist the effects of [[friction]], reduced [[oxygen]], and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] impact while moving at super-speeds.{{issue|date=February 2020}} Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating [[cyclone]]-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]], because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought.{{issue|date=June 2016}} Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants.{{issue|date=May 2016}} It has been revealed that one of the reasons for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, \"Have you ever stood in line at a banking machine behind a person who didn't know how to use it?... Now, imagine, Doctor, that everyone you work with, everywhere you go, your entire world is filled with people who can't work cash machines.\"<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 1, issue #87: \"The X-Amination\"</ref>\n\nQuicksilver loses his powers of speed when his sister removes most of his powers but gains new powers courtesy of the Inhumans' [[Terrigen Mist]]. The mist gives Quicksilver the ability to displace himself out of mainstream time and space and \"jump\" into the future. The character can summon several time-displaced duplicates of himself and appear to teleport by \"jumping\" into the future and then returning to the present at a new location. By voluntarily embedding fragments of the Terrigen Crystals into his own body, the character could empower former mutants with extreme versions of their superhuman abilities. However, the effect was usually fatal. The crystals are subsequently forced from the character's body by the mutant [[Rictor]], leaving him without these abilities. After having a series of hallucinations, Quicksilver saw a woman in mortal danger and felt a desire to be a hero which made him regain his original powers in order to save the woman's life.<ref>''X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead'' #1</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that he actually was a normal child that was put through several experiments by the [[High Evolutionary]] which granted his powers in the first place.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 2) #4</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nIn the [[DC Comics|DC]]/Marvel crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Pietro first appears being brainwashed by [[Starro]] when the Avengers battle him.

During the final battle in the [[Savage Land]], he finally defeats the Flash, but only does so because there is no Speed Force in the Marvel Universe.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref> He makes an appearance in the final battle with [[Krona (DC Comics)|Krona]], but it is very brief.

Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused on characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Quicksilver and [[Scarlet Witch]] were part of a dispute between the two studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], the villain of most of their films, while Marvel would also claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios came to an agreement allowing both to use the characters, with the condition that they cannot make reference to the other studio's properties. The Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, while the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the X-Men and Avengers movies|last=Acuna|first=Kirsten|date=April 30, 2015|work=Business Insider|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n* Quicksilver appears in the films ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016) and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019), played by [[Evan Peters]].<ref name=\"QuickTwitter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/177099-evan-peters-joins-x-men-days-of-future-past-as-quicksilver|title=Evan Peters Joins X-Men: Days of Future Past as Quicksilver|publisher=Superhero Hype |date=May 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PETJo87Bdig|title=X-Men: Days Of Future Past Quicksilver controversy: writer Simon Kinberg speaks|last=Total Film|date=20 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/21/quicksilver-will-have-expanded-role-in-x-men-apocalypse|title= Quicksilver will have expanded role in X-Men:Apocalypse |work=IGN|date=May 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-dark-phoenix-evan-peters-returning-as-quicksilver-1018062|title='X-Men: Dark Phoenix': Evan Peters Returning as Quicksilver (Exclusive)|last=Kit|first=Borys|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 29, 2017|accessdate=June 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rarL9Opb?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-dark-phoenix-evan-peters-returning-as-quicksilver-1018062|archivedate=June 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In ''Days of Future Past'', Quicksilver is an American teenager, thus his name is Americanized to be '''Peter Maximoff''' rather than Pietro.

In October 1897 the club helped found the Verbandes S\u00fcddeutscher Fu\u00dfballvereine (Federation of South German Football Teams) and board member Fritz Seidenfaden served a term as head of the organization. Germania was also part of a local city circuit known as the Frankfurter Association Bund which existed at about the same time and included four other sides: Frankfurter Kicker and  Viktoria 1899&nbsp;\u2013 who would later go on to form [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[1. Bockenheimer FC 1899|Bockenheimer FC Germania 1899]], and [[FC Nordend]]. They captured that league's first championship and enjoyed other successes including the 1904 Main Gau championship and a second-place finish in an international tournament staged at the [[World's Fair]] at [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Belgium]] the following year.\n\nGermania established its own ground in 1906 where they played until the site was developed for housing. From 1910 to 1913, the club played in the [[Nordkreis-Liga]] (I), with limited success. In 1913 they joined gymnastics club ''Frankfurter Turnverein 1860'' as that association's football department in an arrangement that helped the footballers develop and maintain a new home ground where the nation final would be contested in 1920 between [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] and [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth|Spvgg F\u00fcrth]] before 30,000 spectators. In the early 1920s, the club played in the [[Kreisliga Nordmain]], winning the title there in 1921\u201322.\n\nA group of local clubs including 1.FC Sachsenhausen 03, Hellas 07, and Amicitia 1911 merged in 1922 to become VfL Sachsenhausen 03 which would in turn become part of Germania in 1933. In the period following World War I the team was very active in international friendlies playing notable sides such as perennial [[Hungary|Hungarian]] title holders [[MTK Budapest]], [[Switzerland]]'s [[BSC Young Boys]], [[Wiener AC]] out of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and [[Turkey|Turkish]] champions [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]]. They also hosted important German clubs such as [[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig|VfB Leipzig]] and made a visit to [[Sweden]] where they played the [[Sweden national football team|national side]]. The club became independent of Frankfurter TV in 1923, but stayed on friendly terms with them, continuing to make use of TV's ground.\n\nAfter the rise to power of the [[Third Reich]], Germania, like most other organizations in the country, was subjected to manipulation as the [[Nazis]] worked to spread their ideas. In 1933 the club was forced into a union with VfL Sachsenhausen 03 to become VfL Germania 1894 and then put in place a right-thinking chairman. Through this period the play of the footballers improved and they moved up through the various levels of local competition until eventually making an appearance in the [[Gauliga S\u00fcdwest]] (Staffel Mainhessen), one of a number of top flight divisions established in a re-organization of German football under the Reich in 1933. Their turn in first division play was short-lived, however, and they quickly backslid after a poor showing.\n\nFollowing World War II occupying Allied authorities dissolved all organizations in the country, including sports and football associations, but allowed their re-establishment beginning in mid-1945: 1. FC Germania 1894 Frankfurt was the first club to re-gain its license within the American [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]] in September that year.  The club spent the 1946\u201347 season in the second-division Landesliga Hessen before returning to more local competition. The association re-assumed the name VfL Germania 1894 in 1947 as they went about the business of re-establishing the various sports departments that made up the club.\n\nThe footballers spent the next decades playing on the local circuit until winning their way to the [[Landesliga Hessen-S\u00fcd]] (IV) in 1993 where they played as a lower table side until being relegated in 1997. Today the team plays in the Kreisliga-A Frankfurt (IX). The sports club also has a bowling department.\n\n==Honors==\nThe club's honours:\n* '''[[Kreisliga Nordmain]]''' (I)\n** Champions: 1922\n** Runners-up: 1921\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.germania94.de/ Official team site]\n*[http://www.f-archiv.de/ Das deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Archiv] historical German football league tables (in German)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Germania 1894}}\n[[Category:VfL Germania 1894| ]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Germany]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Hesse]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Frankfurt]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1894]]\n[[Category:1894 establishments in Germany|VfL Germania 1894]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n{{Infobox football club\n|clubname=VfL Germania 1894\n|image=[[File:VfL Germania 1894 Frankfurt.svg|135px|logo]]\n|fullname=Verein f\u00fcr Leibeserziehungen Germania 1894 e.V.

In the period following World War I the team was very active in international friendlies playing notable sides such as perennial [[Hungary|Hungarian]] title holders [[MTK Budapest]], [[Switzerland]]'s [[BSC Young Boys]], [[Wiener AC]] out of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and [[Turkey|Turkish]] champions [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]]. They also hosted important German clubs such as [[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig|VfB Leipzig]] and made a visit to [[Sweden]] where they played the [[Sweden national football team|national side]]. The club became independent of Frankfurter TV in 1923, but stayed on friendly terms with them, continuing to make use of TV's ground.\n\nAfter the rise to power of the [[Third Reich]], Germania, like most other organizations in the country, was subjected to manipulation as the [[Nazis]] worked to spread their ideas. In 1933 the club was forced into a union with VfL Sachsenhausen 03 to become VfL Germania 1894 and then put in place a right-thinking chairman. Through this period the play of the footballers improved and they moved up through the various levels of local competition until eventually making an appearance in the [[Gauliga S\u00fcdwest]] (Staffel Mainhessen), one of a number of top flight divisions established in a re-organization of German football under the Reich in 1933. Their turn in first division play was short-lived, however, and they quickly backslid after a poor showing.\n\nFollowing World War II occupying Allied authorities dissolved all organizations in the country, including sports and football associations, but allowed their re-establishment beginning in mid-1945: 1. FC Germania 1894 Frankfurt was the first club to re-gain its license within the American [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]] in September that year.  The club spent the 1946\u201347 season in the second-division Landesliga Hessen before returning to more local competition. The association re-assumed the name VfL Germania 1894 in 1947 as they went about the business of re-establishing the various sports departments that made up the club.\n\nThe footballers spent the next decades playing on the local circuit until winning their way to the [[Landesliga Hessen-S\u00fcd]] (IV) in 1993 where they played as a lower table side until being relegated in 1997. Today the team plays in the Kreisliga-A Frankfurt (IX). The sports club also has a bowling department.\n\n==Honors==\nThe club's honours:\n* '''[[Kreisliga Nordmain]]''' (I)\n** Champions: 1922\n** Runners-up: 1921\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.germania94.de/ Official team site]\n*[http://www.f-archiv.de/ Das deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Archiv] historical German football league tables (in German)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Germania 1894}}\n[[Category:VfL Germania 1894 players| ]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Germany]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Hesse]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Frankfurt]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1894]]\n[[Category:1894 establishments in Germany|VfL Germania 1894]]\n", "name_user": "S.A.

[[Yoga]] in this form has become familiar across the world, especially [[Yoga in America|in America]] and Europe. It is derived from the postures used in the medieval spiritual discipline of [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]], but it is generally simply called \"yoga\"<!--exactly NOT the sense used in article [[yoga]], so do not wikilink-->; postures were not central in any of the older traditions of [[yoga]]. Academics have given yoga as exercise a variety of names, including '''modern postural yoga''',{{sfn|De Michelis|2004|pp=1-2}}{{efn|In 2004, [[Elizabeth De Michelis]] introduced a typology that subdivided her main category \"[[Modern Yoga]]\" into \"Modern Psychosomatic Yoga\", \"Modern Denominational Yoga\", \"Modern Postural Yoga\" and \"Modern Meditational Yoga\".<ref>The De Michelis 2004 typology can be seen at [https://docs.yuj.it/artefacts/yoga-as-linkage Yoga as Linkage].</ref>}} '''modern transnational yoga''',{{sfn|Brammer|2010|p=1}} and '''transnational anglophone yoga'''.{{sfn|Singleton|2013|p=38}}\n\nPosture practice was revived in the 1920s by yoga gurus including [[Yogendra]] and [[Kuvalayananda]], who emphasised its health benefits.

Several of his students went on to found influential schools of yoga: [[Pattabhi Jois]] created [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]], which in turn led to [[Power Yoga]]; [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] created [[Iyengar Yoga]], and defined a modern set of yoga postures in his 1966 book ''[[Light on Yoga]]''; and [[Indra Devi]] taught yoga as exercise to many celebrities in Hollywood. Other major schools founded in the 20th century include [[Bikram Yoga]] and [[Sivananda Yoga]]. Yoga as exercise spread across America and Europe, and then the rest of the world.\n\nHa\u1e6dha yoga's non-postural practices such as its [[Satkarma|purifications]] are much reduced or absent in yoga as exercise. The term \"hatha yoga\" is also in use with a different meaning, a gentle unbranded yoga practice, independent of the major schools, sometimes [[Yoga for women|mainly for women]]. Practices vary from wholly secular, for exercise and relaxation, through to undoubtedly spiritual, whether in traditions like Sivananda Yoga or in personal rituals. Yoga as exercise's relationship to [[Hinduism]] is complex and contested; some Christians have rejected it on the grounds that it is covertly Hindu, while the \"Take Back Yoga\" campaign attempted to insist that it was necessarily connected to Hinduism. Scholars have identified multiple trends in the changing nature of yoga since the end of the 19th century.\n\nYoga as exercise has developed into a worldwide multi-billion dollar business, involving classes, [[Yoga teacher training|certification of teachers]], clothing such as [[yoga pants]], books, videos, equipment including [[yoga mat]]s, and holidays.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Prajnaparamita]] seated in [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] for [[meditation]], Java. 13th century]]\n\n===Yoga's origins===\n{{main|Yoga#History}}\n\nThe [[Sanskrit]] noun \u092f\u094b\u0917 ''{{IAST|yoga}}'', cognate with English \"[[yoke]]\", is derived from the root ''{{IAST|[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yewg-|yuj]]}}'' \"to attach, join, harness, yoke\".<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=David Gordon |authorlink=David Gordon White |title=Yoga in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ii7D-bR0osC&pg=PA3 |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-14086-5 |page=3}}</ref> Its ancient [[Yoga (philosophy)|spiritual and philosophical goal]] was to unite the human spirit with the [[\u012b\u015bvara|Divine]].<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams, Monier]], \"Yoga\", ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.</ref> The branch of yoga that makes use of physical postures is [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]].{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}}<ref name=\"Jain 2016\">{{cite web |last=Jain |first=Andrea |authorlink=Andrea Jain |title=The Early History of Modern Yoga |journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion |url=http://oxfordre.com/religion/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-163 |publisher=Oxford Research Encyclopedias |accessdate=23 February 2019 |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.163 |date=July 2016}}</ref> The [[Sanskrit]] word \u0939\u0920 ''ha\u1e6dha'' means \"force\", alluding to its use of physical techniques.{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|p=770}}\n\n===Ha\u1e6dha yoga===\n{{main|Ha\u1e6dha yoga}}\n{{multiple image\n | image1            = Mode of action of Mudras.svg\n | width1            = 211\n | caption1          = Ha\u1e6dha yoga made use of [[Mudras]] to control vital forces in the [[subtle body]].{{sfn|Mallinson|Singleton|2017|pp=Chapters 5 and 6, especially pages 228\u2013229}}\n | image2            = Shatkarmas.svg\n | width2            = 160\n | caption2          = Ha\u1e6dha yoga used [[Satkarma]]s to purify the subtle body.{{sfn|Mallinson|Singleton|2017|pp=xxviii-xxxii, 46, 49-50, 71-79}}\n}}\n\nHa\u1e6dha yoga flourished from c. 1100-c. 1900.{{sfn|Singleton|2010|pages=28\u201329}} It was practised in secret by solitary ascetic groups such as [[Nath]] yogins in South Asia.<!--India, Nepal, Tibet-->{{sfn|B\u00fchnemann|2007|pp=20-21}}<ref name=\"Mallinson 2011\">{{cite web |last1=Mallinson |first1=James |authorlink=James Mallinson (author) |title=A Response to Mark Singleton's Yoga Body by JamesMallinson |url=https://www.academia.edu/1146607 |accessdate=3 July 2019 |date=9 December 2011}} revised from American Academy of Religions conference, San Francisco, 19 November 2011.</ref>{{sfn|Singleton|2010|p=173}} Instruction was directly from [[guru]] to [[shishya|individual pupil]], in a long-term relationship.{{sfn|Iyengar|1979|pp=27-29}} It was associated with religions, especially [[Hinduism]]{{sfn|B\u00fchnemann|2007|pp=20-21}} but also Jainism and Buddhism.

People were for the first time able to travel freely around the world: consumers could go to the east; Indians could migrate to Europe and America; and business people and religious leaders could go where they liked to sell their wares. Secondly, people across the Western world became disillusioned with organised [[religion]], and started to look for alternatives. And thirdly, yoga became an uncontroversial form of exercise suitable for mass consumption, unlike religious forms of [[modern yoga]] such as [[Siddha Yoga]] or [[Transcendental Meditation]].{{sfn|Jain|2015|p=43}} This involved the dropping of many traditional requirements on the practice of yoga, such as [[Alms|giving alms]], being [[celibate]], studying the [[Hindu scriptures]], and retreating from society.{{sfn|Jain|2015|pp=66-67}}\n\nFrom the 1970s, yoga as exercise spread across many countries of the world, changing as it did so, and becoming \"an integral part of (primarily) urban cultures worldwide\", to the extent that the word ''yoga'' in the Western world now means the practice of asanas, typically in a class.{{efn|The yoga scholar [[Elizabeth De Michelis|De Michelis]] notes that to speakers of Indic languages, ''yoga'' has a \"quite different\" semantic range, including meditation, prayer, ritual and devotional practices, ethical behaviour, and \"secret esoteric techniques\" that average English speakers would not consider to be yoga.<ref name=\"De Michelis 2007\" />}}<ref name=\"De Michelis 2007\">{{cite journal | last=De Michelis | first=Elizabeth | authorlink=Elizabeth De Michelis | title=A Preliminary Survey of Modern Yoga Studies | journal=Asian Medicine, Tradition and Modernity | volume=3 | issue=1 | year=2007 | pages=1\u201319 |doi=10.1163/157342107X207182 |url=https://wzukusers.storage.googleapis.com/user-31520575/documents/5a57bf9c24c23ZrCu301/Survey_of_Modern_Yoga_De_Michelis_2007.pdf}}</ref> For example, Iyengar Yoga reached South Africa in 1979 with the opening of its institute at Pietermaritzburg;<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://bksiyengar.co.za/about/history/ |publisher=Iyengar Yoga Institute, South Africa |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> its Association of South East & East Asia was founded in 2009.<ref>{{cite book |last=Newcombe |first=Suzanne |authorlink=Suzanne Newcombe |year=2014 |title=The institutionalization of the yoga tradition: ''gurus'' B.

[[Yoga]] in this form has become familiar across the world, especially [[Yoga in America|in America]] and Europe. It is derived from the postures used in the medieval spiritual discipline of [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]], but it is generally simply called \"yoga\"<!--exactly NOT the sense used in article [[yoga]], so do not wikilink-->; postures were not central in any of the older traditions of [[yoga]].

Several of his students went on to found influential schools of yoga: [[Pattabhi Jois]] created [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]], which in turn led to [[Power Yoga]]; [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] created [[Iyengar Yoga]], and defined a modern set of yoga postures in his 1966 book ''[[Light on Yoga]]''; and [[Indra Devi]] taught yoga as exercise to many celebrities in Hollywood. Other major schools founded in the 20th century include [[Bikram Yoga]] and [[Sivananda Yoga]]. Yoga as exercise spread across America and Europe, and then the rest of the world.\n\nHa\u1e6dha yoga's non-postural practices such as its [[Satkarma|purifications]] are much reduced or absent in yoga as exercise. The term \"hatha yoga\" is also in use with a different meaning, a gentle unbranded yoga practice, independent of the major schools, sometimes [[Yoga for women|mainly for women]]. Practices vary from wholly secular, for exercise and relaxation, through to undoubtedly spiritual, whether in traditions like Sivananda Yoga or in personal rituals. Yoga as exercise's relationship to [[Hinduism]] is complex and contested; some Christians have rejected it on the grounds that it is covertly Hindu, while the \"Take Back Yoga\" campaign attempted to insist that it was necessarily connected to Hinduism.
