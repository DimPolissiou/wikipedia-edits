One way to do this is to say that two sets \"have the same number of elements\", if and only if all the elements of one set can be paired with the elements of the other, in such a way that each element is paired with exactly one element. Accordingly, one can define two sets to \"have the same number of elements\"\u2014if there is a bijection between them. In which case, the two sets are said to have the same [[cardinality]].\n\nLikewise, one can say that set <math>X</math> \"has fewer than or the same number of elements\" as set <math>Y</math>, if there is an injection from <math>X</math> to <math>Y</math>; one can also say that set <math>X</math> \"has fewer than the number of elements\" in set <math>Y</math>, if there is an injection from <math>X</math> to <math>Y</math>, but not a bijection between <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>.\n\n==Examples==\nIt is important to specify the domain and codomain of each function, since by changing these, functions which appear to be the same may have different properties. \n\n;Injective and surjective (bijective)\n: The identity function id<sub>''X''</sub> for every non-empty set ''X'', and thus specifically <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R} : x \\mapsto x.</math>\n: <math>\\mathbf{R}^+ \\to \\mathbf{R}^+ : x \\mapsto x^2 </math>, and thus also its inverse <math>\\mathbf{R}^+ \\to \\mathbf{R}^+ : x \\mapsto \\sqrt{x}.</math>\n: The [[exponential function]] <math>\\exp \\colon \\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R}^+ : x \\mapsto \\mathrm{e}^x </math> (that is, the exponential function with its codomain restricted to its image), and thus also its inverse the [[natural logarithm]] <math>\\ln \\colon \\mathbf{R}^+ \\to \\mathbf{R} : x \\mapsto \\ln{x}.</math>\n\n;Injective and non-surjective\n: The exponential function <math>\\exp \\colon \\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R} : x \\mapsto \\mathrm{e}^x.</math>\n\n;Non-injective and surjective\n:<math>\\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R} : x \\mapsto (x-1)x(x+1) = x^3 - x .</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{R} \\to [-1,1] : x \\mapsto \\sin(x).</math>\n\n;Non-injective and non-surjective\n:<math>\\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R}: x \\mapsto \\sin(x).</math>\n\n==Properties==\n* For every function {{math|''f''}}, subset {{math|''X''}} of the domain and subset {{math|''Y''}} of the codomain, {{math|''X'' \u2282 ''f''{{i sup|\u22121}}(''f''(''X''))}} and {{math|''f''(''f''{{i sup|\u22121}}(''Y'')) \u2282 ''Y''}}. If {{math|''f''}} is injective, then {{math|1=''X'' = ''f''{{i sup|\u22121}}(''f''(''X''))}}, and if {{math|''f''}} is surjective, then {{math|1=''f''(''f''{{i sup|\u22121}}(''Y'')) = ''Y''}}.\n* For every function {{math|''h'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}}, one can define a surjection {{math|''H'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''h''(''X'') : ''x'' \u2192 ''h''(''x'')}} and an injection {{math|''I'' : ''h''(''X'') \u2192 ''Y'' : ''y'' \u2192 ''y''}}.

Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface.
