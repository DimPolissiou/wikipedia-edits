The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] and a brief period [[French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon|French mandate]], and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian provinces]]. It gained ''de jure'' independence as a [[parliamentary republic]] on 24 October 1945, when the [[Syrian Republic (1946\u20131963)|Republic of Syria]] became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate, although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946. The post-independence period was tumultuous, with many [[military coup]]s and coup attempts shaking the country from 1949 to 1971. In 1958, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt called the [[United Arab Republic]], which was terminated by the [[1961 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The republic was renamed as the Arab Republic of Syria in late 1961 after the [[Syrian constitutional referendum, 1961|December 1 constitutional referendum]] of that year, and was increasingly unstable until the [[1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1963 Ba'athist coup d'\u00e9tat]], since which the Ba'ath Party has maintained its power.

From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European [[Hittites]], with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].\n\n[[File:Geretteteg\u00f6tter l\u00f6wen.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Reliefs from [[Tel Halaf]] dating to the Aramean kingdom of [[Bit Bahiani]] ]]\nA [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding city states such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]] and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[Malta]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and [[Portugal]]), and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city state of [[Carthage]] (in modern [[Tunisia]]) in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nSyria and the Western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC \u2013 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of Syria and Lebanon [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by an attacks from; the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern Syria in 605 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC \u2013 539 BC).  During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of [[Egypt]]. The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over Egypt.\n\n=== Classical antiquity ===\n{{Main|Eber-Nari|Coele-Syria|Syria (Roman province)|Syria-Palaestina}}\n[[File:Palmyra 03.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient city of [[Palmyra]] before the war]]\n\nThe [[Achaemenid Empire]], founded by [[Cyrus the Great]], annexed [[Eber-Nari|Syria]] along with Babylonia to its empire in 539 BC. The [[Persian people|Persians]], retained Imperial Aramaic as one of the diplomatic languages of the Achaemenid Empire (539 BC \u2013 330 BC), as well as the Assyrian name for the new [[satrapy]] of Aram/Syria [[Eber-Nari]].\n\nSyria was conquered by the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Macedonian Empire]], ruled by [[Alexander the Great]] circa 330 BC, and consequently became [[Coele-Syria]] province of the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire]] (323 BC \u2013 64 BC), with the Seleucid kings styling themselves 'King of Syria' and the city of Antioch being its capital starting from 240.\n\nThus, it was the Greeks who introduced the name \"Syria\" to the region.

Eventually parts of southern Seleucid Syria were taken by [[Judean]] [[Hasmoneans]] upon the slow disintegration of the Hellenistic Empire.\n\nSyria briefly came under [[Armenians|Armenian]] control from 83 BC, with the conquests of the Armenian king [[Tigranes the Great]], who was welcomed as a savior from the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and Romans by the Syrian people. However, [[Pompey the Great]], a general of the [[Roman Empire]] rode to Syria, captured [[Antioch]], its capital, and turned Syria into a [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64 BC, thus ending the Armenian control over the region which had lasted two decades. Syria prospered under Roman rule, being strategically located on the silk road which gave it massive wealth and importance, making it the battleground for the rivaling Romans and Persians.\n\n[[File:Bosra pano Syria.jpg|thumb|[[Roman Theatre at Bosra]] in the province of [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]], present-day Syria]]\n[[File:The Jupiter temple in Damascus.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Jupiter, Damascus]]]]\n[[Palmyra]], a rich and sometimes powerful native [[Aramaic]]-speaking kingdom arose in northern Syria in the 2nd century; the Palmyrene established a trade network that made the city one of the richest in the Roman empire.

Syrian writers, many of whom migrated to Egypt, played a crucial role in the [[nahda]] or Arab literary and cultural revival of the 19th century. Prominent contemporary Syrian writers include, among others, [[Ali Ahmad Said|Adonis]], [[Muhammad al-Maghut|Muhammad Maghout]], [[Haidar Haidar]], [[Ghada al-Samman]], [[Nizar Qabbani]] and [[Zakariyya Tamer]].\n\nBa'ath Party rule, since the [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 coup]], has brought about renewed censorship. In this context, the genre of the historical novel, spearheaded by [[Nabil Sulayman]], [[Fawwaz Haddad]], [[Khyri al-Dhahabi]] and [[Nihad Siris]], is sometimes used as a means of expressing dissent, critiquing the present through a depiction of the past. Syrian [[List of folklores|folk narrative]], as a subgenre of historical fiction, is imbued with [[magical realism]], and is also used as a means of veiled criticism of the present. [[Salim Barakat]], a Syrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in Sweden, is one of the leading figures of the genre. Contemporary Syrian literature also encompasses science fiction and futuristic [[utopia]]e ([[Nuhad Sharif]], [[Talib Umran]]), which may also serve as media of dissent.\n\n===Music===\n\n[[Music of Syria|The Syrian music scene]], in particular that of Damascus, has long been among the Arab world's most important, especially in the field of [[classical Arab music]]. Syria has produced several pan-Arab stars, including [[Asmahan]], [[Farid al-Atrash]] and singer [[Lena Chamamyan]]. The city of Aleppo is known for its [[muwashshah]], a form of [[Andalous]] sung poetry popularized by [[Sabri Moudallal]], as well as for popular stars like [[Sabah Fakhri]].\n\n===Media===\n[[Television in Syria|Television was introduced to Syria]] and Egypt in 1960, when both were part of the [[United Arab Republic]].

Syrian food mostly consists of Southern Mediterranean, Greek, and Southwest Asian dishes. Some Syrian dishes also evolved from Turkish and French cooking: dishes like [[Kebab|shish kebab]], stuffed zucchini/courgette, and ''[[dolma|yabra\u02be]]'' (stuffed grape leaves, the word ''yabra\u02be'' deriving from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''yaprak'', meaning leaf).\n\nThe main dishes that form Syrian cuisine are [[kibbeh]], [[hummus]], [[tabbouleh]], [[fattoush]], [[strained yogurt|labneh]], [[shawarma]], [[mujaddara]], [[shanklish]], [[past\u0131rma]], [[sujuk]] and baklava. [[Baklava]] is made of [[filo]] pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in [[honey]]. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as [[meze]], before the main course. [[Za'atar]], [[minced beef]], and cheese [[manakish]] are popular [[hors d'\u0153uvres]]. The Arabic flatbread [[khubz]] is always eaten together with meze.\n\nDrinks in Syria vary, depending on the time of day and the occasion. [[Arabic coffee]] is the most well-known hot drink, usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food. [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an alcoholic drink, is a well-known beverage, served mostly on special occasions.

From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European [[Hittites]], with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].\n\n[[File:Geretteteg\u00f6tter l\u00f6wen.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Reliefs from [[Tel Halaf]] dating to the Aramean kingdom of [[Bit Bahiani]] ]]\nA [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding city states such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]] and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[Malta]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and [[Portugal]]), and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city state of [[Carthage]] (in modern [[Tunisia]]) in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nSyria and the Western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC \u2013 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of Syria and Lebanon [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by an attacks from; the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern Syria in 605 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC \u2013 539 BC).  During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of [[Egypt]].

Syrian writers, many of whom migrated to Egypt, played a crucial role in the [[nahda]] or Arab literary and cultural revival of the 19th century. Prominent contemporary Syrian writers include, among others, [[Ali Ahmad Said|Adonis]], [[Muhammad al-Maghut|Muhammad Maghout]], [[Haidar Haidar]], [[Ghada al-Samman]], [[Nizar Qabbani]] and [[Zakariyya Tamer]].\n\nBa'ath Party rule, since the [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 coup]], has brought about renewed censorship. In this context, the genre of the historical novel, spearheaded by [[Nabil Sulayman]], [[Fawwaz Haddad]], [[Khyri al-Dhahabi]] and [[Nihad Siris]], is sometimes used as a means of expressing dissent, critiquing the present through a depiction of the past. Syrian [[List of folklores|folk narrative]], as a subgenre of historical fiction, is imbued with [[magical realism]], and is also used as a means of veiled criticism of the present. [[Salim Barakat]], a Syrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in Sweden, is one of the leading figures of the genre. Contemporary Syrian literature also encompasses science fiction and futuristic [[utopia]]e ([[Nuhad Sharif]], [[Talib Umran]]), which may also serve as media of dissent.\n\n===Music===\n\n[[Music of Syria|The Syrian music scene]], in particular that of Damascus, has long been among the Arab world's most important, especially in the field of [[classical Arab music]]. Syria has produced several pan-Arab stars, including [[Asmahan]], [[Farid al-Atrash]] and singer [[Lena Chamamyan]].

Some Syrian dishes also evolved from Turkish and French cooking: dishes like [[Kebab|shish kebab]], stuffed zucchini/courgette, and ''[[dolma|yabra\u02be]]'' (stuffed grape leaves, the word ''yabra\u02be'' deriving from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''yaprak'', meaning leaf).\n\nThe main dishes that form Syrian cuisine are [[kibbeh]], [[hummus]], [[tabbouleh]], [[fattoush]], [[strained yogurt|labneh]], [[shawarma]], [[mujaddara]], [[shanklish]], [[past\u0131rma]], [[sujuk]] and baklava. [[Baklava]] is made of [[filo]] pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in [[honey]]. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as [[meze]], before the main course. [[Za'atar]], [[minced beef]], and cheese [[manakish]] are popular [[hors d'\u0153uvres]]. The Arabic flatbread [[khubz]] is always eaten together with meze.\n\nDrinks in Syria vary, depending on the time of day and the occasion. [[Arabic coffee]] is the most well-known hot drink, usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food. [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an alcoholic drink, is a well-known beverage, served mostly on special occasions.

The company did not negotiate an endorsement deal with Ruth, and many saw the company's story about the origin of the name to be a devious way to avoid having to pay the baseball player any [[royalties]]. Curtiss successfully shut down a rival bar that was approved by, and named for, Ruth, on the grounds that the names were too similar.<ref>Case of ''George H. Ruth Candy Co. v. Curtiss Candy Co'', 49 F.2d 1033 (1931), [http://www.snopes.com/business/names/babyruth.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Baby Ruth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the trivia book series ''Imponderables'', David Feldman reports the standard story about the bar being named for Grover Cleveland's daughter, with additional information that ties it to the President: \"The trademark was patterned exactly after the engraved lettering of the name used on a medallion struck for the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893, and picturing the President, his wife, and daughter Baby Ruth.\u201d However, this may have been an after-the-fact covering maneuver.<ref>''What Are Hyenas Laughing At, Anyway?'' (1995), p.&nbsp;84.</ref> He also cites ''More Misinformation'', by Tom Burnam: \"Burnam concluded that the candy bar was named ... after the granddaughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Williamson, candy makers who developed the original formula and sold it to Curtiss.\" (Williamson had also sold the \"[[Oh Henry!]]\" formula to Curtiss around that time.) The writeup goes on to note that marketing the product as being named for a company executive's granddaughter would likely have been less successful, hence their \"official\" story.<ref>''How Do Astronauts Scratch an Itch?''

The company did not negotiate an endorsement deal with Ruth, and many saw the company's story about the origin of the name to be a devious way to avoid having to pay the baseball player any [[royalties]]. Curtiss successfully shut down a rival bar that was approved by, and named for, Ruth, on the grounds that the names were too similar.<ref>Case of ''George H. Ruth Candy Co. v.

When Carl Spackler ([[Bill Murray]]) is cleaning out the pool afterward and recognizes the offending item as a Baby Ruth bar (\"It's no big deal!\"), he takes a bite out of it, disgusting the country club's co-founder and his wife (played by [[Ted Knight]] and [[Lois Kibbee]]), who still believe it to be feces.\n\nBaby Ruth was used in the American film ''[[The Goonies]]''<ref>{{cite book | last=Molinari | first=M. | last2=Kamm | first2=J. | title=Oops!: Movie Mistakes That Made the Cut | publisher=Citadel Press | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8065-2319-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8en3TIqmeQC&pg=PA86 | access-date=October 29, 2017 | page=86}}</ref> by Chunk to befriend Sloth.\n\nIn the film ''[[The Sandlot]]'', Scotty Smalls (after using his stepfather's Babe Ruth-autographed baseball in a game and wanting to get it back after he hit it over the fence into a backyard) mistakenly tells his friends that it was autographed by \"Baby Ruth\"; his friends knew what he meant to say and shout \"BABE RUTH!\" before running to the fence to see the ball before it is taken away by a demonic dog that they call \"the Beast\".\n\nIn the film ''The Mighty'' both Max and Kevin are awarded Baby Ruth bars for taking care of a problem in a local store.\n\nIn the film ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'', a Baby Ruth bar is used to lure and  mollify the infant Hellboy when he is discovered after the destruction of the Nazi portal.\n\nA popular song from the year 1956 was \"[[A Rose and a Baby Ruth]],\" written by [[John D.

Commissioned as one of the youngest generals during World War II, he achieved the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] before his mandatory retirement from the army in 1964. Davidson served as the [[List of United States Military Academy alumni (Superintendents)|Superintendent of the United States Military Academy]] from 1956 to 1960. He also played and coached [[American football|football]] at West Point, helming the Cadet squad as head coach from 1933 to 1937, compiling a record of 35\u201311\u20131.\n\n==Education and early military career==\nDavidson was born in the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]] on April 24, 1904, the son of a [[New York National Guard]] officer. In 1923, he graduated from the prestigious [[Stuyvesant High School]] in New York City, where he was a star on the school's championship football team and a member of the [[Omega Gamma Delta]] fraternity. Davidson realized his boyhood dream of becoming a soldier when he was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]. There, he distinguished himself in football and graduated with the Class of 1927. Upon graduation, he was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] with the 1st Engineer Regiment at [[Fort DuPont State Park|Fort DuPont]], Delaware, and maintained a West Point connection as an assistant [[Army Black Knights football|Army football]] coach.\n\nIn 1930, Davidson returned to West Point as a philosophy instructor and assistant football coach. In 1933, at age 29, he became youngest head football coach at the academy, finishing five seasons later in the 1937 with a record of 35 wins, 11 losses and 1 tie. From 1938 to 1940 he was posted to [[Hawaii]] as a company commander with the 3rd Engineer Regiment. In 1940, he returned to [[California]] as the post engineer for [[Hamilton Army Airfield]] (now known as Hamilton Air Force Base) on the north shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. At the time of Davidson's arrival, Hamilton's mission was being expanded from that of a bomber base with the addition of six squadrons of [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] and Curtiss [[P-36 Hawk]] fighter planes.\n\n==World War II==\nIn February 1942, Davidson transferred to [[Washington, D.C.]] as Assistant Chief, Construction Division, Office of Chief Engineer working for Colonel [[Leslie Groves]] on the construction of [[The Pentagon]].\n\nBy October 1942, Davidson was a colonel and assistant chief engineer for the Western Task Force of [[Operation Torch]] of the Allied [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]] under the command of General [[George S. Patton]]. As 1st Armored Division moved to invade [[Battle of Sicily|Sicily]] in June 1943, it was activated into [[Seventh United States Army]], and Davidson became its chief engineering officer. As a combat engineer, he facilitated Seventh Army's landing in Sicily and enabled Patton's armor to move rapidly across enemy territory. An appreciative Patton used one of his own general stars to honor Davidson in a September 1943 battlefield promotion to brigadier general, one of the youngest of the war at age 39. Davidson remained with Seventh Army under its interim command by General [[Mark W. Clark]] then General [[Alexander Patch]] and was key in planning for Operation Anvil / [[Operation Dragoon]], the Allied landing in southern France following the [[Operation Overlord|D-Day invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944. He continued with the Seventh Army in its move through Germany. At the conclusion of the war he was an engineer with the post-war occupation [[Fifteenth United States Army]] and served as president of the first [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] for military defendants.\n\n==Korean War==\nAfter World War II, in 1946, Davidson was assigned to [[Sixth United States Army]] as its chief engineer and in 1948 became chief of staff for General [[Mark W. Clark]] and General [[Albert C. Wedemeyer]] at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. In July 1950, he was called to Korea by [[Eighth United States Army]] Commanding General [[Walton H. Walker]], who also served under Patton in World War II, directed Davidson to construct a defensive line protecting the [[Pusan Perimeter]]. Known as \"Line Davidson\", Davidson had to subvert his professional better judgment to construct the line to the preferences of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and Walker, trading away defensibility and good internal communications.\n\nAs the North Korean invasion was repelled, Davidson was assigned to the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] as its assistant commander. Davidson reprised his effort at fortifying a more defensible perimeter around Pusan with the second North Korean invasion. He then headed \"Task Force Davidson\" as it broke out of the perimeter to hook up with the forces invading south from Inchon. Afterwards, he constructed fortifications north of Seoul. He concluded his tour of duty as acting commander of the Korean Military Assistance Group.\n\n==Military educator and Cold War warrior==\nReturning from Korea, from 1951 to 1954 Davidson was the senior ground forces advisor in the Weapons System Evaluation Group at the Pentagon and while there was promoted to major general in 1952. During the next six years, Davidson played a significant role in training officers serving in the post-war and atomic eras. Starting in 1954 he was commander of the United States Army's [[Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, then in 1956 he returned to the [[United States Military Academy]] as its superintendent. There he began a process of slowly prevailing over strong traditionalist viewpoints, breaking barriers and initiating a process of revision and modernization of the academy's instructional program little changed since the academy's legendary superintendent [[Sylvanus Thayer]] from 1817 to 1833. The momentum and progress of his reforms continued more easily through the superintendency of his successor, [[William Westmoreland]] and into the 1970s. In 1957, while at West Point, he was promoted and confirmed to the rank of lieutenant general.\n\nAfter West Point, Davidson returned to [[Seventh United States Army]] as its commanding general, posted in West Germany as a forward deployed force during the Cold War. During the [[Berlin Wall]] crisis in the summer of 1961, Davidson would have commanded any American military response or intervention.\n\nIn 1962, Davidson's final command was of [[First United States Army]], headquartered at [[Fort Jay]], [[Governors Island]], New York. While there he also served as United States Military Representative to the United Nations. After a 37-year military career, Davidson reached the mandatory retirement age and retired from active duty on April 30, 1964.\n\n==Retirement==\nDavidson moved to California and served as a vice president at University of California, Berkeley. He resumed his connection with West Point from 1983\u20131985 when he was appointed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for a two-year term to the United States Military Academy Board of Visitors.\n\nDavidson died in Oakland, California on December 25, 1992 and was buried at the [[West Point Cemetery]]. The inscription on his gravestone reads: \"Soldier, Coach, Educator and His Best Teammate\", the latter reference to his wife of 58 years, Verone Gruenther Davidson who died in 1996 and was the sister of a former NATO commander, General [[Alfred M. Gruenther]].\n\nAt the time of his death, Garrison was survived by three sons, Garrison Holt Jr., of Los Angeles, Thomas M., of Darien, Conn., and Alan R., of Sarasota, Fla.; three daughters, Linda L. Hurst, of San Luis Obispo, California, Bonnie Elaine Bardellini and Gail Marie Davidson, both of Martinez, California; 14 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.\n\n==Head coaching record==\n{{Infobox college coach\n| name = Garrison H.

Commissioned as one of the youngest generals during World War II, he achieved the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] before his mandatory retirement from the army in 1964. Davidson served as the [[List of United States Military Academy alumni (Superintendents)|Superintendent of the United States Military Academy]] from 1956 to 1960. He also played and coached [[American football|football]] at West Point, helming the Cadet squad as head coach from 1933 to 1937, compiling a record of 35\u201311\u20131.\n\n==Education and early military career==\nDavidson was born in the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]] on April 24, 1904, the son of a [[New York National Guard]] officer. In 1923, he graduated from the prestigious [[Stuyvesant High School]] in New York City, where he was a star on the school's championship football team and a member of the [[Omega Gamma Delta]] fraternity. Davidson realized his boyhood dream of becoming a soldier when he was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]. There, he distinguished himself in football and graduated with the Class of 1927. Upon graduation, he was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] with the 1st Engineer Regiment at [[Fort DuPont State Park|Fort DuPont]], Delaware, and maintained a West Point connection as an assistant [[Army Black Knights football|Army football]] coach.\n\nIn 1930, Davidson returned to West Point as a philosophy instructor and assistant football coach. In 1933, at age 29, he became youngest head football coach at the academy, finishing five seasons later in the 1937 with a record of 35 wins, 11 losses and 1 tie. From 1938 to 1940 he was posted to [[Hawaii]] as a company commander with the 3rd Engineer Regiment. In 1940, he returned to [[California]] as the post engineer for [[Hamilton Army Airfield]] (now known as Hamilton Air Force Base) on the north shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. At the time of Davidson's arrival, Hamilton's mission was being expanded from that of a bomber base with the addition of six squadrons of [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] and Curtiss [[P-36 Hawk]] fighter planes.\n\n==World War II==\nIn February 1942, Davidson transferred to [[Washington, D.C.]] as Assistant Chief, Construction Division, Office of Chief Engineer working for Colonel [[Leslie Groves]] on the construction of [[The Pentagon]].\n\nBy October 1942, Davidson was a colonel and assistant chief engineer for the Western Task Force of [[Operation Torch]] of the Allied [[North Africa Campaign|North Africa]] under the command of General [[George S. Patton]]. As 1st Armored Division moved to invade [[Battle of Sicily|Sicily]] in June 1943, it was activated into [[Seventh United States Army]], and Davidson became its chief engineering officer. As a combat engineer, he facilitated Seventh Army's landing in Sicily and enabled Patton's armor to move rapidly across enemy territory. An appreciative Patton used one of his own general stars to honor Davidson in a September 1943 battlefield promotion to brigadier general, one of the youngest of the war at age 39. Davidson remained with Seventh Army under its interim command by General [[Mark W. Clark]] then General [[Alexander Patch]] and was key in planning for Operation Anvil / [[Operation Dragoon]], the Allied landing in southern France following the [[Operation Overlord|D-Day invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944. He continued with the Seventh Army in its move through Germany. At the conclusion of the war he was an engineer with the post-war occupation [[Fifteenth United States Army]] and served as president of the first [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] for military defendants.\n\n==Korean War==\nAfter World War II, in 1946, Davidson was assigned to [[Sixth United States Army]] as its chief engineer and in 1948 became chief of staff for General [[Mark W. Clark]] and General [[Albert C. Wedemeyer]] at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. In July 1950, he was called to Korea by [[Eighth United States Army]] Commanding General [[Walton H. Walker]], who also served under Patton in World War II, directed Davidson to construct a defensive line protecting the [[Pusan Perimeter]]. Known as \"Line Davidson\", Davidson had to subvert his professional better judgment to construct the line to the preferences of General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and Walker, trading away defensibility and good internal communications.\n\nAs the North Korean invasion was repelled, Davidson was assigned to the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] as its assistant commander. Davidson reprised his effort at fortifying a more defensible perimeter around Pusan with the second North Korean invasion. He then headed \"Task Force Davidson\" as it broke out of the perimeter to hook up with the forces invading south from Inchon. Afterwards, he constructed fortifications north of Seoul.
