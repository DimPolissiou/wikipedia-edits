B\u00e9chirian was a key player in the British [[new wave music|new wave]] scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, best known for his work with [[Nick Lowe]], [[Paul Carrack]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Undertones]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[The Monkees]], the [[Flamin' Groovies]], and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]].  He was also a member of the pseudonymous new wave group [[Blanket of Secrecy]], which issued one album in 1982.  More recently, B\u00e9chirian has worked with the [[Trashcan Sinatras]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].\n\n==Life and career==\nB\u00e9chirian was born and spent his early years in Calcutta, moving to England with his family at the age of 10.  His engineering career started at [[Eden Studios]], in London in the mid-1970s. The studio was based around an Ampex 4 track and a custom built desk based in part on EMI/BBC designs. B\u00e9chirian progressed to become assistant mastering engineer, using an early Scully lathe during the day, and spending the evenings in the studio with bands improving his engineering skills. Eden then moved to a much larger premises and built a brand new studio complex from the ground up. Being involved in the building of the facility, from wiring the studio to helping to build their custom desk, gained B\u00e9chirian a great insight into acoustic design and audio electronics. He even designed the studio's logo. Eden opened as a 16 track with Ampex MM1100, but made the rapid leap to 24 track recording, moving up to an Ampex MM1200 and Dolby A. It was one of the first few 24 track studios in London at that time.\n\n[[Stiff Records]] founder Dave Robinson sought out B\u00e9chirian and he began recording and mixing projects for the label's then fledgling artist roster.\n\nHe continued to develop his engineering talents at Eden as house engineer on an endless mixture of sessions ranging from solo artists to rock bands, big bands and orchestra. He worked as an assistant on sessions with some of the most successful producers and bands at the time, including [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Moody Blues]], [[David Essex]], [[Georgie Fame]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Clover]] and many others.\n\nB\u00e9chirian had come to the attention of various A&R men, and also continued to work with a variety of Stiff artists. He was asked by Robinson to be involved with the production of [[Lene Lovich]]'s first album, which produced her first hit single, \"[[Lucky Number (song)|Lucky Number]]\". [[Malcolm McLaren]] brought the [[Sex Pistols]] into Eden to work on various drum and guitar tracking sessions, and around this time, Nick Lowe approached B\u00e9chirian to work on his solo project, which was to become ''[[Jesus of Cool]]''. As a result, he wanted B\u00e9chirian to act as his exclusive engineer on all his forthcoming projects, which led to working with [[Graham Parker]], [[Huey Lewis]] and [[Clover]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rockpile]], and others.\n\n[[Seymour Stein]], founder of Sire Records, signed the [[The Undertones|Undertones]], asking B\u00e9chirian to take on production duties for the band's first album.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGaVCwAAQBAJ|title=Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone|last=Bradley|first=Michael|date=2016-02-15|publisher=Music Sales Limited|isbn=9781783238521|language=en}}</ref> B\u00e9chirian ended up engineering and producing the band's first three albums. [[Jake Riviera]], who looked after Costello and Lowe, began representing B\u00e9chirian as manager.\n\nB\u00e9chirian continued to work with various bands and artists as engineer and producer. He produced (with Elvis Costello) and engineered Squeeze's hit album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'', and their American breakthrough hit single \"[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]\".\n\nAround that same time, he formed the band [[Blanket of Secrecy]]. Their first and only album was released in both the UK and the US, and garnered some attention as all the band members wrote and performed under pseudonyms (\"Tinker\", \"Tailor\" and \"Soldier\") and refused to be photographed. This led to speculation about the band members' identities\u2014as B\u00e9chirian was listed in the album's credits as a producer, it was posited that he may have been behind the group.  However, public and media interest in Blanket of Secrecy was short-lived after the album and associated singles failed to chart, and the group broke up.  The actual identities of the band members were not revealed for more than twenty years.\n\nB\u00e9chirian went on to build his own recording studio in London and formed Vinyltone Productions with Epic Records in New York, developing and releasing new artists. The next three years he divided his time between London and New York.  He later remastered Elvis Costello's first nine albums, and produced [[The Monkees]]' 1986 reunion album ''[[Pool It!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tapeop.com/interviews/90/roger-bechirian-bonus/|title=Roger Bechirian: Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Undertones|website=tapeop.com|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref>\n\nLooking for a new direction, B\u00e9chirian later formed Trick Management.  Amongst his clients are [[Tom McRae]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].  Signing Bell X1 to Island Records, he produced the band's breakthrough hit album ''[[Flock (album)|Flock]]''.\n\nNow based in London, B\u00e9chirian engineers and produces, as well as being involved with the development and co-management of new bands and artists.\n\n==Discography overview==\nNote: engineered (e), mixed (m), co-produced (cp), produced (p)\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n\n'''[[Elvis Costello]]''': e-m-cp-p\n\nalbums:\n* ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (remixes)\n* ''[[This Year's Model|This Years Model]]''\n* ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]''\n* ''[[Get Happy!!

2014}}</ref> is an English [[audio engineer|engineer]] and record producer.  B\u00e9chirian was a key player in the British [[new wave music|new wave]] scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, best known for his work with [[Nick Lowe]], [[Paul Carrack]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Undertones]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[The Monkees]], the [[Flamin' Groovies]], and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]].  He was also a member of the pseudonymous new wave group [[Blanket of Secrecy]], which issued one album in 1982.  More recently, B\u00e9chirian has worked with the [[Trashcan Sinatras]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].\n\n==Life and career==\nB\u00e9chirian was born and spent his early years in Calcutta, moving to England with his family at the age of 10.  His engineering career started at [[Eden Studios]], in London in the mid-1970s. The studio was based around an Ampex 4 track and a custom built desk based in part on EMI/BBC designs. B\u00e9chirian progressed to become assistant mastering engineer, using an early Scully lathe during the day, and spending the evenings in the studio with bands improving his engineering skills. Eden then moved to a much larger premises and built a brand new studio complex from the ground up. Being involved in the building of the facility, from wiring the studio to helping to build their custom desk, gained B\u00e9chirian a great insight into acoustic design and audio electronics. He even designed the studio's logo. Eden opened as a 16 track with Ampex MM1100, but made the rapid leap to 24 track recording, moving up to an Ampex MM1200 and Dolby A. It was one of the first few 24 track studios in London at that time.\n\n[[Stiff Records]] founder Dave Robinson sought out B\u00e9chirian and he began recording and mixing projects for the label's then fledgling artist roster.\n\nHe continued to develop his engineering talents at Eden as house engineer on an endless mixture of sessions ranging from solo artists to rock bands, big bands and orchestra. He worked as an assistant on sessions with some of the most successful producers and bands at the time, including [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Moody Blues]], [[David Essex]], [[Georgie Fame]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Clover]] and many others.\n\nB\u00e9chirian had come to the attention of various A&R men, and also continued to work with a variety of Stiff artists. He was asked by Robinson to be involved with the production of [[Lene Lovich]]'s first album, which produced her first hit single, \"[[Lucky Number (song)|Lucky Number]]\". [[Malcolm McLaren]] brought the [[Sex Pistols]] into Eden to work on various drum and guitar tracking sessions, and around this time, Nick Lowe approached B\u00e9chirian to work on his solo project, which was to become ''[[Jesus of Cool]]''. As a result, he wanted B\u00e9chirian to act as his exclusive engineer on all his forthcoming projects, which led to working with [[Graham Parker]], [[Huey Lewis]] and [[Clover]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rockpile]], and others.\n\n[[Seymour Stein]], founder of Sire Records, signed the [[The Undertones|Undertones]], asking B\u00e9chirian to take on production duties for the band's first album.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGaVCwAAQBAJ|title=Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone|last=Bradley|first=Michael|date=2016-02-15|publisher=Music Sales Limited|isbn=9781783238521|language=en}}</ref> B\u00e9chirian ended up engineering and producing the band's first three albums. [[Jake Riviera]], who looked after Costello and Lowe, began representing B\u00e9chirian as manager.\n\nB\u00e9chirian continued to work with various bands and artists as engineer and producer. He produced (with Elvis Costello) and engineered Squeeze's hit album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'', and their American breakthrough hit single \"[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]\".\n\nAround that same time, he formed the band [[Blanket of Secrecy]]. Their first and only album was released in both the UK and the US, and garnered some attention as all the band members wrote and performed under pseudonyms (\"Tinker\", \"Tailor\" and \"Soldier\") and refused to be photographed. This led to speculation about the band members' identities\u2014as B\u00e9chirian was listed in the album's credits as a producer, it was posited that he may have been behind the group.  However, public and media interest in Blanket of Secrecy was short-lived after the album and associated singles failed to chart, and the group broke up.  The actual identities of the band members were not revealed for more than twenty years.\n\nB\u00e9chirian went on to build his own recording studio in London and formed Vinyltone Productions with Epic Records in New York, developing and releasing new artists. The next three years he divided his time between London and New York.  He later remastered Elvis Costello's first nine albums, and produced [[The Monkees]]' 1986 reunion album ''[[Pool It!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tapeop.com/interviews/90/roger-bechirian-bonus/|title=Roger Bechirian: Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Undertones|website=tapeop.com|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref>\n\nLooking for a new direction, B\u00e9chirian later formed Trick Management.  Amongst his clients are [[Tom McRae]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].  Signing Bell X1 to Island Records, he produced the band's breakthrough hit album ''[[Flock (album)|Flock]]''.\n\nNow based in London, B\u00e9chirian engineers and produces, as well as being involved with the development and co-management of new bands and artists.\n\n==Discography overview==\nNote: engineered (e), mixed (m), co-produced (cp), produced (p)\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n'''[[Elvis Costello]]''': e-m-cp-p\n\nalbums:\n* ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (remixes)\n* ''[[This Year's Model|This Years Model]]''\n* ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]''\n* ''[[Get Happy!!

Among the uprising's main objective was to attack \"[[La Fortaleza]]\" (the Governors mansion) and the United States Federal Court House Building in [[Old San Juan]]. In accordance to the planned uprising in San Juan, a group of nationalists were supposed to attack simultaneously the gubernatorial mansion [[La Fortaleza]], where Puerto Rican governor [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn]] resided, and the United States Federal Court House which is located close to an area called \"La Marina\" in Old San Juan.

This part of the city is comprised by a network of [[Sett (paving)|\"setted\" roads]] usually surrounded by ancient, two-storied houses built on [[masonry]]. Some colonial structures have been restored and serve either as government offices or museums. Some examples are the [[Ballaj\u00e1 Barracks]], which now serve as museum and headquarters of several cultural organizations; [[La Fortaleza]], which has served as the residence of the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] since the 16th Century; and the Ancient Welfare Asylum, which now houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, among others. Old San Juan also features several public squares, like the [[Plaza de Armas, San Juan|Plaza de Armas]], located in front of San Juan City Hall; and cathedrals, like the [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/pr_new/viejo_sanjuan.php |title=Viejo San Juan |work=Enciclopedia Puerto Rico |author=Grupo Editorial EPRL |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723220237/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/pr_new/viejo_sanjuan.php |archivedate=July 23, 2013 }}</ref> Old San Juan is also notable for being partly enclosed by massive walls and fortifications built by the [[Spanish government]].\n\nThe architecture is more varied in other districts of the city.

With the annexation of [[R\u00edo Piedras, Puerto Rico|R\u00edo Piedras]] in 1951, the municipality of San Juan grew four times its previous size. As a result, the municipality also went from 2 to 18 barrios (wards),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/maps/sanjuan.pdf |title=San Juan map: Municipo de San Juan |publisher=Welcome.topuertorico.org |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> 16 of which fall within the former municipality of [[R\u00edo Piedras]].

After Pablo Ubarri sought permission to link San Juan with R\u00edo Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of [[Santurtzi]] (''[[Saint George]]'' in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in [[Biscay|Vizcaya]], Spain.

Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence its name, the ''King's Herd'' in Spanish) as early as the 16th century,<ref name=\"mini-wall-street\"/> and is now considered the financial center of the island.

For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce ''barrios'', or subdivisions, of San Juan. The old municipality of R\u00edo Piedras constituted the third most populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry to San Juan, which are factors that prompted R\u00edo Piedras's dramatic urban development in the 20th century.\n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the racial composition of San Juan was as follows:\n* [[White American|White]]: 68.0% ([[Non-Hispanic Whites]]: 1.2%)\n* Black or African American: 18.3% (Non-Hispanic Blacks: 0.3%)\n* [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]: 0.8%\n* [[Asian American|Asian]]: 0.4%\n* [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]]/[[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]]: 0.0%\n* Some other race: 8.2%\n* [[Multiracial American|Two or more races]]: 4.0%\n* [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] (of any race): 98.2%\n\nAmong the Hispanic and Latino population, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] are, unsurprisingly, the largest group; they make up 87.5% of San Juan's Hispanic population. People of [[Dominican American|Dominican]] descent made up 12.2% of the Hispanic population, while those of [[Cuban American|Cuban]] descent formed 1.7% of the Hispanic populace. Other Hispanic and Latino groups collectively formed 3.2% of San Juan's Hispanic population.\n\nThere are 4,822 whites of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan; 1,187 blacks of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks form 1.2% and 0.3% of San Juan's population respectively. There are also approximately 673 Asians of non-Hispanic origin in San Juan; they make up less than 0.1% of the population. However, Asians of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin together number at 6,342. The vast majority of Asians in San Juan are of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] descent; of the 6,342 Asians, 4,928 are Chinese. Chinese comprise 1.4% of the population.

The remaining 0.7% were born in a U.S. territory or were born abroad to American parents. The remaining 11.9% of the population were born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories.

After Pablo Ubarri sought permission to link San Juan with R\u00edo Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of [[Santurtzi]] (''[[Saint George]]'' in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in [[Biscay|Vizcaya]], Spain. The \"Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico\" ([[Puerto Rico Museum of Art]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapr.org/|title=Official site of the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|language=es|publisher=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce.\n\nSouth of Santurce is [[Hato Rey]], part of the former municipality of R\u00edo Piedras. Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence its name, the ''King's Herd'' in Spanish) as early as the 16th century,<ref name=\"mini-wall-street\"/> and is now considered the financial center of the island. A section of this district is often referred to as ''[[Milla de Oro]]'' (actually {{convert|0.47|mi|km|2|disp=or|sp=us}} long) due in part to the many banks and businesses located there.<ref name=\"mini-wall-street\">{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n47/PRSST0847-en.shtml|title=Eatin' Where The Cows Used To Roam: Hato Rey Dining At Its Best|author=Brenda A.

Founded in the mid-1850s, R\u00edo Piedras was a separate town which hosted sugar cane plantations and the estates of some of San Juan's wealthiest inhabitants (as well as their working class staff). The Spanish colonial governors also had their summer home there on land which eventually gave way to the main campus of the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. In 1951 the municipalities of San Juan and R\u00edo Piedras were merged to redefine San Juan's current city limits.

For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce ''barrios'', or subdivisions, of San Juan. The old municipality of R\u00edo Piedras constituted the third most populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry to San Juan, which are factors that prompted R\u00edo Piedras's dramatic urban development in the 20th century.\n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the racial composition of San Juan was as follows:\n* [[White American|White]]: 68.0% ([[Non-Hispanic Whites]]: 1.2%)\n* Black or African American: 18.3% (Non-Hispanic Blacks: 0.3%)\n* [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]: 0.8%\n* [[Asian American|Asian]]: 0.4%\n* [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]]/[[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]]: 0.0%\n* Some other race: 8.2%\n* [[Multiracial American|Two or more races]]: 4.0%\n* [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] (of any race): 98.2%\n\nAmong the Hispanic and Latino population, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] are, unsurprisingly, the largest group; they make up 87.5% of San Juan's Hispanic population. People of [[Dominican American|Dominican]] descent made up 12.2% of the Hispanic population, while those of [[Cuban American|Cuban]] descent formed 1.7% of the Hispanic populace. Other Hispanic and Latino groups collectively formed 3.2% of San Juan's Hispanic population.\n\nThere are 4,822 whites of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan; 1,187 blacks of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks form 1.2% and 0.3% of San Juan's population respectively. There are also approximately 673 Asians of non-Hispanic origin in San Juan; they make up less than 0.1% of the population. However, Asians of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin together number at 6,342. The vast majority of Asians in San Juan are of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] descent; of the 6,342 Asians, 4,928 are Chinese. Chinese comprise 1.4% of the population. The only other sizable Asian group in San Juan are [[Indian Americans]]; there are 698 people of Indian descent in the city, forming 0.2% of the population. There are very small numbers of people of [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]], and [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]] ancestry; none of these groups number more than 100 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US7276770&-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR5&-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-_sse=on |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200211183320/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US7276770&-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR5&-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-_sse=on |archivedate=February 11, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2006\u20132008 American Community Survey, 87.5% of San Juan's population was native and 12.5% were foreign-born. Of the native population, 86.9% were born in Puerto Rico or the United States, of which 75.6% were born in Puerto Rico and 8.9% were born in the United States. The remaining 0.7% were born in a U.S. territory or were born abroad to American parents. The remaining 11.9% of the population were born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. In recent years, an increasing number of Americans not of Hispanic ancestry (both of [[African American]] and of [[White American]] descent) have moved to San Juan. In addition, a large number of [[Stateside Puerto Ricans]] have settled in the city upon their return to Puerto Rico. There is also a growing [[West Indian]] population, both of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin.\n\nIn terms of ancestry, 23,875 people claimed American ancestry, which is equivalent to 5.8% of San Juan's population. Other sizable ancestry groups included those of [[Italian American|Italian]] descent, [[French American|French]] descent, and [[West Indian]] descent. People of Italian descent numbered at 1,694, forming 0.4% of the population; people of French descent numbered at 1,064, forming 0.2% of the population. Finally, those of West Indian descent numbered at 1,393, forming 0.3% of San Juan's population. Approximately 1,026 people claimed [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry; 719 claimed [[Irish American|Irish]] ancestry; 646 claimed [[German American|German]] ancestry; 431 claimed [[Arab American|Arab]] ancestry, and 346 claimed [[English American|English]] ancestry.

It is also possible to instruct Tails to automatically install some additional software from the persistence drive, to load bookmarks for the Tor Browser, keep GPG keys or to keep configurations data for other applications. It is important to note, that the encrypted space could be detected by forensic analysis and is not hidden like in the case of [[VeraCrypt]] which offers [[plausible deniability]] and therefore should not be distinguishable from random data.<ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html</ref>\n\n===Security===\n\nDuring the shutdown process, Tails will overwrite most of the used RAM to avoid a [[cold boot attack]].<ref name=\"memory-erasure\">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/</ref>\nAn emergency shutdown can be triggered by physically removing the medium where Tails is installed: a watchdog monitors the status of the boot medium, and if removed then the memory erasing process will begin immediately.

It lives in RAM and does not write to any other drive unless strictly specified. However, it is possible to set up an encrypted persistence volume (for example, within the USB Drive where Tails is installed) to save user data. It is also possible to instruct Tails to automatically install some additional software from the persistence drive, to load bookmarks for the Tor Browser, keep GPG keys or to keep configurations data for other applications. It is important to note, that the encrypted space could be detected by forensic analysis and is not hidden like in the case of [[VeraCrypt]] which offers [[plausible deniability]] and therefore should not be distinguishable from random data.<ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html</ref>\n\n===Security===\n\nDuring the shutdown process, Tails will overwrite most of the used RAM to avoid a [[cold boot attack]].<ref name=\"memory-erasure\">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/</ref>\nAn emergency shutdown can be triggered by physically removing the medium where Tails is installed: a watchdog monitors the status of the boot medium, and if removed then the memory erasing process will begin immediately. This should however only be used in an emergency situation because it could break the file system of the persistence volume, if set up.<ref name=\"memory-erasure\">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/</ref><ref>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/shutdown/index.en.html</ref>\n\n== Release history ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=3 | {{Version|l|show=110101}}\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin-top:0; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#cfc; padding-top:2em; padding-bottom:2em;\" colspan=\"4\"|Release history\n|-\n!

She is a member of [[Horror Writers Association]], [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]], and the Association for Gravestone Studies.\n\n==Biography==\nInspired by volunteering for [[RE/Search]] Publications, Rhoads and her husband Mason Jones founded Automatism Press in 1993. Automatism published two anthologies, '''Lend the Eye a Terrible Aspect''' (edited by Jones and Rhoads) and '''Death's Garden: Relationships with Cemeteries''' (edited by Rhoads alone), before she created [[Morbid Curiosity (magazine)]] in 1997. The magazine, which published true first-person confessional essays, was a Finalist for the [[Bram Stoker Award]] in 2004.\n\nIn 2006, Rhoads shut down ''Morbid Curiosity'' magazine to concentrate on her own writing. Her first big break came when her story \"Still Life with Shattered Glass\" took third place in the Fiction Contest at the 2005 [[World Horror Convention]] and was later published in [[Cemetery Dance Publications|Cemetery Dance]] magazine. That led in 2008 to the publication of four of her stories in '''Sins of the Sirens: 14 Tales of Dark Desire''' edited by [[John Everson]] for [[Dark Arts Books]].\n\nRhoads edited '''Morbid Curiosity Cures the Blues: True Tales of the Unsavory, Unwise, Unorthodox, and Unusual''', a collection of her favorite essays from ''Morbid Curiosity'' magazine, for [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in 2009. She subsequently edited anthologies for Damnation Books and Tomes & Coffee Press.\n\nHer first novel, co-written with Brian Thomas, was published by Black Bed Sheet Books in 2014, followed by a space-opera trilogy published by [[Night Shade Books]] in 2015.\n\n==Cemetery Work==\n\nIn November 1997, Rhoads began writing a monthly column about visiting cemeteries for Gothic.Net. Many of those essays were collected into a cemetery memoir called '''Wish You Were Here: Adventures in Cemetery Travel''', first published by Western Legends Publishing in 2013.\n\nShe began blogging at CemeteryTravel.com in February 2011, which led to '''199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die''', published by [[Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers]] in 2017.\n\nRhoads has written about cemeteries for [[Mental Floss]],<ref>[https://www.mentalfloss.com/authors/87541/Loren-Rhoads Mental Floss, \"Loren Rhoads,\" n.d.]</ref> [[Legacy.com]],<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/news/explore-history/article/cemetery-sights-norton-emperor-of-the-united-states Legacy.com, \"Cemetery Sights: Norton, Emperor of the United States,\" n.d.]</ref> [[The Daily Beast]], The Cemetery Club,<ref>[https://cemeteryclub.wordpress.com/2018/02/01/four-graves-for-harvey-milk/ Cemetery Club, \"Four Graves for Harvey Milk,\" February 1 2018]</ref> [[Gothic Beauty]],<ref>[http://www.gothicbeauty.com/author/loren-rhoads/ Gothic Beauty, \"Loren Rhoads,\" n.d.]</ref> the Association for Gravestone Studies,<ref>[https://www.gravestonestudies.org/ Association for Gravestone Studies, \"Home,\" n.d.]</ref> the [[Horror Writers Association]], among others.\n\nShe lectured about cemeteries at the Death Salon,<ref>[https://deathsalon.org/meetings/death-salon-sf-2014/ Death Salon,\" Death Salon SF (2014),\" 10/11/14]</ref> Reimagine End of Life,<ref>[https://letsreimagine.org/5/memento-mori Reimagine, \"Memento Mori,\" 4/17/18]</ref> the San Francisco Lit Crawl,<ref>[https://www.oddsalon.com/salon/odd-salon-at-litquake-litcrawl-cemetery-stories/ Odd Salon, \"Odd Salon at LitQuake LitCrawl: Cemetery Stories,\" 10/20/18]</ref> StokerCon,<ref>[http://stokercon2017.horror.org/stokercon-schedule/ Horror Writers Association, \"StokerCon Schedule,\" 4/29/17]</ref> the SFWA Nebula Conference,<ref>[https://nebulas.sfwa.org/2019-nebula-conference-schedule/ Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, \"2019 Nebula Conference Schedule,\" 5/16/19]</ref> and on NPR.<ref>[https://www.wgbh.org/news/2017/11/10/author-graveyard-aficionado-asks-whats-your-favorite-cemetery WGBH, \"Author, Graveyard Aficionado Asks: 'What's Your Favorite Cemetery?',\" November 10 2017]</ref>\n\nShe continues to advocate for the preservation of historic cemeteries.\n\n==Published Works==\n\n===Fiction===\n:* \"Rock Faces,\" Ladies of Horror Flash Project, October 2019.\n:* \"Silence of the Sirens,\" '''Shallow Waters: A Flash Anthology''', volume 1, edited by Joe Mynhardt, (Crystal Lake Publishing), June 2019.\n:* \"Still Life with Shattered Glass,\" '''Tales for the Camp Fire: A Charity Anthology Benefiting Wildfire Relief''' (Tomes & Coffee Press), April 2019. \n::- The raciest version appeared in Sins of the Sirens (Dark Arts Books) in January 2008 under the title \"Still Life with Broken Glass.\" \n::- The earliest version of the story appeared in ''Cemetery Dance'' #54, March 2006, after it took 3rd place in the Fiction Contest at the 2005 World Horror Convention.\n:* \"The Arms Dealer's Daughter,\" ''Space & Time''  #133, March 2019.\n:* \"In the Pines,\" the Women in Horror issue of ''Siren's Call'' magazine, February 2019.\n:* \"Something in the Water,\" ''Occult Detective Quarterly'' #5, January 2019.\n:* \"Elle a Vu un Loup,\" ''Weirdbook'' #40, November 2018.\n:* \"Letter from New Orleans,\" Ladies of Horror Flash Project, November 2018.\n:* \"Mr. Moonlight,\" Ladies of Horror Flash Project, October 2018.\n:* \"Guardian of the Golden Gate,\" '''Strange California''', edited by Jaym Gates and J.

It success led to several international versions being created, though most have been short-lived, as well as a special mini-series of episodes involving an adventure of Ant & Dec, that were later broadcast as a special episode during the Christmas TV season. An official ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' iOS app for [[iPod]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] was released on 15 February 2013. Since the thirteenth series, the programme airs its series finales in location outside of the UK, with the exception of the sixteenth series due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|2020 coronavirus pandemic]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/itvtakeaway/status/1241466202893037573|title=Thank you all for joining us tonight!

Following the permanent closure of the site after the fifteenth series, the programme moved to Studio TC1 at the [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] in West London in 2020. The sixteenth series is the only series in the programme's history to feature pre-recorded episodes, due to events in 2020 (such as the outbreak of coronavirus).\n\n==Format==\n\nThe general set up for each episode is a selection of segments consisting of specially crafted games, comedy/entertainment films, participation by either a studio audience member, or unsuspecting viewer/public member, and a show finale consisting of a performance by a musician, dance group, singer, or group performers. Episodes of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' are broadcast live during the weekend, during a prime time slot on Saturday evenings for the entire run of a series. Each episode is introduced with a line-up of what segments will be featured during its broadcast, along with an introduction of the hosts themselves - from the seventh series onwards, this responsibility was given to a special celebrity announcer, who would not only give an introduction of themselves and the hosts, but would also state what viewers would expect in the show for that episode, along with an update on what was still to come before each commercial break in the programme. In the majority of episodes, the opening titles are preceded by a [[cold open]] scene involving the hosts performing a comedy sketch, similar to the cold openings of US light entertainment programme ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and usually with celebrity guests for the episode, which ended with them or the celebrities saying - \"Roll the titles!\"\n\n===Segments===\nThroughout the show's history, the programme has featured a variety of different segments, some based on notable elements in Saturday night TV. However, ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' features a regular selection of segments that it uses frequently in the majority of its episodes. These segments include:\n\n* '''An Audience Member's Game''' - Played at the beginning of an episode, the segment focuses on the presenters initially picking on certain audience members over something embarrassing about them. However, the last person picked takes part in a specially themed game just for them when Ant says \"I think you better come with me...\", in which they receive a prize regardless of the outcome. Research for the game usually is done by the production team, via input from relations and close friends who nominated the participant for this.\n* '''Ant vs. Dec''' - Played throughout a series, the presenters compete against each other in a number of themed challenges, in which neither presenter knows what each challenge is about. The winner of the game earns a point, and at the end of the series, the winner is the one to have the highest score; the loser is forced to undertake a forfeit during the series finale. The segment originally was designed as a surprise challenge for the two presenters, entitled \"What's Next\", in which neither pair knew what the challenge was, but had to work together to complete it. Between the eighth and ninth series, the presenters were joined by a team of celebrities who partook in the games. The segment is joined by a co-presenter, who gives out the rules and relay the results of the challenge, and is sometimes joined by a commentator during the challenge.\n* '''Ant & Dec Undercover''' - The presenters pull a prank on a selected celebrity, involving scripted scenes, such as a situation going wrong for their target. The prank would sometimes include the pair being on scene with their target, but in specially made disguises. The footage is shown with the celebrity in question present in the studio to watch it and to display their reactions towards what occurred when it was filmed. The segment was introduced in the second series, dropped after the fifth series, and then revived for the tenth series onwards.\n* '''I'm a Celebrity... Get Out of Me Ear!''' - Similar to \"Undercover\" and introduced in the tenth series, the presenters give a celebrity a concealed ear piece, and task them with doing whatever the pair instruct them to do before unsuspecting public members. Such instructions often involving doing or saying anything bizarre, weird, or downright silly.\n* '''Singalong Live''' - The presenters surprise three unsuspecting viewers, who become contestants in a karaoke-style quiz. Each is tasked with singing a segment of a song that is being sung by its artist, whereupon they must correctly identify a word that is missing from it. If they correctly identify the missing word, the viewer wins \u00a3500. The segment was first introduced in the eleventh series.\n* '''Read My Lips''' - This segment, introduced in the thirteenth series, focuses on a contestant giving answers to questions to the guest announcer, via [[Skype]]. However, the announcer wears noise-cancelling headphones, meaning that they have to read the contestant's lips to get the answer. If the contestant manage to get the announcer to give out three correct answers, they win a place on the series finale taking place outside of the UK.\n* '''Best Seats In The House/Sofa Watch''' - These segments focuses on viewer participation in a special game that offers a place in the studio audience for the following episode, with the exception of the series' finale. The segment takes place during the initial minutes of the episodes, in which viewers are shown several sofas (usually around 4) that are hidden in various locations in the UK, as shown by live-streaming via an on-site camera for each sofa. To win a place, the viewers must be within range of the location and be seated on the sofa in order to win when the presenters check to see who has found the sofas at a later stage in the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/saturdaynighttakeaway/videos/best-seats-in-the-house-sofa-watch|title=Best Seats in the House: #SofaWatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n*'''Win A Week Off Work''' - Introduced in Series 16. This segment involves Stephen Mulhern going to an office and has those who work there take part in various games with the last person standing winning a week off work and a holiday.\n* '''Win the Ads''' - Often the penultimate segment, a member of the audience is randomly selected to take part in a quiz to win a series of prizes. Prior to the show's broadcast, an ITV programme that had been broadcast during the week is randomly selected, whereupon the adverts broadcast during its commercial break(s) are used to create the prizes. Before the quiz begins, the prizes are placed onto a grid, concealed and randomly rearranged, before being given a number. The contestant is set amount of time (usually 60 seconds) to answer as many questions as they can - questions are based on that week's news stories, with each correct answer allowing the contestant to pick a number as their prize at the end. After time is up, the contestant is given the option to take their prizes, or gamble for the chance of winning all the prizes if they answer correctly one final question. The segment was originally used during the first series, and featured three people competing for the chance to win up to twenty prizes, with a consolation prize of a toilet roll given to any contestant that gambled and lost. The segment didn't return until the tenth series, which retained most of the format, but in favour of just having one contestant. From the thirteenth series onwards, the format was amended again, reducing the number of prizes to sixteen and dropping the use of a consolation prize.\n* '''\"End of the Show\" Show''' - The final segment of an episode, it focus on a big entertainment act to help finish off an episode's broadcast. From the first series to the ninth, it was mostly a musical act - singer, pop group and so forth - performing their latest hit in the charts. When the show returned from its hiatus, the segment's format was changed to become a musical number, which would be performed by the presenters alongside a special guest star(s).\n\n===Discontinued segments===\nThe following is a list of segments used on the programme in the course of its history, that have since been retired:\n\n* '''Grab the Ads''' (Series 1\u20139) - Run for nine series, the segment focused on one randomly chosen viewer taking part in a prize give out. Viewers are initially asked to phone in for a place in the segment, with the chosen viewer receiving one of nine prizes on offer. Each prize was hidden behind a number - 1 to 9 - and whichever number was chosen was the prize that viewer got. In the first series, the format focused on the viewer picking a number from a grid upon being chosen, but for the majority of series, the number was generated through a game that was played by a different celebrity; after the prize was revealed, the presenters would announce the viewer who had been chosen to receive it.  Its discontinuation came down to the production team opting to use the more commercial.  \"Win the Ads\" game when ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' returned for its tenth series.\n* '''Banged Up with Beadle''' (Series 1) - This segment functioned liked a spoof of a reality show, in which each week, a different member of the public was chosen to spend seven days locked up in a dungeon at [[Spitbank Fort]] in the Solent, with [[Jeremy Beadle]]. When they appeared live in the episode on Saturday, they were given a task, in which they won \u00a35,000 if successful. The segment featured a spin-off [[ITV2]] show of the same name, presented by [[Donna Air]] and [[Brendan Courtney]], to rival that of [[Channel 4]]'s smash hit series ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]''.\n* '''Make Ant Laugh''' (Series 1) - This segment focused on a contestant chosen by the show, attempting to impress Ant by making him laugh. If they succeeded, they won a trophy, otherwise they were [[gunge]]d on the episode. The format was similar in nature to the ''Challenge Ant'' segment of ''[[SMTV Live]]''.\n* '''Jim Didn't Fix It''' (Series 1\u20133) - This segment functioned as a spoof version of the format for ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'', in which an audience member who had written to [[Jimmy Savile]] in their youth for the means to fulfil their dreams but had never been lucky to receive it, were given the chance to realise their dreams years later.\n* '''Home Run''' (Series 1\u20133; 15-16) - This segment focused on unsuspecting members of the public being surprised by the presenters at a public location they were in, shown to viewers and the studio audience via hidden cameras set up at the location. The members selected by the show take part in a race to get back to their home immediately for a cash prize of \u00a33,000. The person(s), regardless of being successful, would then be forced to read an oath in which they stated that they must never go out on Saturday nights again. The segment was briefly revived as part of the programme's 100th episode celebrations in 2018.\n* '''Opportunity Knocks, Again''' (Series 2\u20135) - Based upon ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'', the format focused on members of the studio audience, who had previously performed on the show, to repeat their act on ''Saturday Night Takeaway''.\n* '''Saturday Cash Takeaway''' (Series 3) - This segment focused on a member of the studio audience randomly selecting one of nine popular takeaways, each being delivered to their customers. The one chosen would then be stuffed with \u00a31,000, which the unsuspecting customer could receive, along with their food, if they answered a question correctly from their front door.\n* '''Saturday Night Pub Olympics''' (Series 4) - This segment focused the production team selecting a random pub across the country, in which a number of unsuspecting customers visiting it would be invited to take part in a series of sporting events, dubbed the \"Saturday Night Pub Olympics\". The members taking part, are split into two teams, and face other against each other in three different events, with [[Dickie Davies]] providing commentary on proceedings.\n* '''Beat the Boys''' (Series 6\u20138) - This segment focused on the presenters competing against a pair of celebrities in a specially themed time-trail event. Each pair would drive around a specially created course in a specific type of vehicle, and attempt to set a fast lap time. For each episode that the segment was featured in, the course included a specially designed set of obstacles that both pairs had to complete correctly; any not completed correctly would incur a ten-second penalty to the pair's lap time.\n* '''Jiggy Bank''' (Series 6\u20137) - This segment focused on a studio audience member being randomly chosen to take part in a special game with a cash prize. The game focused on them riding a robotic pig, like a rodeo, and holding for as long as possible, with their time affecting the amount of money they won. A maximum of \u00a35,000 was on offer, and any money not won went into a jackpot for \"Grab the Ads\".\n* '''The Mouse Trap''' (Series 8\u20139) - This segment focused on a viewer being randomly picked to take part in a special game. The chosen viewer is given one minute to collect as much cheese from a specially created maze as they could possibly get and escape the maze before time ran out. Each piece of cheese collected was worth \u00a31,000, with a total of five pieces to collect. If the contestant failed to get out of the maze in time, they would lose and be locked in the maze by \"Tiddles the Takeaway Cat\".\n* '''Escape from Takeaway Prison''' (Series 9) - This segment focused on twenty celebrities being imprisoned in a fictional prison of the show, in which they competed against each other in a series of games, to win their freedom.\n* '''A Ticket To Slide''' (Series 12) - This segment focused on the presenters choosing a random member of the public to take part in a special game, in which they, along with their friends and family, had to collect keys while travelling down an inflatable slide. If enough keys were collected, the contestant would win tickets for a vacation to New York.\n* '''Little Ant & Dec''' (Series 2\u22126, 10-14) - Two young \"look-alikes\" of the presenters, nicknamed \"Little Ant\" and \"Little Dec\", meet with celebrities and ask them blunt questions regarding various subjects, which sometimes bamboozled the interviewee into giving some surprisingly straight answers. From its introduction in the second series to the end of the sixth series, the look-alikes were played by James Pallister and Dylan McKenna-Redshaw. When the segment was revived for the tenth series onwards, both Pallister and McKenna-Redshaw were too old to resume their roles, leading to them being replaced by Neil Overend and Haydn Reid. The segment was dropped after the fourteenth series, when the production team decided that both Overend and Reid were too old to continue in these roles and should be allowed to focus on their education. <!-- Unless this segment is announced to be returning in a new series of the show, please keep here. If it is returning, remove brackets when returning to Segment.-->\n* '''[[In for a Penny (TV show)|In for a Penny]]''' (Series 14-15) - Hosted by Stephen Mulhern and pre-recorded before an episode, this segment focuses on members of public being approached by Mulhern and taking part in a special gameshow, so long as they can provide a penny. Each contestant takes part in five rounds - four focusing on different challenges, and the final focusing on stopping at a selected number of seconds (i.e. stopping between 9\u201310 seconds) - and should they complete all five, they win \u00a31,000, otherwise the game ends. At the end of Series 15, ITV confirmed that the segment would be spun-off as its own show.<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/saturday-night-takeaway/news/a854205/stephen-mulhern-saturday-night-takeaway-in-for-a-penny-own-series/|title=Stephen Mulhern's In For A Penny IS getting own series|date=7 April 2018|publisher=}}</ref> <!-- Considered discontinued since it's gotten a spin-off, unless there is evidence it is to return to this programme. -->\n\n==Filming==\nFilming for every episode is done both live, for studio segments and off-site broadcasts across the country, and pre-recorded for filmed segments. Live studio segments since the show premiered took place from Studio 1 at [[The London Studios]], and included the backstage areas near to the studio for various sketches and banter by the presenters. Although the presenters are the primary cast members of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'', the show also employs a variety of co-stars who would handle off-site segments. After 2018, live studio segments would cease to be conducted at London Studios following the conclusion of the fifteenth series, owing to the site's imminent closure and sale. Filming for the live studio segments were moved to Studio TC1 at the [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] in West London, operated and owned by BBC Studioworks, in time for the sixteenth series launch in February 2020. In March 2020, the programme suspended live studio segments, assigning these to pre-recording in the wake of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nIn 2016, the production staff and the programme's creators decided to air live finales abroad in other locations, as part of a new prize-giving format involving the provision of travel holiday packages to lucky recipients within the audience and around the country. The first finale to be filmed under this new format element took place aboard the [[MV Britannia (2015)|MV Britannia]] while it was docked in Spain during its cruise journey. The format's success led to further sites abroad being used including [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World, Florida]] in 2017, and [[Universal Orlando]] in 2018. However, the finale for the 2020 series was originally planned to return to Walt Disney World, but was later retained within the UK at the home of the presenters, both as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus and due to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] closing the resort as a result of the pandemic.\n\n==Transmissions==\n{{main|List of Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The first serial, a parody of \"[[whodunnit]]\" crime mystery stories titled \"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\", focused on the presenter investigating the mysterious sudden shooting of Cowell at his birthday party. The popularity of the format for the programme led to additional serials being created: \"The Missing Crown Jewels\" for the fourteenth series, and \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\" for the fifteenth series, both parodies of the spy espionage genre of films, in which the presenters operated for the fictional organisation \"Honoured\" to investigate important cases; and \"Men in Brown\" for the sixteenth series, a parody of the [[Men in Black (film series)|''Men in Black'' film series]], in which the presenters join a special organisation involved in dealing with extraterrestrial species on Earth.\n\nAfter the mini-serial is aired with each series, all episodes are later condensed into a special feature-length episode under the title of ''Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway Presents...'', and broadcast in late December of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/tv/342862-itv-turns-ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-sketches-half-hour-festive-specials.html|title=Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway to air Christmas sketches|date=9 December 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Episodes===\n{{Episode table |background=lightblue |overall= |series= |title= |airdate= |episodes= \n{{Episode list|Ant and Dec Saturday Night Takeaway Presents...\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2016|2|27|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n{{Episode list|\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| RTitle          = \"The Missing Crown Jewels\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|2|25|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n{{Episode list|\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| RTitle          = \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n{{Episode list|\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| RTitle          = \"Men in Brown\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|29|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n}}\n\n==''Ant & Dec Takeaway on Tour''==\nOn 31 October 2013, it was announced that a live tour of the show, under the title \"Takeaway on Tour\", would be co-produced between [[Ant & Dec]], James Grant Live, and [[ITV Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a527798/ant--decs-saturday-night-takeaway-2014-arena-tour-announced.html |title=Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway: 2014 arena tour announced |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2013-10-31 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Presented by the show's hosts, with [[Kim Gavin]] as the tour's artistic director, it featured appearances by various celebrities and performers and a number of segments from the programme, including an appearance by [[Ashley Roberts]] as the host of the tour's version of \"Ant vs. Dec\".\n\nDemand for tickets was high, and led to extra dates and venues being added on 28 November 2013, along with some shows having their dates rearranged.<ref name=\"takeaway on tour\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a534173/ant--dec-announce-extra-saturday-night-takeaway-tour-dates.html |title=Ant & Dec announce extra 'Saturday Night Takeaway' tour dates |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2013-11-27 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> The tour ran for only one series of shows, between August - September 2014 across various cities in the [[United Kingdom]], including London, [[Cardiff]], [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], and [[Glasgow]], and also in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].\n\n==International versions==\nThe success of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' led to the creation of a number of international versions:\n\n* A Finnish version of the programme, entitled ''[[:fi:Huuma|Huuma]]'' (''Ecstasy'' in English) was aired on [[MTV3]].

a British television [[variety show]], created and presented by [[Anthony McPartlin]] and [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially known as [[Ant & Dec]]), and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] since its premiere on 8 June 2002, enduring a three-year hiatus between 2010\u20132012, while its presenters worked on other projects.<ref>{{cite

deal|last=Sperling|first=Daniel|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=9 November 2011}}</ref> The show's format, heavily influenced by previous Saturday night [[light entertainment]] shows such as ''[[Noel's House Party]]'', ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' and ''[[Don't Forget Your Toothbrush]]'', focuses on a mixture of live and pre-recorded entertainment and quiz segments, including an audience-based quiz involving the television adverts during a week's episode of one of ITV's programmes, and a competition in each series between the two presenters.\n\nThe programme proved an immense success for the broadcaster since its launch, earning several awards including Best Presenters at the [[18th National Television Awards]]  and the [[BAFTA]] for Entertainment Programme in 2013, as well as earning awards for the presenters. It success led to several international versions being created, though most have been short-lived, as well as a special mini-series of episodes involving an adventure of Ant & Dec, that were later broadcast as a special episode during the Christmas TV season. An official ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' iOS app for [[iPod]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] was released on 15 February 2013. Since the thirteenth series, the programme airs its series finales in location outside of the UK, with the exception of the sixteenth series due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|2020 coronavirus pandemic]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/itvtakeaway/status/1241466202893037573|title=Thank you all for joining us tonight!

Following the permanent closure of the site after the fifteenth series, the programme moved to Studio TC1 at the [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] in West London in 2020. The sixteenth series is the only series in the programme's history to feature pre-recorded episodes, due to events in 2020 (such as the outbreak of coronavirus).\n\n==Format==\n\nThe general set up for each episode is a selection of segments consisting of specially crafted games, comedy/entertainment films, participation by either a studio audience member, or unsuspecting viewer/public member, and a show finale consisting of a performance by a musician, dance group, singer, or group performers. Episodes of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' are broadcast live during the weekend, during a prime time slot on Saturday evenings for the entire run of a series. Each episode is introduced with a line-up of what segments will be featured during its broadcast, along with an introduction of the hosts themselves - from the seventh series onwards, this responsibility was given to a special celebrity announcer, who would not only give an introduction of themselves and the hosts, but would also state what viewers would expect in the show for that episode, along with an update on what was still to come before each commercial break in the programme. In the majority of episodes, the opening titles are preceded by a [[cold open]] scene involving the hosts performing a comedy sketch, similar to the cold openings of US light entertainment programme ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and usually with celebrity guests for the episode, which ended with them or the celebrities saying - \"Roll the titles!\"\n\n===Segments===\nThroughout the show's history, the programme has featured a variety of different segments, some based on notable elements in Saturday night TV. However, ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' features a regular selection of segments that it uses frequently in the majority of its episodes. These segments include:\n\n* '''An Audience Member's Game''' - Played at the beginning of an episode, the segment focuses on the presenters initially picking on certain audience members over something embarrassing about them. However, the last person picked takes part in a specially themed game just for them when Ant says \"I think you better come with me...\", in which they receive a prize regardless of the outcome. Research for the game usually is done by the production team, via input from relations and close friends who nominated the participant for this.\n* '''Ant vs. Dec''' - Played throughout a series, the presenters compete against each other in a number of themed challenges, in which neither presenter knows what each challenge is about. The winner of the game earns a point, and at the end of the series, the winner is the one to have the highest score; the loser is forced to undertake a forfeit during the series finale. The segment originally was designed as a surprise challenge for the two presenters, entitled \"What's Next\", in which neither pair knew what the challenge was, but had to work together to complete it. Between the eighth and ninth series, the presenters were joined by a team of celebrities who partook in the games. The segment is joined by a co-presenter, who gives out the rules and relay the results of the challenge, and is sometimes joined by a commentator during the challenge.\n* '''Ant & Dec Undercover''' - The presenters pull a prank on a selected celebrity, involving scripted scenes, such as a situation going wrong for their target. The prank would sometimes include the pair being on scene with their target, but in specially made disguises. The footage is shown with the celebrity in question present in the studio to watch it and to display their reactions towards what occurred when it was filmed. The segment was introduced in the second series, dropped after the fifth series, and then revived for the tenth series onwards.\n* '''I'm a Celebrity... Get Out of Me Ear!''' - Similar to \"Undercover\" and introduced in the tenth series, the presenters give a celebrity a concealed ear piece, and task them with doing whatever the pair instruct them to do before unsuspecting public members. Such instructions often involving doing or saying anything bizarre, weird, or downright silly.\n* '''Singalong Live''' - The presenters surprise three unsuspecting viewers, who become contestants in a karaoke-style quiz. Each is tasked with singing a segment of a song that is being sung by its artist, whereupon they must correctly identify a word that is missing from it. If they correctly identify the missing word, the viewer wins \u00a3500. The segment was first introduced in the eleventh series.\n* '''Read My Lips''' - This segment, introduced in the thirteenth series, focuses on a contestant giving answers to questions to the guest announcer, via [[Skype]]. However, the announcer wears noise-cancelling headphones, meaning that they have to read the contestant's lips to get the answer. If the contestant manage to get the announcer to give out three correct answers, they win a place on the series finale taking place outside of the UK.\n* '''Best Seats In The House/Sofa Watch''' - These segments focuses on viewer participation in a special game that offers a place in the studio audience for the following episode, with the exception of the series' finale. The segment takes place during the initial minutes of the episodes, in which viewers are shown several sofas (usually around 4) that are hidden in various locations in the UK, as shown by live-streaming via an on-site camera for each sofa. To win a place, the viewers must be within range of the location and be seated on the sofa in order to win when the presenters check to see who has found the sofas at a later stage in the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/saturdaynighttakeaway/videos/best-seats-in-the-house-sofa-watch|title=Best Seats in the House: #SofaWatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n*'''Win A Week Off Work''' - Introduced in Series 16. This segment involves Stephen Mulhern going to an office and has those who work there take part in various games with the last person standing winning a week off work and a holiday.\n* '''Win the Ads''' - Often the penultimate segment, a member of the audience is randomly selected to take part in a quiz to win a series of prizes. Prior to the show's broadcast, an ITV programme that had been broadcast during the week is randomly selected, whereupon the adverts broadcast during its commercial break(s) are used to create the prizes. Before the quiz begins, the prizes are placed onto a grid, concealed and randomly rearranged, before being given a number. The contestant is set amount of time (usually 60 seconds) to answer as many questions as they can - questions are based on that week's news stories, with each correct answer allowing the contestant to pick a number as their prize at the end. After time is up, the contestant is given the option to take their prizes, or gamble for the chance of winning all the prizes if they answer correctly one final question. The segment was originally used during the first series, and featured three people competing for the chance to win up to twenty prizes, with a consolation prize of a toilet roll given to any contestant that gambled and lost. The segment didn't return until the tenth series, which retained most of the format, but in favour of just having one contestant. From the thirteenth series onwards, the format was amended again, reducing the number of prizes to sixteen and dropping the use of a consolation prize.\n* '''\"End of the Show\" Show''' - The final segment of an episode, it focus on a big entertainment act to help finish off an episode's broadcast. From the first series to the ninth, it was mostly a musical act - singer, pop group and so forth - performing their latest hit in the charts. When the show returned from its hiatus, the segment's format was changed to become a musical number, which would be performed by the presenters alongside a special guest star(s).\n\n===Discontinued segments===\nThe following is a list of segments used on the programme in the course of its history, that have since been retired:\n\n* '''Grab the Ads''' (Series 1\u20139) - Run for nine series, the segment focused on one randomly chosen viewer taking part in a prize give out. Viewers are initially asked to phone in for a place in the segment, with the chosen viewer receiving one of nine prizes on offer. Each prize was hidden behind a number - 1 to 9 - and whichever number was chosen was the prize that viewer got. In the first series, the format focused on the viewer picking a number from a grid upon being chosen, but for the majority of series, the number was generated through a game that was played by a different celebrity; after the prize was revealed, the presenters would announce the viewer who had been chosen to receive it.  Its discontinuation came down to the production team opting to use the more commercial.  \"Win the Ads\" game when ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' returned for its tenth series.\n* '''Banged Up with Beadle''' (Series 1) - This segment functioned liked a spoof of a reality show, in which each week, a different member of the public was chosen to spend seven days locked up in a dungeon at [[Spitbank Fort]] in the Solent, with [[Jeremy Beadle]]. When they appeared live in the episode on Saturday, they were given a task, in which they won \u00a35,000 if successful. The segment featured a spin-off [[ITV2]] show of the same name, presented by [[Donna Air]] and [[Brendan Courtney]], to rival that of [[Channel 4]]'s smash hit series ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]''.\n* '''Make Ant Laugh''' (Series 1) - This segment focused on a contestant chosen by the show, attempting to impress Ant by making him laugh. If they succeeded, they won a trophy, otherwise they were [[gunge]]d on the episode. The format was similar in nature to the ''Challenge Ant'' segment of ''[[SMTV Live]]''.\n* '''Jim Didn't Fix It''' (Series 1\u20133) - This segment functioned as a spoof version of the format for ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'', in which an audience member who had written to [[Jimmy Savile]] in their youth for the means to fulfil their dreams but had never been lucky to receive it, were given the chance to realise their dreams years later.\n* '''Home Run''' (Series 1\u20133; 15-16) - This segment focused on unsuspecting members of the public being surprised by the presenters at a public location they were in, shown to viewers and the studio audience via hidden cameras set up at the location. The members selected by the show take part in a race to get back to their home immediately for a cash prize of \u00a33,000. The person(s), regardless of being successful, would then be forced to read an oath in which they stated that they must never go out on Saturday nights again. The segment was briefly revived as part of the programme's 100th episode celebrations in 2018.\n* '''Opportunity Knocks, Again''' (Series 2\u20135) - Based upon ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'', the format focused on members of the studio audience, who had previously performed on the show, to repeat their act on ''Saturday Night Takeaway''.\n* '''Saturday Cash Takeaway''' (Series 3) - This segment focused on a member of the studio audience randomly selecting one of nine popular takeaways, each being delivered to their customers. The one chosen would then be stuffed with \u00a31,000, which the unsuspecting customer could receive, along with their food, if they answered a question correctly from their front door.\n* '''Saturday Night Pub Olympics''' (Series 4) - This segment focused the production team selecting a random pub across the country, in which a number of unsuspecting customers visiting it would be invited to take part in a series of sporting events, dubbed the \"Saturday Night Pub Olympics\". The members taking part, are split into two teams, and face other against each other in three different events, with [[Dickie Davies]] providing commentary on proceedings.\n* '''Beat the Boys''' (Series 6\u20138) - This segment focused on the presenters competing against a pair of celebrities in a specially themed time-trail event. Each pair would drive around a specially created course in a specific type of vehicle, and attempt to set a fast lap time. For each episode that the segment was featured in, the course included a specially designed set of obstacles that both pairs had to complete correctly; any not completed correctly would incur a ten-second penalty to the pair's lap time.\n* '''Jiggy Bank''' (Series 6\u20137) - This segment focused on a studio audience member being randomly chosen to take part in a special game with a cash prize. The game focused on them riding a robotic pig, like a rodeo, and holding for as long as possible, with their time affecting the amount of money they won. A maximum of \u00a35,000 was on offer, and any money not won went into a jackpot for \"Grab the Ads\".\n* '''The Mouse Trap''' (Series 8\u20139) - This segment focused on a viewer being randomly picked to take part in a special game. The chosen viewer is given one minute to collect as much cheese from a specially created maze as they could possibly get and escape the maze before time ran out. Each piece of cheese collected was worth \u00a31,000, with a total of five pieces to collect. If the contestant failed to get out of the maze in time, they would lose and be locked in the maze by \"Tiddles the Takeaway Cat\".\n* '''Escape from Takeaway Prison''' (Series 9) - This segment focused on twenty celebrities being imprisoned in a fictional prison of the show, in which they competed against each other in a series of games, to win their freedom.\n* '''A Ticket To Slide''' (Series 12) - This segment focused on the presenters choosing a random member of the public to take part in a special game, in which they, along with their friends and family, had to collect keys while travelling down an inflatable slide. If enough keys were collected, the contestant would win tickets for a vacation to New York.\n* '''Little Ant & Dec''' (Series 2\u22126, 10-14) - Two young \"look-alikes\" of the presenters, nicknamed \"Little Ant\" and \"Little Dec\", meet with celebrities and ask them blunt questions regarding various subjects, which sometimes bamboozled the interviewee into giving some surprisingly straight answers. From its introduction in the second series to the end of the sixth series, the look-alikes were played by James Pallister and Dylan McKenna-Redshaw. When the segment was revived for the tenth series onwards, both Pallister and McKenna-Redshaw were too old to resume their roles, leading to them being replaced by Neil Overend and Haydn Reid. The segment was dropped after the fourteenth series, when the production team decided that both Overend and Reid were too old to continue in these roles and should be allowed to focus on their education. <!-- Unless this segment is announced to be returning in a new series of the show, please keep here. If it is returning, remove brackets when returning to Segment.-->\n* '''[[In for a Penny (TV show)|In for a Penny]]''' (Series 14-15) - Hosted by Stephen Mulhern and pre-recorded before an episode, this segment focuses on members of public being approached by Mulhern and taking part in a special gameshow, so long as they can provide a penny. Each contestant takes part in five rounds - four focusing on different challenges, and the final focusing on stopping at a selected number of seconds (i.e. stopping between 9\u201310 seconds) - and should they complete all five, they win \u00a31,000, otherwise the game ends. At the end of Series 15, ITV confirmed that the segment would be spun-off as its own show.<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/saturday-night-takeaway/news/a854205/stephen-mulhern-saturday-night-takeaway-in-for-a-penny-own-series/|title=Stephen Mulhern's In For A Penny IS getting own series|date=7 April 2018|publisher=}}</ref> <!-- Considered discontinued since it's gotten a spin-off, unless there is evidence it is to return to this programme. -->\n\n==Filming==\nFilming for every episode is done both live, for studio segments and off-site broadcasts across the country, and pre-recorded for filmed segments. Live studio segments since the show premiered took place from Studio 1 at [[The London Studios]], and included the backstage areas near to the studio for various sketches and banter by the presenters. Although the presenters are the primary cast members of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'', the show also employs a variety of co-stars who would handle off-site segments. After 2018, live studio segments would cease to be conducted at London Studios following the conclusion of the fifteenth series, owing to the site's imminent closure and sale. Filming for the live studio segments were moved to Studio TC1 at the [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] in West London, operated and owned by BBC Studioworks, in time for the sixteenth series launch in February 2020. In March 2020, the programme suspended live studio segments, assigning these to pre-recording in the wake of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nIn 2016, the production staff and the programme's creators decided to air live finales abroad in other locations, as part of a new prize-giving format involving the provision of travel holiday packages to lucky recipients within the audience and around the country. The first finale to be filmed under this new format element took place aboard the [[MV Britannia (2015)|MV Britannia]] while it was docked in Spain during its cruise journey. The format's success led to further sites abroad being used including [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World, Florida]] in 2017, and [[Universal Orlando]] in 2018. However, the finale for the 2020 series was originally planned to return to Walt Disney World, but was later retained within the UK at the home of the presenters, both as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus and due to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] closing the resort as a result of the pandemic.\n\n==Transmissions==\n{{main|List of Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The first serial, a parody of \"[[whodunnit]]\" crime mystery stories titled \"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\", focused on the presenter investigating the mysterious sudden shooting of Cowell at his birthday party. The popularity of the format for the programme led to additional serials being created: \"The Missing Crown Jewels\" for the fourteenth series, and \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\" for the fifteenth series, both parodies of the spy espionage genre of films, in which the presenters operated for the fictional organisation \"Honoured\" to investigate important cases; and \"Men in Brown\" for the sixteenth series, a parody of the [[Men in Black (film series)|''Men in Black'' film series]], in which the presenters join a special organisation involved in dealing with extraterrestrial species on Earth.\n\nAfter the mini-serial is aired with each series, all episodes are later condensed into a special feature-length episode under the title of ''Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway Presents...'', and broadcast in late December of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/tv/342862-itv-turns-ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-sketches-half-hour-festive-specials.html|title=Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway to air Christmas sketches|date=9 December 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Episodes===\n{{Episode table |background=lightblue |overall= |series= |title= |airdate= |episodes= \n{{Episode list|Ant and Dec Saturday Night Takeaway Presents...\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2016|2|27|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n{{Episode list|\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| RTitle          = \"The Missing Crown Jewels\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|2|25|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n{{Episode list|\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| RTitle          = \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n{{Episode list|\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| RTitle          = \"Men in Brown\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|29|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       =  black\n}}\n}}\n\n==''Ant & Dec Takeaway on Tour''==\nOn 31 October 2013, it was announced that a live tour of the show, under the title \"Takeaway on Tour\", would be co-produced between [[Ant & Dec]], James Grant Live, and [[ITV Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a527798/ant--decs-saturday-night-takeaway-2014-arena-tour-announced.html |title=Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway: 2014 arena tour announced |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2013-10-31 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Presented by the show's hosts, with [[Kim Gavin]] as the tour's artistic director, it featured appearances by various celebrities and performers and a number of segments from the programme, including an appearance by [[Ashley Roberts]] as the host of the tour's version of \"Ant vs. Dec\".\n\nDemand for tickets was high, and led to extra dates and venues being added on 28 November 2013, along with some shows having their dates rearranged.<ref name=\"takeaway on tour\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a534173/ant--dec-announce-extra-saturday-night-takeaway-tour-dates.html |title=Ant & Dec announce extra 'Saturday Night Takeaway' tour dates |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2013-11-27 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> The tour ran for only one series of shows, between August - September 2014 across various cities in the [[United Kingdom]], including London, [[Cardiff]], [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], and [[Glasgow]], and also in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].\n\n==International versions==\nThe success of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'' led to the creation of a number of international versions:\n\n* A Finnish version of the programme, entitled ''[[:fi:Huuma|Huuma]]'' (''Ecstasy'' in English) was aired on [[MTV3]].

His mother was Elizabeth Hardekyn (d. December 1615), daughter of Richard Hardekyn (d.1558) of Wotton House near [[Castle Hedingham]].

Vere as a result of his heroic deeds was Knighted by [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Willoughby]] on the field of battle.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn the next year Sir Francis became sergeant major-general of the [[Scots Brigade|English and Scottish troops]] in the Low Countries, and soon afterwards the chief command devolved upon him. This position he retained during fifteen campaigns, with almost unbroken success. Working in close cooperation with the Dutch forces under [[Maurice of Nassau]], he helped, step by step secure the country for the cause of independence. He garnered more rewards and respect from Maurice and the Dutch with his decisive actions in the defeat of Parma during the [[Siege of Knodsenburg]] outside [[Nijmegen]] in July 1591. The future prominent dramatist and poet [[Ben Jonson]] served as a volunteer under his command.\n\nVere won the reputation of being one of the best English soldiers of the day. His troops acquired a cohesion and a training based on the Dutch model fitting them to face the best Spanish troops, and his camp became the fashionable training-ground of all aspiring English soldiers, amongst others not only his younger brother [[Horace Vere|Horace]], but men of such note as [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando (Lord) Fairfax]], [[Gervase Markham]] and Captain [[Myles Standish]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nHe was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Leominster (UK Parliament constituency)|Leominster]] in 1593.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/vere-sir-francis-1560-1609| title= History of Parliament| publisher = History of Parliament Trust| accessdate =16 October 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Nieuport.jpg|thumb|Battle of Nieuwpoort, 1600.

During these visits he quickly became enamoured with Elizabeth. They fell in love - which was rare in those times - and Caesar consented to a marriage. Since Elizabeth\u2019s sister was also engaged, Caesar arranged a grand wedding for his stepdaughters on 26 October 1607.  Vere received a dowry of \u00a32,000 and settled property on her for life.
