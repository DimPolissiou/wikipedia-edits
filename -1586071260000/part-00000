Its also a skill in planning of creating visual content to transit information, thought or feeling so that it is satisfactorily received. Graphic Design is the art or profession of using design elements (such as typography and images) to convey information or create an effect[Merriam-webester 1828<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graphic+design|title=Definition of GRAPHIC DESIGN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> . The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[https://99designs.com.au/blog/design-history-movements/history-graphic-design/ \"Graphic design is so much a part of our modern world that it is hard to imagine living without it.

Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout history; indeed, strong examples of graphic design date back to manuscripts in ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic design developed alongside it over subsequent centuries, with compositors or typesetters often designing pages as they set the type.]\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-design In the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct profession in the West, in part because of the job specialization process that occurred there, and in part because of the new technologies and commercial possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication medium (e.g., a poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of the communication and brought them into a harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922 typographer William A.

These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref> \n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 \"Many employing graphic design skills work in a communications and marketing role. Technically, graphic design is visual communication. The American Institute of Graphic Arts today defines the field for current and aspiring graphic designers.]\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 The field formally incorporates creative and function understanding of seven elements into its own form of communication: space, texture, color, line, size, form, and shape.]\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 While many in graphic design do complete a college degree, it is not required.

Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref>\n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of [[Edward Johnston]] to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Meggs|first=Philip|title=A History of Graphic Design|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=0-471-29198-6|location=New York|pages=229-230}}</ref><!-- Why is this a classic design example?\nWho is Edward Johnston?

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

They are created and maintained by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) [[Local area network|LAN]]/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the [[Wi-Fi]] brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nThe protocols are typically used in conjunction with [[IEEE 802.2]], and are designed to interwork seamlessly with [[Ethernet]], and are very often used to carry [[Internet Protocol]] traffic.\n\nAlthough IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the [[radio frequency]] spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.\n\n==General description==\nThe 802.11 family consists of a series of [[half-duplex]] over-the-air [[modulation]] techniques that use the same basic protocol. The 802.11 protocol family employs [[carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each packet.\n\n802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family (c\u2013f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which may also include corrections to a previous specification.<ref name=\"IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual\">{{cite web |title=IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual |publisher=IEEE-SA |url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |access-date=2015-09-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906183258/http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |archive-date=2015-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4&nbsp;[[hertz|GHz]] [[ISM band]], operating in the United States under [[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] Rules and Regulations; 802.11n can also use that band. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b/g/n equipment may occasionally suffer [[Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz|interference in the 2.4 GHz band]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, and [[Bluetooth]] devices etc. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) and [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively.\n\n802.11a uses the [[U-NII|5&nbsp;GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels rather than the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels, where other adjacent channels overlap\u2014see [[list of WLAN channels]]. Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n can use either the 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 5&nbsp;GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5&nbsp;GHz band.\n\nThe segment of the [[radio frequency]] spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[amateur radio]] band.

Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the application's packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets (e.g., VoIP) create dataflows with high-overhead traffic (i.e., a low [[goodput]]). Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429|publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813094612/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429_Towards_energy-awareness_in_managing_wireless_LAN_applications?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522|publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813113706/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522_Application_Level_Energy_and_Performance_Measurements_in_a_Wireless_LAN?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput.

The mask requires the signal be [[Attenuation|attenuated]] a minimum of 20&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] from its peak amplitude at \u00b111&nbsp;MHz from the centre frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22&nbsp;MHz wide.  One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap.\n\nAvailability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country [[Frequency allocation|allocates radio spectrum]] to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and {{nowrap|1\u201313}} for 802.11g/n-2.4.  Other countries such as Spain initially allowed only channels 10 and 11, and France allowed only 10, 11, 12, and 13; however, Europe now allow channels 1 through 13.<ref name=\"CNAF\">{{cite web|title=Cuadro nacional de Atribuci\u00f3n de Frecuencias CNAF|publisher=Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Telecomunicaciones |url=http://www.mityc.es/Telecomunicaciones/Secciones/Espectro/cnaf |accessdate=2008-03-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213092618/http://www.mityc.es/Telecomunicaciones/Secciones/Espectro/cnaf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-13}}</ref><ref name=\"ART\">{{cite web|title=Evolution du r\u00e9gime d'autorisation pour les RLAN|publisher=French Telecommunications Regulation Authority (ART)|url=http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/evol-rlan-250703.pdf|access-date=2008-10-26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209172043/http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/evol-rlan-250703.pdf|archive-date=2006-12-09|df=}}</ref> North America and some Central and South American countries allow only {{nowrap|1 through 11.}}\n\n[[File:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11g WLAN).svg|thumb|center|upright=3.25|Spectral masks for 802.11g channels {{nowrap|1\u201314}} in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band]]\n\nSince the spectral mask defines only power output restrictions up to \u00b111&nbsp;MHz from the center frequency to be attenuated by \u221250&nbsp;dBr, it is often assumed that the energy of the channel extends no further than these limits. It is more correct to say that, given the separation between channels, the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to minimally interfere with a transmitter on any other channel. Due to the [[near-far problem]] a transmitter can impact (desense) a receiver on a \"non-overlapping\" channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels. Conversely, a sufficiently distant transmitter on an overlapping channel can have little to no significant effect.\n\nConfusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22&nbsp;MHz, resulting in ''three'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 6, and 11). 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20&nbsp;MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that ''four'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) exist under 802.11g, although this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 (2012), which states \"In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25&nbsp;MHz.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications|url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626000833/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-26|df=}}</ref>\nand section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.\n\nThis does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels.  The amount of inter-channel interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 (which is permitted in Europe, but not in North America) is barely different from a three-channel configuration, but with an entire extra channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Choosing the clearest channels for WiFi... continued|url=http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211080940/http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|archive-date=2013-12-11|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"adjacentchannels\">{{Cite conference |last1=Garcia Villegas |first1=E. |title=Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs |conference=CrownCom 2007 |publisher=ICST & IEEE |year=2007 |url=https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |display-authors=etal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720102658/https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:NonOverlappingChannels2.4GHz802.11-en.svg|thumb|802.11 non-overlapping channels for 2.4GHz.

No ''regdomain'' 0 behavior shows up in 802.11-2007 that I can find -->\n\nThe ''regdomain'' setting is often made difficult or impossible to change so that the end users do not conflict with local regulatory agencies such as the [[United States]]' [[Federal Communications Commission]].\n\n==Layer 2 \u2013 Datagrams==\nThe [[datagram]]s are called ''frames''. Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links.\n\nFrames are divided into very specific and standardized sections. Each frame consists of a ''MAC header'', ''payload'', and ''[[frame check sequence]]'' (FCS). Some frames may not have a payload.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Frame <br/>control\n| Duration, <br/>{{abbr|id.|association id.}}\n| Address <br/>1\n| Address <br/>2\n| Address <br/>3\n| Sequence <br/>control\n| Address <br/>4\n| {{abbr|QoS|Quality of service}} <br/>control\n| {{abbr|HT|High throughput}} <br/>control\n| Frame <br/>body\n| Frame check <br/>sequence\n|-\n!

This frame control field is subdivided into the following sub-fields:\n* Protocol Version: Two bits representing the protocol version. Currently used protocol version is zero. Other values are reserved for future use.\n* Type: Two bits identifying the type of WLAN frame. Control, Data, and Management are various frame types defined in IEEE 802.11.\n* Subtype: Four bits providing additional discrimination between frames. Type and Subtype are used together to identify the exact frame.\n* ToDS and FromDS: Each is one bit in size. They indicate whether a data frame is headed for a distribution system. Control and management frames set these values to zero. All the data frames will have one of these bits set. However communication within an [[independent basic service set]] (IBSS) network always set these bits to zero.\n* More Fragments: The More Fragments bit is set when a packet is divided into multiple frames for transmission. Every frame except the last frame of a packet will have this bit set.\n* Retry: Sometimes frames require retransmission, and for this there is a Retry bit that is set to one when a frame is resent. This aids in the elimination of duplicate frames.\n* Power Management: This bit indicates the power management state of the sender after the completion of a frame exchange. Access points are required to manage the connection, and will never set the power-saver bit.\n* More Data: The More Data bit is used to buffer frames received in a distributed system. The access point uses this bit to facilitate stations in power-saver mode. It indicates that at least one frame is available, and addresses all stations connected.\n* Protected Frame: The Protected Frame bit is set to one if the frame body is encrypted by a protection mechanism such as [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA|Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA), or [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA2|Wi-Fi Protected Access II]] (WPA2).\n* Order: This bit is set only when the \"strict ordering\" delivery method is employed. Frames and fragments are not always sent in order as it causes a transmission performance penalty.\n\nThe next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field that indicates how long the field's transmission will take so other devices know when the channel will be available again. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period (CFP), and Association ID (AID).\n\nAn 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a [[MAC address]]. Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver.{{Dubious|date=December 2015}}  Address 4 is only present in data frames transmitted between access points in an [[Extended Service Set]] or between intermediate nodes in a [[mesh networking|mesh network]].\n\nThe remaining fields of the header are:\n* The Sequence Control field is a two-byte section used for identifying message order as well as eliminating duplicate frames. The first 4 bits are used for the fragmentation number, and the last 12 bits are the sequence number.\n* An optional two-byte Quality of Service control field, present in QoS Data frames; it was added with [[802.11e]].\n\nThe payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers.\n\nThe Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), it allows for integrity check of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission.<ref name=\"802.11 Technical Section\">{{cite web|url=http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|title=802.11 Technical Section|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151617/http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref>\n\n===Management frames===\nManagement frames are [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|not always authenticated]], and allow for the maintenance, or discontinuance, of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include:\n* Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication begins with the [[wireless network interface card]] (WNIC) sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity. With an open system authentication, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection. With shared key authentication, after the WNIC sends its initial authentication request it will receive an authentication frame from the access point containing challenge text. The WNIC sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNIC's authentication status.\n* Association request frame: Sent from a station it enables the access point to allocate resources and synchronize. The frame carries information about the WNIC, including supported data rates and the [[SSID]] of the network the station wishes to associate with. If the request is accepted, the access point reserves memory and establishes an association ID for the WNIC.\n* Association response frame: Sent from an access point to a station containing the acceptance or rejection to an association request. If it is an acceptance, the frame will contain information such an association ID and supported data rates.\n* [[Beacon frame]]: Sent periodically from an access point to announce its presence and provide the [[SSID]], and other parameters for WNICs within range.\n* {{vanchor|Deauthentication frame}}: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection from another station.\n* Disassociation frame: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection. It's an elegant way to allow the access point to relinquish memory allocation and remove the WNIC from the association table.\n* Probe request frame: Sent from a station when it requires information from another station.\n* Probe response frame: Sent from an access point containing capability information, supported data rates, etc., after receiving a probe request frame.\n* Reassociation request frame: A WNIC sends a reassociation request when it drops from range of the currently associated access point and finds another access point with a stronger signal. The new access point coordinates the forwarding of any information that may still be contained in the buffer of the previous access point.\n* Reassociation response frame: Sent from an access point containing the acceptance or rejection to a WNIC reassociation request frame. The frame includes information required for association such as the association ID and supported data rates.\n* Action frame: extending management frame to control certain action.   Some of action categories are Block Ack, Radio Measurement, Fast BSS Transition, etc.  These frames are sent by a station when it needs to tell its peer for certain action to be taken. For example, a station can tell another station to set up a [[block acknowledgement]] by sending an ''ADDBA Request'' action frame. The other station would then respond with an ''ADDBA Response'' action frame.\n\nThe body of a management frame consists of frame-subtype-dependent fixed fields followed by a sequence of [[information element]]s (IEs).\n\nThe common structure of an IE is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Type\n| Length\n| Data\n|-\n! Length\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\u2013252\n|}\n\n===Control frames===\nControl frames facilitate in the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include:\n* Acknowledgement (ACK) frame: After receiving a data frame, the receiving station will send an ACK frame to the sending station if no errors are found. If the sending station doesn't receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the sending station will resend the frame.\n* Request to Send (RTS) frame: The [[IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS|RTS and CTS frames]] provide an optional collision reduction scheme for access points with hidden stations. A station sends a RTS frame as the first step in a two-way handshake required before sending data frames.\n* Clear to Send (CTS) frame: A station responds to an RTS frame with a CTS frame. It provides clearance for the requesting station to send a data frame. The CTS provides collision control management by including a time value for which all other stations are to hold off transmission while the requesting station transmits.\n\n===Data frames===\nData frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body.<ref name=\"Frame Types\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|title=Understanding 802.11 Frame Types|access-date=2008-12-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125033409/http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|archive-date=2008-11-25|df=}}</ref> The body begins with an [[IEEE 802.2]] header, with the Destination [[Service Access Point]] (DSAP) specifying the protocol, followed by a [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) header if the DSAP is hex AA, with the [[organizationally unique identifier]] (OUI) and protocol ID (PID) fields specifying the protocol.

To select the correct transmission speed or [[Modulation and Coding Scheme]], a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of an Access points vary widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average.<ref>{{cite journal|author1= D Murray |author2=T Koziniec |author3=M Dixon |author4=K.

Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly equal millisecond).\n\nAlso the term \"Portal\" is used to describe an entity that is similar to an [[IEEE 802.1|802.1H]] bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs.\n\n==Security==\nIn 2001, a group from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] presented a paper describing weaknesses in the [[802.11]] [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by [[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir]]'s paper titled \"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of [[RC4]]\". Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack, they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks.\n\nThe IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the [[Media Access Control|MAC]] layer). The [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] announced an interim specification called [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] ([[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]) based on a subset of the then current IEEE 802.11i draft. These started to appear in products in mid-2003. [[IEEE 802.11i]] (also known as [[WPA2]]) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] AES, instead of [[RC4]], which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES Pre-Shared Key), and for the enterprise space is WPA2 along with a [[RADIUS]] authentication server (or another type of authentication server) and a strong authentication method such as [[EAP-TLS]].\n\nIn January 2005, the IEEE set up yet another [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|task group \"w\"]] to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured. Its standard was published in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title= Status of Project IEEE 802.11 Task Group w: Protected Management Frames |author= Jesse Walker, Chair |date= May 2009 |url= http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |access-date= August 23, 2011 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045925/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |archive-date= September 27, 2011 |df=  }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, a security flaw was revealed that affects some wireless routers with a specific implementation of the optional [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]] (WPS) feature.

They are created and maintained by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) [[Local area network|LAN]]/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the [[Wi-Fi]] brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nThe protocols are typically used in conjunction with [[IEEE 802.2]], and are designed to interwork seamlessly with [[Ethernet]], and are very often used to carry [[Internet Protocol]] traffic.\n\nAlthough IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the [[radio frequency]] spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.\n\n==General description==\nThe 802.11 family consists of a series of [[half-duplex]] over-the-air [[modulation]] techniques that use the same basic protocol. The 802.11 protocol family employs [[carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each packet.\n\n802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family (c\u2013f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which may also include corrections to a previous specification.<ref name=\"IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual\">{{cite web |title=IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual |publisher=IEEE-SA |url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |access-date=2015-09-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906183258/http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |archive-date=2015-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4&nbsp;[[hertz|GHz]] [[ISM band]], operating in the United States under [[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] Rules and Regulations; 802.11n can also use that band. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b/g/n equipment may occasionally suffer [[Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz|interference in the 2.4 GHz band]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, and [[Bluetooth]] devices etc. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) and [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively.\n\n802.11a uses the [[U-NII|5&nbsp;GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels rather than the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping 20&nbsp;MHz-wide channels, where other adjacent channels overlap\u2014see [[list of WLAN channels]]. Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n can use either the 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 5&nbsp;GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5&nbsp;GHz band.\n\nThe segment of the [[radio frequency]] spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.

It specified two [[net bit rate]]s of 1 or 2 [[Megabit per second|megabits per second]] (Mbit/s), plus [[forward error correction]] code. It specified three alternative [[physical layer]] technologies: diffuse [[infrared]] operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s; [[frequency-hopping]] spread spectrum operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s or 2&nbsp;Mbit/s; and [[direct-sequence]] spread spectrum operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s or 2&nbsp;Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used [[microwave]] transmission over the [[ISM band|Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band]] at 2.4&nbsp;GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the [[United States|U.S.]] 900&nbsp;MHz ISM band.\n\nLegacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b.\n\n===802.11a (OFDM waveform)===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11a-1999}}\n\n802.11a, published in 1999, uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an [[OFDM]] based air interface (physical layer). It operates in the 5&nbsp;GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54&nbsp;Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |title=Wireless throughput |access-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103014005/http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |archive-date=2011-11-03 |df= }}</ref> It has seen widespread worldwide implementation, particularly within the corporate workspace.\n\nSince the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5&nbsp;GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high [[Center frequency|carrier frequency]] also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g. In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds (802.11b will reduce speed to 5.5&nbsp;Mbit/s or even 1&nbsp;Mbit/s at low signal strengths). 802.11a also suffers from interference,<ref name=\"ACIisharmfull\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Angelakis  | first1 = V.| last2 = Papadakis | first2 = S.| last3 = Siris | first3 = V.A.| last4 = Traganitis | first4 = A.| title = Adjacent channel interference in 802.11a is harmful: Testbed validation of a simple quantification model| journal = Communications Magazine| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 160\u2013166| publisher = IEEE| date = March 2011| issn = 0163-6804| doi = 10.1109/MCOM.2011.5723815}}</ref> but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput.\n\n===802.11b===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11b-1999}}\n\nThe 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11&nbsp;Mbit/s (Megabits per second), and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.\n\nDevices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, cordless telephones, and some amateur radio equipment. As unlicensed intentional radiators in this [[ISM band]], they must not interfere with and must tolerate interference from primary or secondary allocations (users) of this band, such as amateur radio.\n\n===802.11g===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11g-2003}}\n\nIn June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g. This works in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band (like 802.11b), but uses the same [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] based transmission scheme as 802.11a. It operates at a maximum physical layer bit rate of 54&nbsp;Mbit/s exclusive of forward error correction codes, or about 22&nbsp;Mbit/s average throughput.<ref name=\"wndw-pdf\">{{cite book|title=Wireless Networking in the Developing World: A practical guide to planning and building low-cost telecommunications infrastructure|publisher=Hacker Friendly LLC|edition=2nd|page=425|year=2007|url=http://wndw.net/pdf/wndw2-en/wndw2-ebook.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006075431/http://www.wndw.net/pdf/wndw2-en/wndw2-ebook.pdf|archive-date=2008-10-06|df=}} page 14</ref> 802.11g hardware is fully backward compatible with 802.11b hardware, and therefore is encumbered with legacy issues that reduce throughput by ~21% when compared to 802.11a.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted in the market starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher data rates as well as reductions in manufacturing costs. By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile [[adapter card]] or access point. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process; in an 802.11g network, however, activity of an 802.11b participant will reduce the data rate of the overall 802.11g network.\n\nLike 802.11b, 802.11g devices also suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, for example wireless keyboards.\n\n===802.11-2007===\nIn 2003, task group TGma was authorized to \"roll up\" many of the amendments to the 1999 version of the 802.11 standard.

MU-MIMO allows the Access Point to form beams towards each Client, while transmitting information simultaneously. By doing so, the interference between Clients is reduced, and the overall throughput is increased, since multiple Clients can receive data at the same time. With 802.11ax, a similar multiplexing is introduced in the frequency domain, namely [[OFDMA]]. With this technique, multiple Clients are assigned with different Resource Units in the available spectrum. By doing so, an 80&nbsp;MHz channel can be split into multiple Resource Units, so that multiple Clients receive different type of data over the same spectrum, simultaneously. In order to have enough amount of subcarriers to support the requirements of [[OFDMA]], the number of subcarriers are increased by a factor of 4 (compared to 802.11ac standard). In other words, for 20, 40, 80 and 160&nbsp;MHz channels, there are 64, 128, 256 and 512 subcarriers in 802.11ac standard; while there are 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 subcarriers in 802.11ax standard. Since the available bandwidths have not changed and the number of subcarriers are increased with a factor of 4, the subcarrier spacing is reduced by a factor of 4 as well. This introduces 4 times longer OFDM symbols. E.g., for 802.11ac and 802.11ax, the duration of an OFDM symbol is 3.2 micro seconds and 12.8 micro seconds (both without [[guard interval]]s), respectively.\n\n===802.11ay===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11ay}}\n{{Update|section|date=March 2015}} <!-- ay: need updating with more relevant info. -->\n\nIEEE 802.11ay is a standard that is being developed.

However, this does not apply to typical deployments in which data is being transferred between two endpoints, of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure and the other endpoint is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of [[Wi-Fi]] application specific ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) performance envelope 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, with 802.11n with 40MHz]]\n\nThis means that, typically, data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium, and are being converted to [[IEEE 802.3|802.3]] ([[Ethernet]]) or vice versa. Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the application's packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets (e.g., VoIP) create dataflows with high-overhead traffic (i.e., a low [[goodput]]). Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429|publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813094612/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429_Towards_energy-awareness_in_managing_wireless_LAN_applications?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522|publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813113706/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522_Application_Level_Energy_and_Performance_Measurements_in_a_Wireless_LAN?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput.

These are commonly referred to as the \"2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands\" in most sales literature. Each spectrum is sub-divided into ''channels'' with a center frequency and bandwidth, analogous to the way radio and TV broadcast bands are sub-divided.\n\nThe 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is divided into 14 channels spaced 5&nbsp;MHz apart, beginning with channel&nbsp;1, which is centered on 2.412&nbsp;GHz. The latter channels have additional restrictions or are unavailable for use in some regulatory domains.\n\n[[File:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11b,g WLAN).svg|thumb|center|upright=3.25|Graphical representation of [[Wi-Fi]] channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band]]\n\nThe channel numbering of the {{nowrap|5.725\u20135.875 GHz}} spectrum is less intuitive due to the differences in regulations between countries. These are discussed in greater detail on the [[List of WLAN channels#5GHz|list of WLAN channels]].\n\n===Channel spacing within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band===\nIn addition to specifying the channel center frequency, 802.11 also specifies (in Clause 17) a [[spectral mask]] defining the permitted power distribution across each channel. The mask requires the signal be [[Attenuation|attenuated]] a minimum of 20&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] from its peak amplitude at \u00b111&nbsp;MHz from the centre frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22&nbsp;MHz wide.  One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap.\n\nAvailability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country [[Frequency allocation|allocates radio spectrum]] to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and {{nowrap|1\u201313}} for 802.11g/n-2.4.

It is more correct to say that, given the separation between channels, the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to minimally interfere with a transmitter on any other channel. Due to the [[near-far problem]] a transmitter can impact (desense) a receiver on a \"non-overlapping\" channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels. Conversely, a sufficiently distant transmitter on an overlapping channel can have little to no significant effect.\n\nConfusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22&nbsp;MHz, resulting in ''three'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 6, and 11). 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20&nbsp;MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that ''four'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) exist under 802.11g, although this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 (2012), which states \"In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25&nbsp;MHz.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications|url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626000833/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-26|df=}}</ref>\nand section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.\n\nThis does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels.  The amount of inter-channel interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 (which is permitted in Europe, but not in North America) is barely different from a three-channel configuration, but with an entire extra channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Choosing the clearest channels for WiFi... continued|url=http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211080940/http://www.wirelesswaffle.com/index.php?m=02&y=13&entry=entry130212-072406|archive-date=2013-12-11|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"adjacentchannels\">{{Cite conference |last1=Garcia Villegas |first1=E. |title=Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs |conference=CrownCom 2007 |publisher=ICST & IEEE |year=2007 |url=https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |display-authors=etal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720102658/https://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/1234/1/CrownCom07_CReady.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:NonOverlappingChannels2.4GHz802.11-en.svg|thumb|802.11 non-overlapping channels for 2.4GHz.

Different countries define different levels of allowable transmitter power, time that a channel can be occupied, and different available channels.<ref>IEEE Standard 802.11-2007 page 531</ref> Domain codes are specified for the United States, [[Canada]], [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI (Europe)]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Japan]], and [[China]].\n\nMost [[Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi certified]] devices default to ''regdomain'' 0, which means [[least common denominator]] settings, i.e., the device will not transmit at a power above the allowable power in any nation, nor will it use frequencies that are not permitted in any nation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}<!-- is this even possible? No ''regdomain'' 0 behavior shows up in 802.11-2007 that I can find -->\n\nThe ''regdomain'' setting is often made difficult or impossible to change so that the end users do not conflict with local regulatory agencies such as the [[United States]]' [[Federal Communications Commission]].\n\n==Layer 2 \u2013 Datagrams==\nThe [[datagram]]s are called ''frames''. Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links.\n\nFrames are divided into very specific and standardized sections. Each frame consists of a ''MAC header'', ''payload'', and ''[[frame check sequence]]'' (FCS). Some frames may not have a payload.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Frame <br/>control\n| Duration, <br/>{{abbr|id.|association id.}}\n| Address <br/>1\n| Address <br/>2\n| Address <br/>3\n| Sequence <br/>control\n| Address <br/>4\n| {{abbr|QoS|Quality of service}} <br/>control\n| {{abbr|HT|High throughput}} <br/>control\n| Frame <br/>body\n| Frame check <br/>sequence\n|-\n! Length\n| 2\n| 2\n| 6\n| 6\n| 6\n| 0, or 2\n| 6\n| 0, or 2\n| 0, or 4\n| {{n/a|''Variable''}}\n| 4\n|}\n\nThe first two bytes of the MAC header form a frame control field specifying the form and function of the frame. This frame control field is subdivided into the following sub-fields:\n* Protocol Version: Two bits representing the protocol version. Currently used protocol version is zero. Other values are reserved for future use.\n* Type: Two bits identifying the type of WLAN frame. Control, Data, and Management are various frame types defined in IEEE 802.11.\n* Subtype: Four bits providing additional discrimination between frames. Type and Subtype are used together to identify the exact frame.\n* ToDS and FromDS: Each is one bit in size. They indicate whether a data frame is headed for a distribution system. Control and management frames set these values to zero. All the data frames will have one of these bits set. However communication within an [[independent basic service set]] (IBSS) network always set these bits to zero.\n* More Fragments: The More Fragments bit is set when a packet is divided into multiple frames for transmission. Every frame except the last frame of a packet will have this bit set.\n* Retry: Sometimes frames require retransmission, and for this there is a Retry bit that is set to one when a frame is resent. This aids in the elimination of duplicate frames.\n* Power Management: This bit indicates the power management state of the sender after the completion of a frame exchange. Access points are required to manage the connection, and will never set the power-saver bit.\n* More Data: The More Data bit is used to buffer frames received in a distributed system. The access point uses this bit to facilitate stations in power-saver mode. It indicates that at least one frame is available, and addresses all stations connected.\n* Protected Frame: The Protected Frame bit is set to one if the frame body is encrypted by a protection mechanism such as [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA|Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA), or [[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA2|Wi-Fi Protected Access II]] (WPA2).\n* Order: This bit is set only when the \"strict ordering\" delivery method is employed. Frames and fragments are not always sent in order as it causes a transmission performance penalty.\n\nThe next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field that indicates how long the field's transmission will take so other devices know when the channel will be available again. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period (CFP), and Association ID (AID).\n\nAn 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a [[MAC address]]. Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver.{{Dubious|date=December 2015}}  Address 4 is only present in data frames transmitted between access points in an [[Extended Service Set]] or between intermediate nodes in a [[mesh networking|mesh network]].\n\nThe remaining fields of the header are:\n* The Sequence Control field is a two-byte section used for identifying message order as well as eliminating duplicate frames. The first 4 bits are used for the fragmentation number, and the last 12 bits are the sequence number.\n* An optional two-byte Quality of Service control field, present in QoS Data frames; it was added with [[802.11e]].\n\nThe payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers.\n\nThe Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), it allows for integrity check of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission.<ref name=\"802.11 Technical Section\">{{cite web|url=http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|title=802.11 Technical Section|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151617/http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref>\n\n===Management frames===\nManagement frames are [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|not always authenticated]], and allow for the maintenance, or discontinuance, of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include:\n* Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication begins with the [[wireless network interface card]] (WNIC) sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity. With an open system authentication, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection. With shared key authentication, after the WNIC sends its initial authentication request it will receive an authentication frame from the access point containing challenge text. The WNIC sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNIC's authentication status.\n* Association request frame: Sent from a station it enables the access point to allocate resources and synchronize. The frame carries information about the WNIC, including supported data rates and the [[SSID]] of the network the station wishes to associate with. If the request is accepted, the access point reserves memory and establishes an association ID for the WNIC.\n* Association response frame: Sent from an access point to a station containing the acceptance or rejection to an association request. If it is an acceptance, the frame will contain information such an association ID and supported data rates.\n* [[Beacon frame]]: Sent periodically from an access point to announce its presence and provide the [[SSID]], and other parameters for WNICs within range.\n* {{vanchor|Deauthentication frame}}: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection from another station.\n* Disassociation frame: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection. It's an elegant way to allow the access point to relinquish memory allocation and remove the WNIC from the association table.\n* Probe request frame: Sent from a station when it requires information from another station.\n* Probe response frame: Sent from an access point containing capability information, supported data rates, etc., after receiving a probe request frame.\n* Reassociation request frame: A WNIC sends a reassociation request when it drops from range of the currently associated access point and finds another access point with a stronger signal. The new access point coordinates the forwarding of any information that may still be contained in the buffer of the previous access point.\n* Reassociation response frame: Sent from an access point containing the acceptance or rejection to a WNIC reassociation request frame. The frame includes information required for association such as the association ID and supported data rates.\n* Action frame: extending management frame to control certain action.   Some of action categories are Block Ack, Radio Measurement, Fast BSS Transition, etc.  These frames are sent by a station when it needs to tell its peer for certain action to be taken. For example, a station can tell another station to set up a [[block acknowledgement]] by sending an ''ADDBA Request'' action frame. The other station would then respond with an ''ADDBA Response'' action frame.\n\nThe body of a management frame consists of frame-subtype-dependent fixed fields followed by a sequence of [[information element]]s (IEs).\n\nThe common structure of an IE is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Type\n| Length\n| Data\n|-\n! Length\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\u2013252\n|}\n\n===Control frames===\nControl frames facilitate in the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include:\n* Acknowledgement (ACK) frame: After receiving a data frame, the receiving station will send an ACK frame to the sending station if no errors are found. If the sending station doesn't receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the sending station will resend the frame.\n* Request to Send (RTS) frame: The [[IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS|RTS and CTS frames]] provide an optional collision reduction scheme for access points with hidden stations. A station sends a RTS frame as the first step in a two-way handshake required before sending data frames.\n* Clear to Send (CTS) frame: A station responds to an RTS frame with a CTS frame. It provides clearance for the requesting station to send a data frame. The CTS provides collision control management by including a time value for which all other stations are to hold off transmission while the requesting station transmits.\n\n===Data frames===\nData frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body.<ref name=\"Frame Types\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|title=Understanding 802.11 Frame Types|access-date=2008-12-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125033409/http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|archive-date=2008-11-25|df=}}</ref> The body begins with an [[IEEE 802.2]] header, with the Destination [[Service Access Point]] (DSAP) specifying the protocol, followed by a [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) header if the DSAP is hex AA, with the [[organizationally unique identifier]] (OUI) and protocol ID (PID) fields specifying the protocol.

To select the correct transmission speed or [[Modulation and Coding Scheme]], a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of an Access points vary widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average.<ref>{{cite journal|author1= D Murray |author2=T Koziniec |author3=M Dixon |author4=K.

Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly equal millisecond).\n\nAlso the term \"Portal\" is used to describe an entity that is similar to an [[IEEE 802.1|802.1H]] bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs.\n\n==Security==\nIn 2001, a group from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] presented a paper describing weaknesses in the [[802.11]] [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by [[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir]]'s paper titled \"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of [[RC4]]\". Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack, they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks.\n\nThe IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the [[Media Access Control|MAC]] layer). The [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] announced an interim specification called [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] ([[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]]) based on a subset of the then current IEEE 802.11i draft. These started to appear in products in mid-2003. [[IEEE 802.11i]] (also known as [[WPA2]]) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] AES, instead of [[RC4]], which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES Pre-Shared Key), and for the enterprise space is WPA2 along with a [[RADIUS]] authentication server (or another type of authentication server) and a strong authentication method such as [[EAP-TLS]].\n\nIn January 2005, the IEEE set up yet another [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|task group \"w\"]] to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured. Its standard was published in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title= Status of Project IEEE 802.11 Task Group w: Protected Management Frames |author= Jesse Walker, Chair |date= May 2009 |url= http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |access-date= August 23, 2011 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045925/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/tgw_update.htm |archive-date= September 27, 2011 |df=  }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, a security flaw was revealed that affects some wireless routers with a specific implementation of the optional [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]] (WPS) feature. While WPS is not a part of 802.11, the flaw allows an attacker within the range of the wireless router to recover the WPS PIN and, with it, the router's 802.11i password in a few hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf |website=.braindump \u2013 RE and stuff |title=Brute forcing Wi-Fi Protected Setup |date=2011-12-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118105726/http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-18 |df= }}</ref><ref>[[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US CERT]] [http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755 Vulnerability Note VU#723755] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103152902/http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755 |date=2012-01-03 }}</ref>\n\nIn late 2014, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that its [[iOS]]&nbsp;8 mobile operating system would scramble MAC addresses<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking|title=iOS 8 strikes an unexpected blow against location tracking|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402001224/http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5792970/ios-8-strikes-an-unexpected-blow-against-location-tracking|archive-date=2015-04-02|df=}}</ref> during the pre-association stage to thwart [[People counter|retail footfall tracking]] made possible by the regular transmission of uniquely identifiable probe requests.\n\nWi-Fi users may be subjected to a [[Wi-Fi deauthentication attack]] to eavesdrop, attack passwords or simply to force the use of another, usually more expensive access point.\n\n==Non-standard 802.11 extensions and equipment==\n{{Main|802.11 non-standard equipment}}\n\nMany companies implement wireless networking equipment with non-IEEE standard 802.11 extensions either by implementing proprietary or draft features.
