Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins ([[synaptotagmin]]) on synaptic vesicles, triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent [[neurotransmitter]] release from the motor neuron into the [[synaptic cleft]]. In [[vertebrates]], motor neurons release [[acetylcholine]] (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAChRs) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the [[sarcolemma]]. nAChRs are [[ionotropic]] receptors, meaning they serve as [[ligand]]-gated [[ion channels]]. The binding of ACh to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber, causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction.\n\n[[Neuromuscular junction disease]]s can be of [[genetic disorder|genetic]] and [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] origin.

The acetylcholine quantum diffuses through the acetylcholinesterase meshwork, where the high local transmitter concentration occupies all of the binding sites on the enzyme in its path.  The acetylcholine that reaches the endplate activates ~2,000 acetylcholine receptors, opening their ion channels which permits sodium ions to move into the endplate producing a depolarization of ~0.5 mV known as a miniature endplate potential (MEPP). By the time the acetylcholine is released from the receptors the acetylcholinesterase has destroyed its bound ACh, which takes about ~0.16 ms,  and hence is available to destroy the  ACh released from the receptors.\n\nWhen the motor nerve is stimulated there is a delay of only 0.5 to 0.8 msec between the arrival of the nerve impulse in the motor nerve terminals and the first response of the endplate <ref>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Bernard|title=Nerve, muscle, and synapse|date=1966|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=114}}</ref>  The arrival of the motor nerve [[action potential]] at the presynaptic neuron terminal opens [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s and Ca<sup>2+</sup> [[ions]] flow from the extracellular fluid into the presynaptic neuron's [[cytosol]].

The endplate depolarization by the released acetylcholine is called an endplate potential (EPP). The EPP is accomplished when ACh binds the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) at the motor end plate, and causes an influx of sodium ions.

In vertebrate animals, the acetylcholine receptor subtype that is found at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles is the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] (nAChR), which is a [[ligand-gated ion channel]].  Each subunit of this receptor has a characteristic \"cys-loop\", which is composed of a [[cysteine]] residue followed by 13 [[amino acid]] residues and another cysteine residue. The two cysteine residues form a [[disulfide bond|disulfide linkage]] which results in the \"cys-loop\" receptor that is capable of binding acetylcholine and other ligands.  These cys-loop receptors are found only in [[eukaryotes]], but [[prokaryotes]] possess ACh receptors with similar properties.<ref name=\"Sine\" />  Not all species use a [[cholinergic]] neuromuscular junction; e.g. [[crayfish]] and fruit flies have a [[glutamic acid|glutamatergic]] neuromuscular junction.<ref name=\"Text\" />\n\nAChRs at the skeletal neuromuscular junction form heteropentamers composed of two \u03b1, one \u03b2, one \u025b, and one \u03b4 subunits.<ref>miller's anaesthesia, 7th edition.</ref>  When a single ACh ligand binds to one of the \u03b1 subunits of the ACh receptor it induces a [[conformational change]] at the interface with the second AChR \u03b1 subunit.

With this technique, a microelectrode was placed inside the motor endplate of the muscle fiber, and a micropipette filled with acetylcholine (ACh) is placed directly in front of the endplate in the synaptic cleft.  A positive voltage was applied to the tip of the micropipette, which caused a burst of positively charged ACh molecules to be released from the pipette. These ligands flowed into the space representing the synaptic cleft and bound to AChRs.  The intracellular microelectrode monitored the [[amplitude]] of the [[depolarization]] of the motor endplate in response to ACh binding to nicotinic (ionotropic) receptors.  Katz and del Castillo showed that the amplitude of the depolarization ([[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]) depended on the proximity of the micropipette releasing the ACh ions to the endplate.  The farther the micropipette was from the motor endplate, the smaller the depolarization was in the muscle fiber.  This allowed the researchers to determine that the nicotinic receptors were localized to the motor endplate in high density.<ref name=\"Text\" /><ref name=\"Sine\" />\n\nToxins are also used to determine the location of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. [[alpha-bungarotoxin|\u03b1-Bungarotoxin]] is a toxin found in the snake species [[Bungarus multicinctus]] that acts as an ACh antagonist and binds to AChRs irreversibly.

It functions very similarly to botunlinum neurotoxin (BoNT) by attaching and endocytosing into the presynaptic nerve terminal and interfering with SNARE protein complexes. It differs from BoNT in a few ways, most apparently in its end state, wherein tetanospasmin demonstrates a rigid / [[spastic paralysis]] as opposed to the flaccid paralysis demonstrated with BoNT.\n\n===Latrotoxin===\n[[Latrotoxin]] (\u03b1-Latrotoxin) found in venom of widow spiders also affects the neuromuscular junction by causing the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic cell. Mechanisms of action include binding to receptors on the presynaptic cell activating the [[IP3/DAG pathway]] and release of calcium from intracellular stores and pore formation resulting in influx of calcium ions directly. Either mechanism causes increased calcium in presynaptic cell, which then leads to release of synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine. Latrotoxin causes pain, muscle contraction and if untreated potentially paralysis and death.\n\n===Snake venom===\nSnake venoms act as toxins at the neuromuscular junction and can induce weakness and [[paralysis]].

The majority of these neurotoxins act by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, into the synapse between neurons. However, some of these toxins have also been known to enhance neurotransmitter release. Those that inhibit neurotransmitter release create a [[neuromuscular blockade]] that prevents signaling molecules from reaching their postsynaptic target receptors. In doing so, the victim of these snake bite suffer from profound weakness. Such neurotoxins do not respond well to anti-venoms. After one hour of inoculation of these toxins, including notexin and [[taipoxin]], many of the affected nerve terminals show signs of irreversible physical damage, leaving them devoid of any [[synaptic vesicle]]s.<ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\nPostsynaptic neurotoxins, otherwise known as \u03b1-neurotoxins, act oppositely to the presynaptic neurotoxins by binding to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. This prevents interaction between the acetylcholine released by the presynaptic terminal and the receptors on the postsynaptic cell. In effect, the opening of sodium channels associated with these acetylcholine receptors is prohibited, resulting in a neuromuscular blockade, similar to the effects seen due to presynaptic neurotoxins. This causes paralysis in the muscles involved in the affected junctions. Unlike presynaptic neurotoxins, postsynaptic toxins are more easily affected by anti-venoms, which accelerate the dissociation of the toxin from the receptors, ultimately causing a reversal of paralysis. These neurotoxins experimentally and qualitatively aid in the study of acetylcholine receptor [[density]] and [[Cell turnover|turnover]], as well as in studies observing the direction of [[antibodies]] toward the affected acetylcholine receptors in patients diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\n==Diseases==\n{{main|Neuromuscular junction disease}}\nAny [[Disease|disorder]] that compromises the synaptic transmission between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is categorized under the umbrella term of [[neuromuscular disease]]s.

In [[vertebrates]], motor neurons release [[acetylcholine]] (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAChRs) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the [[sarcolemma]]. nAChRs are [[ionotropic]] receptors, meaning they serve as [[ligand]]-gated [[ion channels]].

The acetylcholine quantum diffuses through the acetylcholinesterase meshwork, where the high local transmitter concentration occupies all of the binding sites on the enzyme in its path.  The acetylcholine that reaches the endplate activates ~2,000 acetylcholine receptors, opening their ion channels which permits sodium ions to move into the endplate producing a depolarization of ~0.5 mV known as a miniature endplate potential (MEPP).

With this technique, a microelectrode was placed inside the motor endplate of the muscle fiber, and a micropipette filled with acetylcholine (ACh) is placed directly in front of the endplate in the synaptic cleft.  A positive voltage was applied to the tip of the micropipette, which caused a burst of positively charged ACh molecules to be released from the pipette. These ligands flowed into the space representing the synaptic cleft and bound to AChRs.  The intracellular microelectrode monitored the [[amplitude]] of the [[depolarization]] of the motor endplate in response to ACh binding to nicotinic (ionotropic) receptors.  Katz and del Castillo showed that the amplitude of the depolarization ([[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]) depended on the proximity of the micropipette releasing the ACh ions to the endplate.  The farther the micropipette was from the motor endplate, the smaller the depolarization was in the muscle fiber.  This allowed the researchers to determine that the nicotinic receptors were localized to the motor endplate in high density.<ref name=\"Text\" /><ref name=\"Sine\" />\n\nToxins are also used to determine the location of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. [[alpha-bungarotoxin|\u03b1-Bungarotoxin]] is a toxin found in the snake species [[Bungarus multicinctus]] that acts as an ACh antagonist and binds to AChRs irreversibly.  By coupling assayable enzymes such as [[horseradish peroxidase]] (HRP) or fluorescent proteins such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) to the \u03b1-bungarotoxin, AChRs can be visualized and quantified.<ref name=\"Text\" />\n\n==Toxins that affect the neuromuscular junction==\n\n===Nerve gases===\nNerve gases and liquor damage this area.\n[[File:Dr_Braun_Performs_a_Botox_Injection_(4035273577).jpg|thumb|303x303px|[[Botulinum toxin]] injected in human face]]\n\n=== Botulinum toxin ===\n[[Botulinum toxin]] (aka botulinum neurotoxin, BoNT, and sold under the trade name Botox) inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by interfering with SNARE proteins.<ref name=\"Text\" /> This toxin crosses into the nerve terminal through the process of [[endocytosis]] and subsequently interferes with SNARE proteins, which are necessary for ACh release. By doing so, it induces a transient [[flaccid paralysis]] and chemical denervation localized to the striated muscle that it has affected. The inhibition of the ACh release does not set in until approximately two weeks after the injection is made. Three months after the inhibition occurs, neuronal activity begins to regain partial function, and six months, complete neuronal function is regained.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Papapetropoulos S, Singer C |title=Botulinum toxin in movement disorders |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=183\u201394 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17390263 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-971171 }}</ref>\n\n===Tetanus toxin===\nTetanus toxin, also known as [[tetanospasmin]] is a potent neurotoxin produced by ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' and causes the disease state, tetanus. The LD<sub>50</sub> of this toxin has been measured to be approximately 1&nbsp;ng/kg, making it second only to Botulinum toxin D as the deadliest toxin in the world. It functions very similarly to botunlinum neurotoxin (BoNT) by attaching and endocytosing into the presynaptic nerve terminal and interfering with SNARE protein complexes. It differs from BoNT in a few ways, most apparently in its end state, wherein tetanospasmin demonstrates a rigid / [[spastic paralysis]] as opposed to the flaccid paralysis demonstrated with BoNT.\n\n===Latrotoxin===\n[[Latrotoxin]] (\u03b1-Latrotoxin) found in venom of widow spiders also affects the neuromuscular junction by causing the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic cell. Mechanisms of action include binding to receptors on the presynaptic cell activating the [[IP3/DAG pathway]] and release of calcium from intracellular stores and pore formation resulting in influx of calcium ions directly. Either mechanism causes increased calcium in presynaptic cell, which then leads to release of synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine. Latrotoxin causes pain, muscle contraction and if untreated potentially paralysis and death.\n\n===Snake venom===\nSnake venoms act as toxins at the neuromuscular junction and can induce weakness and [[paralysis]]. Venoms can act as both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins.<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis RL, Gutmann L |title=Snake venoms and the neuromuscular junction |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=175\u20139 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15257514 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-830904 }}</ref>\n\nPresynaptic neurotoxins, commonly known as \u03b2-neurotoxins, affect the presynaptic regions of the neuromuscular junction. The majority of these neurotoxins act by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, into the synapse between neurons. However, some of these toxins have also been known to enhance neurotransmitter release. Those that inhibit neurotransmitter release create a [[neuromuscular blockade]] that prevents signaling molecules from reaching their postsynaptic target receptors. In doing so, the victim of these snake bite suffer from profound weakness. Such neurotoxins do not respond well to anti-venoms. After one hour of inoculation of these toxins, including notexin and [[taipoxin]], many of the affected nerve terminals show signs of irreversible physical damage, leaving them devoid of any [[synaptic vesicle]]s.<ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\nPostsynaptic neurotoxins, otherwise known as \u03b1-neurotoxins, act oppositely to the presynaptic neurotoxins by binding to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. This prevents interaction between the acetylcholine released by the presynaptic terminal and the receptors on the postsynaptic cell. In effect, the opening of sodium channels associated with these acetylcholine receptors is prohibited, resulting in a neuromuscular blockade, similar to the effects seen due to presynaptic neurotoxins. This causes paralysis in the muscles involved in the affected junctions. Unlike presynaptic neurotoxins, postsynaptic toxins are more easily affected by anti-venoms, which accelerate the dissociation of the toxin from the receptors, ultimately causing a reversal of paralysis. These neurotoxins experimentally and qualitatively aid in the study of acetylcholine receptor [[density]] and [[Cell turnover|turnover]], as well as in studies observing the direction of [[antibodies]] toward the affected acetylcholine receptors in patients diagnosed with [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref name=\"Lewis\" />\n\n==Diseases==\n{{main|Neuromuscular junction disease}}\nAny [[Disease|disorder]] that compromises the synaptic transmission between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is categorized under the umbrella term of [[neuromuscular disease]]s. These disorders can be [[Heredity|inherited]] or acquired and can vary in their severity and mortality. In general, most of these disorders tend to be caused by mutations or autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders, in the case of neuromuscular diseases, tend to be [[humoral]] mediated, [[B cell]] mediated, and result in an [[antibody]] improperly created against a motor neuron or muscle fiber protein that interferes with synaptic transmission or signaling.\n\n===Autoimmune===\n\n====Myasthenia gravis====\n[[Myasthenia gravis]] is an autoimmune disorder where the body makes antibodies against either the acetylcholine receptor (AchR) (in 80% of cases), or against postsynaptic muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) (0\u201310% of cases). In seronegative myasthenia gravis [[low density lipoprotein]] receptor-related protein 4 is targeted by [[IgG1]], which acts as a competitive inhibitor of its ligand, preventing the ligand from binding its receptor. It is not known if seronegative myasthenia gravis will respond to standard therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Finsterer J, Papi&#x107; L, Auer-Grumbach M |title=Motor neuron, nerve, and neuromuscular junction disease |journal=Curr.

MG can be transferred from the mother to the fetus by the movement of AChR antibodies through the [[placenta]]. Signs of this disease at birth include weakness, which responds to anticholinesterase medications, as well as fetal akinesia, or the lack of fetal movement. This form of the disease is transient, lasting for about three months. However, in some cases, neonatal MG can lead to other health effects, such as arthrogryposis and even fetal death. These conditions are thought to be initiated when maternal AChR antibodies are directed to the [[fetal]] AChR and can last until the 33rd week of [[gestation]], when the \u03b3 subunit of AChR is replaced by the \u03b5 subunit.<ref name=\"Newsom\">{{cite journal |author=Newsom-Davis J |title=The emerging diversity of neuromuscular junction disorders |journal=Acta Myol |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=5\u201310 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17915563 |pmc=2949330 }}</ref>\n\n====Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome====\n[[Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction.

Rather than causing muscle weakness, NMT leads to the hyperexcitation of motor nerves. NMT causes this hyperexcitation by producing longer depolarizations by down-regulating [[voltage-gated potassium channel]]s, which causes greater neurotransmitter release and repetitive firing. This increase in rate of firing leads to more active transmission and as a result, greater muscular activity in the affected individual. NMT is also believed to be of [[autoimmune]] origin due to its associations with autoimmune symptoms in the individual affected.<ref name=\"Newsom\" />\n\n===Genetic===\n\n====Congenital myasthenic syndromes====\n[[Congenital myasthenic syndrome]]s (CMS) are very similar to both MG and LEMS in their functions, but the primary difference between CMS and those diseases is that CMS is of genetic origins. Specifically, these syndromes are diseases incurred due to mutations, typically [[recessive]], in 1 of at least 10 genes that affect presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic proteins in the neuromuscular junction. Such mutations usually arise in the \u03b5-subunit of AChR,<ref name=\"Newsom\" /> thereby affecting the kinetics and expression of the receptor itself.  Single nucleotide substitutions or deletions may cause loss of function in the subunit. Other [[mutation]]s, such as those affecting [[acetylcholinesterase]] and [[acetyltransferase]], can also cause the expression of CMS, with the latter being associated specifically with episodic [[apnea]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harper CM |title=Congenital myasthenic syndromes |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=111\u201323 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15229798 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-829592 }}</ref> These syndromes can present themselves at different times within the life of an individual.

The city is situated geographically within [[Simcoe County]], however it is a [[Independent city|politically independent]] single-tier municipality. It is within the historically significant [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of Central Ontario, and is part of the [[Golden Horseshoe|Greater Golden Horseshoe]], a densely populated and industrialised sub-region of Ontario. As of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]], the city's population was 141,434 making it the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|34th largest]] in Canada in terms of population proper. The Barrie [[Census metropolitan areas|census metropolitan area]] (CMA) as of the same census had a population of 197,059 residents, making it the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|21st largest CMA in Canada]]. The city itself has seen significant growth in recent decades due to its emergence as a [[bedroom community]] for that of [[Toronto]]. The affordability of housing and robust job market perhaps contribute to a Toronto buyer's appeasement with Barrie. [[GO Transit]] offers daily service to and from the [[Greater Toronto Area]] from two stations in the city. Barrie is located {{convert|85|km|mi}} north of Toronto, {{convert|355|km|mi}} northeast of [[Detroit]] and {{convert|335|km|mi}} west of [[Ottawa]]. This represents the city's highly centralised and historically advantageous situation, providing an ease of access to major centres and airports across the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.placestogrow.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9&Itemid=14 |title=Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure |website=Placestogrow.ca |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe Barrie area was first settled during the [[War of 1812]] as a key supply depot for British forces. It would be named 20 years later after Sir [[Robert Barrie]], who frequently commanded forces through the region. The 1980s and 1990s would be a period of immense growth for Barrie, with the population tripling in the span of twenty-five years. In 1981, the city had a population of 38,423; in 2006, Barrie had 128,430 residents living within city limits. Barrie's ongoing success would be punctuated by high-rise condominium development along Kempenfelt Bay, instigating a sort of downtown renaissance. Great investment by the city into their beachfront amenities would culminate in Barrie becoming a prime tourist destination. With several ski resorts in the vicinity and a picturesque waterfront, Barrie is known not just for its tourism, but also as the 'Gateway to Cottage Country'.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\">{{cite web |title=Barrie Wards Map |publisher=City of Barrie |url=https://barrie.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3369de0cb238453ba0376b9c392e2b6d }}</ref> The city's economy is diverse, with [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[information technology]] and [[manufacturing]] all prevalent sectors. The [[Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre]] is Barrie's largest employer, with nearly 3,000 workers. [[Retail]] in the city has flourished too in recent decades, bolstered by the completion of [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] in 2008. Barrie experiences cold, snowy winters with an average January minimum temperature of {{convert|-12.4|C}}. Summers are hot and humid, with an average July maximum temperature of {{convert|26.3|C}}.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAt its inception, Barrie was an establishment of houses and warehouses at the foot of the [[Nine Mile Portage]] from [[Kempenfelt Bay]] to [[Fort Willow]], an aboriginal transportation route that existed centuries before Europeans arrived in [[Simcoe County]]. The portage linked Kempenfelt Bay through Willow Creek, connecting [[Lake Simcoe]] to the [[Nottawasaga River]] which flows into [[Georgian Bay]] off Lake Huron. Barrie played an integral role in the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, the city became a [[supply depot]] for British forces and in addition, the Nine Mile Portage was adopted by the British military as a key piece of their supply line which provided a strategic path for communication, personnel and vital supplies and equipment to and from Fort Willow and Georgian Bay/[[Lake Huron]]. Today, the Nine Mile Portage is marked by signs along roads in Barrie and in [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater Township]]. The scenic path from Memorial Square to Fort Willow is accessible to visitors year-round. The city was named in 1833 after [[Robert Barrie|Sir Robert Barrie]], who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada and frequently commanded forces through the city and along the Nine Mile Portage. Barrie was also the final destination for a branch of the [[Underground Railroad]]. In the mid-19th century, this network of secret routes allowed many American slaves to enter Barrie and the surrounding area. This contributed to the development (and name) of nearby [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]]. In 1846, the population of Barrie was roughly 500, mostly from England, Ireland and Scotland. A private school, three churches, a brick courthouse and a limestone jail, (built in 1842), were in operation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Simcoe County Court-House and Gaol |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe25.html |publisher=Ontario's Historical Plaques |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> Local businesses included three [[tavern]]s, six stores, three [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], a wagon maker, a bakery, a cabinet maker and six shoemakers, as well as a bank.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

It was a station of the [[Northern Railway of Canada|Northern Railway]] and was situated on Lake Simcoe's western arm, known as Kempenfelt Bay. Throughout the latter of the 19th century, [[Steamship]]s ran from Barrie to the [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka Territory]], [[Orillia, Ontario|Orillia]] and other communities and stages were taking passengers to [[Penetanguishene]].<ref>The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869</ref> The period of 1870 to 1890 defined Barrie's downtown development with a series of raging fires that sequentially destroyed multiple landmarks, giving rise to the moniker that Barrie was \"among the best burning towns in Canada.\" <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.simcoe.com/news-story/2069137-huge-fires-defined-barrie-s-downtown-development/|title=Huge fires defined Barrie\u2019s downtown development|date=2007-12-07|website=Simcoe.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> Many local businesses like breweries, tanneries and sawmills depended on fire to operate, endangering the ramshackle assortment of wooden homes and buildings that made up the city centre. One of the most destructive fires came in mid-1875, when the entire section north of Dunlop to Collier, bounded by Clapperton and Owen Streets, was reduced to ash, destroying around 20 local businesses. After this period, the modern streets and buildings of Barrie began to take form in a massive rebuilding process. Other landmarks to eventually burn down over the years include the Barrie Opera House (1926), The Queen's Hotel (1915) and two of Barrie's largest and most prominent companies; the Sevigny Carriage Shop and the Anderton Brewery in 1916.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the midst of [[World War I]], dedicated residents of Barrie helped to hastily construct [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] (CFB Borden) as a means of additional support and to serve as a major training centre of [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] battalions. The base would open on July 11, 1916, and since then has become the largest Canadian Forces Base in the country, playing a paramount role through the remainder of the war, and throughout history. During [[World War II]], the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] named a {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} {{HMCS|Barrie}}. On September 7, 1977, a private aircraft dropped to an altitude of {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} in dense fog and struck the {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on|0}} [[CKVR-TV]] tower, killing all five occupants aboard the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station's {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on|0}} auxiliary tower was also destroyed and damage had been inflicted on the roof of the main studio. CKVR was back on the air in the weeks following using a temporary {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on|0}} tower; a power reduction of nearly 40,000 watts occurred upon their return to the air on September 19 at 8:55&nbsp;p.m. The new 1,000-foot tower was rebuilt in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On May 31, 1985, an [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornado struck Barrie, touching down in [[Essa Township]], less than 10 kilometres (6.2&nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Highway 400]] and the Barrie city limits. At approximately 4:00 PM, all electrical power in Barrie went out, as the Grand Valley/Tottenham tornado took out the main hydro transformers southwest of the city. It then entered the southern part of Barrie shortly before 5:00pm, causing devastating damage in the subdivisions within its immediate path. The visibility in the general vicinity had been reduced drastically as the tornado was cloaked in heavy rain and dust. It became known as one of the most [[1985 Barrie tornado outbreak|violent and deadliest tornadoes]] in Canadian history, claiming the lives of eight within the city and injuring over 155 people. A [[state of emergency]] had been issued for the city that evening, with services from surrounding municipalities being required as the weeks following wore on. Between June 12-13, 1987, a sculpture called ''[[Spirit Catcher]]'' by [[Ron Baird]] was moved to Barrie from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where it had been exhibited as part of [[Expo '86]]. The sculpture was erected permanently at the foot of Maple Avenue on the shore of Kempenfelt Bay and has since become a principal facet in the Barrie city skyline and tourism. However, with the re-development along the waterfront and Lakeshore Drive, the city is considering moving the Spirit Catcher to a gravel outcropping at the foot of Bayfield Street. On January 12, 2004, the former [[Molson Brewery]] in south Barrie was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million; at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada's history. Barrie's [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] (formerly Molson Park) was chosen to host [[live8|Live 8]] Canada on July 2, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |title=Barrie, Ont. to host Canadian edition of Live 8 |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226043121/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |archivedate=December 26, 2005 |df= }}</ref> The overall success of the concert contributed to a plan to convert the prior [[Molson Park]] lands into a commercial district. On October 31, 2006, commercial real estate developers North American Acquisition Inc (NAA), a subsidiary of North American Development Group, LLC (NADG) won an [[Ontario Municipal Board]] (OMB) appeal of a rezoning application that had been previously denied by the City of Barrie to rezone the new Park Place lands from general industrial to business park zones, and general commercial or mixed employment. The proposal was followed by several concepts, including a [[box store]] abstraction originally conceived in 2002. The development of the lands was halted temporarily in 2009 due to disputes with the past OMB appeal, and construction of the complex would resume in 2010. An explosion in the Royal Thai restaurant, housed in the landmark Wellington Hotel at the \"Five Points\" intersection in downtown Barrie, occurred at 11:20pm on December 6, 2007. The fire quickly spread to several neighbouring buildings and firefighters battled the blaze well into the following morning, requiring assistance from other Simcoe County fire services. Officials estimated the damages to be in the millions. The 100-year-old Wellington Hotel building collapsed later in the morning.<ref name=\"canada.com\">{{cite web   |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332 |title=Massive blaze destroys six buildings in Barrie |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071209023032/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332| archivedate= December 9, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"ctv.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome |title=Fire destroys historic buildings in Barrie, Ont.\n |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210055740/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome| archivedate= December 10, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> On February 17, 2008, two people were charged in connection with the fire after the Ontario Fire Marshal's office concluded the explosion and subsequent fire were the result of arson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|title=Pair charged in Barrie fire had ties to destroyed restaurant|publisher=Canoe.ca CNEWS|accessdate=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709132558/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|archive-date=July 9, 2012|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nBarrie is located in the central portion of Southern Ontario, approximately {{convert|abbr=on|80|km}} north of [[Toronto]], {{convert|abbr=on|303|km}} south southeast of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and {{convert|abbr=on|412|km}} west southwest of [[Ottawa]], within the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] subregion. It is additionally located approximately {{convert|abbr=on|38|km}} southeast of the sought-after summertime destination, [[Wasaga Beach]] and {{convert|abbr=on|112|km}} south of the [[Muskoka District Municipality]] and cottage country, accessible via Highways [[Highway 26 (Ontario)|26]], [[Ontario Highway 400|400]] and [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|11]]. Barrie's historic downtown area is situated in a distinct curved or wrapped valley, surrounding the western edge of Kempenfelt Bay. The terrain is generally flat near the city's centre, with small but relevant hills and valleys being prominent astride the aforementioned. Moving up the valley slopes toward the city's north and south ends and the terrain can be rather steep in some areas. The earth flattens considerably just outside the city's limits to the south and northeast, especially beyond the airport where vast expanses of vegetation and farmland are most notable. The land surrounding Barrie is rich with agricultural activity. Barrie falls into Plant Hardiness Zone 5b. The city does not have any major rivers within its limits but does have numerous creeks and streams, most of which empty into Kempenfelt Bay.\n\n=== Interurban communities ===\n[[File:Barrie Condos and Houses in Winter.jpg|thumb|right|Residential condominiums and houses in Barrie after a snowfall]]\n* Letitia Heights\n* Cundles\n* Ardagh Bluffs\n* The Grove\n* Eastview\n* Holly\n* Downtown\n* Painswick\n* Allandale\n* Minet's Point\n\n=== Expansion ===\nBarrie has been designated an Urban Growth Centre by the Province of Ontario (Places to Grow Simcoe Area, 2009). Its population growth, largely due to its emergence as a bedroom community for Toronto, has given rise to the development of numerous subdivisions on the southern side of the city.

The city is situated on Lake Simcoe, a climatically insignificant body of water. Barrie is located in close proximity to [[Georgian Bay]], which, along with the [[Great Lakes]], act as a \"buffer\" of sorts, moderating year-round temperatures to a fair extent, while combined with the [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]] can spawn blinding snow squalls in the winter, and strong thunderstorms in the spring and summer. The average July maximum in Barrie is {{convert|26.3|C|0}}, while the average January minimum is {{convert|-12.4|C|0}}. Barrie experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons, similar to [[Toronto]], the city's southern neighbour. Barrie does not, however, see the effects of [[diurnal temperature variation]], owing to its northerly location and rural outskirts. The city can be subject of noticeably cooler afternoons in the spring and early summer, due to the influence of a [[lake breeze]] since nearby lakes, such as Lake Huron, are cool relative to the air during these seasons. These aforementioned \"lake breezes\" mostly occur throughout the summer, bringing much-needed relief on hot days. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include constant [[lake-effect snow]] in the winter, fog and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as [[seasonal lag]]. Winters are typically cold with frequent snow. During the winter months, temperatures are usually below {{convert|0|C|0}}. Barrie winters sometimes feature cold snaps when maximum temperatures remain below {{convert|-10|C|0}}, often made to feel colder by a biting [[wind chill]]. Occasionally, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-25|C|0}}. Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain, can disrupt work and travel schedules, while accumulating snow can fall anytime from late-October until mid-April. However, on the contrary, mild bouts also occur in most winters, melting any accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by very warm temperatures and muggy conditions. Daytime temperatures are normally above {{convert|20|C|0}}, and often rise above {{convert|30|C|0}}. However, they can sometimes surpass {{convert|35|C|0}}, accompanied by high humidity. The short transitional seasons of spring and autumn have generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating periods of dry and wet. Daytime temperatures average around {{convert|10 to 12|C|0}} during these seasons. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. Barrie is known for heavy thunderstorm activity in the late spring and summer months, all due to its location within a [[Convergence zone|convergence of breezes]] originating from Georgian Bay, [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Erie]]. There can be short periods of dry weather, but [[drought]]-like conditions are rare. The average yearly precipitation is about {{convert|932|mm|0}}, with an average annual snowfall of about {{convert|223|cm|0}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The highest temperature ever recorded in Barrie was {{convert|38.9|C|0}} on July 5, 1911.<ref name=\"July 1911\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=7&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1911\n| title = July 1911\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-38.9|C|0}} on January 8, 1866.<ref name=\"January 1866\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=1&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1866\n| title = January 1866\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| open         =  <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template permanently open, and remove the hide button.

In the 2016 census, the city's population increased to 141,434, a growth of 3.9% over the 2011 population of 136,063. The median age is 38.5 years, somewhat lower than the provincial average of 39.0 years.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> The [[census metropolitan area]] of Barrie is 197,059 and consists of the city proper; the town of [[Innisfil]] directly to the south, west of [[Lake Simcoe]]'s southern arm (population 36,566); and the township of [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]] in the agricultural north (population 19,059). Barrie has a total land area of {{convert|898.02|sqkm}} in its metropolitan area, with a significant portion of the precinct being farmland or grassland. Roughly 40% of the Barrie [[census metropolitan area]] is developed land. In the 2016 census, Barrie's \"[[bedroom community]]\" for that of the city of Toronto distinction would be represented once again in another census by its demography. Barrie's median household income was $113,575, far higher than Ontario's median of $74,287, potentially depicting the higher-paying occupations available in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] as opposed to those offered within city limits.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> Barrie's economic stature is not lacking, however several jobs are offered across different fields locally. Barrie's average commute time is the third highest in Ontario at 59 minutes, also possibly displaying the populous' tendency to work abroad in the more desirable and opportunity-oriented south.

Barrie's historic downtown and [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] are at the heart of its tourism industry. Downtown Barrie hosts many older buildings that have been kept up over the years or given new facades that exemplify their historical importance.  Many speciality shops, boutiques, pubs and restaurants are located throughout downtown Barrie, most notably along Dunlop Street East.  Downtown Barrie is becoming well known for its fashion boutiques, local art, live theatre, indie-music and nightlife scenes. In addition, downtown Barrie is home to numerous annual festivals and events such as The Barrie Waterfront Festival, Barrielicious, Winterfest, Celebrate Barrie, Ecofest, Jazz & Blues Festival, Promenade Days, Ribfest and Craft Beer Show, Caribfest, Lawnchair Luminata, [[Kempenfest]], The New Music Festival, [[Barrie Film Festival]], Santa Claus Parade and the New Year's Countdown. In the summer months, the city boasts several beaches including Minet's Point Beach, Johnsons Beach, The Gables, Tyndale Beach, and Centennial Beach. Boating in also very popular in Kempenfelt Bay and Lake Simcoe as it connects to the [[Trent Severn Waterway]]. In 2011, Barrie's waterfront was under redevelopment, with the relocation of several roadways to provide more greenspace and parkland along the lakeshore. There are numerous winter recreation activities and facilities in the surrounding area, including skiing, snow tubing and snowboarding resorts, snowmobile trails and ice fishing. Recreational activities include skiing at nearby [[Horseshoe Resort]], [[Snow Valley (ski area)|Snow Valley]], [[Mount St. Louis Moonstone]] and [[Blue Mountain (ski resort)|Blue Mountain]].\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n[[File:Barrie Canada Day Fireworks.png|thumb|Fireworks over Kempenfelt Bay during Barrie's [[Canada Day]] celebrations]]\nBarrie is home to vibrant performing and fine arts scenes.  There are a number of live performance companies including Theatre by the Bay, Talk Is Free Theatre and the Huronia Symphony. Grove Park Home is the practice hall for On-Stage Performance Group which performs in [[Cookstown, Ontario|Cookstown]]. The Strolling Youth Players and the Kempenfelt Community Players also all perform in Barrie. In addition, an annual live concert series is hosted by Georgian College. There are two main performing arts venues in the city: the Five Points Theatre, and the Georgian Theatre. Originally, the Five Points Theatre was known as The Mady Centre For The Performing Arts, but it was renamed in January 2018. It is located in Barrie's downtown at the Five Points intersection and was completed in 2011. This modern facility is home to many professional and amateur cultural productions, film screenings, theatrical plays, concerts, dance recitals and other performances. It is also the main venue for Theatre by the Bay and the Talk Is Free Theatre Companies. The venue features a flexible stage area with lighting and sound for professional theatre, music, dance, and other presentations, an automated riser/seating system with capacity for 120-200 seats and a sprung performance floor. The Georgian Theatre is a professional performing arts facility located in Barrie's north end on the campus of Georgian College. The theatre features a proscenium stage, sound, lights, fly gallery and seating for 427 on the main level with three pods which can be used to increase the seating capacity to 690. The Theatre is used for both theatrical and non-theatrical activity including conferences and seminars.\n\n[[File:Spiritcatcher barrie wide.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ron Baird's ''The [[Spirit Catcher]]'' (1986), installed along the waterfront in Barrie]]\nThe prominent [[MacLaren Art Centre]] is located in Barrie. This is an innovative art gallery that inspired the \"Art City\" project, which has had many different large sculptures installed around the city. These can be found in parks and along the scenic waterfront. The MacLaren Art Centre is a large and beautiful building on Mulcaster Street in downtown Barrie. International and Canadian artists display in the three main galleries. A permanent collection of art is growing, the Radio Cafe, a gift shop, film nights, speakers, theatre and many children's programs and community art projects are just a small part of the gallery's mandate. The gallery contributes overall to a vibrant arts community in the Barrie area with it leading edge arts. Barrie is also home to many independent galleries and studios. A concentration of independent galleries, studios and boutiques is located in Lakeshore Mews. This area is located behind the downtown's Dunlop Street and provides a location where one-of-a-kind items can be purchased. Lakeshore Mews artists also organize the annual \"Arts ce Soir\"; an all-night contemporary art event in celebration of visual, musical, theatrical and literary art. In addition, a studio tour in the Barrie/Orillia area takes place on the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Canadian Thanksgiving]] weekend every year. It is called the Images Studio Tour and has over 25 artists on average. The self-guided tour allows people to visit artists in their working studio and see how the art is created while enjoying the beautiful fall colours driving through the two cities and the countryside. Potters, jewellers, painters, textile artists and fashion designers make up a few of the disciplines of the talents on display. Barrie is also home to [[Kempenfest]]; one of the largest outdoor arts and crafts celebrations in Ontario. This festival occurs annually over the August long weekend and features over 300 artisans, an antique show, food demonstrations, children's activities and live entertainment, including an indie-music stage. Some of the main arts and culture groups in the city include:\n* Barrie Art Club\n* Barrie Concert Band<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Concert Band|url=http://www.barrieconcertband.org/|website=Barrieconcertband.org|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Barrie Film Festival]]\n* Barrie Folk Society<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Folk Society|url=http://www.barriefolk.com/|website=Barriefolk.com|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref>\n* Campus Gallery\n* Caribbean Culture Institute\n* Huronia Symphony Orchestra<ref>{{cite web|title=Huronia Symphony Orchestra|url=http://huroniasymphony.ca/|website=Huroniasymphony.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Kempenfelt Community Players\n* King Edward Choir<ref>{{cite web|title=King Edward Choir|url=http://www.kingedwardchoir.ca/|website=Kingedwardchoir.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lyrica Chamber Choir\n* Simcoe Contemporary Dancers\n* Talk Is Free Theatre\n* Theatre By The Bay\n* Kiwanis\n\n== Attractions ==\nBarrie has numerous recreational venues and community centres throughout the city.\n* Allandale Recreation Centre\n* [[Barrie Community Sports Complex]]\n* [https://www.barrielibrary.ca/ Barrie Public Library]\n* [[Barrie Uptown Theater]]\n* Dorian Parker Centre\n* East Bayfield Community Centre\n* Eastview Arena\n* Holly Community Centre\n* Lampman Park\n* Lampman Lane Community Centre\n* Parkview Community Centre\n* Southshore Community Centre\n* Victoria Village\n* YMCA of Barrie\n\n== Sports ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

By the time of the [[1837 Rebellion]], Simcoe County had a sufficient population to form a [[battalion]] of [[Militia|Sedentary Militia]] of almost 600 strong. This battalion was involved in marching suspected rebels down Yonge Street to Toronto in order to face justice. By 1855, Barrie was home to an [[Company (military unit)|independent company]] of Rifle Company of militia, followed in 1863 by a company of Infantry. These companies served during the [[Fenian Raids]]. With the [[Militia Act of 1866]], the companies in Barrie were respectively organized as Number 1 and Number 5 companies, in the newly formed 35th Battalion of Infantry (Simcoe Foresters), gazetted on September 14, 1866. In 1885, four companies the 35th Simcoe Foresters, including those from Barrie, formed with four companies from the 12th York Battalion to form the York-Simcoe Battalion. This specially raised battalion served in Western Canada during the [[Northwest Rebellion]], under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.E. O'Brien of [[Shanty Bay]], Ontario. For its efforts, The Simcoe Foresters received its first [[Battle Honour]] \"Northwest Canada 1885.\" Citizens of Barrie would next volunteer for military service during the [[Boer War]] in South Africa 1899\u20131902. It was during this conflict that at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] the citizens of Barrie and The Simcoe Foresters suffered their first fatal casualty, Private James Halkett Findlay. Private Findlay was killed-in-action on February 18, 1900, while serving with C Company of the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] of Infantry. In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out and many citizens of Barrie were quick to volunteer for service overseas with The Simcoe Foresters. Late the following year, the Regiment was tasked with raising two overseas battalions, the [[157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]] and the [[177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]]. In the spring of 1916, the Barrie and [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] companies of the 157th Battalion began clearing the land and construction of the new military camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain&nbsp;\u2014 Camp Borden (now [[CFB Borden]]). This began Barrie's long friendship with the Base, hence the reason CFB Borden was used for ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 2]]'' and ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 5]].'' With a re-organization of the Canadian Militia between the two world wars, The Simcoe Foresters, headquartered in Barrie, were amalgamated in 1936 with the Grey Regiment, headquartered at [[Owen Sound]], Ontario. This event created the present-day regiment of [[The Grey and Simcoe Foresters]], which is headquartered at the Armoury in Queen's Park, downtown Barrie. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, citizens of Barrie volunteered for service overseas with The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, the Royal Canadian Navy and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. The City of Barrie sponsored a ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS ''Barrie,'' a Flower-class corvette.\n<br />\n{{wide image|Barrie-panorama-2016-08-29.jpg|1000px|Barrie waterfront}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Airports ===\nThere are no major airports with scheduled flights near Barrie (the closest being [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], located in [[Mississauga]]). There are a few airports that are used for light aviation aircraft:\n\n* [[Lake Simcoe Regional Airport]]\n* [[Barrie/Little Lake Water Aerodrome]]\n* [[Springwater (Barrie Airpark) Aerodrome]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nBarrie is served by Provincial Highway [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]], which acts as the primary route between Barrie and Toronto. Highway&nbsp;400 bisects the city on a roughly north\u2013south basis. [[Ontario Highway 26|Highway&nbsp;26]], also located in the city, is the main route to the Collingwood area and is known as Bayfield Street within the city limits. Barrie was once served by [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]], [[Ontario Highway 90|Highway&nbsp;90]], [[Ontario Highway 93|Highway&nbsp;93]], [[Ontario Highway 131|Highway&nbsp;131]] and [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]]. However, the province downgraded many highways in 1997 and 1998; these highways are now known as [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;27]], [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;90]] (Dunlop Street), [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;93]] and Simcoe County Road&nbsp;30. The portion of Highway&nbsp;11 through Barrie is known as [[Yonge Street]], though it is actually part of the [[Penetanguishene Road]]. Major arterial roads within the city include Mapleview Drive, Ferndale Drive, 10th Line, Big Bay Point Road, Essa Road, Huronia Road, Bayfield Street, Cundles Road, Anne Street, Dunlop Street, Livingstone Street, Duckworth Street, Wellington Street and St. Vincent Street.\n\n=== Public transit ===\nPublic transport is provided by [[Barrie Transit]], which operates numerous bus routes within the city. Accessible transit is offered by booking with city run [[Barrie Accessible Community Transportation Service]]. Most regular bus routes operated by Barrie Transit are accessible using low floor vehicles.\nBarrie also has GO Trains and Buses.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter rail ===\n[[GO Transit]] connects the city to the [[Greater Toronto Area]] through daily train service along the [[Barrie line]], with trains operating from the [[Allandale Waterfront GO Station]] and the [[Barrie South GO Station]]. This is primarily a commuter rail service to the GTA, with southbound trips to Toronto's [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in the morning rush hour and northbound trips in the evening rush hour. Limited weekend service to and from Toronto is also operated.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter bus ===\nIn addition to train service, GO Transit offers daily commuter-oriented bus service to the Greater Toronto Area.  Barrie is served by various private interurban bus lines such as [[Penetang-Midland Coach Lines]] and parent [[Greyhound Canada]], which run buses between Barrie and Toronto's [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal]]. Greyhound operates QuickLink commuter service from Barrie to Toronto seven days a week. In the past [[Gray Coach]] offered service from Toronto to Barrie; the route was later acquired by Greyhound. [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services|Ontario Northland]] operates bus routes from various locations to and from Barrie. All inter-urban buses operate from the [[Barrie Transit Terminal]] at 24 Maple Street.\n\n=== Passenger rail ===\nHistorically, Barrie was served by scheduled passenger rail service. Allandale Station was a stop for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Via Rail]]. In addition, [[Ontario Northland]]'s [[Northlander]] used the station as a stop, as did [[CN Rail]]/Via Rail (namely [[The Canadian]]). Regular passenger rail service to the station ended in the 1980s and has largely been replaced by interurban / commuter rail service.\n\n== Education ==\nBarrie has two major English school boards that operate inside the city at a public level. The [[Simcoe County District School Board]] administers a Public education in Barrie and Simcoe County, while the [[Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board]] administers to the Catholic population and serves the Simcoe and Muskoka areas. It also has two French school boards, [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]] (formerly Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud), the Catholic board, and [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]] (CSV, formerly Conseil Scolaire de District du Centre-Sud-Ouest), the secular board. There are also several private schools both for K-8 and K-12.\n\n=== High schools ===\n* [[Barrie North Collegiate Institute]]\n* [[Bear Creek Secondary School]]\n* [[Eastview Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole Secondaire Catholique Nouvelle Alliance\n* [[Innisdale Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Joseph's High School (Barrie)|St. Joseph's High School]]\n* Saint Joan of Arc\n* [[St. Peter's Catholic Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole secondaire Rom\u00e9o Dallaire\n* [[Unity Christian High School (Barrie)|Unity Christian High School]]\n\n=== Georgian College ===\n[[Georgian College]]'s main campus, with over 10,000 full-time students and approximately 25,000 part-time students, is located in Barrie.\n\n== Media ==\n=== Online ===\n[[Village Media]] operates ''BarrieToday.com.''\n\n=== Print ===\nThere are both semi-weekly and monthly newspapers serving the City of Barrie. The ''[[Barrie Advance]],'' published by [[Metroland Media Group]], is a free newspaper established in 1983 delivered weekly (on Thursdays) to every residence in the city as well as residents of Springwater Township and parts of Oro-Medonte. The newspaper contains local news, classifieds, advertisements and flyers. ''Barrie Business'' is a free newsprint publication covering local and regional business news. Published monthly and distributed to every business in the City of Barrie through Canada Post, it seeks to highlight and support Barrie's local business community and events. The ''[[Barrie Examiner]],'' established in 1864, was one of Canada's oldest daily newspapers.

The city is situated geographically within [[Simcoe County]], however it is a [[Independent city|politically independent]] single-tier municipality. It is within the historically significant [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of Central Ontario, and is part of the [[Golden Horseshoe|Greater Golden Horseshoe]], a densely populated and industrialised sub-region of Ontario. As of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]], the city's population was 141,434 making it the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|34th largest]] in Canada in terms of population proper. The Barrie [[Census metropolitan areas|census metropolitan area]] (CMA) as of the same census had a population of 197,059 residents, making it the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|21st largest CMA in Canada]]. The city itself has seen significant growth in recent decades due to its emergence as a [[bedroom community]] for that of [[Toronto]]. The affordability of housing and robust job market perhaps contribute to a Toronto buyer's appeasement with Barrie. [[GO Transit]] offers daily service to and from the [[Greater Toronto Area]] from two stations in the city. Barrie is located {{convert|85|km|mi}} north of Toronto, {{convert|355|km|mi}} northeast of [[Detroit]] and {{convert|335|km|mi}} west of [[Ottawa]]. This represents the city's highly centralised and historically advantageous situation, providing an ease of access to major centres and airports across the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.placestogrow.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9&Itemid=14 |title=Ministry of Economic Development, Employment and Infrastructure |website=Placestogrow.ca |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe Barrie area was first settled during the [[War of 1812]] as a key supply depot for British forces. It would be named 20 years later after Sir [[Robert Barrie]], who frequently commanded forces through the region. The 1980s and 1990s would be a period of immense growth for Barrie, with the population tripling in the span of twenty-five years. In 1981, the city had a population of 38,423; in 2006, Barrie had 128,430 residents living within city limits. Barrie's ongoing success would be punctuated by high-rise condominium development along Kempenfelt Bay, instigating a sort of downtown renaissance. Great investment by the city into their beachfront amenities would culminate in Barrie becoming a prime tourist destination. With several ski resorts in the vicinity and a picturesque waterfront, Barrie is known not just for its tourism, but also as the 'Gateway to Cottage Country'.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\">{{cite web |title=Barrie Wards Map |publisher=City of Barrie |url=https://barrie.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3369de0cb238453ba0376b9c392e2b6d }}</ref> The city's economy is diverse, with [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[information technology]] and [[manufacturing]] all prevalent sectors. The [[Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre]] is Barrie's largest employer, with nearly 3,000 workers. [[Retail]] in the city has flourished too in recent decades, bolstered by the completion of [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] in 2008. Barrie experiences cold, snowy winters with an average January minimum temperature of {{convert|-12.4|C}}. Summers are hot and humid, with an average July maximum temperature of {{convert|26.3|C}}.<ref name=\"Barrie Wards Map\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAt its inception, Barrie was an establishment of houses and warehouses at the foot of the [[Nine Mile Portage]] from [[Kempenfelt Bay]] to [[Fort Willow]], an aboriginal transportation route that existed centuries before Europeans arrived in [[Simcoe County]]. The portage linked Kempenfelt Bay through Willow Creek, connecting [[Lake Simcoe]] to the [[Nottawasaga River]] which flows into [[Georgian Bay]] off Lake Huron. Barrie played an integral role in the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, the city became a [[supply depot]] for British forces and in addition, the Nine Mile Portage was adopted by the British military as a key piece of their supply line which provided a strategic path for communication, personnel and vital supplies and equipment to and from Fort Willow and Georgian Bay/[[Lake Huron]]. Today, the Nine Mile Portage is marked by signs along roads in Barrie and in [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater Township]]. The scenic path from Memorial Square to Fort Willow is accessible to visitors year-round. The city was named in 1833 after [[Robert Barrie|Sir Robert Barrie]], who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada and frequently commanded forces through the city and along the Nine Mile Portage. Barrie was also the final destination for a branch of the [[Underground Railroad]]. In the mid-19th century, this network of secret routes allowed many American slaves to enter Barrie and the surrounding area. This contributed to the development (and name) of nearby [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]]. In 1846, the population of Barrie was roughly 500, mostly from England, Ireland and Scotland. A private school, three churches, a brick courthouse and a limestone jail, (built in 1842), were in operation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Simcoe County Court-House and Gaol |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe25.html |publisher=Ontario's Historical Plaques |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> Local businesses included three [[tavern]]s, six stores, three [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]], a wagon maker, a bakery, a cabinet maker and six shoemakers, as well as a bank.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

It was a station of the [[Northern Railway of Canada|Northern Railway]] and was situated on Lake Simcoe's western arm, known as Kempenfelt Bay. Throughout the latter of the 19th century, [[Steamship]]s ran from Barrie to the [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka Territory]], [[Orillia, Ontario|Orillia]] and other communities and stages were taking passengers to [[Penetanguishene]].<ref>The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869</ref> The period of 1870 to 1890 defined Barrie's downtown development with a series of raging fires that sequentially destroyed multiple landmarks, giving rise to the moniker that Barrie was \"among the best burning towns in Canada.\" <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.simcoe.com/news-story/2069137-huge-fires-defined-barrie-s-downtown-development/|title=Huge fires defined Barrie\u2019s downtown development|date=2007-12-07|website=Simcoe.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> Many local businesses like breweries, tanneries and sawmills depended on fire to operate, endangering the ramshackle assortment of wooden homes and buildings that made up the city centre. One of the most destructive fires came in mid-1875, when the entire section north of Dunlop to Collier, bounded by Clapperton and Owen Streets, was reduced to ash, destroying around 20 local businesses. After this period, the modern streets and buildings of Barrie began to take form in a massive rebuilding process. Other landmarks to eventually burn down over the years include the Barrie Opera House (1926), The Queen's Hotel (1915) and two of Barrie's largest and most prominent companies; the Sevigny Carriage Shop and the Anderton Brewery in 1916.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the midst of [[World War I]], dedicated residents of Barrie helped to hastily construct [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] (CFB Borden) as a means of additional support and to serve as a major training centre of [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] battalions. The base would open on July 11, 1916, and since then has become the largest Canadian Forces Base in the country, playing a paramount role through the remainder of the war, and throughout history. During [[World War II]], the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] named a {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}} {{HMCS|Barrie}}. On September 7, 1977, a private aircraft dropped to an altitude of {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} in dense fog and struck the {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on|0}} [[CKVR-TV]] tower, killing all five occupants aboard the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station's {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on|0}} auxiliary tower was also destroyed and damage had been inflicted on the roof of the main studio. CKVR was back on the air in the weeks following using a temporary {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on|0}} tower; a power reduction of nearly 40,000 watts occurred upon their return to the air on September 19 at 8:55&nbsp;p.m. The new 1,000-foot tower was rebuilt in 1978.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On May 31, 1985, an [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornado struck Barrie, touching down in [[Essa Township]], less than 10 kilometres (6.2&nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Highway 400]] and the Barrie city limits. At approximately 4:00 PM, all electrical power in Barrie went out, as the Grand Valley/Tottenham tornado took out the main hydro transformers southwest of the city. It then entered the southern part of Barrie shortly before 5:00pm, causing devastating damage in the subdivisions within its immediate path. The visibility in the general vicinity had been reduced drastically as the tornado was cloaked in heavy rain and dust. It became known as one of the most [[1985 Barrie tornado outbreak|violent and deadliest tornadoes]] in Canadian history, claiming the lives of eight within the city and injuring over 155 people. A [[state of emergency]] had been issued for the city that evening, with services from surrounding municipalities being required as the weeks following wore on. Between June 12-13, 1987, a sculpture called ''[[Spirit Catcher]]'' by [[Ron Baird]] was moved to Barrie from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where it had been exhibited as part of [[Expo '86]]. The sculpture was erected permanently at the foot of Maple Avenue on the shore of Kempenfelt Bay and has since become a principal facet in the Barrie city skyline and tourism. However, with the re-development along the waterfront and Lakeshore Drive, the city is considering moving the Spirit Catcher to a gravel outcropping at the foot of Bayfield Street. On January 12, 2004, the former [[Molson Brewery]] in south Barrie was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million; at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada's history. Barrie's [[Park Place (Ontario)|Park Place]] (formerly Molson Park) was chosen to host [[live8|Live 8]] Canada on July 2, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |title=Barrie, Ont. to host Canadian edition of Live 8 |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226043121/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1119352066774_150 |archivedate=December 26, 2005 |df= }}</ref> The overall success of the concert contributed to a plan to convert the prior [[Molson Park]] lands into a commercial district. On October 31, 2006, commercial real estate developers North American Acquisition Inc (NAA), a subsidiary of North American Development Group, LLC (NADG) won an [[Ontario Municipal Board]] (OMB) appeal of a rezoning application that had been previously denied by the City of Barrie to rezone the new Park Place lands from general industrial to business park zones, and general commercial or mixed employment. The proposal was followed by several concepts, including a [[box store]] abstraction originally conceived in 2002. The development of the lands was halted temporarily in 2009 due to disputes with the past OMB appeal, and construction of the complex would resume in 2010. An explosion in the Royal Thai restaurant, housed in the landmark Wellington Hotel at the \"Five Points\" intersection in downtown Barrie, occurred at 11:20pm on December 6, 2007. The fire quickly spread to several neighbouring buildings and firefighters battled the blaze well into the following morning, requiring assistance from other Simcoe County fire services. Officials estimated the damages to be in the millions. The 100-year-old Wellington Hotel building collapsed later in the morning.<ref name=\"canada.com\">{{cite web   |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332 |title=Massive blaze destroys six buildings in Barrie |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071209023032/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=4f3ddae9-5044-4f4d-a4fb-7adee1d63299&k=71332| archivedate= December 9, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"ctv.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome |title=Fire destroys historic buildings in Barrie, Ont.\n |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210055740/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071207/barrie_fire_071207/20071207?hub=TorontoHome| archivedate= December 10, 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> On February 17, 2008, two people were charged in connection with the fire after the Ontario Fire Marshal's office concluded the explosion and subsequent fire were the result of arson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|title=Pair charged in Barrie fire had ties to destroyed restaurant|publisher=Canoe.ca CNEWS|accessdate=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709132558/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/02/18/pf-4856783.html|archive-date=July 9, 2012|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nBarrie is located in the central portion of Southern Ontario, approximately {{convert|abbr=on|80|km}} north of [[Toronto]], {{convert|abbr=on|303|km}} south southeast of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and {{convert|abbr=on|412|km}} west southwest of [[Ottawa]], within the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] subregion. It is additionally located approximately {{convert|abbr=on|38|km}} southeast of the sought-after summertime destination, [[Wasaga Beach]] and {{convert|abbr=on|112|km}} south of the [[Muskoka District Municipality]] and cottage country, accessible via Highways [[Highway 26 (Ontario)|26]], [[Ontario Highway 400|400]] and [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|11]]. Barrie's historic downtown area is situated in a distinct curved or wrapped valley, surrounding the western edge of Kempenfelt Bay. The terrain is generally flat near the city's centre, with small but relevant hills and valleys being prominent astride the aforementioned. Moving up the valley slopes toward the city's north and south ends and the terrain can be rather steep in some areas. The earth flattens considerably just outside the city's limits to the south and northeast, especially beyond the airport where vast expanses of vegetation and farmland are most notable. The land surrounding Barrie is rich with agricultural activity. Barrie falls into Plant Hardiness Zone 5b. The city does not have any major rivers within its limits but does have numerous creeks and streams, most of which empty into Kempenfelt Bay.\n\n=== Interurban communities ===\n[[File:Barrie Condos and Houses in Winter.jpg|thumb|right|Residential condominiums and houses in Barrie after a snowfall]]\n* Letitia Heights\n* Cundles\n* Ardagh Bluffs\n* The Grove\n* Eastview\n* Holly\n* Downtown\n* Painswick\n* Allandale\n* Minet's Point\n\n=== Expansion ===\nBarrie has been designated an Urban Growth Centre by the Province of Ontario (Places to Grow Simcoe Area, 2009). Its population growth, largely due to its emergence as a bedroom community for Toronto, has given rise to the development of numerous subdivisions on the southern side of the city.

The city is situated on Lake Simcoe, a climatically insignificant body of water. Barrie is located in close proximity to [[Georgian Bay]], which, along with the [[Great Lakes]], act as a \"buffer\" of sorts, moderating year-round temperatures to a fair extent, while combined with the [[Lake-effect snow|lake effect]] can spawn blinding snow squalls in the winter, and strong thunderstorms in the spring and summer. The average July maximum in Barrie is {{convert|26.3|C|0}}, while the average January minimum is {{convert|-12.4|C|0}}. Barrie experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons, similar to [[Toronto]], the city's southern neighbour. Barrie does not, however, see the effects of [[diurnal temperature variation]], owing to its northerly location and rural outskirts. The city can be subject of noticeably cooler afternoons in the spring and early summer, due to the influence of a [[lake breeze]] since nearby lakes, such as Lake Huron, are cool relative to the air during these seasons. These aforementioned \"lake breezes\" mostly occur throughout the summer, bringing much-needed relief on hot days. Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include constant [[lake-effect snow]] in the winter, fog and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as [[seasonal lag]]. Winters are typically cold with frequent snow. During the winter months, temperatures are usually below {{convert|0|C|0}}. Barrie winters sometimes feature cold snaps when maximum temperatures remain below {{convert|-10|C|0}}, often made to feel colder by a biting [[wind chill]]. Occasionally, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-25|C|0}}. Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain, can disrupt work and travel schedules, while accumulating snow can fall anytime from late-October until mid-April. However, on the contrary, mild bouts also occur in most winters, melting any accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by very warm temperatures and muggy conditions. Daytime temperatures are normally above {{convert|20|C|0}}, and often rise above {{convert|30|C|0}}. However, they can sometimes surpass {{convert|35|C|0}}, accompanied by high humidity. The short transitional seasons of spring and autumn have generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating periods of dry and wet. Daytime temperatures average around {{convert|10 to 12|C|0}} during these seasons. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. Barrie is known for heavy thunderstorm activity in the late spring and summer months, all due to its location within a [[Convergence zone|convergence of breezes]] originating from Georgian Bay, [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Erie]]. There can be short periods of dry weather, but [[drought]]-like conditions are rare. The average yearly precipitation is about {{convert|932|mm|0}}, with an average annual snowfall of about {{convert|223|cm|0}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The highest temperature ever recorded in Barrie was {{convert|38.9|C|0}} on July 5, 1911.<ref name=\"July 1911\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=7&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1911\n| title = July 1911\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-38.9|C|0}} on January 8, 1866.<ref name=\"January 1866\">{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-06-30&mlyRange=1866-01-01%7C1958-12-01&StationID=4406&Prov=ON&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=1&Day=25&txtStationName=barrie&timeframe=2&Year=1866\n| title = January 1866\n| work = Canadian Climate Data\n| accessdate = March 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| open         =  <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template permanently open, and remove the hide button.

In the 2016 census, the city's population increased to 141,434, a growth of 3.9% over the 2011 population of 136,063. The median age is 38.5 years, somewhat lower than the provincial average of 39.0 years.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> The [[census metropolitan area]] of Barrie is 197,059 and consists of the city proper; the town of [[Innisfil]] directly to the south, west of [[Lake Simcoe]]'s southern arm (population 36,566); and the township of [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]] in the agricultural north (population 19,059). Barrie has a total land area of {{convert|898.02|sqkm}} in its metropolitan area, with a significant portion of the precinct being farmland or grassland. Roughly 40% of the Barrie [[census metropolitan area]] is developed land. In the 2016 census, Barrie's \"[[bedroom community]]\" for that of the city of Toronto distinction would be represented once again in another census by its demography. Barrie's median household income was $113,575, far higher than Ontario's median of $74,287, potentially depicting the higher-paying occupations available in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] as opposed to those offered within city limits.<ref name=\"2016Census\" /> Barrie's economic stature is not lacking, however several jobs are offered across different fields locally. Barrie's average commute time is the third highest in Ontario at 59 minutes, also possibly displaying the populous' tendency to work abroad in the more desirable and opportunity-oriented south.

Barrie's historic downtown and [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] are at the heart of its tourism industry. Downtown Barrie hosts many older buildings that have been kept up over the years or given new facades that exemplify their historical importance.  Many speciality shops, boutiques, pubs and restaurants are located throughout downtown Barrie, most notably along Dunlop Street East.  Downtown Barrie is becoming well known for its fashion boutiques, local art, live theatre, indie-music and nightlife scenes. In addition, downtown Barrie is home to numerous annual festivals and events such as The Barrie Waterfront Festival, Barrielicious, Winterfest, Celebrate Barrie, Ecofest, Jazz & Blues Festival, Promenade Days, Ribfest and Craft Beer Show, Caribfest, Lawnchair Luminata, [[Kempenfest]], The New Music Festival, [[Barrie Film Festival]], Santa Claus Parade and the New Year's Countdown. In the summer months, the city boasts several beaches including Minet's Point Beach, Johnsons Beach, The Gables, Tyndale Beach, and Centennial Beach. Boating in also very popular in Kempenfelt Bay and Lake Simcoe as it connects to the [[Trent Severn Waterway]]. In 2011, Barrie's waterfront was under redevelopment, with the relocation of several roadways to provide more greenspace and parkland along the lakeshore. There are numerous winter recreation activities and facilities in the surrounding area, including skiing, snow tubing and snowboarding resorts, snowmobile trails and ice fishing. Recreational activities include skiing at nearby [[Horseshoe Resort]], [[Snow Valley (ski area)|Snow Valley]], [[Mount St. Louis Moonstone]] and [[Blue Mountain (ski resort)|Blue Mountain]].\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n[[File:Barrie Canada Day Fireworks.png|thumb|Fireworks over Kempenfelt Bay during Barrie's [[Canada Day]] celebrations]]\nBarrie is home to vibrant performing and fine arts scenes.  There are a number of live performance companies including Theatre by the Bay, Talk Is Free Theatre and the Huronia Symphony. Grove Park Home is the practice hall for On-Stage Performance Group which performs in [[Cookstown, Ontario|Cookstown]]. The Strolling Youth Players and the Kempenfelt Community Players also all perform in Barrie. In addition, an annual live concert series is hosted by Georgian College. There are two main performing arts venues in the city: the Five Points Theatre, and the Georgian Theatre. Originally, the Five Points Theatre was known as The Mady Centre For The Performing Arts, but it was renamed in January 2018. It is located in Barrie's downtown at the Five Points intersection and was completed in 2011. This modern facility is home to many professional and amateur cultural productions, film screenings, theatrical plays, concerts, dance recitals and other performances. It is also the main venue for Theatre by the Bay and the Talk Is Free Theatre Companies. The venue features a flexible stage area with lighting and sound for professional theatre, music, dance, and other presentations, an automated riser/seating system with capacity for 120-200 seats and a sprung performance floor. The Georgian Theatre is a professional performing arts facility located in Barrie's north end on the campus of Georgian College. The theatre features a proscenium stage, sound, lights, fly gallery and seating for 427 on the main level with three pods which can be used to increase the seating capacity to 690. The Theatre is used for both theatrical and non-theatrical activity including conferences and seminars.\n\n[[File:Spiritcatcher barrie wide.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ron Baird's ''The [[Spirit Catcher]]'' (1986), installed along the waterfront in Barrie]]\nThe prominent [[MacLaren Art Centre]] is located in Barrie. This is an innovative art gallery that inspired the \"Art City\" project, which has had many different large sculptures installed around the city. These can be found in parks and along the scenic waterfront. The MacLaren Art Centre is a large and beautiful building on Mulcaster Street in downtown Barrie. International and Canadian artists display in the three main galleries. A permanent collection of art is growing, the Radio Cafe, a gift shop, film nights, speakers, theatre and many children's programs and community art projects are just a small part of the gallery's mandate. The gallery contributes overall to a vibrant arts community in the Barrie area with it leading edge arts. Barrie is also home to many independent galleries and studios. A concentration of independent galleries, studios and boutiques is located in Lakeshore Mews. This area is located behind the downtown's Dunlop Street and provides a location where one-of-a-kind items can be purchased. Lakeshore Mews artists also organize the annual \"Arts ce Soir\"; an all-night contemporary art event in celebration of visual, musical, theatrical and literary art. In addition, a studio tour in the Barrie/Orillia area takes place on the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Canadian Thanksgiving]] weekend every year. It is called the Images Studio Tour and has over 25 artists on average. The self-guided tour allows people to visit artists in their working studio and see how the art is created while enjoying the beautiful fall colours driving through the two cities and the countryside. Potters, jewellers, painters, textile artists and fashion designers make up a few of the disciplines of the talents on display. Barrie is also home to [[Kempenfest]]; one of the largest outdoor arts and crafts celebrations in Ontario. This festival occurs annually over the August long weekend and features over 300 artisans, an antique show, food demonstrations, children's activities and live entertainment, including an indie-music stage. Some of the main arts and culture groups in the city include:\n* Barrie Art Club\n* Barrie Concert Band<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Concert Band|url=http://www.barrieconcertband.org/|website=Barrieconcertband.org|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Barrie Film Festival]]\n* Barrie Folk Society<ref>{{cite web|title=Barrie Folk Society|url=http://www.barriefolk.com/|website=Barriefolk.com|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref>\n* Campus Gallery\n* Caribbean Culture Institute\n* Huronia Symphony Orchestra<ref>{{cite web|title=Huronia Symphony Orchestra|url=http://huroniasymphony.ca/|website=Huroniasymphony.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Kempenfelt Community Players\n* King Edward Choir<ref>{{cite web|title=King Edward Choir|url=http://www.kingedwardchoir.ca/|website=Kingedwardchoir.ca|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lyrica Chamber Choir\n* Simcoe Contemporary Dancers\n* Talk Is Free Theatre\n* Theatre By The Bay\n* Kiwanis\n\n== Attractions ==\nBarrie has numerous recreational venues and community centres throughout the city.\n* Allandale Recreation Centre\n* [[Barrie Community Sports Complex]]\n* [https://www.barrielibrary.ca/ Barrie Public Library]\n* [[Barrie Uptown Theater]]\n* Dorian Parker Centre\n* East Bayfield Community Centre\n* Eastview Arena\n* Holly Community Centre\n* Lampman Park\n* Lampman Lane Community Centre\n* Parkview Community Centre\n* Southshore Community Centre\n* Victoria Village\n* YMCA of Barrie\n\n== Sports ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

By the time of the [[1837 Rebellion]], Simcoe County had a sufficient population to form a [[battalion]] of [[Militia|Sedentary Militia]] of almost 600 strong. This battalion was involved in marching suspected rebels down Yonge Street to Toronto in order to face justice. By 1855, Barrie was home to an [[Company (military unit)|independent company]] of Rifle Company of militia, followed in 1863 by a company of Infantry. These companies served during the [[Fenian Raids]]. With the [[Militia Act of 1866]], the companies in Barrie were respectively organized as Number 1 and Number 5 companies, in the newly formed 35th Battalion of Infantry (Simcoe Foresters), gazetted on September 14, 1866. In 1885, four companies the 35th Simcoe Foresters, including those from Barrie, formed with four companies from the 12th York Battalion to form the York-Simcoe Battalion. This specially raised battalion served in Western Canada during the [[Northwest Rebellion]], under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.E. O'Brien of [[Shanty Bay]], Ontario. For its efforts, The Simcoe Foresters received its first [[Battle Honour]] \"Northwest Canada 1885.\" Citizens of Barrie would next volunteer for military service during the [[Boer War]] in South Africa 1899\u20131902. It was during this conflict that at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] the citizens of Barrie and The Simcoe Foresters suffered their first fatal casualty, Private James Halkett Findlay. Private Findlay was killed-in-action on February 18, 1900, while serving with C Company of the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] of Infantry. In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out and many citizens of Barrie were quick to volunteer for service overseas with The Simcoe Foresters. Late the following year, the Regiment was tasked with raising two overseas battalions, the [[157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]] and the [[177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF]]. In the spring of 1916, the Barrie and [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] companies of the 157th Battalion began clearing the land and construction of the new military camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain&nbsp;\u2014 Camp Borden (now [[CFB Borden]]). This began Barrie's long friendship with the Base, hence the reason CFB Borden was used for ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 2]]'' and ''[[Canada's Worst Driver 5]].'' With a re-organization of the Canadian Militia between the two world wars, The Simcoe Foresters, headquartered in Barrie, were amalgamated in 1936 with the Grey Regiment, headquartered at [[Owen Sound]], Ontario. This event created the present-day regiment of [[The Grey and Simcoe Foresters]], which is headquartered at the Armoury in Queen's Park, downtown Barrie. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, citizens of Barrie volunteered for service overseas with The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, the Royal Canadian Navy and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. The City of Barrie sponsored a ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS ''Barrie,'' a Flower-class corvette.\n<br />\n{{wide image|Barrie-panorama-2016-08-29.jpg|1000px|Barrie waterfront}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n=== Airports ===\nThere are no major airports with scheduled flights near Barrie (the closest being [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], located in [[Mississauga]]). There are a few airports that are used for light aviation aircraft:\n\n* [[Lake Simcoe Regional Airport]]\n* [[Barrie/Little Lake Water Aerodrome]]\n* [[Springwater (Barrie Airpark) Aerodrome]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nBarrie is served by Provincial Highway [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]], which acts as the primary route between Barrie and Toronto. Highway&nbsp;400 bisects the city on a roughly north\u2013south basis. [[Ontario Highway 26|Highway&nbsp;26]], also located in the city, is the main route to the Collingwood area and is known as Bayfield Street within the city limits. Barrie was once served by [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]], [[Ontario Highway 90|Highway&nbsp;90]], [[Ontario Highway 93|Highway&nbsp;93]], [[Ontario Highway 131|Highway&nbsp;131]] and [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]]. However, the province downgraded many highways in 1997 and 1998; these highways are now known as [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;27]], [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;90]] (Dunlop Street), [[Simcoe County Road&nbsp;93]] and Simcoe County Road&nbsp;30. The portion of Highway&nbsp;11 through Barrie is known as [[Yonge Street]], though it is actually part of the [[Penetanguishene Road]]. Major arterial roads within the city include Mapleview Drive, Ferndale Drive, 10th Line, Big Bay Point Road, Essa Road, Huronia Road, Bayfield Street, Cundles Road, Anne Street, Dunlop Street, Livingstone Street, Duckworth Street, Wellington Street and St. Vincent Street.\n\n=== Public transit ===\nPublic transport is provided by [[Barrie Transit]], which operates numerous bus routes within the city. Accessible transit is offered by booking with city run [[Barrie Accessible Community Transportation Service]]. Most regular bus routes operated by Barrie Transit are accessible using low floor vehicles.\nBarrie also has GO Trains and Buses.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter rail ===\n[[GO Transit]] connects the city to the [[Greater Toronto Area]] through daily train service along the [[Barrie line]], with trains operating from the [[Allandale Waterfront GO Station]] and the [[Barrie South GO Station]]. This is primarily a commuter rail service to the GTA, with southbound trips to Toronto's [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in the morning rush hour and northbound trips in the evening rush hour. Limited weekend service to and from Toronto is also operated.\n\n=== Interurban/commuter bus ===\nIn addition to train service, GO Transit offers daily commuter-oriented bus service to the Greater Toronto Area.  Barrie is served by various private interurban bus lines such as [[Penetang-Midland Coach Lines]] and parent [[Greyhound Canada]], which run buses between Barrie and Toronto's [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal]]. Greyhound operates QuickLink commuter service from Barrie to Toronto seven days a week. In the past [[Gray Coach]] offered service from Toronto to Barrie; the route was later acquired by Greyhound. [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services|Ontario Northland]] operates bus routes from various locations to and from Barrie. All inter-urban buses operate from the [[Barrie Transit Terminal]] at 24 Maple Street.\n\n=== Passenger rail ===\nHistorically, Barrie was served by scheduled passenger rail service. Allandale Station was a stop for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]], [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Via Rail]]. In addition, [[Ontario Northland]]'s [[Northlander]] used the station as a stop, as did [[CN Rail]]/Via Rail (namely [[The Canadian]]). Regular passenger rail service to the station ended in the 1980s and has largely been replaced by interurban / commuter rail service.\n\n== Education ==\nBarrie has two major English school boards that operate inside the city at a public level. The [[Simcoe County District School Board]] administers a Public education in Barrie and Simcoe County, while the [[Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board]] administers to the Catholic population and serves the Simcoe and Muskoka areas. It also has two French school boards, [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]] (formerly Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud), the Catholic board, and [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]] (CSV, formerly Conseil Scolaire de District du Centre-Sud-Ouest), the secular board. There are also several private schools both for K-8 and K-12.\n\n=== High schools ===\n* [[Barrie North Collegiate Institute]]\n* [[Bear Creek Secondary School]]\n* [[Eastview Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole Secondaire Catholique Nouvelle Alliance\n* [[Innisdale Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Joseph's High School (Barrie)|St. Joseph's High School]]\n* Saint Joan of Arc\n* [[St. Peter's Catholic Secondary School]]\n* \u00c9cole secondaire Rom\u00e9o Dallaire\n* [[Unity Christian High School (Barrie)|Unity Christian High School]]\n\n=== Georgian College ===\n[[Georgian College]]'s main campus, with over 10,000 full-time students and approximately 25,000 part-time students, is located in Barrie.\n\n== Media ==\n=== Online ===\n[[Village Media]] operates ''BarrieToday.com.''\n\n=== Print ===\nThere are both semi-weekly and monthly newspapers serving the City of Barrie. The ''[[Barrie Advance]],'' published by [[Metroland Media Group]], is a free newspaper established in 1983 delivered weekly (Thursdays) to every residence in the city as well as residents of Springwater Township and parts of Oro-Medonte. The newspaper contains local news, classifieds, advertisements and flyers. ''Barrie Business'' is a free newsprint publication covering local and regional business news. Published monthly and distributed to every business in the City of Barrie through Canada Post, it seeks to highlight and support Barrie's local business community and events. The ''[[Barrie Examiner]],'' established in 1864, was one of Canada's oldest daily newspapers. It was distributed five days a week (Tuesday to Saturday) to paid subscribers and also delivered to the remainder of the market free on Thursdays. The ''Examiner'' was one of several [[Postmedia Network]] newspapers purchased by [[Torstar]] in a transaction between the two companies in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kopun|first1=Francine|title=Torstar, Postmedia announce community and daily paper deal|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/11/27/torstar-postmedia-announce-community-and-daily-paper-deal.html|accessdate=November 27, 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> Following the acquisition, Torstar subsidiary [[Metroland Media Group]] announced the closure of the paper effective November 27, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Postmedia and Torstar swap dozens of community papers, but will shut down most of them|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/postmedia-torstar-1.4420955|accessdate=November 27, 2017|work=CBC News|agency=The Canadian Press|date=November 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Metroland Media to publish 4 daily papers purchased from Postmedia|url=https://metroland.com/press-releases/metroland-media-to-publish-4-daily-papers-purchased-from-postmedia/|website=Metroland Media Group|publisher=Torstar Corporation|accessdate=November 27, 2017|date=November 27, 2017|quote=The closure of the newspapers, which is effective immediately, will affect 46 full-time and part-time employees}}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\nLocal radio stations serving Barrie and environs include:\n* FM 93.1 - [[CHAY-FM|CHAY]] (\"Fresh 93.1\"), [[Top 40]]\n* FM 95.7 - [[CFJB-FM|CFJB]] (\"Rock 95\"), [[active rock]]\n* FM 100.3 - [[CJLF-FM|CJLF]] (\"Life 100.3\"), [[christian radio]]\n* FM 101.1 - [[CIQB-FM|CIQB]] (\"Big 101\"), [[Classic Hits]]\n* FM 107.5 - [[CKMB-FM|CKMB]] (\"1075 Kool FM\"), [[hot adult contemporary]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barrie Police Service]]\n* [[Barrie Speedway]]\n* [[Georgian Mall]]\n* [[Sandy Hollow Landfill]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Barrie, Ontario}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Barrie}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Barrie}}\n*[http://www.barrie.ca/ Official City of Barrie Website]\n*[http://www.barrietourism.on.ca/ Barrie Tourism]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Barrie\n | North     = [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]]\n | Northeast = [[Oro-Medonte]]\n | East      = ''[[Kempenfelt Bay]]'' of ''[[Lake Simcoe]]''\n | Southeast =\n | South     = [[Innisfil, Ontario|Innisfil]]\n | Southwest = [[Essa, Ontario|Essa]]\n | West      = [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]]\n | Northwest =\n}}\n{{Barrie}}\n{{Simcoe County}}\n{{Subdivisions of Ontario}}\n{{Census metropolitan areas by size}}\n\n[[Category:Barrie| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Underground Railroad]]\n[[Category:Single-tier municipalities in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePrint:Grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie"}

From the diary of Binyomin Wilhelm (as cited by his great-grandson, Rabbi Zvi Belsky), Louis Dershowitz is credited, not only with giving early financial and moral support for the founding of the yeshiva,  but for the very idea of establishing a yeshiva in Williamsburg.
