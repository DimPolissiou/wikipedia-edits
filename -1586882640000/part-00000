Over the course of his career, he lectured at both the [[University of Bristol]] and [[University of Oxford]] and published fifteen books on archaeological subjects. A keen populariser of the discipline, Aston was widely known for appearing as the resident academic on the [[Channel 4]] television series ''[[Time Team]]'' from 1994 to 2011.\n\nBorn in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Worcestershire]], to a working-class family, Aston developed an early interest in archaeology, studying it as a subsidiary to geography at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1970, he began his career working for the Oxford City and County Museum and there began his work in public outreach by running extramural classes in archaeology and presenting a series on the subject for [[Radio Oxford]]. In 1974, he was appointed the first [[County Archaeologist]] for [[Somerset]], there developing an interest in [[aerial archaeology]] and establishing a reputation as a pioneer in landscape archaeology\u2014a term that he co-invented with [[Trevor Rowley]]\u2014by authoring some of the earliest books on the subject. In 1978 he began lecturing at the University of Oxford and in 1979 became a tutor at the University of Bristol, supplementing these activities by working as an archaeological tour guide in Greece.\n\nIn 1988, Aston teamed up with television producer [[Tim Taylor (producer)|Tim Taylor]] and together they created two shows which focused on bringing archaeology into British popular consciousness. The first was the short-lived ''[[Time Signs]]'' (1991), although this was followed by the more successful ''Time Team'', which was produced for Channel 4 from 1994 to 2013. Aston was responsible for identifying sites for [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and for selecting specialists to appear on the show, and through the programme became well known to the viewing public for his trademark colourful jumpers and flowing, untidy hairstyle. In 1996 he was appointed to the specially-created post of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University, and undertook a ten-year project investigating the manor at [[Shapwick, Somerset]].\nHe retired from his university posts in 2004, but continued working on ''Time Team'' until 2011 and in 2006 commenced writing regular articles for ''[[Council for British Archaeology|British Archaeology]]'' magazine until his death. Although Aston did not believe that he would leave a significant legacy behind him, after his death various archaeologists claimed that he had a major impact in helping to popularise the discipline among the British public.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education: 1946\u201369===\nAston was born on 1 July 1946 into a working-class family in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Worcestershire]]<!-- Do not change to West Midlands, Oldbury was part of Worcestershire in 1946 -->, to cabinet-maker Harold Aston and his wife Gladys.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{r|Telegraph2013}} He developed an early interest in archaeology, although teachers at [[Langley High School, Oldbury|Oldbury Grammar School]] attempted to dissuade him from pursuing it.{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=13}} His father gave him two books on archaeology as a Christmas present, and he subsequently spent much time visiting archaeological sites, sometimes [[truancy|playing truant]] to do so.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=11}}{{r|Hilts2013}} The first of his family to attend university, Aston studied geography at the [[University of Birmingham]], albeit with a subsidiary in archaeology, graduating in 1967.{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=14}}{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} He taught himself more about archaeology by enrolling in various [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]],{{r|Dyer2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=13}}{{r|Hilts2013}} and was influenced by such figures as his thesis supervisor Harry Thorpe, as well as the geographer Trevor Rowley and archaeologists [[Philip Rahtz]] and Philip Barker.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=14\u201316}} His dissertation was on the development of settlement in the West [[Penwith]] peninsula.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=51}}\n\n===Early career: 1970\u201387===\nAston first gained full-time employment in 1970, working as a field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in [[Oxfordshire]]. For a time living in a tent, he worked on the [[sites and monuments record]] and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}} This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that archaeology should be open to all who were interested in it.{{r|PriorHorton}} As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on [[Radio Oxford]].{{r|Archaeology2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=26}} In 1974 he moved to [[Taunton]] to become the first [[County Archaeologist]] for [[Somerset]], where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the [[M5 motorway]]. Again he also taught extramural adult education classes, this time for the [[University of Bristol]].{{r|Dyer2013}}{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=18\u201319}} It was here that he developed a passion for [[aerial archaeology]], and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=44}} Becoming a pioneer of landscape archaeology, along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, ''Landscape Archaeology''.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|Gerrard}} With archaeologist James Bond he authored ''The Landscape of Towns'' (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape archaeology to urban areas.{{r|Dyer2013}} Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].{{r|Telegraph2013}}\n\nTiring of his position as county archaeologist, finding it \"too safe, pensionable and superannuable\", in 1978 he returned to Oxfordshire to take up a temporary position as a tutor in archaeology and local studies at [[Oxford University]]'s External Studies Department.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=19\u201320}} That year he co-ran his first study tour to Greece with Peter Hardy; he would continue to run these annually for a number of years, most often visiting [[Santorini]].{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=52}} In 1979 he returned to the West Country as tutor in archaeology at the [[University of Bristol]]'s Extra-Mural Department,{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|BBC2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=20}} through which he organised weekend and evening courses throughout the region, introducing thousands of interested people to archaeology.{{r|PriorHorton}} During this period he also authored ''Interpreting the Landscape'' (1985).{{r|Dyer2013}}\n\n===Founding ''Time Team'': 1988\u201395===\n[[File:TimeTeam2007.jpg|thumb|right|Aston (centre) with presenter Sir [[Tony Robinson]] (left) and Roman expert [[Guy de la B\u00e9doy\u00e8re]] (right) during a ''Time Team'' dig]]\n\nIn June 1988 the producer [[Tim Taylor (producer)|Tim Taylor]] invited Aston to work on a new four-episode television series for [[Channel 4]] called ''[[Time Signs]]'', broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the [[Roadford Lake|Roadford Reservoir]] in [[Devon]], making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] into the project in order to explain techniques of [[experimental archaeology]] to the audience.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=27}} Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=23}} He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book ''Monasteries'' (1993);{{r|Dyer2013}} he had initially planned to title the volume ''Monasteries in the Landscape'' but his publisher, [[Batsford]], had insisted on the shorter title.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=110}}\n\nAston and Taylor subsequently decided to work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for ''[[Time Team]]''. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to excavate, and gathered together a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and [[Carenza Lewis]], artist [[Victor Ambrus]], and historian [[Robin Bush (historian)|Robin Bush]]. He knew the actor and television presenter [[Tony Robinson]] after they had met on an archaeological course in [[Greece]], and successfully requested that he present the show.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=28\u201330}} From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=79}}\n\n''Time Team'' was first broadcast in 1994, and would attract around four million viewers per episode, with Aston becoming \"an icon to the viewing public.\"{{r|PriorHorton}} Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Christopher Dyer]] noted that Aston's \"unkempt hair and beard, multicoloured sweaters and [[Black Country]] accent made him instantly recognisable\" to the British public, describing him as \"a popular success\" who had attracted \"a large public following\".{{r|Dyer2013}} Aston acted as chief archaeological adviser to the programme until the end of series nineteen, appearing in almost every episode,{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} although he would later comment that when it first started he had no idea it would continue for so long.{{r|Eggington}} Aston enjoyed working with the ''Time Team'' crew, commenting that they were \"a great gang&nbsp;... There are some real party people.\"{{r|Hilts2013}}\n\nAston saw ''Time Team'' as an extension of his work as an extramural tutor, telling a 2013 interviewer that it was \"a way of reaching 3 million people rather than 30 people in the village hall.\"{{r|Hilts2013}} Commenting on the popularity of ''Time Team'', and its role in exposing the British public to archaeology, in a 2010 interview Aston remarked that \"My motive was to get as many people as possible interested in archaeology, because we [in the profession] all enjoy it and think it interesting. That was my personal aim&nbsp;... and on that basis I think it is a success.\"{{r|Aston2010}} ''Time Team'' encouraged wider public interest in archaeology and led to increasing numbers of students applying to study archaeological courses at British universities,{{r|PriorHorton}} while subscriptions to ''Current Archaeology'' magazine quadrupled to 18,000 in the show's first five years.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=40}} In autumn 1998, Channel 4 started a ''Time Team'' fan club, which had 16,000 members within a few months,{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=40}} while Aston became a supporter of the [[Council for British Archaeology]]'s Young Archaeologists' Club (YAC), and with Harding gave regular talks to YAC branches.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=42}} Aston found himself giving up to 20 public lectures a year on the subject of ''Time Team'', describing the public feedback as \"embarrassingly encouraging\".{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=42}}\n\n===Professorship: 1996\u20132011===\nIn 1996, Aston was appointed to the position of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University's Department of Continuing Education, a post designed explicitly for him.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} In 1998 the post was moved to the Centre for the Historic Environment within the Department of Archaeology.{{r|PriorHorton}} He would subsequently be instrumental in setting up the master's degree in archaeology and screen media at the department.{{r|Bailey}} By 1996, Aston was feeling \"a bit frustrated\" with ''Time Team'', primarily because he was always \"number two\" to Robinson.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=36}} He proceeded to present his own six-episode series, ''[[Time Traveller (1997 series)|Time Traveller]]'', in which he explored various archaeological sites in the counties around Bristol. It was broadcast on [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] over July and August 1997, and gained the largest local audiences for its time slot.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=37\u201339}}\n\nThe archaeology students of [[University of Winchester|King Alfred's College, Winchester]] also participated in a 10-year project led by Aston to investigate the manor of [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]] in [[Somerset]].{{r|BBC2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}} It became the \"type site for the study of the development of medieval villages\".{{r|PriorHorton}} Aston published the results of the project in ''The Shapwick Project, Somerset: A Rural Landscape Explored'' (2007), co-written with Christopher Gerrard, and this was followed by a more popular account of the project, ''Interpreting the English Village'', in 2013.{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|PriorHorton}}\n\nAlongside his academic publications, Aston wrote two books on archaeology for a more general audience, both of which were published by [[Channel 4 Books]] as a spin-off from the ''Time Team'' television series. The first of these was ''Time Team's Timechester: A Companion to Archaeology'', co-written with [[Carenza Lewis]] and [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] and first published in 2000. Based around the fictional British town of Timechester, the book looks at how the settlement would have progressed from the [[Palaeolithic]] through to the modern day, and examines the remains that each period would have left behind in the archaeological record.{{sfnp|Lewis|Harding|Aston|2002|p=}} This was followed in 2002 by ''Archaeology is Rubbish: A Beginner's Guide'', which Aston co-wrote with [[Tony Robinson]] and dedicated to Harding. ''Archaeology is Rubbish'' describes a fictional excavation site in an ordinary suburban back garden, and discusses the evidence from different archaeological periods, the field methods and techniques used by the excavators, and the legal proceedings and problems that archaeologists in Britain face.{{sfnp|Robinson|Aston|2002|p=}}\n\nAston retired from Bristol University in 2004, subsequently becoming Professor Emeritus.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}} He was also appointed an Honorary Visiting Professor at the [[University of Exeter]], [[University of Durham]], and the [[University of Worcester]].{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} That year, the [[University of Winchester]] awarded him an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Letters]].{{r|PriorHorton}} In 2006 Aston began writing a regular column, \"Mick's Travels\", for the bimonthly journal ''British Archaeology'', the publication of the [[Council for British Archaeology]].{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|Articles}} In 2007, Worcester University awarded Aston an honorary doctorate; that same year a number of his colleagues released a ''[[festschrift]]'' in his honour entitled ''People and Places: Essays in Honour of Michael Aston''.{{r|PriorHorton}}\n\n===Final years: 2012\u201313===\nIn February 2012 it was reported that Aston had left ''Time Team''. He explained his position to the ''[[Western Daily Press]]'', stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process ''Time Team'' had been \"[[dumbing down|dumbed down]]\", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists\u2014including surveyor [[Stewart Ainsworth]], small finds specialist [[Helen Geake]] and illustrator [[Victor Ambrus]]\u2014had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, [[Mary-Ann Ochota]] (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained \"a lot of faffing about.\"{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|Aston2012}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Professor-Mick-Aston-quits-Time-Team-dumbing-row/story-15177582-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414220332/http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Professor-Mick-Aston-quits-Time-Team-dumbing-row/story-15177582-detail/story.html| title=Professor Mick Aston quits Time Team over 'dumbing down' row|publisher=Western Daily Press | date= 9 Feb 2012| access-date=9 Apr 2020| archive-date=14 Apr 2014}}</ref> In an interview with the magazine ''British Archaeology'' Aston said: \"The time had come to leave.

\u2013 24 June 2013) was an English [[archaeologist]] who specialised in [[Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval]] [[landscape archaeology]]. Over the course of his career, he lectured at both the [[University of Bristol]] and [[University of Oxford]] and published fifteen books on archaeological subjects. A keen populariser of the discipline, Aston was widely known for appearing as the resident academic on the [[Channel 4]] television series ''[[Time Team]]'' from 1994 to 2011.\n\nBorn in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Worcestershire]], to a working-class family, Aston developed an early interest in archaeology, studying it as a subsidiary to geography at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1970, he began his career working for Oxford City and County Museum and there began his work in public outreach by running extramural classes in archaeology and presenting a series on the subject for [[Radio Oxford]]. In 1974, he was appointed the first [[County Archaeologist]] for [[Somerset]], there developing an interest in [[aerial archaeology]] and establishing a reputation as a pioneer in landscape archaeology\u2014a term that he co-invented with [[Trevor Rowley]]\u2014by authoring some of the earliest books on the subject. In 1978 he began lecturing at the University of Oxford and in 1979 became a tutor at the University of Bristol, supplementing these activities by working as an archaeological tour guide in Greece.\n\nIn 1988, Aston teamed up with television producer [[Tim Taylor (producer)|Tim Taylor]] and together they created two shows which focused on bringing archaeology into British popular consciousness. The first was the short-lived ''[[Time Signs]]'' (1991), although this was followed by the more successful ''Time Team'', which was produced for Channel 4 from 1994 to 2013. Aston was responsible for identifying sites for [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and for selecting specialists to appear on the show, and through the programme became well known to the viewing public for his trademark colourful jumpers and flowing, untidy hairstyle. In 1996 he was appointed to the specially-created post of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University, and undertook a ten-year project investigating the manor at [[Shapwick, Somerset]].\nHe retired from his university posts in 2004, but continued working on ''Time Team'' until 2011 and in 2006 commenced writing regular articles for ''[[Council for British Archaeology|British Archaeology]]'' magazine until his death. Although Aston did not believe that he would leave a significant legacy behind him, after his death various archaeologists claimed that he had a major impact in helping to popularise the discipline among the British public.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education: 1946\u201369===\nAston was born on 1 July 1946 into a working-class family in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Worcestershire]]<!-- Do not change to West Midlands, Oldbury was part of Worcestershire in 1946 -->, to cabinet-maker Harold Aston and his wife Gladys.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{r|Telegraph2013}} He developed an early interest in archaeology, although teachers at [[Langley High School, Oldbury|Oldbury Grammar School]] attempted to dissuade him from pursuing it.{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=13}} His father gave him two books on archaeology as a Christmas present, and he subsequently spent much time visiting archaeological sites, sometimes [[truancy|playing truant]] to do so.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=11}}{{r|Hilts2013}} The first of his family to attend university, Aston studied geography at the [[University of Birmingham]], albeit with a subsidiary in archaeology, graduating in 1967.{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=14}}{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} He taught himself more about archaeology by enrolling in various [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]],{{r|Dyer2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=13}}{{r|Hilts2013}} and was influenced by such figures as his thesis supervisor Harry Thorpe, as well as the geographer Trevor Rowley and archaeologists [[Philip Rahtz]] and Philip Barker.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=14\u201316}} His dissertation was on the development of settlement in the West [[Penwith]] peninsula.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=51}}\n\n===Early career: 1970\u201387===\nAston first gained full-time employment in 1970, working as a field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in [[Oxfordshire]]. For a time living in a tent, he worked on the [[sites and monuments record]] and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum.{{r|Dyer2013}}{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}} This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston's staunch belief that archaeology should be open to all who were interested in it.{{r|PriorHorton}} As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on [[Radio Oxford]].{{r|Archaeology2013}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=26}} In 1974 he moved to [[Taunton]] to become the first [[County Archaeologist]] for [[Somerset]], where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the [[M5 motorway]].

The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the [[Roadford Lake|Roadford Reservoir]] in [[Devon]], making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] into the project in order to explain techniques of [[experimental archaeology]] to the audience.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=27}} Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=23}} He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book ''Monasteries'' (1993);{{r|Dyer2013}} he had initially planned to title the volume ''Monasteries in the Landscape'' but his publisher, [[Batsford]], had insisted on the shorter title.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=110}}\n\nAston and Taylor subsequently decided to work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for ''[[Time Team]]''. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to excavate, and gathered together a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and [[Carenza Lewis]], artist [[Victor Ambrus]], and historian [[Robin Bush (historian)|Robin Bush]]. He knew the actor and television presenter [[Tony Robinson]] after they had met on an archaeological course in [[Greece]], and successfully requested that he present the show.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=28\u201330}} From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=79}}\n\n''Time Team'' was first broadcast in 1994, and would attract around four million viewers per episode, with Aston becoming \"an icon to the viewing public.\"{{r|PriorHorton}} Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Christopher Dyer]] noted that Aston's \"unkempt hair and beard, multicoloured sweaters and [[Black Country]] accent made him instantly recognisable\" to the British public, describing him as \"a popular success\" who had attracted \"a large public following\".{{r|Dyer2013}} Aston acted as chief archaeological adviser to the programme until the end of series nineteen, appearing in almost every episode,{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} although he would later comment that when it first started he had no idea it would continue for so long.{{r|Eggington}} Aston enjoyed working with the ''Time Team'' crew, commenting that they were \"a great gang&nbsp;... There are some real party people.\"{{r|Hilts2013}}\n\nAston saw ''Time Team'' as an extension of his work as an extramural tutor, telling a 2013 interviewer that it was \"a way of reaching 3 million people rather than 30 people in the village hall.\"{{r|Hilts2013}} Commenting on the popularity of ''Time Team'', and its role in exposing the British public to archaeology, in a 2010 interview Aston remarked that \"My motive was to get as many people as possible interested in archaeology, because we [in the profession] all enjoy it and think it interesting. That was my personal aim&nbsp;... and on that basis I think it is a success.\"{{r|Aston2010}} ''Time Team'' encouraged wider public interest in archaeology and led to increasing numbers of students applying to study archaeological courses at British universities,{{r|PriorHorton}} while subscriptions to ''Current Archaeology'' magazine quadrupled to 18,000 in the show's first five years.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=40}} In autumn 1998, Channel 4 started a ''Time Team'' fan club, which had 16,000 members within a few months,{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=40}} while Aston became a supporter of the [[Council for British Archaeology]]'s Young Archaeologists' Club (YAC), and with Harding gave regular talks to YAC branches.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=42}} Aston found himself giving up to 20 public lectures a year on the subject of ''Time Team'', describing the public feedback as \"embarrassingly encouraging\".{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=42}}\n\n===Professorship: 1996\u20132011===\nIn 1996, Aston was appointed to the position of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University's Department of Continuing Education, a post designed explicitly for him.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} In 1998 the post was moved to the Centre for the Historic Environment within the Department of Archaeology.{{r|PriorHorton}} He would subsequently be instrumental in setting up the master's degree in archaeology and screen media at the department.{{r|Bailey}} By 1996, Aston was feeling \"a bit frustrated\" with ''Time Team'', primarily because he was always \"number two\" to Robinson.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|p=36}} He proceeded to present his own six-episode series, ''[[Time Traveller (1997 series)|Time Traveller]]'', in which he explored various archaeological sites in the counties around Bristol. It was broadcast on [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] over July and August 1997, and gained the largest local audiences for its time slot.{{sfnp|Aston|2000|pp=37\u201339}}\n\nThe archaeology students of [[University of Winchester|King Alfred's College, Winchester]] also participated in a 10-year project led by Aston to investigate the manor of [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]] in [[Somerset]].{{r|BBC2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}} It became the \"type site for the study of the development of medieval villages\".{{r|PriorHorton}} Aston published the results of the project in ''The Shapwick Project, Somerset: A Rural Landscape Explored'' (2007), co-written with Christopher Gerrard, and this was followed by a more popular account of the project, ''Interpreting the English Village'', in 2013.{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|PriorHorton}}\n\nAlongside his academic publications, Aston wrote two books on archaeology for a more general audience, both of which were published by [[Channel 4 Books]] as a spin-off from the ''Time Team'' television series. The first of these was ''Time Team's Timechester: A Companion to Archaeology'', co-written with [[Carenza Lewis]] and [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] and first published in 2000. Based around the fictional British town of Timechester, the book looks at how the settlement would have progressed from the [[Palaeolithic]] through to the modern day, and examines the remains that each period would have left behind in the archaeological record.{{sfnp|Lewis|Harding|Aston|2002|p=}} This was followed in 2002 by ''Archaeology is Rubbish: A Beginner's Guide'', which Aston co-wrote with [[Tony Robinson]] and dedicated to Harding. ''Archaeology is Rubbish'' describes a fictional excavation site in an ordinary suburban back garden, and discusses the evidence from different archaeological periods, the field methods and techniques used by the excavators, and the legal proceedings and problems that archaeologists in Britain face.{{sfnp|Robinson|Aston|2002|p=}}\n\nAston retired from Bristol University in 2004, subsequently becoming Professor Emeritus.{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}}{{r|Archaeology2013}} He was also appointed an Honorary Visiting Professor at the [[University of Exeter]], [[University of Durham]], and the [[University of Worcester]].{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|BBC2013}} That year, the [[University of Winchester]] awarded him an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Letters]].{{r|PriorHorton}} In 2006 Aston began writing a regular column, \"Mick's Travels\", for the bimonthly journal ''British Archaeology'', the publication of the [[Council for British Archaeology]].{{r|PriorHorton}}{{r|Articles}} In 2007, Worcester University awarded Aston an honorary doctorate; that same year a number of his colleagues released a ''[[festschrift]]'' in his honour entitled ''People and Places: Essays in Honour of Michael Aston''.{{r|PriorHorton}}\n\n===Final years: 2012\u201313===\nIn February 2012 it was reported that Aston had left ''Time Team''. He explained his position to the ''[[Western Daily Press]]'', stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process ''Time Team'' had been \"[[dumbing down|dumbed down]]\", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists\u2014including surveyor [[Stewart Ainsworth]], small finds specialist [[Helen Geake]] and illustrator [[Victor Ambrus]]\u2014had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, [[Mary-Ann Ochota]] (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained \"a lot of faffing about.\"{{r|Telegraph2013}}{{r|Aston2012}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Professor-Mick-Aston-quits-Time-Team-dumbing-row/story-15177582-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414220332/http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Professor-Mick-Aston-quits-Time-Team-dumbing-row/story-15177582-detail/story.html| title=Professor Mick Aston quits Time Team over 'dumbing down' row|publisher=Western Daily Press | date= 9 Feb 2012| access-date=9 Apr 2020| archive-date=14 Apr 2014}}</ref> In an interview with the magazine ''British Archaeology'' Aston said: \"The time had come to leave.

Many of these wetland areas are separated by active glaciers. There are also several short glacier-fed streams and glacial pools. Some wetland areas have been recorded on McDonald Island but, due to substantial volcanic activity since the last landing was made in 1980, their present extent is unknown.\n\nThe HIMI wetland is listed on the [[Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia]] and, in a recent analysis of Commonwealth-managed wetlands, was ranked highest for nomination under the [[Ramsar Convention|Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention)]] as an internationally important wetland.\n\nSix wetland types have been identified from HIMI covering approximately 1860 ha: coastal \u2018pool complex\u2019 (237 ha); inland \u2018pool complex\u2019 (105 ha); vegetated seeps mostly on recent glaciated areas (18 ha); glacial lagoons (1103 ha); non-glacial lagoons (97ha); Elephant Spit (300 ha) plus some coastal areas. On Heard Island, the majority of these types suites are found below 150&nbsp;m asl. The wetland vegetation occurs in the \u2018wet mixed herbfield\u2019 and \u2018coastal biotic vegetation\u2019 communities described above.\n\nThe wetlands provide important breeding and feeding habitat for a number of Antarctic and subantarctic wetland animals. These include the southern elephant seal and macaroni, gentoo, king and southern rockhopper penguins, considered to be wetland species under the Ramsar Convention. Non-wetland vegetated parts of the islands also support penguin and other seabird colonies.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Heard Island Karman vortex street.jpg|thumb|[[Vortex shedding]] as winds pass Heard Island resulted in this [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] in the clouds]]\nThe islands have an Antarctic climate, tempered by their maritime setting. The weather is marked by low seasonal and daily temperature ranges, persistent and generally low cloud cover, frequent precipitation and strong winds. Snowfall occurs throughout the year. Monthly average temperatures at [[Atlas Cove]] (at the northwestern end of Heard Island) range from {{convert|0.0|to|4.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, with an average daily range of {{convert|3.7|to|5.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in summer and {{convert|-0.8|to|0.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in winter. The winds are predominantly westerly and persistently strong. At Atlas Cove, monthly average wind speeds range between around {{convert|26|and|33.5|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Gusts in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} have been recorded. Annual precipitation at sea level on Heard Island is in the order of {{convert|1300|to|1900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}; rain or snow falls on about 3 out of 4 days.<ref>HIMI official website.</ref>\n\nMeteorological records at Heard Island are incomplete.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Heard Island, 12 m asl (1981\u20132010 normals) \n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 20.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.0\n|Mar record high C = 19.9\n|Apr record high C = 20.4\n|May record high C = 19.3\n|Jun record high C = 14.0\n|Jul record high C = 15.0\n|Aug record high C = 15.4\n|Sep record high C = 16.8\n|Oct record high C = 16.4\n|Nov record high C = 14.6\n|Dec record high C = 19.2\n|Jan high C = 6.4\n|Feb high C = 6.5\n|Mar high C = 6.3\n|Apr high C = 5.3\n|May high C = 3.7\n|Jun high C = 2.3\n|Jul high C = 2.2\n|Aug high C = 2.2\n|Sep high C = 2.2\n|Oct high C = 3.3\n|Nov high C = 4.1\n|Dec high C = 5.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.7\n|Feb mean C = 4.8\n|Mar mean C = 4.6\n|Apr mean C = 3.6\n|May mean C = 2.2\n|Jun mean C = 0.9\n|Jul mean C = 0.5\n|Aug mean C = 0.4\n|Sep mean C = 0.5\n|Oct mean C = 1.5\n|Nov mean C = 2.4\n|Dec mean C = 3.8\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 3.0\n|Feb low C = 3.1\n|Mar low C = 2.8\n|Apr low C = 1.9\n|May low C = 0.7\n|Jun low C = -0.6\n|Jul low C = -1.1\n|Aug low C = -1.4\n|Sep low C = -1.1\n|Oct low C = -0.2\n|Nov low C = 0.7\n|Dec low C = 2.1\n|year low C = \n|Jan record low C = -0.5\n|Feb record low C = 0.2\n|Mar record low C = -1.7\n|Apr record low C = -2.9\n|May record low C = -4.8\n|Jun record low C = -7.2\n|Jul record low C = -6.2\n|Aug record low C = -11.5\n|Sep record low C = -8.6\n|Oct record low C = -7.1\n|Nov record low C = -6.2\n|Dec record low C = -0.7\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm = \n|Feb precipitation mm =  \n|Mar precipitation mm = \n|Apr precipitation mm = \n|May precipitation mm =  \n|Jun precipitation mm =  \n|Jul precipitation mm = \n|Aug precipitation mm = \n|Sep precipitation mm = \n|Oct precipitation mm =  \n|Nov precipitation mm = \n|Dec precipitation mm = \n|year precipitation mm = \n|unit precipitation days = 1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  \n|Feb precipitation days =  \n|Mar precipitation days =  \n|Apr precipitation days =  \n|May precipitation days =  \n|Jun precipitation days =  \n|Jul precipitation days =  \n|Aug precipitation days =  \n|Sep precipitation days =  \n|Oct precipitation days =  \n|Nov precipitation days =  \n|Dec precipitation days =  \n|year precipitation days = \n|source 1=  M\u00e9t\u00e9o climat stats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-p97.php|title=Moyennes 1961-1990 Australie (Ile Heard)|language=fr|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2= M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat <ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/station-31.php|title=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat stats for Ile Heard |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\n=== Timmy O'Coitus ===\n\nA very endangered species found only on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands. This species is known to roam widely around the island high off the devils lettuce in only a loin clothe. The species mainly eats enormous meat sticks, but has been know to fangoriously devour late night Schawarma stands native to the island. Smelly and unkept, O\u2019Coituses are known to live in dark, damp habitats throughout the island, such as under bridges or in garbage cans.\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Constraints ====\nThe islands are part of the [[Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra]] [[ecoregion]] that includes several [[subantarctic]] islands. In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, lichens, and [[moss]]es.<ref>[http://heardisland.antarctica.gov.au/nature/plants Plants]. Australian Department of the Environment, Australian Antarctic Division. Updated 28 February 2005.</ref> Low plant diversity reflects the islands\u2019 isolation, small size, severe climate, the short, cool growing season and, for Heard Island, substantial permanent ice cover. The main environmental determinants of vegetation on subantarctic islands are wind exposure, water availability, parent soil composition, salt spray exposure, nutrient availability, disturbance by trampling (from seabirds and seals) and, possibly, altitude. At Heard Island, exposure to salt spray and the presence of breeding and moulting seabirds and seals are particularly strong influences on vegetation composition and structure in coastal areas.\n\n==== History ====\nEvidence from microfossil records indicates that ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the [[Tertiary]] (a period with a cool and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant ''[[Pringlea|Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.\n\n==== Flowering plants and ferns ====\nLow-growing [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] flowering plants and [[bryophyte]]s are the major vegetation components. The vascular flora comprises the smallest number of species of any major subantarctic island group, reflecting its isolation, small ice-free area and severe climate. Twelve vascular species are known from Heard Island, of which five have also been recorded on McDonald Island. None of the vascular species is endemic, although ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Colobanthus kerguelensis]]'', and ''[[Poa kerguelensis]]'' occur only on subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe plants are typically subantarctic, but with a higher abundance of the cushion-forming ''[[Azorella selago]]'' than other subantarctic islands. Heard Island is the largest subantarctic island with no confirmed human-introduced plants. Areas available for plant colonisation on Heard Island are generally the result of retreating glaciers or new ice-free land created by lava flows. Today, substantial vegetation covers over 20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Heard Island, and is best developed on coastal areas at elevations below 250&nbsp;m.\n\n==== Mosses and liverworts ====\nBryophytes (mosses and liverworts) contribute substantially to the overall biodiversity of Heard Island, with 43 mosses and 19 liverworts being recorded, often occupying habitats unsuitable for vascular plants, such as cliff faces. Bryophytes are present in most of the major vegetation communities including several soil and moss-inhabiting species. A 1980 survey of McDonald Island found lower diversity than that on Heard Island; four mosses and a number of algal species are recorded from there.\n\n==== Algae ====\nAt least 100 species of terrestrial algae are known from Heard Island, commonly in permanently moist and ephemeral habitats. Forests of the giant Antarctic kelp ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' occur at a number of sites around Heard Island and at least 17 other species of seaweed are known, with more to be added following the identification of recent collections. Low seaweed diversity is due to the island's isolation from other land masses, unsuitable beach habitat, constant abrasion by waves, tides and small stones, and the extension of glaciers into the sea in many areas.\n\n==== Vegetation communities ====\nHeard Island has a range of terrestrial environments in which vegetation occurs. Seven general vegetation communities are currently recognised, although vegetation composition is considered more of a continuum than discrete units:\n* [[Subantarctic]] vegetation is minimal and includes small types of shrubbery, including mosses and liverworts.\n* [[cushion plant|Open cushionfield]] vegetation is the most widespread and abundant vegetation type on Heard Island. It is characterised by ''[[Azorella selago]]'' cushions interspersed with bryophytes, small vascular species and bare ground with 20\u201375% cover, and found mainly at altitudes between 30\u201370m asl.\n* [[Fellfield]] describes vegetation with abundant bare ground and less than 50% plant cover. Fellfield may occur as a result of harsh climatic and/or edaphic factors, or recent [[deglaciation]] which has exposed bare ground.\n* [[Moss]]y [[fellfield]] is a community with high species richness and consists of bryophytes and small ''Azorella selago'' cushions.

Other species and vegetation communities found on subantarctic islands north of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] now absent from the Heard Island flora may colonise the island if climate change produces more favourable conditions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSome plant species are spreading and modifying the structure and composition of communities, some of which are also increasing in distribution. It is likely that further changes will occur, and possibly at an accelerated rate. Changes in population numbers of seal and seabird species are also expected to affect the vegetation by changing nutrient availability and disturbance through trampling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.au/details/f2005l02346/Html/Text|title=Heard Island and McDonald Islands Marine Reserve Management Plan 2005|last=Environment|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nOne plant species on Heard Island, ''[[Poa annua]]'', a cosmopolitan grass native to Europe, was possibly introduced by humans, though is more likely to have arrived naturally, probably by [[skua]]s from the Kerguelen Islands where it is widespread. It was initially recorded in 1987 in two deglaciated areas of Heard Island not previously exposed to human visitors, while being absent from known sites of past human habitation. Since 1987 ''Poa annua'' populations have increased in density and abundance within the original areas and have expanded beyond them. Expeditioner boot traffic during the Australian Antarctic program expedition in 1987 may be at least partly responsible for the spread, but it is probably mainly due to dispersal by wind and the movement of seabirds and seals around the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe potential for introducing plant species (including invasive species not previously found on subantarctic islands) by both natural and human-induced means is high. This is due to the combination of low species diversity and climatic amelioration. During the 2003/04 summer a new plant species, ''[[Cotula plumosa]]'', was recorded. Only one small specimen was found growing on a coastal river terrace that had experienced substantial development and expansion of vegetation over the past decade. The species has a circumantarctic distribution and occurs on many subantarctic islands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=P. A. M.|last2=Scott|first2=J. J.|last3=Rozefelds|first3=A.

Both the shag and the sheathbill are endemic to Heard Island.\n\nA further 28 seabird species are recorded as either non-breeding visitors or have been noted during 'at-sea surveys' of the islands. All recorded breeding species, other than the Heard Island sheathbill, are listed marine species under the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act (1999, four are listed as threatened species and five are listed migratory species.

The king penguin population is the best studied seabird species on Heard Island and has shown a dramatic increase since first recorded in 1947/48, with the population doubling every five years or so for more than 50 years.\n\nA paper reviewing population data for the black-browed albatross between 1947 and 2000/01 suggested that the breeding population had increased to approximately three times that present in the late 1940s,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Woehler |first=E.

The discovery of a large, previously unknown, colony of Heard shags in 2000/01 at Cape Pillar raised the known breeding population from 200 pairs to over 1000 pairs.<ref name=\"Woehler, E.J. 2006\"/> The breeding population of southern giant petrels decreased by more than 50% between the early 1950s and the late 1980s.\n\n==== Terrestrial, freshwater and coastal invertebrates ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\nHeard Island supports a relatively low number of terrestrial invertebrate species compared to other Southern Ocean islands, in parallel with the low species richness in the flora\u2013that is, the island's isolation and limited ice-free area. [[Endemism]] is also generally low and the invertebrate fauna is exceptionally pristine with few, if any, (successful) human-induced introductions of alien species.\nTwo species, including the thrips ''Apterothrips apteris'' and the mite ''[[Tyrophagus putrescentiae]]'' are thought to be recent, possibly natural, introductions. An exotic species of earthworm ''[[Dendrodrilus rubidus]]'' was also collected in 1929 from a dump near Atlas Cove, and has recently been collected from a variety of habitats including wallows, streams and lakes on Heard Island.\n\nThe arthropods of Heard Island are comparatively well known with 54 species of [[mite]] and [[tick]], one [[spider]] and eight [[springtail]]s recorded. A study over summer at Atlas Cove in 1987/88 showed overall densities of up to 60 000 individual springtails per square metre in soil under stands of ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]''. Despite a few recent surveys, the non-arthropod invertebrate fauna of Heard Island remain poorly known.\n\nBeetles and flies dominate Heard Island's known insect fauna, which comprises up to 21 species of ectoparasite (associated with birds and seals) and up to 13 free-living species. Approximately half of the free-living insects are habitat-specific, while the remainder are generalists found in a variety of habitats, being associated with either supralittoral or intertidal zones, ''[[Poa cookii]]'' and ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' stands, [[bryophyte]]s, lichen-covered rocks, exposed rock faces or the underside of rocks. There is a pronounced seasonality to the insect fauna, with densities in winter months dropping to a small percentage (between 0.75%) of the summer maximum. Distinct differences in relative abundances of species between habitats has also been shown, including a negative relationship between altitude and body size for Heard Island weevils.\n\nThe fauna of the freshwater pools, lakes, streams and mires found in the coastal areas of Heard Island are broadly similar to those on other subantarctic islands of the southern Indian Ocean. Many species reported from Heard Island are found elsewhere. Some sampling of freshwater fauna has been undertaken during recent expeditions and records to date indicate that the freshwater fauna includes a species of [[Protista]], a gastrotrich, two species of [[tardigrade]], at least four species of nematode, 26 species of rotifer, six species of annelid and 14 species of arthropod.\n\nAs with the other shore biota, the marine macro-invertebrate fauna of Heard Island is similar in composition and local distribution to other subantarctic islands, although relatively little is known about the Heard Island communities compared with the well-studied fauna of some other islands in the subantarctic region, such as [[Macquarie Island|Macquarie]] and Kerguelen.\n\nDespite Heard Island's isolation, species richness is considered to be moderate, rather than depauperate, although the number of endemic species reported is low. The large macro-alga ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' supports a diverse array of invertebrate taxa and may play an important role in transporting some of this fauna to Heard Island.\n\nThe rocky shores of Heard Island exhibit a clear demarcation between fauna of the lower kelp holdfast zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet ''Nacella kerguelensis'' is abundant in the lower part of the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the chiton ''[[Hemiarthrum setulosum]]'' and the starfish ''Anasterias mawsoni''. The amphipod ''Hyale'' sp. and the isopod ''Cassidinopsis'' sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp holdfast zone, the littornid ''Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis'' and the bivalve mollusc ''Kidderia bicolor'' are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve ''Gaimardia trapesina trapesina'' has been recorded from immediately above the holdfast zone. Oligochaetes are also abundant in areas supporting porous and spongy layers of algal mat.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:FMIB 46007 Antarctic Sea-Elephant Fishery.jpeg|thumb|right|Heard Island 1887 by [[Henry Wood Elliott]]<ref>Goode, George Brown (1887) Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States, (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1887).</ref>]]\nNeither island-cluster had recorded visitors until the mid-1850s.\n\nAn American sailor, John Heard, on the ship ''Oriental'', sighted Heard Island on 25 November 1853, en route from [[Boston]] to Melbourne.

In the sailing period from 1855 to 1880 a number of American sealers spent a year or more on the island, living in appalling conditions in dark smelly huts, also at Oil Barrel Point. At its peak the community consisted of 200 people. By 1880 sealers had wiped out most of the seal population and then left the island. In all the islands furnished more than 100,000 barrels of [[elephant seal|elephant-seal]] oil during this period.\n\nA number of wrecks have occurred in the vicinity of the islands. There is also a discarded building left from John Heard's sealing station which is situated near Atlas Cove.\n\nThe first recorded landing on McDonald Island was made by Australian scientists Grahame Budd and Hugh Thelander on 12 February 1971, using a helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|title=SIOE 2002: Heard I. & The McDonald Is|date=1 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052000/http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|archive-date=26 April 2012|last=Cerchi|first=Dan|website=www.cerchi.net}}</ref><ref name=\"aad\">{{cite web|url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406140708/http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177  |archivedate=2011-04-06 |url-status=dead |title=Gazetteer - AADC Name Details - Australian Antarctic Data Centre |via=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=29 March 2016|website=[[Australian Antarctic Data Centre]]}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have been a territory of Australia since 1947, when they were transferred from the UK.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/> The archipelago became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997.\n\nThere were at least five private expeditions to Heard Island between 1965 and 2000.

The transfer was confirmed by an exchange of letters between the two governments on 19 December 1950.\n\nThe islands are a territory (Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands) of Australia administered from [[Hobart]] by the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] of the Australian [[Department of the Environment and Energy]]. The administration of the territory is established in the ''Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953'', which places it under the laws of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2008C00326|website=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> The islands are contained within a {{convert|65000|km2|sqmi|adj=on}} marine reserve and are primarily visited for research, meaning that there is no permanent human habitation.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/>\n\nFrom 1947 until 1955 there were camps of visiting scientists on Heard Island (at [[Atlas Cove]] in the northwest, which was in 1969 again occupied by American scientists and expanded in 1971 by French scientists) and in 1971 on McDonald Island (at [[Williams Bay, Australia|Williams Bay]]).

They total approximately {{convert|2.5|km2|sqmi|1}} in area, where McDonald Island is {{convert|1.13|km2|sqmi|1}}.

Many of these wetland areas are separated by active glaciers. There are also several short glacier-fed streams and glacial pools. Some wetland areas have been recorded on McDonald Island but, due to substantial volcanic activity since the last landing was made in 1980, their present extent is unknown.\n\nThe HIMI wetland is listed on the [[Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia]] and, in a recent analysis of Commonwealth-managed wetlands, was ranked highest for nomination under the [[Ramsar Convention|Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention)]] as an internationally important wetland.\n\nSix wetland types have been identified from HIMI covering approximately 1860 ha: coastal \u2018pool complex\u2019 (237 ha); inland \u2018pool complex\u2019 (105 ha); vegetated seeps mostly on recent glaciated areas (18 ha); glacial lagoons (1103 ha); non-glacial lagoons (97ha); Elephant Spit (300 ha) plus some coastal areas. On Heard Island, the majority of these types suites are found below 150&nbsp;m asl. The wetland vegetation occurs in the \u2018wet mixed herbfield\u2019 and \u2018coastal biotic vegetation\u2019 communities described above.\n\nThe wetlands provide important breeding and feeding habitat for a number of Antarctic and subantarctic wetland animals. These include the southern elephant seal and macaroni, gentoo, king and southern rockhopper penguins, considered to be wetland species under the Ramsar Convention. Non-wetland vegetated parts of the islands also support penguin and other seabird colonies.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Heard Island Karman vortex street.jpg|thumb|[[Vortex shedding]] as winds pass Heard Island resulted in this [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] in the clouds]]\nThe islands have an Antarctic climate, tempered by their maritime setting. The weather is marked by low seasonal and daily temperature ranges, persistent and generally low cloud cover, frequent precipitation and strong winds. Snowfall occurs throughout the year. Monthly average temperatures at [[Atlas Cove]] (at the northwestern end of Heard Island) range from {{convert|0.0|to|4.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, with an average daily range of {{convert|3.7|to|5.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in summer and {{convert|-0.8|to|0.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in winter.

Gusts in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} have been recorded. Annual precipitation at sea level on Heard Island is in the order of {{convert|1300|to|1900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}; rain or snow falls on about 3 out of 4 days.<ref>HIMI official website.</ref>\n\nMeteorological records at Heard Island are incomplete.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Heard Island, 12 m asl (1981\u20132010 normals) \n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 20.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.0\n|Mar record high C = 19.9\n|Apr record high C = 20.4\n|May record high C = 19.3\n|Jun record high C = 14.0\n|Jul record high C = 15.0\n|Aug record high C = 15.4\n|Sep record high C = 16.8\n|Oct record high C = 16.4\n|Nov record high C = 14.6\n|Dec record high C = 19.2\n|Jan high C = 6.4\n|Feb high C = 6.5\n|Mar high C = 6.3\n|Apr high C = 5.3\n|May high C = 3.7\n|Jun high C = 2.3\n|Jul high C = 2.2\n|Aug high C = 2.2\n|Sep high C = 2.2\n|Oct high C = 3.3\n|Nov high C = 4.1\n|Dec high C = 5.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.7\n|Feb mean C = 4.8\n|Mar mean C = 4.6\n|Apr mean C = 3.6\n|May mean C = 2.2\n|Jun mean C = 0.9\n|Jul mean C = 0.5\n|Aug mean C = 0.4\n|Sep mean C = 0.5\n|Oct mean C = 1.5\n|Nov mean C = 2.4\n|Dec mean C = 3.8\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 3.0\n|Feb low C = 3.1\n|Mar low C = 2.8\n|Apr low C = 1.9\n|May low C = 0.7\n|Jun low C = -0.6\n|Jul low C = -1.1\n|Aug low C = -1.4\n|Sep low C = -1.1\n|Oct low C = -0.2\n|Nov low C = 0.7\n|Dec low C = 2.1\n|year low C = \n|Jan record low C = -0.5\n|Feb record low C = 0.2\n|Mar record low C = -1.7\n|Apr record low C = -2.9\n|May record low C = -4.8\n|Jun record low C = -7.2\n|Jul record low C = -6.2\n|Aug record low C = -11.5\n|Sep record low C = -8.6\n|Oct record low C = -7.1\n|Nov record low C = -6.2\n|Dec record low C = -0.7\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm = \n|Feb precipitation mm =  \n|Mar precipitation mm = \n|Apr precipitation mm = \n|May precipitation mm =  \n|Jun precipitation mm =  \n|Jul precipitation mm = \n|Aug precipitation mm = \n|Sep precipitation mm = \n|Oct precipitation mm =  \n|Nov precipitation mm = \n|Dec precipitation mm = \n|year precipitation mm = \n|unit precipitation days = 1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  \n|Feb precipitation days =  \n|Mar precipitation days =  \n|Apr precipitation days =  \n|May precipitation days =  \n|Jun precipitation days =  \n|Jul precipitation days =  \n|Aug precipitation days =  \n|Sep precipitation days =  \n|Oct precipitation days =  \n|Nov precipitation days =  \n|Dec precipitation days =  \n|year precipitation days = \n|source 1=  M\u00e9t\u00e9o climat stats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-p97.php|title=Moyennes 1961-1990 Australie (Ile Heard)|language=fr|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2= M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat <ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/station-31.php|title=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat stats for Ile Heard |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Constraints ====\nThe islands are part of the [[Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra]] [[ecoregion]] that includes several [[subantarctic]] islands. In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, lichens, and [[moss]]es.<ref>[http://heardisland.antarctica.gov.au/nature/plants Plants]. Australian Department of the Environment, Australian Antarctic Division. Updated 28 February 2005.</ref> Low plant diversity reflects the islands\u2019 isolation, small size, severe climate, the short, cool growing season and, for Heard Island, substantial permanent ice cover. The main environmental determinants of vegetation on subantarctic islands are wind exposure, water availability, parent soil composition, salt spray exposure, nutrient availability, disturbance by trampling (from seabirds and seals) and, possibly, altitude. At Heard Island, exposure to salt spray and the presence of breeding and moulting seabirds and seals are particularly strong influences on vegetation composition and structure in coastal areas.\n\n==== History ====\nEvidence from microfossil records indicates that ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the [[Tertiary]] (a period with a cool and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant ''[[Pringlea|Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.\n\n==== Flowering plants and ferns ====\nLow-growing [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] flowering plants and [[bryophyte]]s are the major vegetation components. The vascular flora comprises the smallest number of species of any major subantarctic island group, reflecting its isolation, small ice-free area and severe climate. Twelve vascular species are known from Heard Island, of which five have also been recorded on McDonald Island. None of the vascular species is endemic, although ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Colobanthus kerguelensis]]'', and ''[[Poa kerguelensis]]'' occur only on subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe plants are typically subantarctic, but with a higher abundance of the cushion-forming ''[[Azorella selago]]'' than other subantarctic islands. Heard Island is the largest subantarctic island with no confirmed human-introduced plants. Areas available for plant colonisation on Heard Island are generally the result of retreating glaciers or new ice-free land created by lava flows. Today, substantial vegetation covers over 20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Heard Island, and is best developed on coastal areas at elevations below 250&nbsp;m.\n\n==== Mosses and liverworts ====\nBryophytes (mosses and liverworts) contribute substantially to the overall biodiversity of Heard Island, with 43 mosses and 19 liverworts being recorded, often occupying habitats unsuitable for vascular plants, such as cliff faces. Bryophytes are present in most of the major vegetation communities including several soil and moss-inhabiting species. A 1980 survey of McDonald Island found lower diversity than that on Heard Island; four mosses and a number of algal species are recorded from there.\n\n==== Algae ====\nAt least 100 species of terrestrial algae are known from Heard Island, commonly in permanently moist and ephemeral habitats. Forests of the giant Antarctic kelp ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' occur at a number of sites around Heard Island and at least 17 other species of seaweed are known, with more to be added following the identification of recent collections. Low seaweed diversity is due to the island's isolation from other land masses, unsuitable beach habitat, constant abrasion by waves, tides and small stones, and the extension of glaciers into the sea in many areas.\n\n==== Vegetation communities ====\nHeard Island has a range of terrestrial environments in which vegetation occurs. Seven general vegetation communities are currently recognised, although vegetation composition is considered more of a continuum than discrete units:\n* [[Subantarctic]] vegetation is minimal and includes small types of shrubbery, including mosses and liverworts.\n* [[cushion plant|Open cushionfield]] vegetation is the most widespread and abundant vegetation type on Heard Island. It is characterised by ''[[Azorella selago]]'' cushions interspersed with bryophytes, small vascular species and bare ground with 20\u201375% cover, and found mainly at altitudes between 30\u201370m asl.\n* [[Fellfield]] describes vegetation with abundant bare ground and less than 50% plant cover. Fellfield may occur as a result of harsh climatic and/or edaphic factors, or recent [[deglaciation]] which has exposed bare ground.\n* [[Moss]]y [[fellfield]] is a community with high species richness and consists of bryophytes and small ''Azorella selago'' cushions. It is found at altitudes between 30\u2013150&nbsp;m in areas with intermediate exposure.\n* [[Herbfield|Wet mixed herbfield]] occurs on moist substrate, mostly on moraines and moist lee slopes (often in association with burrowing petrels colonies) at low altitude (< 40&nbsp;m) where the water table is at or close to the surface. Species richness is highest here of all the communities, with dominant species being ''[[Poa cookii]]'', ''Azorella selago'', ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Acaena magellanica]]'', and ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]''.\n* [[Coastal Strand|Coastal biotic]] vegetation is dominated by ''Poa cookii'' and ''Azorella selago'', occurring mainly on coastal sites of moderate exposure and in areas subject to significant influence from seals and seabirds.\n* [[Supralittoral zone|Saltspray vegetation]] is dominated by the salt-tolerant moss ''[[Muelleriella crassifolia]]'' and limited in extent, being found at low elevations on lavas in exposed coastal sites.\n* [[cushion plant|Closed cushionfield]] is found on moraines and sand at altitudes mostly below 60&nbsp;m, and is dominated almost entirely by ''Azorella selago'' cushions that often grow together to form continuous carpets which can be subject to burrowing by seabirds.\n\n==== Outlook ====\nOne of the most rapidly changing physical settings in the subantarctic has been produced on Heard Island by a combination of rapid glacial recession and climate warming.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The consequent increase in habitat available for plant colonisation, plus the coalescing of previously discrete ice-free areas, has led to marked changes in the vegetation of Heard Island in the last 20 years or so.

It is likely that further changes will occur, and possibly at an accelerated rate. Changes in population numbers of seal and seabird species are also expected to affect the vegetation by changing nutrient availability and disturbance through trampling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.au/details/f2005l02346/Html/Text|title=Heard Island and McDonald Islands Marine Reserve Management Plan 2005|last=Environment|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nOne plant species on Heard Island, ''[[Poa annua]]'', a cosmopolitan grass native to Europe, was possibly introduced by humans, though is more likely to have arrived naturally, probably by [[skua]]s from the Kerguelen Islands where it is widespread. It was initially recorded in 1987 in two deglaciated areas of Heard Island not previously exposed to human visitors, while being absent from known sites of past human habitation. Since 1987 ''Poa annua'' populations have increased in density and abundance within the original areas and have expanded beyond them. Expeditioner boot traffic during the Australian Antarctic program expedition in 1987 may be at least partly responsible for the spread, but it is probably mainly due to dispersal by wind and the movement of seabirds and seals around the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe potential for introducing plant species (including invasive species not previously found on subantarctic islands) by both natural and human-induced means is high. This is due to the combination of low species diversity and climatic amelioration. During the 2003/04 summer a new plant species, ''[[Cotula plumosa]]'', was recorded. Only one small specimen was found growing on a coastal river terrace that had experienced substantial development and expansion of vegetation over the past decade. The species has a circumantarctic distribution and occurs on many subantarctic islands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=P. A. M.|last2=Scott|first2=J. J.|last3=Rozefelds|first3=A.

Both the shag and the sheathbill are endemic to Heard Island.\n\nA further 28 seabird species are recorded as either non-breeding visitors or have been noted during 'at-sea surveys' of the islands. All recorded breeding species, other than the Heard Island sheathbill, are listed marine species under the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act (1999, four are listed as threatened species and five are listed migratory species.

The king penguin population is the best studied seabird species on Heard Island and has shown a dramatic increase since first recorded in 1947/48, with the population doubling every five years or so for more than 50 years.\n\nA paper reviewing population data for the black-browed albatross between 1947 and 2000/01 suggested that the breeding population had increased to approximately three times that present in the late 1940s,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Woehler |first=E.

The discovery of a large, previously unknown, colony of Heard shags in 2000/01 at Cape Pillar raised the known breeding population from 200 pairs to over 1000 pairs.<ref name=\"Woehler, E.J. 2006\"/> The breeding population of southern giant petrels decreased by more than 50% between the early 1950s and the late 1980s.\n\n==== Terrestrial, freshwater and coastal invertebrates ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\nHeard Island supports a relatively low number of terrestrial invertebrate species compared to other Southern Ocean islands, in parallel with the low species richness in the flora\u2013that is, the island's isolation and limited ice-free area. [[Endemism]] is also generally low and the invertebrate fauna is exceptionally pristine with few, if any, (successful) human-induced introductions of alien species.\nTwo species, including the thrips ''Apterothrips apteris'' and the mite ''[[Tyrophagus putrescentiae]]'' are thought to be recent, possibly natural, introductions. An exotic species of earthworm ''[[Dendrodrilus rubidus]]'' was also collected in 1929 from a dump near Atlas Cove, and has recently been collected from a variety of habitats including wallows, streams and lakes on Heard Island.\n\nThe arthropods of Heard Island are comparatively well known with 54 species of [[mite]] and [[tick]], one [[spider]] and eight [[springtail]]s recorded. A study over summer at Atlas Cove in 1987/88 showed overall densities of up to 60 000 individual springtails per square metre in soil under stands of ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]''. Despite a few recent surveys, the non-arthropod invertebrate fauna of Heard Island remain poorly known.\n\nBeetles and flies dominate Heard Island's known insect fauna, which comprises up to 21 species of ectoparasite (associated with birds and seals) and up to 13 free-living species. Approximately half of the free-living insects are habitat-specific, while the remainder are generalists found in a variety of habitats, being associated with either supralittoral or intertidal zones, ''[[Poa cookii]]'' and ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' stands, [[bryophyte]]s, lichen-covered rocks, exposed rock faces or the underside of rocks. There is a pronounced seasonality to the insect fauna, with densities in winter months dropping to a small percentage (between 0.75%) of the summer maximum. Distinct differences in relative abundances of species between habitats has also been shown, including a negative relationship between altitude and body size for Heard Island weevils.\n\nThe fauna of the freshwater pools, lakes, streams and mires found in the coastal areas of Heard Island are broadly similar to those on other subantarctic islands of the southern Indian Ocean. Many species reported from Heard Island are found elsewhere. Some sampling of freshwater fauna has been undertaken during recent expeditions and records to date indicate that the freshwater fauna includes a species of [[Protista]], a gastrotrich, two species of [[tardigrade]], at least four species of nematode, 26 species of rotifer, six species of annelid and 14 species of arthropod.\n\nAs with the other shore biota, the marine macro-invertebrate fauna of Heard Island is similar in composition and local distribution to other subantarctic islands, although relatively little is known about the Heard Island communities compared with the well-studied fauna of some other islands in the subantarctic region, such as [[Macquarie Island|Macquarie]] and Kerguelen.\n\nDespite Heard Island's isolation, species richness is considered to be moderate, rather than depauperate, although the number of endemic species reported is low. The large macro-alga ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' supports a diverse array of invertebrate taxa and may play an important role in transporting some of this fauna to Heard Island.\n\nThe rocky shores of Heard Island exhibit a clear demarcation between fauna of the lower kelp holdfast zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet ''Nacella kerguelensis'' is abundant in the lower part of the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the chiton ''[[Hemiarthrum setulosum]]'' and the starfish ''Anasterias mawsoni''. The amphipod ''Hyale'' sp. and the isopod ''Cassidinopsis'' sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp holdfast zone, the littornid ''Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis'' and the bivalve mollusc ''Kidderia bicolor'' are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve ''Gaimardia trapesina trapesina'' has been recorded from immediately above the holdfast zone. Oligochaetes are also abundant in areas supporting porous and spongy layers of algal mat.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:FMIB 46007 Antarctic Sea-Elephant Fishery.jpeg|thumb|right|Heard Island 1887 by [[Henry Wood Elliott]]<ref>Goode, George Brown (1887) Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States, (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1887).</ref>]]\nNeither island-cluster had recorded visitors until the mid-1850s.\n\nAn American sailor, John Heard, on the ship ''Oriental'', sighted Heard Island on 25 November 1853, en route from [[Boston]] to Melbourne.

In the sailing period from 1855 to 1880 a number of American sealers spent a year or more on the island, living in appalling conditions in dark smelly huts, also at Oil Barrel Point. At its peak the community consisted of 200 people. By 1880 sealers had wiped out most of the seal population and then left the island. In all the islands furnished more than 100,000 barrels of [[elephant seal|elephant-seal]] oil during this period.\n\nA number of wrecks have occurred in the vicinity of the islands. There is also a discarded building left from John Heard's sealing station which is situated near Atlas Cove.\n\nThe first recorded landing on McDonald Island was made by Australian scientists Grahame Budd and Hugh Thelander on 12 February 1971, using a helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|title=SIOE 2002: Heard I. & The McDonald Is|date=1 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052000/http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|archive-date=26 April 2012|last=Cerchi|first=Dan|website=www.cerchi.net}}</ref><ref name=\"aad\">{{cite web|url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406140708/http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177  |archivedate=2011-04-06 |url-status=dead |title=Gazetteer - AADC Name Details - Australian Antarctic Data Centre |via=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=29 March 2016|website=[[Australian Antarctic Data Centre]]}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have been a territory of Australia since 1947, when they were transferred from the UK.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/> The archipelago became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997.\n\nThere were at least five private expeditions to Heard Island between 1965 and 2000.

Its northernmost range is said to be along the northern fringe of the [[Chugach Mountains]] in southcentral Alaska. Introduced populations can also be found in such areas as [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], [[South Dakota]], and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of Washington.\n\nMountain goats are the largest mammals found in their high-altitude [[habitat]]s, which can exceed elevations of 13,000 feet (4,000&nbsp;m). They sometimes descend to sea level in coastal areas although they are primarily an [[alpine climate|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] species. The animals usually stay above the [[tree line]] throughout the year but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range. Winter migrations to low-elevation [[Salt lick|mineral licks]] often take them several kilometers through forested areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mountain Goats|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/mountain-goats.htm|work=North Cascades National Park Service Complex|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Movement patterns ==\n[[File:Oreamnos americanus 21073.JPG|thumb|In the [[Cascade Range]], [[Mount Rainier National Park]], near the southwestern limit of their distribution.]]\nDaily movements by individual mountain goats are primarily confined to areas on the same mountain face, drainage basin, or alpine opening. Daily movements reflect an individual's needs for foraging, resting, [[thermoregulation]] and security from predators or disturbance. Seasonal movements primarily reflect nutritional needs (e.g., movements to and from mineral licks/[[salt lick]]), reproductive needs (i.e., movement of pre-parturient females to \"kidding\" areas; movement to rutting areas), and climatic influences (i.e., movement to areas in response to foraging conditions). In general, seasonal movements are likely to exhibit a strong elevational component, whereby lower, forested elevations are used during the spring-summer (security cover effects) to access lower elevation mineral licks, and during winter (thermal cover effects) to access forage. The farthest movements are expected to be by dispersing mountain goats. Such movements are likely to involve mountain goats crossing forested valleys as they move between mountain blocks.\n\n== Diet ==\n[[File:Mountain goat - artificial salt lick.jpg|thumb|upright|Young mountain goat licking handrail for salt]]\nMountain goats are herbivores and spend most of their time grazing. Their diets include [[grass]]es, [[herb]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, and twigs and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and [[conifer]]s of their high-altitude habitat.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.jpg|thumbnail|A mountain goat grazing at [[Mount Rushmore]], [[South Dakota]]]]\nIn captivity, the mountain goat's diet can also include grain, [[alfalfa]], fruits, vegetables and [[grass]].\n\n== Lifecycle and mating ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn the wild, mountain goats usually live 12 to 15 years, with their lifespans limited by the wearing down of their teeth. In zoos, however, they can live for 16 to 20 years.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat kid.jpg|thumb|Mountain goat kid at Cawridge, Alberta]]\nMountain goats reach sexual maturity at about 30 months.<ref>D. Chadwick (1983). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SMnXTHE5iWMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false A Beast the Color of Winter \u2013 The Mountain Goat Observed]''. [[Sierra Club Books]]. San Francisco. 208 p.</ref> Nannies in a herd undergo synchronized [[estrus]] in late October through early December, at which time males and females participate in a mating ritual. Mature billies stare at nannies for long periods, dig rutting pits, and fight each other in showy (though occasionally dangerous) scuffles. Young billies sometimes try to participate, but they are ignored by nannies; nannies also sometimes pursue inattentive billies. Both males and females usually mate with multiple individuals during breeding season, although some billies try to keep other males away from certain nannies. After the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult billies breaking up into small bands of two or three individuals. Nannies form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals.\n\n[[File:Wherever you go I will go.JPG|thumb|right|Mountain goat with kid in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]]]]\nKids are born in the spring (late May or early June) after a six-month gestation period. Nannies give birth, usually to a single offspring, after moving to an isolated ledge;'' post partum'', they lick the kid dry and ingest the [[placenta]]. Kids weigh a little over {{Convert|3|kg}} at birth and begin to run and climb (or attempt to do so) within hours. Although they are mostly weaned within one month, kids follow their mothers closely for the first year of life (or until the nanny gives birth again, if this does not occur the next breeding season); nannies protect their young by leading them out of danger, standing over them when faced by predators, and positioning themselves below their kids on steep slopes to stop freefalls.\n\n== Aggressive behavior ==\nNannies can be very competitive and protective of their space and food sources.  They fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the nannies in the herd.  In these battles, nannies circle each other with their heads lowered, displaying their horns.  As with fights between billies during breeding season, these conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or death, but are usually harmless.  To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of nonaggression by stretching low to the ground.\n\nIn regions below the tree line, nannies use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators. Predators, including [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[wolverine]]s, [[Canadian lynx|lynx]]es, and [[bear]]s, attack goats of most ages given the opportunity. The [[cougar|mountain lion]] is perhaps the primary predator, being powerful enough to overwhelm the largest adults and uniquely nimble enough to navigate the rocky ecosystem of the goats. Though their size protects them from most potential predators in higher altitudes, nannies must sometimes defend their young from both [[bald eagle|bald]] and [[golden eagle]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hamel|first1=Sandra|last2=C\u00f4t\u00e9|first2=Steeve D.|title=Maternal defensive behavior of mountain goats against predation by Golden Eagles|journal=Western North American Naturalist|date=2009|volume=69|issue=1|pages=115\u2013118|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wnan/vol69/iss1/13|language=en|issn=1527-0904|doi=10.3398/064.069.0103}}</ref> which can be a predatory threat to kids.<ref name= ADW /> Nannies have even been observed trying to dominate the more passive, but often heavier [[bighorn sheep]] that share some of their territory.\n\nMountain goats can occasionally be aggressive towards humans, with at least one reported fatality resulting from an attack by a mountain goat.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/428578_hiker17.html Hiker killed by mountain goat in Olympic Nat'l.

Introduced populations can also be found in such areas as [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], [[South Dakota]], and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of Washington.\n\nMountain goats are the largest mammals found in their high-altitude [[habitat]]s, which can exceed elevations of 13,000 feet (4,000&nbsp;m). They sometimes descend to sea level in coastal areas although they are primarily an [[alpine climate|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] species. The animals usually stay above the [[tree line]] throughout the year but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range. Winter migrations to low-elevation [[Salt lick|mineral licks]] often take them several kilometers through forested areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mountain Goats|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/mountain-goats.htm|work=North Cascades National Park Service Complex|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Movement patterns ==\n[[File:Oreamnos americanus 21073.JPG|thumb|In the [[Cascade Range]], [[Mount Rainier National Park]], near the southwestern limit of their distribution.]]\nDaily movements by individual mountain goats are primarily confined to areas on the same mountain face, drainage basin, or alpine opening. Daily movements reflect an individual's needs for foraging, resting, [[thermoregulation]] and security from predators or disturbance. Seasonal movements primarily reflect nutritional needs (e.g., movements to and from mineral licks/[[salt lick]]), reproductive needs (i.e., movement of pre-parturient females to \"kidding\" areas; movement to rutting areas), and climatic influences (i.e., movement to areas in response to foraging conditions). In general, seasonal movements are likely to exhibit a strong elevational component, whereby lower, forested elevations are used during the spring-summer (security cover effects) to access lower elevation mineral licks, and during winter (thermal cover effects) to access forage. The farthest movements are expected to be by dispersing mountain goats. Such movements are likely to involve mountain goats crossing forested valleys as they move between mountain blocks.\n\n== Diet ==\n[[File:Mountain goat - artificial salt lick.jpg|thumb|upright|Young mountain goat licking handrail for salt]]\nMountain goats are herbivores and spend most of their time grazing. Their diets include [[grass]]es, [[herb]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, and twigs and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and [[conifer]]s of their high-altitude habitat.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.jpg|thumbnail|A mountain goat grazing at [[Mount Rushmore]], [[South Dakota]]]]\nIn captivity, the mountain goat's diet can also include grain, [[alfalfa]], fruits, vegetables and [[grass]].\n\n== Lifecycle and mating ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn the wild, mountain goats usually live 12 to 15 years, with their lifespans limited by the wearing down of their teeth. In zoos, however, they can live for 16 to 20 years.\n\n[[File:Mountain goat kid.jpg|thumb|Mountain goat kid at Cawridge, Alberta]]\nMountain goats reach sexual maturity at about 30 months.<ref>D. Chadwick (1983). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SMnXTHE5iWMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false A Beast the Color of Winter \u2013 The Mountain Goat Observed]''. [[Sierra Club Books]]. San Francisco. 208 p.</ref> Nannies in a herd undergo synchronized [[estrus]] in late October through early December, at which time males and females participate in a mating ritual. Mature billies stare at nannies for long periods, dig rutting pits, and fight each other in showy (though occasionally dangerous) scuffles. Young billies sometimes try to participate, but they are ignored by nannies; nannies also sometimes pursue inattentive billies. Both males and females usually mate with multiple individuals during breeding season, although some billies try to keep other males away from certain nannies. After the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult billies breaking up into small bands of two or three individuals. Nannies form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals.\n\n[[File:Wherever you go I will go.JPG|thumb|right|Mountain goat with kid in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]]]]\nKids are born in the spring (late May or early June) after a six-month gestation period. Nannies give birth, usually to a single offspring, after moving to an isolated ledge;'' post partum'', they lick the kid dry and ingest the [[placenta]]. Kids weigh a little over {{Convert|3|kg}} at birth and begin to run and climb (or attempt to do so) within hours. Although they are mostly weaned within one month, kids follow their mothers closely for the first year of life (or until the nanny gives birth again, if this does not occur the next breeding season); nannies protect their young by leading them out of danger, standing over them when faced by predators, and positioning themselves below their kids on steep slopes to stop freefalls.\n\n== Aggressive behavior ==\nNannies can be very competitive and protective of their space and food sources.  They fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the nannies in the herd.  In these battles, nannies circle each other with their heads lowered, displaying their horns.  As with fights between billies during breeding season, these conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or death, but are usually harmless.  To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of nonaggression by stretching low to the ground.\n\nIn regions below the tree line, nannies use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators. Predators, including [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[wolverine]]s, [[Canadian lynx|lynx]]es, and [[bear]]s, attack goats of most ages given the opportunity. The [[cougar|mountain lion]] is perhaps the primary predator, being powerful enough to overwhelm the largest adults and uniquely nimble enough to navigate the rocky ecosystem of the goats. Though their size protects them from most potential predators in higher altitudes, nannies must sometimes defend their young from both [[bald eagle|bald]] and [[golden eagle]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hamel|first1=Sandra|last2=C\u00f4t\u00e9|first2=Steeve D.|title=Maternal defensive behavior of mountain goats against predation by Golden Eagles|journal=Western North American Naturalist|date=2009|volume=69|issue=1|pages=115\u2013118|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wnan/vol69/iss1/13|language=en|issn=1527-0904|doi=10.3398/064.069.0103}}</ref> which can be a predatory threat to kids.<ref name= ADW /> Nannies have even been observed trying to dominate the more passive, but often heavier [[bighorn sheep]] that share some of their territory.\n\nMountain goats can occasionally be aggressive towards humans, with at least one reported fatality resulting from an attack by a mountain goat.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/428578_hiker17.html Hiker killed by mountain goat in Olympic Nat'l.

Stunned by this news, the team collapsed and only won one of their remaining seven games and Belichick was fired. As part of the agreement to allow Modell to move, the city of Cleveland was allowed to keep the Browns name, the team's history from 1946 onward, and everything else associated with the Browns while Modell would receive a new franchise, which would become known as the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The Browns' roster would be transferred to Baltimore but the club would otherwise start from scratch as an expansion franchise would. The NFL also agreed that Cleveland would receive a new franchise once a stadium was built for it, and in 1999 the Browns franchise was reactivated under new ownership. The 1999 Browns were stocked by an [[expansion draft]], but were otherwise a continuation of the original 1946 franchise.\n\nThe team was documented in [[NFL Network]]'s ''[[A Football Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/NFL-Networks-A-FOOTBALL-LIFE-to-Return-912-20120828 |title=NFL Network's A FOOTBALL LIFE to Return 9/12 |publisher=tv.broadwayworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==Offseason==\n\n===NFL draft===\n{{main article|1995 NFL draft}}\n{{NFL team draft start\n | year     = 1995\n | teamname = Cleveland Browns\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 1\n | pick       = 30\n | player     = [[Craig Powell (American football)|Craig Powell]]\n | position   = [[Linebacker]]\n | college    = [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 3\n | pick       = 84\n | player     = [[Eric Zeier]]\n | position   = [[Quarterback]]\n | college    = [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 3\n | pick       = 94\n | player     = Mike Frederick\n | position   = [[Defensive end]]\n | college    = [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 5\n | pick       = 136\n | player     = Tau Pupua\n | position   = [[Defensive tackle]]\n | college    = [[Weber State Wildcats football|Weber State]]\n | notes      = \n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 5\n | pick       = 147\n | player     = Mike Miller\n | position   = [[Wide receiver]]\n | college    = [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]\n | notes      = \n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 7\n | pick       = 231\n | player     = A.

Stunned by this news, the team collapsed and only won one of their remaining seven games and Belichick was fired. As part of the agreement to allow Modell to move, the city of Cleveland was allowed to keep the Browns name, the team's history from 1946 onward, and everything else associated with the Browns while Modell would receive a new franchise, which would become known as the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The Browns' roster would be transferred to Baltimore but the club would otherwise start from scratch as an expansion franchise would. The NFL also agreed that Cleveland would receive a new franchise once a stadium was built for it, and in 1999 the Browns franchise was reactivated under new ownership. The 1999 Browns were stocked by an [[expansion draft]], but were otherwise a continuation of the original 1946 franchise.\n\nThe team was documented in [[NFL Network]]'s ''[[A Football Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/NFL-Networks-A-FOOTBALL-LIFE-to-Return-912-20120828 |title=NFL Network's A FOOTBALL LIFE to Return 9/12 |publisher=tv.broadwayworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==Offseason==\n\n===NFL draft===\n{{main article|1995 NFL draft}}\n{{NFL team draft start\n | year     = 1995\n | teamname = Cleveland Browns\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 1\n | pick       = 30\n | player     = [[Craig Powell (American football)|Craig Powell]]\n | position   = [[Linebacker]]\n | college    = [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 3\n | pick       = 84\n | player     = [[Eric Zeier]]\n | position   = [[Quarterback]]\n | college    = [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 3\n | pick       = 94\n | player     = Mike Frederick\n | position   = [[Defensive end]]\n | college    = [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 5\n | pick       = 136\n | player     = Tau Pupua\n | position   = [[Defensive tackle]]\n | college    = [[Weber State Wildcats football|Weber State]]\n | notes      = \n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 5\n | pick       = 147\n | player     = Mike Miller\n | position   = [[Wide receiver]]\n | college    = [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]\n | notes      = \n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 7\n | pick       = 231\n | player     = A.

He made 679 appearances during a 20-year professional career, and won 73 caps for [[England national football team|England]], highlighted by starting every game of the nation's [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] victory.\n\nBanks joined [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in March 1953, and played for their youth team in the 1956 [[FA Youth Cup]] final. He made his first team debut in November 1958, and was sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for \u00a37,000 in July 1959. He played in four cup finals for the club, as they were beaten in the [[1961 FA Cup Final|1961]] and [[1963 FA Cup Final|1963]] [[FA Cup]] finals, before winning the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in [[1964 Football League Cup Final|1964]] and finishing as finalists in [[1965 Football League Cup Final|1965]]. Despite this success, and his World Cup win in 1966, he was dropped by Leicester and sold on to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for \u00a350,000 in April 1967. In the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]],<ref name=\"ifhof\" /><ref name=\"pelgod\" /><ref name=\"keepstun\" /> he made one of the game's great saves to prevent a [[Pel\u00e9]] goal, but was absent due to illness as England were beaten by [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the quarter-final stage.\n\nBanks was Stoke City's goalkeeper in the [[1972 Football League Cup Final|1972 League Cup]] win\u2014the club's only major honour. He was still Stoke and England's number one when a car crash in October 1972 cost him both the sight in his right eye, and eventually, his professional career. He played two last seasons in the United States for the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977\u20131983)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 1977 and 1978, and despite only having vision in one eye, was [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL]] Goalkeeper of the Year in 1977 after posting the best defensive record in the league. He briefly entered management with [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]], but left the game in December 1980.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, Banks was named [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1972, and was named [[FIFA]] Goalkeeper of the Year on six occasions. The [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]] named Banks the second-best goalkeeper of the 20th century, after [[Lev Yashin]] (1st) and ahead of [[Dino Zoff]] (3rd).<ref>{{cite web|last=Stokkermans|first=Karel|title=IFFHS' Century Elections|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html|work=RSSSF|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nBanks was born in [[Abbeydale, Sheffield]], and brought up in the working-class area of [[Tinsley, South Yorkshire|Tinsley]].<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=6}}</ref> The family later moved to the village of [[Catcliffe]] after his father set up a (then-illegal) [[betting shop]].<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=11}}</ref> This brought greater prosperity but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=12}}</ref> Banks left school in December 1952, aged 15, and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength.<ref name=\"page 13\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=13}}</ref> He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys.<ref name=\"page 13\" /> His performances there earned him a game in the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]] for [[Rawmarsh Welfare F.C.|Rawmarsh Welfare]], however a 12\u20132 defeat to [[Stocksbridge Works F.C.|Stocksbridge Works]] on his debut was followed by a 3\u20131 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh.<ref name=\"page 14\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=14}}</ref> Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a [[Brick hod|hod carrier]].<ref name=\"page 14\" />\n\n== Club career ==\n=== Chesterfield ===\nHe was scouted by [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] whilst playing for Millspaugh, and offered a six-game trial in the youth team in March 1953.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=15}}</ref> He impressed enough in these games to be offered a part-time \u00a33-a-week contract by manager [[Teddy Davison]] in July 1953.<ref name=\"page 17\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=17}}</ref> The reserve team were placed in [[the Central League]] on account of a powerful club director rather than on merit, and Banks conceded 122 goals in the 1954\u201355 season as the \"Spireites\" finished in last place with only three victories.<ref name=\"page 17\" /> Banks was posted to Germany with the [[Royal Corps of Signals|Royal Signals]] on [[national service]], and won the Rhine Cup with his regimental team.<ref name=\"page 20\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=20}}</ref> He recovered from a fractured elbow to help the Chesterfield youth team to the 1956 final of the [[FA Youth Cup]].<ref name=\"page 20\" /> There they were beaten 4\u20133 on aggregate by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s famous \"[[Busby Babes]]\"\u2014a team that included both [[Wilf McGuinness]] and [[Bobby Charlton]].<ref name=\"page 22\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=22}}</ref>\n\nBanks was given his first team debut by manager [[Doug Livingstone]], at the expense of long-serving [[Ron Powell]], in a [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] game against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] at [[Saltergate]] in November 1958.<ref name=\"page 23\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=23}}</ref> The game ended 2\u20132, and Banks kept his place against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the following match; by the end of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359]] season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury.<ref name=\"page 25\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=25}}</ref> With no goalkeeping coach to guide him, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=26}}</ref> Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when [[Matt Gillies]], manager of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], bought him from Chesterfield for \u00a37,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to \u00a315 a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=27}}</ref>\n\n=== Leicester City ===\nBanks faced competition from five other goalkeepers, including 30-year-old [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[Johnny Anderson (footballer)|Johnny Anderson]] and 25-year-old [[Dave MacLaren]].<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=29}}</ref> He started the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] season as the reserve team's goalkeeper.

as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. He made 679 appearances during a 20-year professional career, and won 73 caps for [[England national football team|England]], highlighted by starting every game of the nation's [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] victory.\n\nBanks joined [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in March 1953, and played for their youth team in the 1956 [[FA Youth Cup]] final. He made his first team debut in November 1958, and was sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for \u00a37,000 in July 1959. He played in four cup finals for the club, as they were beaten in the [[1961 FA Cup Final|1961]] and [[1963 FA Cup Final|1963]] [[FA Cup]] finals, before winning the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in [[1964 Football League Cup Final|1964]] and finishing as finalists in [[1965 Football League Cup Final|1965]]. Despite this success, and his World Cup win in 1966, he was dropped by Leicester and sold on to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] for \u00a350,000 in April 1967. In the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]],<ref name=\"ifhof\" /><ref name=\"pelgod\" /><ref name=\"keepstun\" /> he made one of the game's great saves to prevent a [[Pel\u00e9]] goal, but was absent due to illness as England were beaten by [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the quarter-final stage.\n\nBanks was Stoke City's goalkeeper in the [[1972 Football League Cup Final|1972 League Cup]] win\u2014the club's only major honour. He was still Stoke and England's number one when a car crash in October 1972 cost him both the sight in his right eye, and eventually, his professional career. He played two last seasons in the United States for the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977\u20131983)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 1977 and 1978, and despite only having vision in one eye, was [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL]] Goalkeeper of the Year in 1977 after posting the best defensive record in the league. He briefly entered management with [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]], but left the game in December 1980.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, Banks was named [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1972, and was named [[FIFA]] Goalkeeper of the Year on six occasions. The [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]] named Banks the second-best goalkeeper of the 20th century, after [[Lev Yashin]] (1st) and ahead of [[Dino Zoff]] (3rd).<ref>{{cite web|last=Stokkermans|first=Karel|title=IFFHS' Century Elections|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html|work=RSSSF|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nBanks was born in [[Abbeydale, Sheffield]], and brought up in the working-class area of [[Tinsley, South Yorkshire|Tinsley]].<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=6}}</ref> The family later moved to the village of [[Catcliffe]] after his father set up a (then-illegal) [[betting shop]].<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=11}}</ref> This brought greater prosperity but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=12}}</ref> Banks left school in December 1952, aged 15, and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength.<ref name=\"page 13\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=13}}</ref> He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys.<ref name=\"page 13\" /> His performances there earned him a game in the [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire League]] for [[Rawmarsh Welfare F.C.|Rawmarsh Welfare]], however a 12\u20132 defeat to [[Stocksbridge Works F.C.|Stocksbridge Works]] on his debut was followed by a 3\u20131 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh.<ref name=\"page 14\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=14}}</ref> Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a [[Brick hod|hod carrier]].<ref name=\"page 14\" />\n\n== Club career ==\n=== Chesterfield ===\nHe was scouted by [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] whilst playing for Millspaugh, and offered a six-game trial in the youth team in March 1953.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=15}}</ref> He impressed enough in these games to be offered a part-time \u00a33-a-week contract by manager [[Teddy Davison]] in July 1953.<ref name=\"page 17\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=17}}</ref> The reserve team were placed in [[the Central League]] on account of a powerful club director rather than on merit, and Banks conceded 122 goals in the 1954\u201355 season as the \"Spireites\" finished in last place with only three victories.<ref name=\"page 17\" /> Banks was posted to Germany with the [[Royal Corps of Signals|Royal Signals]] on [[national service]], and won the Rhine Cup with his regimental team.<ref name=\"page 20\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=20}}</ref> He recovered from a fractured elbow to help the Chesterfield youth team to the 1956 final of the [[FA Youth Cup]].<ref name=\"page 20\" /> There they were beaten 4\u20133 on aggregate by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s famous \"[[Busby Babes]]\"\u2014a team that included both [[Wilf McGuinness]] and [[Bobby Charlton]].<ref name=\"page 22\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=22}}</ref>\n\nBanks was given his first team debut by manager [[Doug Livingstone]], at the expense of long-serving [[Ron Powell]], in a [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] game against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] at [[Saltergate]] in November 1958.<ref name=\"page 23\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=23}}</ref> The game ended 2\u20132, and Banks kept his place against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the following match; by the end of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359]] season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury.<ref name=\"page 25\">{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=25}}</ref> With no goalkeeping coach to guide him, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=26}}</ref> Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when [[Matt Gillies]], manager of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], bought him from Chesterfield for \u00a37,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to \u00a315 a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=27}}</ref>\n\n=== Leicester City ===\nBanks faced competition from five other goalkeepers, including 30-year-old [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[Johnny Anderson (footballer)|Johnny Anderson]] and 25-year-old [[Dave MacLaren]].<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=29}}</ref> He started the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] season as the reserve team's goalkeeper. This in effect made him the club's second choice, ahead of four of his rivals but behind first team choice MacLaren.<ref>{{harvnb|Banks|2002|p=30}}</ref> He had played four reserve team games when MacLaren picked up an injury, and manager Matt Gillies selected Banks for his Leicester debut against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at [[Filbert Street]] on 9 September.

The first case was identified on 9 March,<ref name=\"firstcase\"/> and transmission within the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 24 March.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> As of 13 April, there have been 219 cases identified in the Bailiwick, all in Guernsey,{{refn|group=note|'Guernsey' refers to the entire jurisdiction of Guernsey, which includes the island of Guernsey as well as the three inhabited islands of [[Herm]], [[Jethou]] and [[Lihou]].}} and 6 people are confirmed to have died from the infection.{{refn|group=note|The States of Guernsey has also recorded (separately) 3 'presumptive' deaths presumed to be due to COVID-19.}}\n\nThe [[States of Guernsey]] response is led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA), a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island, chaired by [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey#List of heads of government of Guernsey|Chief Minister]] [[Gavin St Pier]].

Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days.

As first built &ndash; as a terminus &ndash; the station had four tracks, although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in 1854. Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks, which serve Platform 1 (for trains towards Cambridge or Peterborough) and Platform 2 (for trains towards Ipswich and Harwich International).<ref>{{cite book|author=Biddle, Gordon|title=Britain's Historic Railway Buildings|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-866247-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk|journal=Great Eastern Journal|issue=106|pages=23\u20139|date=April 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station, which like the station building is a Grade II [[listed building]], has been credited to [[Frederick Barnes (architect)|Frederick Barnes]] (who was a partner of Sancton Wood) and Charles Russell.\n\nThe two platforms are connected by a subway.\n\n===Goods facilities===\nA goods yard was situated on the down side west of the station.\n\n==Engine Shed==\nThe first engine shed was located immediately west of the railway station when Bury St Edmunds was a terminus station for the Ipswich and Bury Railway. The opening of the line to Cambridge in 1854 saw the end of this first shed as it was in the way of the new line. A new engine shed of wooden construction was established on the north side of the line again west of the station. This shed deteriorated over the years and inclement weather in 1901 finished the structure off. The Great Eastern Railway, often parsimonious in matters relating to the locomotive department, left it until 1904 before a new three-road brick built shed with a north-light roof was built.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Chris|last2=Reeve|first2=George|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Part 2|date=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|isbn=0 906867 487|pages=267\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Ipswich district in 1914 the shed had 30 men under a fitter-in-charge.

At this time it acquired two sub-sheds at Sudbury and Haverhill. By 1950 under British Railways this had fallen to 14 but increased to 16 in 1954.\n\nAlthough the shed was re-roofed in 1953, the shed was closed to traffic on 5 January 1959 and demolished later that year.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Chris|last2=Reeve|first2=George|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Part 2|date=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|isbn=0 906867 487|pages=267\u2013274}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stn art lrnk|BSE|IP326AD}}\n* [http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#585,264,1 Bury St Edmunds station on navigable 1946 O.S. map]\n\n{{coord|52.254|N|0.713|E|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations in Suffolk]]\n[[Category:Grade II listed railway stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1847]]\n[[Category:Former Great Eastern Railway stations]]\n[[Category:Greater Anglia franchise railway stations]]\n[[Category:Bury St Edmunds]]\n[[Category:1847 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Railway depots in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Grade II listed railway station in Suffolk, England}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox GB station\n| symbol       = rail\n| name         = Bury St Edmunds\n| image_name   = 2018 at Bury St Edmunds station - forecourt.JPG\n| caption      = \n| manager      = [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]]\n| locale       = [[Bury St Edmunds]]\n| borough      = [[West Suffolk (district)|West Suffolk]]\n<!-- | usage0203 = {{pad|1em}} 0.204\n| usage0405 = {{increase}} 0.211\n| usage0506 = {{increase}} 0.241\n| usage0607 = {{increase}} 0.275\n| usage0708 = {{increase}} 0.374\n| usage0809 = {{increase}} 0.416\n| usage0910 = {{increase}} 0.420\n| usage1011 = {{increase}} 0.470\n| lowint1011 = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 217\n| usage1112 = {{increase}} 0.488\n| lowint1112 = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 225\n| usage1213 = {{increase}} 0.566\n| lowint1213 = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 257\n| usage1314 = {{increase}} 0.578\n| lowint1314 = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 310 -->\n| usage1415 = {{increase}} 0.596\n| lowint1415 = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 514\n| usage1516 = {{increase}} 0.604\n| lowint1516 = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 380\n| usage1617 = {{increase}} 0.633\n| lowint1617 = {{pad|1em}}{{decrease}} 348\n| usage1718 = {{increase}} 0.652\n| lowint1718 = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 401\n| usage1819 = {{increase}} 0.665\n| lowint1819 = {{pad|1em}}{{increase}} 518\n| platforms    = 2\n| start        = 1847\n| code         = BSE\n| dft_category = C2\n| gridref      = TL852651\n}}\n'''Bury St Edmunds railway station''' serves the town of [[Bury St Edmunds]] in [[Suffolk]], [[England]].

As first built &ndash; as a terminus &ndash; the station had four tracks, although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in 1854. Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks, which serve Platform 1 (for trains towards Cambridge or Peterborough) and Platform 2 (for trains towards Ipswich and Harwich International).<ref>{{cite book|author=Biddle, Gordon|title=Britain's Historic Railway Buildings|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-866247-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk|journal=Great Eastern Journal|issue=106|pages=23\u20139|date=April 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station, which like the station building is a Grade II [[listed building]], has been credited to [[Frederick Barnes (architect)|Frederick Barnes]] (who was a partner of Sancton Wood) and Charles Russell.\n\nThe two platforms are connected by a subway.\n\n===Goods facilities===\nA goods yard was situated on the down side west of the station.\n\n==Engine Shed==\nThe first engine shed was located immediately west of the railway station when Bury St Edmunds was a terminus station for the Ipswich and Bury Railway. The opening of the line to Cambridge in 1854 saw the end of this first shed as it was in the way of the new line. A new engine shed of wooden construction was established on the north side of the line again west of the station. This shed deteriorated over the years and inclement weather in 1901 finished the structure off. The Great Eastern Railway, often parsimonious in matters relating to the locomotive department, left it until 1904 before a new three-road brick built shed with a north-light roof was built.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Chris|last2=Reeve|first2=George|title=Great Eastern Engine Sheds Part 2|date=1987|publisher=Wild Swan|isbn=0 906867 487|pages=267\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Ipswich district in 1914 the shed had 30 men under a fitter-in-charge.

The village of [[Hume, Scottish Borders|Hume]] is located between [[Greenlaw]] and [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]], two miles north of the village of [[Stichill]], in [[Berwickshire]], [[Scotland]].

It had historically been used as a [[beacon]] to warn of invasion.\nIts enormous walls were created in the 18th century but remnants of the central keep and other features can still be seen.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nWilliam de Home, son of Sir Patrick de Greenlaw (a younger son of [[Gospatric III, Earl of Lothian|Cospatric I, Earl of Dunbar]]), acquired the lands of Home in the early 13th century through marriage to his cousin Ada (the daughter of [[Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar]]). He then took his surname from his estate, a not uncommon practice of the time. It is assumed that he built the first stone fortifications at the site.\n\n[[James II of Scotland|James II]] stayed at Home en route to the siege of [[Roxburgh Castle]], the last English garrison left in Scotland following the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Wars of Independence]]. (James was killed by an early [[bombard (weapon)|bombard]] during the siege.)\n\n[[File:FollyPlaque.jpg|thumb|250px|Plaque at the foot of Hume Castle hill]]\n\n===Sixteenth century and the Rough Wooing ===\nIn August 1515 [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Regent Albany]] imprisoned members of the Hume family at [[Dunfermline]], with Adam Tinmo, the Constable of Hume Castle. At this time, Scotland's Governor Regent Albany was planning to bring an army against the Hume family on the Scottish borders. Albany had captured Hume Castle, but according to a report of [[Cardinal Wolsey]]'s chaplain, William Frankelayn, [[Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home|Lord Hume]], [[Chamberlain of Scotland|Lord Chamberlain]], retook the castle on 26 August, and kept Albany's captain, [[Lord Fleming]]'s uncle, prisoner. Lord Hume then [[Slighting|slighted]] his own castle, razed the walls, \"and dammed the well for ever more.\" <ref>''Letters & Papers of Henry VIII'', vol.2 (1864), no.861.</ref>\n\nBefore the advent of [[artillery]], Hume castle was considered  almost impregnable. However, in 1547 it was captured, during the \"[[Rough Wooing]]\", by the [[Lord Protector Somerset]]. [[Regent Arran]] had sent 12 [[arquebus|gunners]] to man the castle in August 1547.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 9, (1911), 100.</ref> [[George Home, 4th Lord Home]], was injured at the [[Battle of Pinkie]] and his son Alexander captured,  After stout resistance by [[Mariotta Haliburton|Mariotta (or Marion) Haliburton]] Lady Home, the castle fell and an English garrison installed. According to an English account, the castle was rendered by the negotiation of Lady Home after the English army encamped nearby at [[the Hirsel]] or Hare Craig. Although English artillery was placed to commence bombardment, no shot was fired by either side. [[Somerset Herald]] conveyed Lady Home's instructions to the reluctant garrison who would have preferred Lord Home's word. [[Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley|Sir Edward Sutton]], described as a cousin of the [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Earl of Warwick]], was made Captain of Hume, and received the keys from Andrew Home, [[Abbot of Jedburgh|Commendator of Jedburgh and Restennet]], on Thursday 22 September 1547. There were seventy-eight Scots within, and Edward Sutton found guns including; 2 [[culverin|batard culverins]]; a [[saker (cannon)|saker]]; 3 [[falconet (cannon)|brass falconets]]; and eight other iron guns.<ref>[[William Patten (historian)|Patten, William]], ''The Expedition into Scotland, 1547'', London (1548): Pollard, A.

The soldiers planned to rob him and change sides. Loyal members of the garrison fired the beacon and Sir John Ellerker's men arrested the would-be deserters. One was killed escaping, and [[William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton|Grey of Wilton]] planned to hang six of them, but the two leaders escaped into Scotland.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 76-7, 101: ''Calendar of State Papers Spain'', vol. 9, (1912), 260.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his father, captive in the [[Tower of London|Tower]], Alexander, the young [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home|5th Lord Home]], with the help of his brother Andrew the Commendator, recaptured the castle in December 1548.

The Earls of Home had already established a new seat at [[The Hirsel]] by 1611. However, the castle finally succumbed to the forces of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] in 1650 during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. [[James Home, 3rd Earl of Home|James, 3rd Earl of Home]] was a prominent member of the [[Kirk Party]], and after Cromwell's successful investiture of  [[Edinburgh Castle]], he sent [[George Fenwick (Parliamentarian)|Colonel George Fenwick]] to beset the Earl's Castle with two regiments. Catherine Morrison, the Lady of Wedderburn, paid \u00a36 to bring cannon to defend Hume.<ref>HMC, ''Home of Wedderburn'', (1902), 102</ref> [[John Cockburn (Scottish officer)|Colonel John Cockburn]], the castle's Scottish governor,<ref>Cockburn, Sir Robert, and Harry A.

Colonel Cockburn feigned that he had no idea who Cromwell was and that the castle stood on a rock. He then sent a note to Fenwick with the following doggerel: \n:\"I, Will of the Wastle\n:Am King of my castle\n:All the dogs in the town \n:Shall gare gang me down!\"<ref name=humehistory>{{cite web |url=http://humecastle.org/castle-history/ |title=Castle History |publisher=Hume Castle Preservation Trust  |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever once the bombardment began, it became clear  that there was no option but submission. Fenwick's troops entered the castle, and accepted Cockburn's surrender. Cockburn and his men were given quarter for life only. They retreated and Fenwick [[slighting|slighted]] the fortification.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/58561/hume-castle |title=Hume Castle |publisher=Historic Environment Scotland |work=Canmore |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrection ===\n[[File:Hume Battlements.JPG|thumb|250px|Crenellation at Hume]]\nIn the early 18th century, Hume and its environs came into the possession of the [[Lord Polwarth|Earls of Marchmont]],  wealthier and more influential cadets of the main line of the family. The Castle at this point was level with the ground that it was built upon. \nAt some point before his death in 1794, Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, 3rd Lord Polwarth, restored the castle as a [[folly]], from the waste left from its destruction, on the original foundations of its [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. He adorned the wall tops with enormous [[crenellations]] that are  more picturesque than practical.\n\n=== The Great Alarm ===\nIn light of its function as a medi\u00e6val early warning system, the castle was used again as a beacon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1804, on the night of 31 January, a sergeant of the Berwickshire Volunteers in charge of the beacon mistook charcoal burners' fires on nearby [[Dirrington Great Law]] for a warning. Lighting the beacon at Hume Castle, he set in train the lighting of all the Borders beacons to the West, and 3,000 volunteers turned out in what became known as 'The Great Alarm'.<ref name=humehistory/>\n\nAgain, during the [[Second World War]] it functioned as a lookout post, and was also to act as a base for resistance in the event of a German invasion.\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe castle is still seen as the spiritual home of the many Homes and Humes in Scotland and abroad. The castle was bought by the state in 1929, and in 1985 a restoration programme was undertaken by the [[Berwickshire Civic Society]] funded by the [[Scottish Office]].

The village of [[Hume, Scottish Borders|Hume]] is located between [[Greenlaw]] and [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]], two miles north of the village of [[Stichill]], in [[Berwickshire]], [[Scotland]]. (OS ref.- NT704413). It is a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]], recorded as such by [[Historic Environment Scotland]].<ref>{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=SM387|desc=Hume Castle, castle and associated settlement|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nStanding as it does, on an impressive height above its eponymous [[castle town|''castleton'']], it commands fine prospects across the [[Merse (Scotland)|Merse]], with views to the [[England|English]] border at [[Carter Bar]]. It had historically been used as a [[beacon]] to warn of invasion.\nIts enormous walls were created in the 18th century but remnants of the central keep and other features can still be seen.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nWilliam de Home, son of Sir Patrick de Greenlaw (a younger son of [[Gospatric III, Earl of Lothian|Cospatric I, Earl of Dunbar]]), acquired the lands of Home in the early 13th century through marriage to his cousin Ada (the daughter of [[Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar]]). He then took his surname from his estate, a not uncommon practice of the time. It is assumed that he built the first stone fortifications at the site.\n\n[[James II of Scotland|James II]] stayed at Home en route to the siege of [[Roxburgh Castle]], the last English garrison left in Scotland following the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Wars of Independence]]. (James was killed by an early [[bombard (weapon)|bombard]] during the siege.)\n\n[[File:FollyPlaque.jpg|thumb|250px|Plaque at the foot of Hume Castle hill]]\n\n===Sixteenth century and the Rough Wooing ===\nIn August 1515 [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Regent Albany]] imprisoned members of the Hume family at [[Dunfermline]], with Adam Tinmo, the Constable of Hume Castle. At this time, Scotland's Governor Regent Albany was planning to bring an army against the Hume family on the Scottish borders. Albany had captured Hume Castle, but according to a report of [[Cardinal Wolsey]]'s chaplain, William Frankelayn, [[Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home|Lord Hume]], [[Chamberlain of Scotland|Lord Chamberlain]], retook the castle on 26 August, and kept Albany's captain, [[Lord Fleming]]'s uncle, prisoner. Lord Hume then [[Slighting|slighted]] his own castle, razed the walls, \"and dammed the well for ever more.\" <ref>''Letters & Papers of Henry VIII'', vol.2 (1864), no.861.</ref>\n\nBefore the advent of [[artillery]], Hume castle was considered  almost impregnable. However, in 1547 it was captured, during the \"[[Rough Wooing]]\", by the [[Lord Protector Somerset]]. [[Regent Arran]] had sent 12 [[arquebus|gunners]] to man the castle in August 1547.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 9, (1911), 100.</ref> [[George Home, 4th Lord Home]], was injured at the [[Battle of Pinkie]] and his son Alexander captured,  After stout resistance by [[Mariotta Haliburton|Mariotta (or Marion) Haliburton]] Lady Home, the castle fell and an English garrison installed. According to an English account, the castle was rendered by the negotiation of Lady Home after the English army encamped nearby at [[the Hirsel]] or Hare Craig. Although English artillery was placed to commence bombardment, no shot was fired by either side. [[Somerset Herald]] conveyed Lady Home's instructions to the reluctant garrison who would have preferred Lord Home's word. [[Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley|Sir Edward Sutton]], described as a cousin of the [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Earl of Warwick]], was made Captain of Hume, and received the keys from Andrew Home, [[Abbot of Jedburgh|Commendator of Jedburgh and Restennet]], on Thursday 22 September 1547. There were seventy-eight Scots within, and Edward Sutton found guns including; 2 [[culverin|batard culverins]]; a [[saker (cannon)|saker]]; 3 [[falconet (cannon)|brass falconets]]; and eight other iron guns.<ref>[[William Patten (historian)|Patten, William]], ''The Expedition into Scotland, 1547'', London (1548): Pollard, A. F., ''Tudor Tracts'', Constable (1903), 142-145.</ref> More guns were brought to hold the castle, and an English [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of 31 December 1547]] lists 21 cannons including 4 [[veuglaire|fowlers]], and 40 [[arquebus|hand-guns]].<ref>Starkey, David, ed., ''The Inventory of Henry VIII'', vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries, (1998), 143.</ref> Minor strengthening work was carried out by the English, on the advice of the military engineer William Ridgeway, but only \u00a3734 was spent, the local stone was unsuitable and limestone at [[Roxburgh]] too far away.<ref>Colvin, Howard, ed., ''The History of the King's Works'', vol. 4 part 2, HMSO (1982), 699, 706, citing PRO SP15/2 f.81, SP10/15/11.</ref>\n\nMariotta, Lady Home, complained to [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Somerset]] on 2 November 1547 that she had, \"been very sore examined for the rendering of Hume\", and accused of taking money. Her reply was she thought it marvellous that anyone could think she could keep the \"sober barmkin\" of Hume against the English army, when all the nobles of Scotland could not keep the field.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 36, no. 75.</ref> Hume was nearly lost in February 1548, when Captain Pelham travelled to [[Warkworth Castle]] to collect pay for the Spanish mercenary garrison. The soldiers planned to rob him and change sides. Loyal members of the garrison fired the beacon and Sir John Ellerker's men arrested the would-be deserters. One was killed escaping, and [[William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton|Grey of Wilton]] planned to hang six of them, but the two leaders escaped into Scotland.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 76-7, 101: ''Calendar of State Papers Spain'', vol. 9, (1912), 260.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his father, captive in the [[Tower of London|Tower]], Alexander, the young [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home|5th Lord Home]], with the help of his brother Andrew the Commendator, recaptured the castle in December 1548. The first man in was Tulloch, a servant of the laird of Buccleuch.<ref>Cameron, Annie, I., ''Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine'', (1927), 280-281, 283, 288, Tulloch was killed while firing the gate of [[Ferniehirst Castle]] in Feb. 1549.</ref> Edward Sutton was blamed for losing the castle by negligence to a night assault. [[Jean de Beaugu\u00e9]], a French soldier and writer, gave an account of the re-capture. He said that an inside-man let in seven Scots, and at night an eighth man climbed in. These then overwhelmed the garrison. In Jean's account the man who climbed the wall was a Home, aged 60.<ref>Beaugu\u00e9, Jean de, ''History of the Campaigns of 1548 and 1549'', (1707), 77-82.</ref> Sutton was still a prisoner at the end of the war, and the [[Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]] was asked to organise his release by the exchange of French hostages.<ref>John Roche Dasent, ''Acts of the Privy Council'', vol. 2, HMSO (1890), 421.</ref>\n\nMariotta, Lady Home, sent the news to [[Mary of Guise]] on 28 December 1548 from Edinburgh. [[Regent Arran]] thanked John Hume of Cowdenknowes for his service recovering the castle. The English unsuccessfully attempted to recapture Hume in February 1549.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 9, (1911), 264, 285.</ref> Lady Home was once again installed in the castle in March 1549 and complained to Mary of Guise in March 1549 of the behaviour of the French and Spanish garrison obtaining credit from the villagers.<ref>Cameron, Annie, I., ed., ''Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine'', SHS, (1927), 280-281, 283 & n., 296-297, no. CCVI.</ref> When the English abandoned their fort at [[Thirlestane Castle|Lauder]] the guns there were dragged by oxen to Hume Castle.<ref>''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 9, (1911), 421, 423.</ref>\n\nMary of Guise ordered the people of Sherriffdom of Berwick and Lauderdale to provide 320 oxen to remove the guns from Hume in February 1558. The cannons were taken to the fort at [[Eyemouth]].<ref>Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1913), lxxi, 333-334.</ref> The castle was again besieged at the end of April 1570 by the [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex|Earl of Sussex]] during his raid into Scotland. The defenders capitulated within twelve hours, in awe of his superior numbers and the firepower of \"three battery pieces and two sakers\" brought from [[Wark Castle]].<ref>[[Edmund Lodge]], ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 3 (London, 1791), p. 43.</ref> [[Regent Morton]] gave money to Agnes Gray, Lady Home, in the 1570s to keep the castle garrisoned for [[James VI]].<ref>''HMC 12th report appendix part VIII, Earl of Home'' (London, 1891), 100</ref>\n\n=== Downfall ===\n\nThe 17th century saw the demise of Hume Castle as a habitable fortress. The Earls of Home had already established a new seat at [[The Hirsel]] by 1611. However, the castle finally succumbed to the forces of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] in 1650 during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. [[James Home, 3rd Earl of Home|James, 3rd Earl of Home]] was a prominent member of the [[Kirk Party]], and after Cromwell's successful investiture of  [[Edinburgh Castle]], he sent [[George Fenwick (Parliamentarian)|Colonel George Fenwick]] to beset the Earl's Castle with two regiments. Catherine Morrison, the Lady of Wedderburn, paid \u00a36 to bring cannon to defend Hume.<ref>HMC, ''Home of Wedderburn'', (1902), 102</ref> [[John Cockburn (Scottish officer)|Colonel John Cockburn]], the castle's Scottish governor,<ref>Cockburn, Sir Robert, and Harry A. Cockburn, ''The Records of the Cockburn Family'', T. N. Foulis, London, 1913.</ref> engaged in witty repartee with the [[Roundheads]], but refused to deliver the castle. Colonel Cockburn feigned that he had no idea who Cromwell was and that the castle stood on a rock. He then sent a note to Fenwick with the following doggerel: \n:\"I, Will of the Wastle\n:Am King of my castle\n:All the dogs in the town \n:Shall gare gang me down!\"<ref name=humehistory>{{cite web |url=http://humecastle.org/castle-history/ |title=Castle History |publisher=Hume Castle Preservation Trust  |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever once the bombardment began, it became clear  that there was no option but submission. Fenwick's troops entered the castle, and accepted Cockburn's surrender. Cockburn and his men were given quarter for life only. They retreated and Fenwick [[slighting|slighted]] the fortification.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/58561/hume-castle |title=Hume Castle |publisher=Historic Environment Scotland |work=Canmore |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrection ===\n[[File:Hume Battlements.JPG|thumb|250px|Crenellation at Hume]]\nIn the early 18th century, Hume and its environs came into the possession of the [[Lord Polwarth|Earls of Marchmont]],  wealthier and more influential cadets of the main line of the family. The Castle at this point was level with the ground that it was built upon. \nAt some point before his death in 1794, Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, 3rd Lord Polwarth, restored the castle as a [[folly]], from the waste left from its destruction, on the original foundations of its [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. He adorned the wall tops with enormous [[crenellations]] that are  more picturesque than practical.\n\n=== The Great Alarm ===\nIn light of its function as a medi\u00e6val early warning system, the castle was used again as a beacon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1804, on the night of 31 January, a sergeant of the Berwickshire Volunteers in charge of the beacon mistook charcoal burners' fires on nearby [[Dirrington Great Law]] for a warning. Lighting the beacon at Hume Castle, he set in train the lighting of all the Borders beacons to the West, and 3,000 volunteers turned out in what became known as 'The Great Alarm'.<ref name=humehistory/>\n\nAgain, during the [[Second World War]] it functioned as a lookout post, and was also to act as a base for resistance in the event of a German invasion.\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe castle is still seen as the spiritual home of the many Homes and Humes in Scotland and abroad. The castle was bought by the state in 1929, and in 1985 a restoration programme was undertaken by the [[Berwickshire Civic Society]] funded by the [[Scottish Office]]. It re-opened to the public in 1992. \nIn 2006 the Civic Society handed over the castle to a charitable trust run by the Clan Home Association, under the auspices of [[Historic Scotland]], to maintain its preservation in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humecastle.org/ |title=Welcome to the Hume Castle Preservation Trust |publisher=Hume Castle Preservation Trust  |accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of places in the Scottish Borders]]\n*[[Clan Home]]\n*[[Hume (surname)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Ordnance Gazetteer-Scotland Vol IV,ed.
