{"title_page": "Torah Umadda", "text_new": "{{short description|The relationship between the secular world and Judaism}}\n'''''Torah Umadda''''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05bc\u05de\u05b7\u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2}}, \"Torah and secular knowledge\") is a [[philosophy]] of [[Orthodox Judaism]] concerning the relationship between the [[secular]] world and [[Judaism]], and in particular between secular knowledge and Jewish religious knowledge. The resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism is referred to as ''Centrist Orthodoxy''.\n\n==History==\n''Torah Umadda'' is closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]]. The actual philosophy underlying the combination of Torah and secular wisdom at Yeshiva University was variously articulated, first by [[Bernard Revel]], by his successors [[Samuel Belkin]] and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik|Joseph Soloveitchik]], and most recently, and formally, by [[Norman Lamm]]. Although its roots go back to 1886, it was only in 1946 that the University adopted \"Torah Umadda\" as its slogan. (In 2005, Yeshiva University president [[Richard Joel]] initiated a campaign to append the phrase \"Bringing wisdom to life\", as a \"tag-line\" to the university's motto.)<ref>[http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2005/09/yus-new-tag-line.html Hirhurim.blogspot.com]</ref> Today, Yeshiva University publishes the ''Torah Umadda Journal'' which \"explores the complex relationships between Torah, the humanities, and the natural and social sciences\", as well as studies on related topics in the ''Library of Jewish Law and Ethics'' (with Ktav Publishing House).\n\nThe phrase itself is thought to originate with [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]], who mentions \"Torah u-Madda\" in his [[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|''Yaarot Devash'']] in at least sixteen places.<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_brill.pdf Edah.org]</ref> This use of \"Madda\" as \"secular knowledge\" is, however, recent. In [[Rabbinic literature]], \"secular knowledge\" is usually<ref>[http://www.azure.org.il/download/magazine/186az24_Hansel.pdf Azure.org]</ref> referred to as ''chokhmah'' {{hebrew|\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4}}. The first book in [[Maimonides]]' compendium of [[Halakha]], the [[Mishneh Torah]], is entitled \"Madda\" {{Hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e2}}  - there, though, the term refers to knowledge of the fundamentals of Judaism. \"In the first book I will include all the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] that are [[Jewish principles of faith|principles]] of the law of Moses and that a man should know before all else, such as the [[divine simplicity|Unity of God]] and the prohibitions related to idolatry. And I have called this book ''Sefer ha Madda'' the Book of Knowledge.\"\n\nTorah and Madda is also the doctrine of the Vilna Gaon  as stated in Sefer Kol Hator, that the torah is incomplete without knowledge of the 7 wisdoms.<ref>Kol Hator sha'ar Be'er shevah part 2</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Torah and secular knowledge===\nIn the view of ''Torah Umadda'', \"Jewishness and Jewish faith ... and the universal concerns and preoccupations of humanity\" are not \"fundamentally inapposite\"; Judaism and [[culture]] are, \"in essence part of one continuum\". Jewish knowledge and secular knowledge, ''Torah'' and ''Madda'', do not, therefore, require \"substantive reconciliation\" (Norman Lamm, ''Torah Umadda'' pp. 142\u201343); in fact, the study of Torah with other knowledge results in a heightened and enriched Judaism. As articulated by [[Rabbi]] [[Norman Lamm]]: \n{{quote|\n\"Torah, faith, religious learning on one side and Madda, science, worldly knowledge on the other, together offer us a more {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} and truer vision than either one set alone. Each set gives one view of the Creator as well as of His creation, and the other a different perspective that may not agree at all with the first ... Each alone is true, but only partially true; both together present the possibility of a larger truth.\"<ref> (Norman Lamm, ''Torah Umadda'', p. 236)</ref>}}\n\n===Synthesis===\nAlthough ''Torah Umadda'' regards [[science]] and [[religion]] as separate, where the \"wisdom of the world\" maintains its own significance, it nevertheless conceives of a synthesis between the two realms. In this understanding, \"synthesis does not refer to a logical unity of the theories of science, [[democracy]] and Judaism\"; rather, the idea of synthesis has a [[psychology|psychological]] and a [[sociology|sociological]] meaning. Here, the \"individual has absorbed the attitudes characteristic of science, democracy and Jewish life and responds appropriately in diverse relations and contexts.\"<ref>[http://www.yutorah.org/_materials/ACF4B2B.pdf Yutorah.org]</ref>\n\n:We prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains which need not be in serious conflict and, therefore, need no reconciliation. If we seek the blending of science and religion and the integration of secular knowledge with sacred wisdom, then it is not in the subject matter of these fields but rather within the personality of the individual that we hope to achieve the synthesis.<ref>[[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943</ref>\n\nGiven this conception, the realization of ''Torah Umadda'' may find \"different legitimate expressions in each individual.\"<ref>[http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html Yuweb.addr.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308081945/http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html |date=2007-03-08 }}</ref> In his book Lamm explores six separate models of ''Torah Umadda'', including those presented by [[Maimonides]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. The philosophy recognizes the challenge this is likely to pose to its adherents, and posits a framework in which \"the confrontation between Judaism and secular culture results in heightened creativity within Judaism.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040325184911/http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/features/q%26a29.htm Ohrtorahstone.org.il]</ref>\n\n===Centrality of Torah===\nDespite its acceptance of both Torah and secular knowledge and culture, ''Torah Umadda'' prioritizes a Torah outlook and Torah knowledge, and in its practice requires strict adherence to ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish law). ''Torah Umadda'' demands \"unquestioned allegiance to the primacy of Torah, and that the apprehension of all other intellectual disciplines must be rooted and viewed through the prism of Torah.\"<ref>[http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html Yuweb.addr.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308081945/http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html |date=2007-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn the words of Rabbi Lamm, \"''Torah Umadda'' does not imply ... coequality.

Rather, to some degree, \"the theories and methods of secular disciplines [can] be used to secure not ''intellectual'' ends, but ''practical'' ends in [daily life].\" God's blessing to Adam and Eve \"''Fill the land and conquer it''\" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:28) is interpreted by Rav Soloveitchik (as well as [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] and [[Isaac Breuer]]) as a positive ''mitzvah'' calling man to develop and improve God's world; this ''mitzvah'' of creative activity expresses the divine image in all branches of human culture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/halacha/trees |title=Pardes.org |access-date=2005-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313174156/http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/halacha/trees |archive-date=2005-03-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Thus, secular knowledge enables the religious Jew \"to fulfill the biblical mandate of \"''Fill the land and conquer it''\" ...  to carry out their responsibilities to others and, further, by increasing the modalities for improving human welfare, to expand the range of these responsibilities; and, finally, to fulfill the mandate of [[imitatio dei|''imitatio Dei'']].\" <!--who are these quotes from?--> See further under [[Joseph Soloveitchik#Philosophy: Synthesis|Joseph Soloveitchik]]; [[Divine Providence#Modern Orthodox Judaism|Divine Providence]].\n\n==Centrist Orthodoxy==\nCentrist Orthodoxy is the dominant mode of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[United States]] and the [[western world]]; it is also influential in the Modern Orthodox movement in [[State of Israel|Israel]]. \n\n===Characteristics===\nCentrist Orthodoxy's ''[[weltanschauung]]''<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&type=Document&category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&firstname=Norman&lastname=Lamm&pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&authorid=285 Edah.org]</ref> (''[[Hashkafa]]'') is characterised by \"education, moderation, and the centrality of the people of Israel.\"<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&type=Document&category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&firstname=Norman&lastname=Lamm&pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&authorid=285 Edah.org]</ref> In general, differences between Centrist Orthodoxy and other Orthodox movements (both Haredi and Modern - e.g. [[Open Orthodoxy]]) result from the particular emphasis placed on each of these characteristics; see [[Modern_Orthodox_Judaism#Comparison with other movements|further discussion]] under Modern Orthodox Judaism.\n\n====Education====\n{{Further|Divine providence in Judaism}}\n''Madda'' entails \"worldly involvement\" in addition to its intellectual component - and places a high value on contribution to general society. Adherents of Centrist Orthodoxy are thus well represented, proportionately, in the [[profession]]s and in [[academia]]<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_waxman.pdf Edah.org]</ref> - and to some extent in politics. Members of [[Haredi]] communities, by contrast, will typically not undertake any post [[high school]] secular education (except for specific exceptions for livelihood purposes), and will, in general, minimize involvement with the secular.\n\n====Moderation====\nFor Centrist Orthodoxy, moderation \"is the result neither of guile nor of indifference nor of prudence, it is a matter of sacred principle ... it is not the mindless application of the [[arithmetic mean]]... [rather] it is the earnest sober and intelligent assessment of each situation... [Thus], moderation issues from a broad weltanschauung rather than from [[tunnel vision]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamm |first1=N. |title=Some comments on centrist Orthodoxy |journal=Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought |date=1986 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=1-12}}</ref> This moderation, \"seeking what is allowed rather than forbidden\", is manifest in three ways. Firstly, along with the Haredi community, the ideology demands adherence to the halakha; however it is not insistent that strictures (''chumras'') are [[Norm (sociology)|normative]], rather, these are a matter of personal choice<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/diverse.cfm#Chumrah Edah.org]</ref> (see [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Haredi Judaism|3.1]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance|4.1]] under Modern Orthodox Judaism). Secondly, relative to the Haredi community - but less so than in non-orthodox communities - women are starting to play a public role within the community<ref>[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/8077/edition_id/153/format/html/displaystory.html Jewishsf.com]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://shma.com/feb01/sarna.htm |title=SHMA.com |access-date=2005-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120100006/http://shma.com/feb01/sarna.htm |archive-date=2005-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (in roles other than strictly religious).<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Jewish_World_Today/Denominations/OrthodoxJudaism.htm Myjewishlearning.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120105354/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Jewish_World_Today/Denominations/OrthodoxJudaism.htm |date=2005-11-20 }}</ref> Thirdly, the movement will engage with the broader Jewish community, as discussed below, and with the secular world, as opposed to the Haredi approach of minimizing such contact.\n\n====Centrality of the People of Israel====\nAll Orthodox ideologies place a high value on ''ahavat yisrael'' (love of ones fellow Jews) and all regard the [[Land of Israel]] as holy - and residence there as a ''[[mitzvah]]''. However, for Centrist Orthodoxy, the \"People of Israel\", additionally, play a central role. The resulting difference, relative to other philosophies, manifests in two ways. Firstly, involvement with non-orthodox will extend beyond \"[[Baal teshuva#Orthodox outreach organizations|outreach]]\" - in which many Haredi organisations engage - to continued institutional relations and cooperation (despite the \"deviationist violations of Torah and Halakha\" of the non-orthodox). Secondly, Centrist Orthodoxy places a high [[nationalism|national]], as well as religious, significance on the [[State of Israel]]. Centrist Orthodox institutions and individuals are therefore [[Zionist]] in orientation, and rates of ''[[Aliyah]]'' (immigration to Israel) from this community are high relative to others;<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=312146&contrassID=2&subContrassID=16&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y Haaretz.com]</ref> study in Israeli ''[[Hesder Yeshiva|Hesder Yeshivot]]'' is also common. Thus, although Centrist Orthodoxy and [[religious Zionist Movement|Religious Zionism]] are not identical, they share many of the same values and many of the same adherents.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_47/ai_54600118#continue Findarticles.com]</ref>\n\n===Institutions===\nThe institutions of American Centrist Orthodoxy include:<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Centrist.html Ucalgary.ca]</ref>\n\n* [[Yeshiva University]] and The [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (\"RIETS\"), the main institution for the training and [[semicha|ordination]] of Orthodox congregational Rabbis in America.    \n* The [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the central body of Centrist Rabbis. Its \"[[Bet Din of America]]\", long headed by Rabbi Soloveitchik, is a respected source of [[posek|Jewish legal decisions]].<ref>[http://www.rabbis.org/about_us.cfm Rabbis.org]</ref>   \n* The [[Orthodox Union]] (\"OU\"; Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America) established in 1898, is largest union of American Orthodox congregations. Its activities include the administration and certification of [[kashrut]]; support for a broad range of religious educational institutions and projects; lobbying the American government on various issues of importance to religious Jews (and occasionally, on matters related to Israel).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/about/ou.htm |title=OU.org |access-date=2005-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050803193643/http://www.ou.org/about/ou.htm |archive-date=2005-08-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It also incorporates NCSY ([[National Conference of Synagogue Youth]]) which offers social, educational and outreach programming in hundreds of communities.<ref>[http://www.ou.org/NCSY/basic.htm OU.org]</ref>   \n* [[Young Israel]] (The National Council of Young Israel) founded in 1912, serves as the national coordinating agency for nearly 150 Orthodox congregations; the goal of NCYI is \"to broaden the appeal of the traditional community synagogue as the central address for Jewish communal life by providing educational, religious, social, spiritual and communal programming\".<ref>[http://www.youngisrael.org/ Younisrael.org]</ref>\n\n==Relationship with ''Torah im Derech Eretz''==\n:''See also under [[Azriel_Hildesheimer#Comparison with Samson Raphael Hirsch|Azriel Hildesheimer]], [[Modern_Orthodox_Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|below]].''\n\n''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]''\u2014\"Torah with worldly involvement\"\u2014is a philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] concerning the relationship between Torah Judaism and the modern world, first articulated by [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] in c. 1840.  In some senses ''Torah Umadda'' and ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' are similar. Both value the acquisition of secular knowledge coupled with adherence to [[halakha]]; both, additionally, emphasise [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Worldly involvement|worldly involvement]]. In fact, ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is sometimes put forward as one [[paradigm]] upon which ''Torah Umadda'' (and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]] in general) is based.\n\nAt the same time though, the two are distinct in terms of emphasis. Whereas ''Torah Umadda'' maintains two separate realms\u2014religious and secular\u2014and accents the idea of (psychological and sociological) synthesis, \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination\u2014for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson).\n\nAnother difference is that ''Torah Umadda'' does not disavow communal partnership with the non-Orthodox Jewish community, whereas for Rabbi Hirsch \"''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]''\" (the Halachic requirement to have no official ties with non-Orthodox communal institutions) was a defining characteristic of his community, and a major theme in his writings.\n\nWhile these distinctions can seem subtle (particularly the first), they have manifested in markedly divergent religious attitudes and perspectives. In fact, [[Shimon Schwab]], leader of the [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)|\"Breuers\" community]] in Washington Heights, has been described as \"spiritually very distant\" from Torah Umaddah.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Findarticles.com]</ref>\n\nNote further, that given both of the above, some have proposed that today, followers of ''Torah Umadda'' in fact assume a \"non-Hirschian position\", resembling more closely that of Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Findarticles.com]</ref>\n\n\n==Criticism==\n===Haredi Judaism===\nCritics of ''Torah Umadda'', particularly within [[Haredi Judaism]], see the complementarity of Torah and secular knowledge proposed by the philosophy as suggesting that the Torah is not of itself whole or complete. In their view, Torah Umadda is thus premised on a flawed appreciation of Torah. Furthermore, they believe that Torah Umadda is problematic in that its synthesis allows for an \"encroachment\" of the [[scientific]] [[worldview]] on [[Jewish theology]]. Torah Umadda thus represents a dilution of the \"pure sanctity\" (''taharat hakodesh'') of the Torah.<ref>[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm Daat.ac.il]</ref>\n\n===Hasidic Judaism===\nCriticism by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups includes an additional [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] dimension. Here, since the doctrine of ''[[Tzimtzum]]'' is understood to imply that since the physical world in fact ''conceals'' the existence and nature of the [[Creator deity|creator]], study of the natural world will be unlikely to deepen one's appreciation of God or understanding of Torah \n(see [[Tzimtzum #Inherent paradox]]; also, [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel #Jewish philosophy]]).\nA further consideration -  in common with the Haredi view - arises in that the role of the Jew [[Olam HaZeh|in this world]] is understood, primarily, to be concerned with fulfillment of the Law and study of Torah: \"[One should] live by the light of these three things: love of God, love of Israel, and love of Torah\" ([[Baal Shem Tov]]).<ref>[http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/denominations/hasidic.htm Religionfacts.com]</ref> Thus, the study of secular ideas and devotion of time to secular activities not directly for the sake of Torah - or as is necessary for supporting oneself - may constitute \"spiritually damaging behavior\". \nThe sciences in particular are considered problematic:\n{{quote|\n\"Occupying oneself with the sciences of the nations of the world is\u2026 included in the category of engaging in inconsequential matters insofar as the sin of neglecting the Torah is concerned\u2026 Moreover, the impurity of science is greater than the impurity of idle speech\u2026 Thus this is forbidden unless one employs [this knowledge] as a useful instrument, viz., as a means of [earning a livelihood] with which to be able to serve God\u2026 or unless he knows how to apply them in the service of God or to his better understanding of His Torah [i.e., in the manner of] Maimonides and Nachmanides\u2026\" (''[[Tanya]]'': ''Likutei Amarim, 8''<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7887 Chabad.org]</ref>)|[[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]}}\n\n{{quote|\"The main cause of the weakening of faith in our sages, is the attribution of [value] to secular knowledge... whereas, being based on philosophy or on the study of nature, as opposed to that which is true and eternal, this knowledge is in fact spiritually valueless ... further, pursuit of this knowledge is often motivated by physicality...\" ([https://www.breslevmeir.com/\u05e2\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea-\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea/ ''Etzot Yesharot: Moadim'']) \"...It is [thus] a major prohibition to study \"investigative\" works \u2013 particularly since several difficulties relating to [His essence] are impossible to address naturally (see re.

However, more conservative Religious Zionists differ with ''Torah Umadda'' in its approach to secular knowledge.<ref>[http://www.zionism-israel.com/ezine/religious_zionism.htm Zionism-israel.com]</ref> In this view, engagement with secular ideas and situations is permissible and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the State of Israel. Here, then, secular knowledge is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in and of itself. Thus, for example, in contrast to ''Torah Umadda'', the study of literature and the humanities is discouraged here, whereas the study of engineering or medicine (and with subsequent practice in Israel) is deemed to be valuable.\n\n===Modern Orthodoxy===\nWithin the ''Torah Umadda'' camp itself,<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_brill.pdf Edah.org]</ref> there are those who question whether \"the literature on ''Torah u-Madda'' with its [[Intellectual#Intellectualism|intellectually elitist]] bias fails to directly address the majority of its practitioners\"; further, there are suggestions that \"the very logic of the practice is far removed from the ideology\" (\"The community works with an ideology of Torah combined with a suburban logic of practice\"). The contention here is that the \"''Torah u-Madda'' suburbanite\" does not in reality engage in secular studies in order to achieve the [[intellectual synthesis]] described above, but rather \"view[s] a college degree as the gateway toward professional advancement.\" Thus, although ''Torah Umadda'' may allow students at Yeshiva University \"to navigate the use of their college years\", it may not provide a directly applicable theology for the contemporary Modern Orthodox family.\n\nIn ''[[The Crisis of Zionism]]'', [[Peter Beinart]] writes that while the motto of Yeshiva University is Torah Umaddah, many Modern Orthodox leaders have abandoned that intellectual openness \"in favor of an insularity that bespeaks both fear and insularity: fear that Orthodox Judaism cannot survive a dialogue with the outside world and arrogance that the outside world can add nothing of value to the world of Torah.\"<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0U1fjErMGkC&pg=PT180 |title = The Crisis of Zionism|isbn = 9780522861761|last1 = Beinart|first1 = Peter|year = 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bar-Ilan University]] \u2013 a [[Tel Aviv]] based university which aims \"to blend tradition with modern technologies and scholarship, and teach the compelling ethics of Jewish heritage to all.\"\n* [[Hebrew Theological College]] - a [[Chicago]] based institution, \"preparing its graduates for roles as educators and Rabbis\", while providing \"broad cultural perspectives and a strong foundation in the Liberal Arts and Sciences.\"\n* [[Islamization of knowledge]]\n* [[Jerusalem College of Technology]] - a [[Jerusalem]] based college, founded to \"educate students who see the synthesis of Jewish values and a profession as their way of life\"\n* [[Kabbalistic approaches to the sciences and humanities]]\n* [[Lander College]] - a [[New York City]] based college, combining Torah study with secular, University study, based on a philosophy of ''Torah Uparnassa'' (Torah and Livelihood)\n* The [[Zomet Institute]] - a crossroad between Halacha and the modern world\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n*[http://www.yutorah.org/_materials/1i%20ESSAY%20IN%20JEWISH%20THOUGHT.pdf An Inaugural Address] ([[portable document format|PDF]]), in \"Essays in Traditional Jewish Thought\", Rabbi Dr [[Samuel Belkin]], Philosophical Library, 1956.\n*[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/diverse.cfm#Torah Diverse Orthodox Attitudes to Torah U'Maddah], Rabbi Saul J.

The resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism is referred to as ''Centrist Orthodoxy''.\n\n==History==\n''Torah Umadda'' is closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]]. The actual philosophy underlying the combination of Torah and secular wisdom at Yeshiva University was variously articulated, first by [[Bernard Revel]], by his successors [[Samuel Belkin]] and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik|Joseph Soloveitchik]], and most recently, and formally, by [[Norman Lamm]]. Although its roots go back to 1886, it was only in 1946 that the University adopted \"Torah Umadda\" as its slogan. (In 2005, Yeshiva University president [[Richard Joel]] initiated a campaign to append the phrase \"Bringing wisdom to life\", as a \"tag-line\" to the university's motto.)<ref>[http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2005/09/yus-new-tag-line.html Hirhurim.blogspot.com]</ref> Today, Yeshiva University publishes the ''Torah Umadda Journal'' which \"explores the complex relationships between Torah, the humanities, and the natural and social sciences\", as well as studies on related topics in the ''Library of Jewish Law and Ethics'' (with Ktav Publishing House).\n\nThe phrase itself is thought to originate with [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]], who mentions \"Torah u-Madda\" in his [[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|''Yaarot Devash'']] in at least sixteen places.<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_brill.pdf Edah.org]</ref> This use of \"Madda\" as \"secular knowledge\" is, however, recent. In [[Rabbinic literature]], \"secular knowledge\" is usually<ref>[http://www.azure.org.il/download/magazine/186az24_Hansel.pdf Azure.org]</ref> referred to as ''chokhmah'' {{hebrew|\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4}}. The first book in [[Maimonides]]' compendium of [[Halakha]], the [[Mishneh Torah]], is entitled \"Madda\" {{Hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e2}}  - there, though, the term refers to knowledge of the fundamentals of Judaism. \"In the first book I will include all the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] that are [[Jewish principles of faith|principles]] of the law of Moses and that a man should know before all else, such as the [[divine simplicity|Unity of God]] and the prohibitions related to idolatry. And I have called this book ''Sefer ha Madda'' the Book of Knowledge.\"\n\nTorah and Madda is also the doctrine of the Vilna Gaon  as stated in Sefer Kol Hator, that the torah is incomplete without knowledge of the 7 wisdoms.<ref>Kol Hator sha'ar Be'er shevah part 2</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Torah and secular knowledge===\nIn the view of ''Torah Umadda'', \"Jewishness and Jewish faith ... and the universal concerns and preoccupations of humanity\" are not \"fundamentally inapposite\"; Judaism and [[culture]] are, \"in essence part of one continuum\". Jewish knowledge and secular knowledge, ''Torah'' and ''Madda'', do not, therefore, require \"substantive reconciliation\" (Norman Lamm, ''Torah Umadda'' pp. 142\u201343); in fact, the study of Torah with other knowledge results in a heightened and enriched Judaism. As articulated by [[Rabbi]] [[Norman Lamm]]: \n{{quote|\n\"Torah, faith, religious learning on one side and Madda, science, worldly knowledge on the other, together offer us a more {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} and truer vision than either one set alone. Each set gives one view of the Creator as well as of His creation, and the other a different perspective that may not agree at all with the first ... Each alone is true, but only partially true; both together present the possibility of a larger truth.\"<ref> (Norman Lamm, ''Torah Umadda'', p. 236)</ref>}}\n\n===Synthesis===\nAlthough ''Torah Umadda'' regards [[science]] and [[religion]] as separate, where the \"wisdom of the world\" maintains its own significance, it nevertheless conceives of a synthesis between the two realms. In this understanding, \"synthesis does not refer to a logical unity of the theories of science, [[democracy]] and Judaism\"; rather, the idea of synthesis has a [[psychology|psychological]] and a [[sociology|sociological]] meaning. Here, the \"individual has absorbed the attitudes characteristic of science, democracy and Jewish life and responds appropriately in diverse relations and contexts.\"<ref>[http://www.yutorah.org/_materials/ACF4B2B.pdf Yutorah.org]</ref>\n\n:We prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains which need not be in serious conflict and, therefore, need no reconciliation. If we seek the blending of science and religion and the integration of secular knowledge with sacred wisdom, then it is not in the subject matter of these fields but rather within the personality of the individual that we hope to achieve the synthesis.<ref>[[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943</ref>\n\nGiven this conception, the realization of ''Torah Umadda'' may find \"different legitimate expressions in each individual.\"<ref>[http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html Yuweb.addr.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308081945/http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html |date=2007-03-08 }}</ref> In his book Lamm explores six separate models of ''Torah Umadda'', including those presented by [[Maimonides]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]. The philosophy recognizes the challenge this is likely to pose to its adherents, and posits a framework in which \"the confrontation between Judaism and secular culture results in heightened creativity within Judaism.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040325184911/http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/features/q%26a29.htm Ohrtorahstone.org.il]</ref>\n\n===Centrality of Torah===\nDespite its acceptance of both Torah and secular knowledge and culture, ''Torah Umadda'' prioritizes a Torah outlook and Torah knowledge, and in its practice requires strict adherence to ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish law). ''Torah Umadda'' demands \"unquestioned allegiance to the primacy of Torah, and that the apprehension of all other intellectual disciplines must be rooted and viewed through the prism of Torah.\"<ref>[http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html Yuweb.addr.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308081945/http://yuweb.addr.com/v67i7/culture/toyou.html |date=2007-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn the words of Rabbi Lamm, \"''Torah Umadda'' does not imply ... coequality.

Rather, to some degree, \"the theories and methods of secular disciplines [can] be used to secure not ''intellectual'' ends, but ''practical'' ends in [daily life].\" God's blessing to Adam and Eve \"''Fill the land and conquer it''\" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:28) is interpreted by Rav Soloveitchik (as well as [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] and [[Isaac Breuer]]) as a positive ''mitzvah'' calling man to develop and improve God's world; this ''mitzvah'' of creative activity expresses the divine image in all branches of human culture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/halacha/trees |title=Pardes.org |access-date=2005-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313174156/http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/halacha/trees |archive-date=2005-03-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Thus, secular knowledge enables the religious Jew \"to fulfill the biblical mandate of \"''Fill the land and conquer it''\" ...  to carry out their responsibilities to others and, further, by increasing the modalities for improving human welfare, to expand the range of these responsibilities; and, finally, to fulfill the mandate of [[imitatio dei|''imitatio Dei'']].\" <!--who are these quotes from?--> See further under [[Joseph Soloveitchik#Philosophy: Synthesis|Joseph Soloveitchik]]; [[Divine Providence#Modern Orthodox Judaism|Divine Providence]].\n\n==Centrist Orthodoxy==\nCentrist Orthodoxy is the dominant mode of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[United States]] and the [[western world]]; it is also influential in the Modern Orthodox movement in [[State of Israel|Israel]]. \n\n===Characteristics===\nCentrist Orthodoxy's ''[[weltanschauung]]''<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&type=Document&category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&firstname=Norman&lastname=Lamm&pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&authorid=285 Edah.org]</ref> (''[[Hashkafa]]'') is characterised by \"education, moderation, and the centrality of the people of Israel.\"<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&type=Document&category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&firstname=Norman&lastname=Lamm&pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&authorid=285 Edah.org]</ref> In general, differences between Centrist Orthodoxy and other Orthodox movements (both Haredi and Modern - e.g. [[Open Orthodoxy]]) result from the particular emphasis placed on each of these characteristics; see [[Modern_Orthodox_Judaism#Comparison with other movements|further discussion]] under Modern Orthodox Judaism.\n\n====Education====\n{{Further|Divine providence in Judaism}}\n''Madda'' entails \"worldly involvement\" in addition to its intellectual component - and places a high value on contribution to general society. Adherents of Centrist Orthodoxy are thus well represented, proportionately, in the [[profession]]s and in [[academia]]<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_waxman.pdf Edah.org]</ref> - and to some extent in politics. Members of [[Haredi]] communities, by contrast, will typically not undertake any post [[high school]] secular education (except for specific exceptions for livelihood purposes), and will, in general, minimize involvement with the secular.\n\n====Moderation====\nFor Centrist Orthodoxy, moderation \"is the result neither of guile nor of indifference nor of prudence, it is a matter of sacred principle ... it is not the mindless application of the [[arithmetic mean]]... [rather] it is the earnest sober and intelligent assessment of each situation... [Thus], moderation issues from a broad weltanschauung rather than from [[tunnel vision]].\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamm |first1=N. |title=Some comments on centrist Orthodoxy |journal=Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought |date=1986 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=1-12}}</ref> This moderation, \"seeking what is allowed rather than forbidden\", is manifest in three ways. Firstly, along with the Haredi community, the ideology demands adherence to the halakha; however it is not insistent that strictures (''chumras'') are [[Norm (sociology)|normative]], rather, these are a matter of personal choice<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/diverse.cfm#Chumrah Edah.org]</ref> (see [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Haredi Judaism|3.1]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance|4.1]] under Modern Orthodox Judaism). Secondly, relative to the Haredi community - but less so than in non-orthodox communities - women are starting to play a public role within the community<ref>[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/8077/edition_id/153/format/html/displaystory.html Jewishsf.com]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://shma.com/feb01/sarna.htm |title=SHMA.com |access-date=2005-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120100006/http://shma.com/feb01/sarna.htm |archive-date=2005-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (in roles other than strictly religious).<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Jewish_World_Today/Denominations/OrthodoxJudaism.htm Myjewishlearning.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120105354/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Jewish_World_Today/Denominations/OrthodoxJudaism.htm |date=2005-11-20 }}</ref> Thirdly, the movement will engage with the broader Jewish community, as discussed below, and with the secular world, as opposed to the Haredi approach of minimizing such contact.\n\n====Centrality of the People of Israel====\nAll Orthodox ideologies place a high value on ''ahavat yisrael'' (love of ones fellow Jews) and all regard the [[Land of Israel]] as holy - and residence there as a ''[[mitzvah]]''. However, for Centrist Orthodoxy, the \"People of Israel\", additionally, play a central role. The resulting difference, relative to other philosophies, manifests in two ways. Firstly, involvement with non-orthodox will extend beyond \"[[Baal teshuva#Orthodox outreach organizations|outreach]]\" - in which many Haredi organisations engage - to continued institutional relations and cooperation (despite the \"deviationist violations of Torah and Halakha\" of the non-orthodox). Secondly, Centrist Orthodoxy places a high [[nationalism|national]], as well as religious, significance on the [[State of Israel]]. Centrist Orthodox institutions and individuals are therefore [[Zionist]] in orientation, and rates of ''[[Aliyah]]'' (immigration to Israel) from this community are high relative to others;<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=312146&contrassID=2&subContrassID=16&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y Haaretz.com]</ref> study in Israeli ''[[Hesder Yeshiva|Hesder Yeshivot]]'' is also common. Thus, although Centrist Orthodoxy and [[religious Zionist Movement|Religious Zionism]] are not identical, they share many of the same values and many of the same adherents.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_47/ai_54600118#continue Findarticles.com]</ref>\n\n===Institutions===\nThe institutions of American Centrist Orthodoxy include:<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Centrist.html Ucalgary.ca]</ref>\n\n* [[Yeshiva University]] and The [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (\"RIETS\"), the main institution for the training and [[semicha|ordination]] of Orthodox congregational Rabbis in America.    \n* The [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the central body of Centrist Rabbis.

Its activities include the administration and certification of [[kashrut]]; support for a broad range of religious educational institutions and projects; lobbying the American government on various issues of importance to religious Jews (and occasionally, on matters related to Israel).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/about/ou.htm |title=OU.org |access-date=2005-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050803193643/http://www.ou.org/about/ou.htm |archive-date=2005-08-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It also incorporates NCSY ([[National Conference of Synagogue Youth]]) which offers social, educational and outreach programming in hundreds of communities.<ref>[http://www.ou.org/NCSY/basic.htm OU.org]</ref>   \n* [[Young Israel]] (The National Council of Young Israel) founded in 1912, serves as the national coordinating agency for nearly 150 Orthodox congregations; the goal of NCYI is \"to broaden the appeal of the traditional community synagogue as the central address for Jewish communal life by providing educational, religious, social, spiritual and communal programming\".<ref>[http://www.youngisrael.org/ Younisrael.org]</ref>\n\n==Relationship with ''Torah im Derech Eretz''==\n:''See also under [[Azriel_Hildesheimer#Comparison with Samson Raphael Hirsch|Azriel Hildesheimer]], [[Modern_Orthodox_Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|below]].''\n\n''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]''\u2014\"Torah with worldly involvement\"\u2014is a philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] concerning the relationship between Torah Judaism and the modern world, first articulated by [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] in c. 1840.  In some senses ''Torah Umadda'' and ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' are similar. Both value the acquisition of secular knowledge coupled with adherence to [[halakha]]; both, additionally, emphasise [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Worldly involvement|worldly involvement]]. In fact, ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is sometimes put forward as one [[paradigm]] upon which ''Torah Umadda'' (and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]] in general) is based.\n\nAt the same time though, the two are distinct in terms of emphasis. Whereas ''Torah Umadda'' maintains two separate realms\u2014religious and secular\u2014and accents the idea of (psychological and sociological) synthesis, \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination\u2014for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson).\n\nAnother difference is that ''Torah Umadda'' does not disavow communal partnership with the non-Orthodox Jewish community, whereas for Rabbi Hirsch \"''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]''\" (the Halachic requirement to have no official ties with non-Orthodox communal institutions) was a defining characteristic of his community, and a major theme in his writings.\n\nWhile these distinctions can seem subtle (particularly the first), they have manifested in markedly divergent religious attitudes and perspectives. In fact, [[Shimon Schwab]], leader of the [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)|\"Breuers\" community]] in Washington Heights, has been described as \"spiritually very distant\" from Torah Umaddah.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Findarticles.com]</ref>\n\nNote further, that given both of the above, some have proposed that today, followers of ''Torah Umadda'' in fact assume a \"non-Hirschian position\", resembling more closely that of Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n1_v42/ai_13796421/print Findarticles.com]</ref>\n\n\n==Criticism==\n===Haredi Judaism===\nCritics of ''Torah Umadda'', particularly within [[Haredi Judaism]], see the complementarity of Torah and secular knowledge proposed by the philosophy as suggesting that the Torah is not of itself whole or complete. In their view, Torah Umadda is thus premised on a flawed appreciation of Torah. Furthermore, they believe that Torah Umadda is problematic in that its synthesis allows for an \"encroachment\" of the [[scientific]] [[worldview]] on [[Jewish theology]]. Torah Umadda thus represents a dilution of the \"pure sanctity\" (''taharat hakodesh'') of the Torah.<ref>[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm Daat.ac.il]</ref>\n\n===Hasidic Judaism===\nCriticism by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups includes an additional [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] dimension. Here, since the doctrine of ''[[Tzimtzum]]'' is understood to imply that since the physical world in fact ''conceals'' the existence and nature of the [[Creator deity|creator]], study of the natural world will be unlikely to deepen one\u2019s appreciation of God or understanding of Torah \n(see [[Tzimtzum #Inherent paradox]]; also, [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel #Jewish philosophy]]).\nA further consideration -  in common with the Haredi view - arises in that the role of the Jew [[Olam HaZeh|in this world]] is understood, primarily, to be concerned with fulfillment of the Law and study of Torah: \"[One should] live by the light of these three things: love of God, love of Israel, and love of Torah\" ([[Baal Shem Tov]]).<ref>[http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/denominations/hasidic.htm Religionfacts.com]</ref> Thus, the study of secular ideas and devotion of time to secular activities not directly for the sake of Torah - or as is necessary for supporting oneself - may constitute \"spiritually damaging behavior\". \nThe sciences in particular are considered problematic:\n{{quote|\n\"Occupying oneself with the sciences of the nations of the world is\u2026 included in the category of engaging in inconsequential matters insofar as the sin of neglecting the Torah is concerned\u2026 Moreover, the impurity of science is greater than the impurity of idle speech\u2026 Thus this is forbidden unless one employs [this knowledge] as a useful instrument, viz., as a means of [earning a livelihood] with which to be able to serve God\u2026 or unless he knows how to apply them in the service of God or to his better understanding of His Torah [i.e., in the manner of] Maimonides and Nachmanides\u2026\" (''[[Tanya]]'': ''Likutei Amarim, 8''<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7887 Chabad.org]</ref>)|[[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]}}\n\n{{quote|\"The main cause of the weakening of faith in our sages, is the attribution of [value] to secular knowledge... whereas, being based on philosophy or on the study of nature, as opposed to that which is true and eternal, this knowledge is in fact spiritually valueless ... further, pursuit of this knowledge is often motivated by physicality...\" ([https://www.breslevmeir.com/\u05e2\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea-\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea/ ''Etzot Yesharot: Moadim'']) \"...It is [thus] a major prohibition to study \"investigative\" works \u2013 particularly since several difficulties relating to [His essence] are impossible to address naturally (see re.

However, more conservative Religious Zionists differ with ''Torah Umadda'' in its approach to secular knowledge.<ref>[http://www.zionism-israel.com/ezine/religious_zionism.htm Zionism-israel.com]</ref> In this view, engagement with secular ideas and situations is permissible and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the State of Israel. Here, then, secular knowledge is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in and of itself. Thus, for example, in contrast to ''Torah Umadda'', the study of literature and the humanities is discouraged here, whereas the study of engineering or medicine (and with subsequent practice in Israel) is deemed to be valuable.\n\n===Modern Orthodoxy===\nWithin the ''Torah Umadda'' camp itself,<ref>[http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_1_brill.pdf Edah.org]</ref> there are those who question whether \"the literature on ''Torah u-Madda'' with its [[Intellectual#Intellectualism|intellectually elitist]] bias fails to directly address the majority of its practitioners\"; further, there are suggestions that \"the very logic of the practice is far removed from the ideology\" (\"The community works with an ideology of Torah combined with a suburban logic of practice\"). The contention here is that the \"''Torah u-Madda'' suburbanite\" does not in reality engage in secular studies in order to achieve the [[intellectual synthesis]] described above, but rather \"view[s] a college degree as the gateway toward professional advancement.\" Thus, although ''Torah Umadda'' may allow students at Yeshiva University \"to navigate the use of their college years\", it may not provide a directly applicable theology for the contemporary Modern Orthodox family.\n\nIn ''[[The Crisis of Zionism]]'', [[Peter Beinart]] writes that while the motto of Yeshiva University is Torah Umaddah, many Modern Orthodox leaders have abandoned that intellectual openness \"in favor of an insularity that bespeaks both fear and insularity: fear that Orthodox Judaism cannot survive a dialogue with the outside world and arrogance that the outside world can add nothing of value to the world of Torah.\"<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0U1fjErMGkC&pg=PT180 |title = The Crisis of Zionism|isbn = 9780522861761|last1 = Beinart|first1 = Peter|year = 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bar-Ilan University]] \u2013 a [[Tel Aviv]] based university which aims \"to blend tradition with modern technologies and scholarship, and teach the compelling ethics of Jewish heritage to all.\"\n* [[Hebrew Theological College]] - a [[Chicago]] based institution, \"preparing its graduates for roles as educators and Rabbis\", while providing \"broad cultural perspectives and a strong foundation in the Liberal Arts and Sciences.\"\n* [[Islamization of knowledge]]\n* [[Jerusalem College of Technology]] - a [[Jerusalem]] based college, founded to \"educate students who see the synthesis of Jewish values and a profession as their way of life\"\n* [[Kabbalistic approaches to the sciences and humanities]]\n* [[Lander College]] - a [[New York City]] based college, combining Torah study with secular, University study, based on a philosophy of ''Torah Uparnassa'' (Torah and Livelihood)\n* The [[Zomet Institute]] - a crossroad between Halacha and the modern world\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n*[http://www.yutorah.org/_materials/1i%20ESSAY%20IN%20JEWISH%20THOUGHT.pdf An Inaugural Address] ([[portable document format|PDF]]), in \"Essays in Traditional Jewish Thought\", Rabbi Dr [[Samuel Belkin]], Philosophical Library, 1956.\n*[http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/diverse.cfm#Torah Diverse Orthodox Attitudes to Torah U'Maddah], Rabbi Saul J.

Various existing images have been claimed to be the \"original\" relic, or early copies of it.\n\nThe final form of the Western tradition recounts that [[Saint Veronica]] from [[Jerusalem]] encountered [[Jesus]] along the [[Via Dolorosa]] on the way to [[Calvary]]. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin ''sudor'') off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by the Sixth [[Station of the Cross]]. According to some versions, St. Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor [[Tiberius]], and the veil, possessing the Grace of God, was able to quench thirst, cure blindness, and even raise the dead.\n\nThe story is not recorded in its present form until the [[Middle Ages]]. During the fourteenth century it became a central icon in the [[Western Church]]; in the words of art historian [[Neil Macgregor]]: \"From [the 14th Century] on, wherever the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]] went, the Veronica would go with it.\"<ref>\"Seeing Salvation\". ''Images of Christ in Art'', Neil MacGregor, {{ISBN|0-563-55111-9}}.</ref> The act of Saint Veronica wiping the face of Jesus with her veil is celebrated in the sixth [[Stations of the Cross|Station of the Cross]] in many [[Anglican]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Western Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=Trinity>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityevansville.org/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|date=24 March 2013|publisher=Trinity UMC|accessdate=25 April 2016|quote=This tradition began most prominently with St. Francis of Assisi (1182\u20131226) and spread to other churches in the medieval period.

The closest written reference is the [[miracle]] of [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman]] by touching the hem of Jesus' garment ({{Bibleref2|Luke 8:43\u201348}}); her name is later identified as Veronica by the [[apocrypha]]l \"[[Acts of Pilate]]\". The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured Tiberius. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion, and the miraculous appearance of the image, was made by [[Roger d'Argenteuil]]'s ''Bible in French'' in the 13th century,<ref>G. Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'',1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 78\u201379, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}</ref> and gained further popularity following the internationally popular work ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'' of about 1300. It is also at this point that other depictions of the image change to include a crown of thorns, blood, and the expression of a man in pain,<ref>G Schiller, op. & page cit</ref> and the image became very common throughout Catholic Europe, forming part of the [[Arma Christi]], and with the meeting of Jesus and Veronica becoming one of the [[Stations of the Cross]].\n\n==Origin of the name==\nAccording to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], the name \"Veronica\" is a [[colloquial]] [[portmanteau]] of the [[Latin]] word '''''vera''''', meaning truth, and [[Greek language|Greek]] '''''icon (eikon)''''', meaning \"image\"; the Veil of Veronica was therefore largely regarded in medieval times as \"the true image\", and the truthful representation of Jesus, preceding the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15362a.htm |title= CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Veronica |work= newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\n== History of the veil ==\nThere was a physical image displayed in Rome in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries which was known and venerated as the Veil of Veronica. However, the history of that image is somewhat problematic.\n\n[[File:Saint veronica.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of ''St Veronica & the Veil'' at [[St Peter's Basilica]]]]\nIt has often been assumed that the Veronica was present in the [[Old St Peter's]] in the papacy of [[Pope John VII|John VII]] (705-8), as a chapel known as the Veronica chapel was built during his reign, and this seems to have been the assumption of later writers.{{cn|date=August 2015}} However, this is far from certain, as mosaics that decorated that chapel do not refer to the Veronica story in any way.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Furthermore, contemporaneous writers make no reference to the Veronica in this period.{{cn|date=August 2015}} \nIt would appear however that the Veronica was in place by 1011 when a scribe was identified as keeper of the cloth.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 175</ref>\n\nFirm recording of the Veronica only begins in 1199 when two pilgrims, Gerald de Barri ([[Giraldus Cambrensis]]) and [[Gervase of Tilbury]], made two accounts at different times of a visit to Rome, making direct reference to the existence of the Veil of Veronica. Shortly after that, in 1207, the cloth became more prominent when it was publicly paraded and displayed by [[Pope Innocent III]], who also granted indulgences to anyone praying before it. This parade, between St Peter's and the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Santo Spirito Hospital]], became an annual event and on one such occasion in 1300 [[Pope Boniface VIII]], who had it translated to St. Peter's in 1297, was inspired to proclaim the first [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] in 1300. During this Jubilee the Veronica was publicly displayed and became one of the \"Mirabilia Urbis\" (\"Wonders of the City\") for the [[pilgrim]]s who visited Rome. For the next two hundred years the Veronica, retained at Old St Peter's, was regarded as the most precious of all Christian relics; there [[Pedro Tafur]], a Spanish visitor in 1436, noted:\n<blockquote>On the right hand is a pillar as high as a small tower, and in it is the holy Veronica. When it is to be exhibited an opening is made in the roof of the church and a wooden chest or cradle is let down, in which are two clerics, and when they have descended, the chest or cradle is drawn up, and they, with the greatest reverence, take out the Veronica and show it to the people, who make concourse there upon the appointed day. It happens often that the worshippers are in danger of their lives, so many are they and so great is the press.<sub>Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch3 Andan\u00e7as e viajes]''.</sub></blockquote>\n\nAfter the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome in 1527]], some writers recorded that the veil had been destroyed: Messer Unbano tells the Duchess of Urbino that the Veronica was stolen and passed around the taverns of Rome.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 112</ref> Other writers however, testify to its continuing presence in the Vatican and one witness to the sacking states that the Veronica was not found by the looters.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 113</ref>\n\nMany artists of the time created reproductions of the Veronica, again suggesting its survival, but in 1616, [[Pope Paul V]] prohibited the manufacture of further copies unless made by a canon of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. In 1629, Pope [[Urban VIII]] not only prohibited reproductions of the Veronica from being made, but also ordered the destruction of all existing copies. His edict declared that anyone who had access to a copy must bring it to the Vatican, under penalty of excommunication.\n\nAfter that the Veronica disappears almost entirely from public view, and its subsequent history is unrecorded. As there is no conclusive evidence that it ever left St Peter's, the possibility exists that it remains there to this day; this would be consistent with such limited information as the Vatican has provided in recent centuries.\n\n== Images traditionally connected with the Veil of Veronica ==\nThere are at least six images in existence which bear a marked resemblance to each other and which are claimed to be the original Veil, a direct copy of it or, in two cases, the [[Mandylion]]. Each member of this group is enclosed in an elaborate outer frame with a gilded metal sheet (or [[riza]] in Russian) within, in which is cut an aperture where the face appears; at the lower extreme of the face there are three points which correspond to the shape of the hair and beard.\n\n<gallery heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Veil of Veronica\">\nFile:Vatican Veil of Veronica.jpg|The Vatican Veronica\nFile:Holy Face - Vienna.jpg|The Holy Face of Vienna\nFile:Holy Face - Alicante2.jpg|The Holy Face of Alicante\nFile:Holy Face - Jaen.jpg|The Holy Face of Ja\u00e9n\n</gallery>\n\n=== St. Peter's Basilica ===\nThere is an image kept in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]{{cn|date=March 2019}} which purports{{who|date=March 2019}} to be the same veil as was revered in the [[Middle Ages]].{{cn|date=March 2019}} This image is stored in the chapel that lies behind the balcony in the southwest pier supporting the dome.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nVery few inspections are recorded in modern times{{cn|date=March 2019}} and there are no detailed photographs.{{cn|date=March 2019}} The most detailed recorded inspection of the 20th century occurred in 1907 when Jesuit art historian [[Joseph Wilpert]]{{who|date=March 2019}} was allowed to remove two plates of glass to inspect the image.{{cn|date=March 2019}} According to author [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]], he commented that he saw only \"a square piece of light coloured material, somewhat faded through age, which bear two faint rust-brown stains, connected one to the other\".<ref>[[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]], ''[[Holy Faces, Secret Places]]'', page 63</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the face is still displayed each year on the occasion of the 5th Sunday of Lent, [[Passion Sunday]].{{cn|date=September 2014}} The blessing takes place after the traditional [[Vespers]] at 5.00 pm.{{cn|date=September 2014}} There is a short [[procession]] within the basilica, accompanied by the Roman [[litany]].{{cn|date=September 2014}} A bell rings and three [[Canon (priest)|canons]] carry the heavy frame out on the balcony above the statue of St. Veronica holding the veil.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Holy Veil of St. Veronica|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/paulus_magnus/4540886625/|website=flickr|publisher=Yahoo Co.|accessdate=25 September 2014}}{{dead link|date=March 2019}}</ref>{{cn|date=September 2014}} From this limited view no image is discernible and it is only possible to see the shape of the inner frame.{{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== The Hofburg Palace, Vienna ===\nIn the Hofburg Palace in Vienna there is a copy of the Veronica, identified by the signature of P. Strozzi in the right hand corner of the inner frame. He was the secretary of [[Pope Paul V]], and a man referred to by Vatican notary Jacopo Grimaldi as making a series of six meticulous copies of the veil in 1617.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 157</ref>\n\nThe outside of the frame is relatively modern, while the inner frame is roughly made and corresponds to the cut-out pattern of earlier copies. The face within is very unclear, more a series of blotches in which only the bare elements of a nose, eyes and mouth can be identified. This argues for the authenticity of the copy as there is clearly no attempt at artistic enhancement. Furthermore, the fact of its being copied from the Vatican copy after the [[Sack of Rome in 1527]] suggests that the original image may have survived that event.\n\nIt is kept in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)|Schatzkammer]] of Sacred and Secular Treasurers of the Habsburg dynasty in the [[Hofburg Palace]], Vienna.\n\n=== Monastery of the Holy Face, Alicante, Spain ===\nThis relic was acquired by Pope Nicholas V from relatives of the Byzantine Emperor in [[Fall of Constantinople|1453]]. This veil was given by a Vatican cardinal to a Spanish priest, Mosen Pedro Mena, who took it to [[Alicante]], in southern [[Spain]], where it arrived in 1489, at the same time as a severe drought. Carried in a procession on 17 March by an Alicante priest, Father Villafranca, a tear sprang from the eye of the face of Christ on the veil and rain began to fall. The relic is now housed in the Monastery of the Holy Face (Monasterio de la Santa Faz), on the outskirts of Alicante, in a chapel built in 1611 and decorated between 1677 and 1680 by the sculptor Jos\u00e9 Vilanova, the gilder Pere Joan Valero and the painter [[Juan Conchillos]]. The chapel is decorated with paintings depicting the miraculous termination of the drought, local personalities associated with the founding of the chapel and religious themes of judgment and salvation. The Monastery was extensively restored between 2003\u20136, together with the Cathedral of Saint Nicholas and the Basilica of St Mary in the city centre, and the three buildings housed an exhibition in 2006 about the relic under the name of ''The Face of Eternity''.<ref>''Visitor's Guide to the Exposici\u00f3n La Luz de las Imagenes \u2013 La Faz de la Eternidad'', Alicante 2006.</ref>\n\n=== Ja\u00e9n Cathedral, Ja\u00e9n, Spain ===\nThe [[Ja\u00e9n Cathedral|cathedral of Ja\u00e9n]] has a copy of the Veronica which probably dates from the fourteenth century and originates in Siena. It is kept in a shrine by the high altar and is annually exhibited to the people on Good Friday and on the Feast of the Assumption. It is exhibited in a chapel to the side of the Cathedral every Friday from 11.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. when visitors are allowed to kiss the glass that protects the image. Known as the Santo Rostro, it was acquired by Bishop Nicholas de Biedma in the 14th century.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 94</ref>\n\n== Similar images ==\n\n=== Holy Face of Genoa ===\n[[File:39bMandylion.jpg|The Mandylion of Edessa|thumb|120px|The Holy Face of San Silvestro, now in the Matilda chapel in the [[Vatican Palace|Vatican]].]]\nKept in the modest Church of St Bartholomew of The Armenians, [[Genoa]], it was given in the 14th century to the Doge Leonardo Montaldo by the Byzantine Emperor [[John V Palaeologus]].\n\nThe image was studied in detail in 1969 by Colette Dufour Bozzo, who dated the outer frame to the late 14th century,<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 162</ref> while the inner frame and the image itself are believed to have originated earlier. Bozzo found that the image was imprinted on a cloth that had been pasted onto a wooden board.<ref>Wilson, ibid, page 88</ref> The similarity of the image with the Veil of Veronica suggests a link between the two traditions.\n\n=== Holy Face of S. Silvestro ===\nThis image was kept in Rome's church of [[San Silvestro in Capite|S. Silvestro]] until 1870 and is now kept in the Matilda chapel in the Vatican. It is housed in a Baroque frame donated by one Sister Dionora Chiarucci in 1623.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 193</ref> The earliest evidence of its existence is 1517 when the nuns were forbidden to exhibit it to avoid competition with the Veronica. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on board and therefore is likely to be a copy.\n\nIt was exhibited at Germany's Expo 2000 in the pavilion of the Holy See.\n\n=== The Manoppello Image ===\n[[File:Volto-Santo 01.jpg|thumb|120px|The Manoppello Image.]]\n{{Main|Manoppello Image}}\nIn 1999, German Jesuit [[:de:Heinrich Pfeiffer (Kunsthistoriker)|Father Heinnrich Pfeiffer]], Professor of Art History at the Pontifical Gregorian University,<ref>http://holyfaceofmanoppello.blogspot.com/2008/05/fr-heinrich-pfeiffer-sj-teaches-about.html Excerpt of ''Il Volto Santo di Manoppello '' (The Holy Face of Manoppello), published by Carsa Edizioni in Pescara (page 13) access date March 2013</ref> announced at a press conference in [[Rome]] that he had found the Veil in a church of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery, in the small village of [[Manoppello, Italy]], where it had been since 1660. Professor Pfeiffer had, in fact, been promoting this image for many years before.<ref name=\"Ian Wilson page 161\">Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 161</ref> It is known as the [[Manoppello Image]].\n\nAccording to local tradition, an anonymous pilgrim arrived in 1508 with the cloth inside a wrapped package. The pilgrim gave it to Dr. Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, who was sitting on a bench in front of the church. The doctor went into the church and opened the parcel containing the Veil. At once, he went out of the church but did not find the bearer of the packet. The Veil was owned by the Leonelli family until 1608. Pancrazio Petrucci, a soldier married to Marzia Leonelli, stole the Veil from his father-in-law's house. A few years later, Marzia sold it for 400 scudi to Doctor Donato Antonio De Fabritiis to pay a ransom demand for her husband who was then a prisoner in Chieti. The Veil was given by De Fabritiis to the Capuchins, who still hold it today. This history was documented by Father Donato da Bomba in his ''Relatione historica'' following researches started in 1640.\n\n==House of Veronica in Jerusalem==\n[[File:Veronoca.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The Chapel of The Holy Face on the [[Via Dolorosa]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\nOn the [[Via Dolorosa]] in [[Jerusalem]] there is a small chapel, known as the Chapel of the Holy Face.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-via-dolorosa.htm |title= Via Dolorosa \u2013 Jerusalem |work= sacred-destinations.com}}</ref> Traditionally, this is regarded as the home of St Veronica and site of the miracle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Via Dolorosa |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226224951/http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/Toursite_form_atarEng.asp?site_id=463&pic_cat=4&icon_cat=6&york_cat=9&type_id=16 |website=Via Dolorosa |date=26 December 2007}}</ref>  \n\n\n== Representative art ==\n<!--  -->\n\n\n<!-- [[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|''Veronica's veil'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]-->\nThere are two main traditions for the iconography of the face depicted on the veil. One tradition (Type I), common in Italian art, shows the face of Christ as full-bearded, in pain, scourged and perhaps crowned with thorns.

Various existing images have been claimed to be the \"original\" relic, or early copies of it.\n\nThe final form of the Western tradition recounts that [[Saint Veronica]] from [[Jerusalem]] encountered [[Jesus]] along the [[Via Dolorosa]] on the way to [[Calvary]]. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin ''sudor'') off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by the Sixth [[Station of the Cross]]. According to some versions, St. Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor [[Tiberius]], and the veil, possessing the Grace of God, was able to quench thirst, cure blindness, and even raise the dead.\n\nThe story is not recorded in its present form until the [[Middle Ages]]. During the fourteenth century it became a central icon in the [[Western Church]]; in the words of art historian [[Neil Macgregor]]: \"From [the 14th Century] on, wherever the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]] went, the Veronica would go with it.\"<ref>\"Seeing Salvation\".

The closest written reference is the [[miracle]] of [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman]] by touching the hem of Jesus' garment ({{Bibleref2|Luke 8:43\u201348}}); her name is later identified as Veronica by the [[apocrypha]]l \"[[Acts of Pilate]]\". The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured Tiberius. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion, and the miraculous appearance of the image, was made by [[Roger d'Argenteuil]]'s ''Bible in French'' in the 13th century,<ref>G. Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'',1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 78\u201379, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}</ref> and gained further popularity following the internationally popular work ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'' of about 1300. It is also at this point that other depictions of the image change to include a crown of thorns, blood, and the expression of a man in pain,<ref>G Schiller, op. & page cit</ref> and the image became very common throughout Catholic Europe, forming part of the [[Arma Christi]], and with the meeting of Jesus and Veronica becoming one of the [[Stations of the Cross]].\n\n==Origin of the name==\nAccording to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], the name \"Veronica\" is a [[colloquial]] [[portmanteau]] of the [[Latin]] word '''''vera''''', meaning truth, and [[Greek language|Greek]] '''''icon (eikon)''''', meaning \"image\"; the Veil of Veronica was therefore largely regarded in medieval times as \"the true image\", and the truthful representation of Jesus, preceding the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15362a.htm |title= CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Veronica |work= newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\n== History of the veil ==\nThere was a physical image displayed in Rome in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries which was known and venerated as the Veil of Veronica. However, the history of that image is somewhat problematic.\n\n[[File:Saint veronica.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of ''St Veronica & the Veil'' at [[St Peter's Basilica]]]]\nIt has often been assumed that the Veronica was present in the [[Old St Peter's]] in the papacy of [[Pope John VII|John VII]] (705-8), as a chapel known as the Veronica chapel was built during his reign, and this seems to have been the assumption of later writers.{{cn|date=August 2015}} However, this is far from certain, as mosaics that decorated that chapel do not refer to the Veronica story in any way.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Furthermore, contemporaneous writers make no reference to the Veronica in this period.{{cn|date=August 2015}} \nIt would appear however that the Veronica was in place by 1011 when a scribe was identified as keeper of the cloth.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 175</ref>\n\nFirm recording of the Veronica only begins in 1199 when two pilgrims, Gerald de Barri ([[Giraldus Cambrensis]]) and [[Gervase of Tilbury]], made two accounts at different times of a visit to Rome, making direct reference to the existence of the Veil of Veronica. Shortly after that, in 1207, the cloth became more prominent when it was publicly paraded and displayed by [[Pope Innocent III]], who also granted indulgences to anyone praying before it. This parade, between St Peter's and the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Santo Spirito Hospital]], became an annual event and on one such occasion in 1300 [[Pope Boniface VIII]], who had it translated to St. Peter's in 1297, was inspired to proclaim the first [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] in 1300. During this Jubilee the Veronica was publicly displayed and became one of the \"Mirabilia Urbis\" (\"Wonders of the City\") for the [[pilgrim]]s who visited Rome. For the next two hundred years the Veronica, retained at Old St Peter's, was regarded as the most precious of all Christian relics; there [[Pedro Tafur]], a Spanish visitor in 1436, noted:\n<blockquote>On the right hand is a pillar as high as a small tower, and in it is the holy Veronica. When it is to be exhibited an opening is made in the roof of the church and a wooden chest or cradle is let down, in which are two clerics, and when they have descended, the chest or cradle is drawn up, and they, with the greatest reverence, take out the Veronica and show it to the people, who make concourse there upon the appointed day. It happens often that the worshippers are in danger of their lives, so many are they and so great is the press.<sub>Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch3 Andan\u00e7as e viajes]''.</sub></blockquote>\n\nAfter the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome in 1527]], some writers recorded that the veil had been destroyed: Messer Unbano tells the Duchess of Urbino that the Veronica was stolen and passed around the taverns of Rome.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 112</ref> Other writers however, testify to its continuing presence in the Vatican and one witness to the sacking states that the Veronica was not found by the looters.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 113</ref>\n\nMany artists of the time created reproductions of the Veronica, again suggesting its survival, but in 1616, [[Pope Paul V]] prohibited the manufacture of further copies unless made by a canon of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. In 1629, Pope [[Urban VIII]] not only prohibited reproductions of the Veronica from being made, but also ordered the destruction of all existing copies. His edict declared that anyone who had access to a copy must bring it to the Vatican, under penalty of excommunication.\n\nAfter that the Veronica disappears almost entirely from public view, and its subsequent history is unrecorded. As there is no conclusive evidence that it ever left St Peter's, the possibility exists that it remains there to this day; this would be consistent with such limited information as the Vatican has provided in recent centuries.\n\n== Images traditionally connected with the Veil of Veronica ==\nThere are at least six images in existence which bear a marked resemblance to each other and which are claimed to be the original Veil, a direct copy of it or, in two cases, the [[Mandylion]]. Each member of this group is enclosed in an elaborate outer frame with a gilded metal sheet (or [[riza]] in Russian) within, in which is cut an aperture where the face appears; at the lower extreme of the face there are three points which correspond to the shape of the hair and beard.\n\n<gallery heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Veil of Veronica\">\nFile:Vatican Veil of Veronica.jpg|The Vatican Veronica\nFile:Holy Face - Vienna.jpg|The Holy Face of Vienna\nFile:Holy Face - Alicante2.jpg|The Holy Face of Alicante\nFile:Holy Face - Jaen.jpg|The Holy Face of Ja\u00e9n\n</gallery>\n\n=== St. Peter's Basilica ===\nThere is an image kept in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]{{cn|date=March 2019}} which purports{{who|date=March 2019}} to be the same veil as was revered in the [[Middle Ages]].{{cn|date=March 2019}} This image is stored in the chapel that lies behind the balcony in the southwest pier supporting the dome.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nVery few inspections are recorded in modern times{{cn|date=March 2019}} and there are no detailed photographs.{{cn|date=March 2019}} The most detailed recorded inspection of the 20th century occurred in 1907 when Jesuit art historian [[Joseph Wilpert]]{{who|date=March 2019}} was allowed to remove two plates of glass to inspect the image.{{cn|date=March 2019}} According to author [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]], he commented that he saw only \"a square piece of light coloured material, somewhat faded through age, which bear two faint rust-brown stains, connected one to the other\".<ref>[[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]], ''[[Holy Faces, Secret Places]]'', page 63</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the face is still displayed each year on the occasion of the 5th Sunday of Lent, [[Passion Sunday]].{{cn|date=September 2014}} The blessing takes place after the traditional [[Vespers]] at 5.00 pm.{{cn|date=September 2014}} There is a short [[procession]] within the basilica, accompanied by the Roman [[litany]].{{cn|date=September 2014}} A bell rings and three [[Canon (priest)|canons]] carry the heavy frame out on the balcony above the statue of St. Veronica holding the veil.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Holy Veil of St. Veronica|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/paulus_magnus/4540886625/|website=flickr|publisher=Yahoo Co.|accessdate=25 September 2014}}{{dead link|date=March 2019}}</ref>{{cn|date=September 2014}} From this limited view no image is discernible and it is only possible to see the shape of the inner frame.{{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== The Hofburg Palace, Vienna ===\nIn the Hofburg Palace in Vienna there is a copy of the Veronica, identified by the signature of P. Strozzi in the right hand corner of the inner frame. He was the secretary of [[Pope Paul V]], and a man referred to by Vatican notary Jacopo Grimaldi as making a series of six meticulous copies of the veil in 1617.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 157</ref>\n\nThe outside of the frame is relatively modern, while the inner frame is roughly made and corresponds to the cut-out pattern of earlier copies. The face within is very unclear, more a series of blotches in which only the bare elements of a nose, eyes and mouth can be identified. This argues for the authenticity of the copy as there is clearly no attempt at artistic enhancement. Furthermore, the fact of its being copied from the Vatican copy after the [[Sack of Rome in 1527]] suggests that the original image may have survived that event.\n\nIt is kept in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)|Schatzkammer]] of Sacred and Secular Treasurers of the Habsburg dynasty in the [[Hofburg Palace]], Vienna.\n\n=== Monastery of the Holy Face, Alicante, Spain ===\nThis relic was acquired by Pope Nicholas V from relatives of the Byzantine Emperor in [[Fall of Constantinople|1453]]. This veil was given by a Vatican cardinal to a Spanish priest, Mosen Pedro Mena, who took it to [[Alicante]], in southern [[Spain]], where it arrived in 1489, at the same time as a severe drought. Carried in a procession on 17 March by an Alicante priest, Father Villafranca, a tear sprang from the eye of the face of Christ on the veil and rain began to fall. The relic is now housed in the Monastery of the Holy Face (Monasterio de la Santa Faz), on the outskirts of Alicante, in a chapel built in 1611 and decorated between 1677 and 1680 by the sculptor Jos\u00e9 Vilanova, the gilder Pere Joan Valero and the painter [[Juan Conchillos]]. The chapel is decorated with paintings depicting the miraculous termination of the drought, local personalities associated with the founding of the chapel and religious themes of judgment and salvation. The Monastery was extensively restored between 2003-6, together with the Cathedral of Saint Nicholas and the Basilica of St Mary in the city centre, and the three buildings housed an exhibition in 2006 about the relic under the name of ''The Face of Eternity''.<ref>''Visitor's Guide to the Exposici\u00f3n La Luz de las Imagenes \u2013 La Faz de la Eternidad'', Alicante 2006.</ref>\n\n=== Ja\u00e9n Cathedral, Ja\u00e9n, Spain ===\nThe [[Ja\u00e9n Cathedral|cathedral of Ja\u00e9n]] has a copy of the Veronica which probably dates from the fourteenth century and originates in Siena. It is kept in a shrine by the high altar and is annually exhibited to the people on Good Friday and on the Feast of the Assumption. It is exhibited in a chapel to the side of the Cathedral every Friday from 11.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. when visitors are allowed to kiss the glass that protects the image. Known as the Santo Rostro, it was acquired by Bishop Nicholas de Biedma in the 14th century.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 94</ref>\n\n== Similar images ==\n\n=== Holy Face of Genoa ===\n[[File:39bMandylion.jpg|The Mandylion of Edessa|thumb|120px|The Holy Face of San Silvestro, now in the Matilda chapel in the [[Vatican Palace|Vatican]].]]\nKept in the modest Church of St Bartholomew of The Armenians, [[Genoa]], it was given in the 14th century to the Doge Leonardo Montaldo by the Byzantine Emperor [[John V Palaeologus]].\n\nThe image was studied in detail in 1969 by Colette Dufour Bozzo, who dated the outer frame to the late 14th century,<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 162</ref> while the inner frame and the image itself are believed to have originated earlier. Bozzo found that the image was imprinted on a cloth that had been pasted onto a wooden board.<ref>Wilson, ibid, page 88</ref> The similarity of the image with the Veil of Veronica suggests a link between the two traditions.\n\n=== Holy Face of S. Silvestro ===\nThis image was kept in Rome's church of [[San Silvestro in Capite|S. Silvestro]] until 1870 and is now kept in the Matilda chapel in the Vatican. It is housed in a Baroque frame donated by one Sister Dionora Chiarucci in 1623.<ref>Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 193</ref> The earliest evidence of its existence is 1517 when the nuns were forbidden to exhibit it to avoid competition with the Veronica. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on board and therefore is likely to be a copy.\n\nIt was exhibited at Germany's Expo 2000 in the pavilion of the Holy See.\n\n=== The Manoppello Image ===\n[[File:Volto-Santo 01.jpg|thumb|120px|The Manoppello Image.]]\n{{Main|Manoppello Image}}\nIn 1999, German Jesuit [[:de:Heinrich Pfeiffer (Kunsthistoriker)|Father Heinnrich Pfeiffer]], Professor of Art History at the Pontifical Gregorian University,<ref>http://holyfaceofmanoppello.blogspot.com/2008/05/fr-heinrich-pfeiffer-sj-teaches-about.html Excerpt of ''Il Volto Santo di Manoppello '' (The Holy Face of Manoppello), published by Carsa Edizioni in Pescara (page 13) access date March 2013</ref> announced at a press conference in [[Rome]] that he had found the Veil in a church of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery, in the small village of [[Manoppello, Italy]], where it had been since 1660. Professor Pfeiffer had, in fact, been promoting this image for many years before.<ref name=\"Ian Wilson page 161\">Ian Wilson, ''Holy Faces, Secret Places'', page 161</ref> It is known as the [[Manoppello Image]].\n\nAccording to local tradition, an anonymous pilgrim arrived in 1508 with the cloth inside a wrapped package. The pilgrim gave it to Dr. Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, who was sitting on a bench in front of the church. The doctor went into the church and opened the parcel containing the Veil. At once, he went out of the church but did not find the bearer of the packet. The Veil was owned by the Leonelli family until 1608. Pancrazio Petrucci, a soldier married to Marzia Leonelli, stole the Veil from his father-in-law's house. A few years later, Marzia sold it for 400 scudi to Doctor Donato Antonio De Fabritiis to pay a ransom demand for her husband who was then a prisoner in Chieti. The Veil was given by De Fabritiis to the Capuchins, who still hold it today. This history was documented by Father Donato da Bomba in his ''Relatione historica'' following researches started in 1640.\n\n==House of Veronica in Jerusalem==\n[[File:Veronoca.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The Chapel of The Holy Face on the [[Via Dolorosa]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\nOn the [[Via Dolorosa]] in [[Jerusalem]] there is a small chapel, known as the Chapel of the Holy Face.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-via-dolorosa.htm |title= Via Dolorosa \u2013 Jerusalem |work= sacred-destinations.com}}</ref> Traditionally, this is regarded as the home of St Veronica and site of the miracle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Via Dolorosa |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226224951/http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/Toursite_form_atarEng.asp?site_id=463&pic_cat=4&icon_cat=6&york_cat=9&type_id=16 |website=Via Dolorosa |date=26 December 2007}}</ref>  \n\n\n== Representative art ==\n<!--  -->\n\n\n<!-- [[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|''Veronica's veil'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]-->\nThere are two main traditions for the iconography of the face depicted on the veil.
