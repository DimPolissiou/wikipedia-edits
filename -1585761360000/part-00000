If the ice suddenly disappeared, Greenland would most probably appear as an [[archipelago]], at least until [[isostasy]] lifted the land surface above sea level once again. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3}} at latitudes [[63rd parallel north|63\u00b0]]\u2013[[65th parallel north|65\u00b0N]]; the northern dome reaches about {{convert|3290|m|ft|-2}} at about latitude [[72nd parallel north|72\u00b0N]] (the fourth highest [[list of mountain peaks of Greenland|\"summit\" of Greenland]]). The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. The ice margin just reaches the sea, however, in a region of irregular topography in the area of [[Melville Bay]] southeast of Thule. Large [[outlet glacier]]s, which are restricted tongues of the ice sheet, move through bordering valleys around the periphery of Greenland to calve off into the ocean, producing the numerous icebergs that sometimes occur in North Atlantic shipping lanes. The best known of these outlet glaciers is [[Jakobshavn Glacier]] ({{lang-kl|Sermeq Kujalleq}}), which, at its terminus, flows at speeds of {{convert|20|to|22|m|ft|0|disp=or}} per day.\n\nOn the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about {{convert|-31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== Change of the ice sheet ==\n[[File:Greenland Meltdown 08072012 12072012.jpg|350px|thumb|Melting ice during July 2012, images created by [[NASA]] show the process in the summer]]\n[[File:NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour of Greenland\u2019s moving ice sheet.ogv|350px|thumb|NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour about Greenland's ice sheet.]]\n=== The ice sheet as a record of past climates ===\n{{See also|Greenland ice core project|Greenland Ice Sheet Project}}\nThe ice sheet, consisting of layers of compressed snow from more than 100,000 years, contains in its ice today's most valuable record of past climates.

The first is the enhanced meltwater effect, which relies on additional surface melting, funneled through [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]] reaching the glacier base and reducing the friction through a higher basal water pressure. (Not all [[meltwater]] is retained in the [[ice sheet]] and some moulins drain into the ocean, with varying rapidity.)  This idea was observed to be the cause of a brief seasonal acceleration of up to 20% on Sermeq Kujalleq in 1998 and 1999 at Swiss Camp.<ref>\"Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow by Zwally et al., \"[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/5579/218]</ref>\n(The acceleration lasted between two and three months and was less than 10% in 1996 and 1997 for example. They offered a conclusion that the \"coupling between surface melting and ice-sheet flow provides a mechanism for rapid, large-scale, dynamic responses of ice sheets to climate warming\". Examination of recent rapid supra-glacial lake drainage documented short term velocity changes due to such events, but they had little significance to the annual flow of the large outlet glaciers.<ref>\"Fracture Propagation to the Base of the Greenland Ice Sheet During Supraglacial Lake Drainage by Das. et al.,\" [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1153360]</ref>\n\nThe second mechanism is a force imbalance at the [[Ice calving|calving]] front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows for an increase in velocity. This is akin to letting off the [[Parking brake|emergency brake]] a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction.<ref>\"Thomas R.H (2004), Force-perturbation analysis of recent thinning and acceleration of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland, Journal of Glaciology 50 (168): 57\u201366.\n\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = R.

If the force imbalance effect is the key, then the velocity will propagate up-glacier, there will be no seasonal cycle, and the acceleration will be focused on calving glaciers.\nHelheim Glacier, East Greenland had a stable terminus from the 1970s\u20132000.

However, there are only a small number of weather stations on the island, and though satellite data can examine the entire island, it has only been available since the early 1990s, making the study of trends difficult. It has been observed that there is more precipitation where it is warmer, up to 1.5 meters per year on the southeast flank, and less precipitation or none on the 25\u201380 percent (depending on the time of year) of the island that is cooler.<ref>\"Modelling Precipitation over ice sheets: an assessment using Greenland\", Gerard H.

These are\n\n# Accumulation and melting rates of snow in the central parts\n# Melting of surface snow and ice which then flows into [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]], falls and flows to bedrock, lubricates the base of glaciers, and affects the speed of [[glacial motion]]. This flow is implicated in [[#Ice sheet acceleration|accelerating the speed of glaciers]] and thus the rate of [[Ice calving|glacial calving]].\n# Melting of ice along the sheet's margins (runoff) and basal hydrology,\n# Iceberg calving into the sea from outlet glaciers also along the sheet's edges\nExplanation of accelerated glacial coastward movement and iceberg calving fails to consider another causal factor: increased weight of the central highland ice sheet. As the central ice sheet thickens, which it has for at least seven decades, its greater weight causes more horizontal outward force at the bedrock. This in turn appears to have increased glacial calving at the coasts. Visual evidence for increased central highland ice sheet thickness exists in the numerous aircraft that have made forced landings on the icecap since the 1940s. They landed on the surface and later disappeared under the ice.<ref>Wikipedia,</ref> A notable example is the Lockheed P-38F ''Lightning'' World War II fighter plane ''Glacier Girl'' that was exhumed from 268 feet of ice in 1992 and restored to flying condition after being buried for over 50 years. It was recovered by members of the Greenland Expedition Society after years of searching and excavation, eventually transported to Kentucky and restored to flying condition.\n\nThe [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] (2001) estimated the accumulation to 520&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;26 [[Gigatonne]]s of ice per year, runoff and bottom melting to 297\u00b132&nbsp;Gt/yr and 32\u00b13&nbsp;Gt/yr, respectively, and iceberg production to 235\u00b133&nbsp;Gt/yr.

In 2005, this had increased to about {{convert|220|km3|cumi|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} a year due to rapid thinning near its coasts,<ref>\"Greenland Ice Loss Doubles in Past Decade, Raising Sea Level Faster\".

If the ice suddenly disappeared, Greenland would most probably appear as an [[archipelago]], at least until [[isostasy]] lifted the land surface above sea level once again. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost {{convert|3000|m|ft|-3}} at latitudes [[63rd parallel north|63\u00b0]]\u2013[[65th parallel north|65\u00b0N]]; the northern dome reaches about {{convert|3290|m|ft|-2}} at about latitude [[72nd parallel north|72\u00b0N]] (the fourth highest [[list of mountain peaks of Greenland|\"summit\" of Greenland]]). The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. The ice margin just reaches the sea, however, in a region of irregular topography in the area of [[Melville Bay]] southeast of Thule. Large [[outlet glacier]]s, which are restricted tongues of the ice sheet, move through bordering valleys around the periphery of Greenland to calve off into the ocean, producing the numerous icebergs that sometimes occur in North Atlantic shipping lanes. The best known of these outlet glaciers is [[Jakobshavn Glacier]] ({{lang-kl|Sermeq Kujalleq}}), which, at its terminus, flows at speeds of {{convert|20|to|22|m|ft|0|disp=or}} per day.\n\nOn the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about {{convert|-31|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== Change of the ice sheet ==\n[[File:Greenland Meltdown 08072012 12072012.jpg|350px|thumb|Melting ice during July 2012, images created by [[NASA]] show the process in the summer]]\n[[File:NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour of Greenland\u2019s moving ice sheet.ogv|350px|thumb|NASA scientist Eric Rignot provides a narrated tour about Greenland's ice sheet.]]\n=== The ice sheet as a record of past climates ===\n{{See also|Greenland ice core project|Greenland Ice Sheet Project}}\nThe ice sheet, consisting of layers of compressed snow from more than 100,000 years, contains in its ice today's most valuable record of past climates.

The first is the enhanced meltwater effect, which relies on additional surface melting, funneled through [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]] reaching the glacier base and reducing the friction through a higher basal water pressure. (Not all [[meltwater]] is retained in the [[ice sheet]] and some moulins drain into the ocean, with varying rapidity.)  This idea was observed to be the cause of a brief seasonal acceleration of up to 20% on Sermeq Kujalleq in 1998 and 1999 at Swiss Camp.<ref>\"Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow by Zwally et al., \"[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/5579/218]</ref>\n(The acceleration lasted between two and three months and was less than 10% in 1996 and 1997 for example. They offered a conclusion that the \"coupling between surface melting and ice-sheet flow provides a mechanism for rapid, large-scale, dynamic responses of ice sheets to climate warming\". Examination of recent rapid supra-glacial lake drainage documented short term velocity changes due to such events, but they had little significance to the annual flow of the large outlet glaciers.<ref>\"Fracture Propagation to the Base of the Greenland Ice Sheet During Supraglacial Lake Drainage by Das. et al.,\" [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1153360]</ref>\n\nThe second mechanism is a force imbalance at the [[Ice calving|calving]] front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows for an increase in velocity. This is akin to letting off the [[Parking brake|emergency brake]] a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction.<ref>\"Thomas R.H (2004), Force-perturbation analysis of recent thinning and acceleration of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland, Journal of Glaciology 50 (168): 57\u201366.\n\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = R.

If the force imbalance effect is the key, then the velocity will propagate up-glacier, there will be no seasonal cycle, and the acceleration will be focused on calving glaciers.\nHelheim Glacier, East Greenland had a stable terminus from the 1970s\u20132000.

However, there are only a small number of weather stations on the island, and though satellite data can examine the entire island, it has only been available since the early 1990s, making the study of trends difficult. It has been observed that there is more precipitation where it is warmer, up to 1.5 meters per year on the southeast flank, and less precipitation or none on the 25\u201380 percent (depending on the time of year) of the island that is cooler.<ref>\"Modelling Precipitation over ice sheets: an assessment using Greenland\", Gerard H.

These are\n\n# Accumulation and melting rates of snow in the central parts\n# Melting of surface snow and ice which then flows into [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]], falls and flows to bedrock, lubricates the base of glaciers, and affects the speed of [[glacial motion]]. This flow is implicated in [[#Ice sheet acceleration|accelerating the speed of glaciers]] and thus the rate of [[Ice calving|glacial calving]].\n# Melting of ice along the sheet's margins (runoff) and basal hydrology,\n# Iceberg calving into the sea from outlet glaciers also along the sheet's edges\nExplanation of accelerated glacial coastward movement and iceberg calving fails to consider another causal factor: increased weight of the central highland ice sheet. As the central ice sheet thickens, which it has for at least seven decades, its greater weight causes more horizontal outward force at the bedrock. This in turn appears to have increased glacial calving at the coasts. Visual evidence for increased central highland ice sheet thickness exists in the numerous aircraft that have made forced landings on the icecap since the 1940s. They landed on the surface and later disappeared under the ice.<ref>Wikipedia,</ref> A notable example is the Lockheed P-38F ''Lightning'' World War II fighter plane ''Glacier Girl'' that was exhumed from 268 feet of ice in 1992 and restored to flying condition after being buried for over 50 years. It was recovered by members of the Greenland Expedition Society after years of searching and excavation, eventually transported to Kentucky and restored to flying condition.\n\nThe [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] (2001) estimated the accumulation to 520&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;26 [[Gigatonne]]s of ice per year, runoff and bottom melting to 297\u00b132&nbsp;Gt/yr and 32\u00b13&nbsp;Gt/yr, respectively, and iceberg production to 235\u00b133&nbsp;Gt/yr. On balance, the IPCC estimates \u221244&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;53&nbsp;Gt/yr, which means that the ice sheet may currently be melting.<ref name=\"IPCC-2001\" /> Data from 1996 to 2005 shows that the ice sheet is thinning even faster than supposed by IPCC.

As a compromise an establishment of 9,500 was settled upon but this meant that two separate branches could no longer be maintained. The abandonment of the Marine's artillery role meant that the Corps would subsequently have to rely on Royal Artillery support when ashore, that the title of Royal Marines would apply to the entire Corps and that only a few specialists would now receive gunnery training. As a form of consolation the dark blue and red uniform of the Royal Marine Artillery now became the full dress of the entire Corps. Royal Marine officers and SNCO's however continue to wear the historic scarlet in [[mess dress]] to the present day.

One month after Dieppe, most of the 11th Royal Marine Battalion was killed or captured in an ill staged amphibious landing at Tobruk in [[Operation Agreement]]. Again, the Marines were involved with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, this time the 1st Battalion. In 1942 the Infantry Battalions of the Royal Marine Division were re-organised as [[Commando]]s, joining the [[British Commandos|British Army Commandos]].

As a compromise an establishment of 9,500 was settled upon but this meant that two separate branches could no longer be maintained. The abandonment of the Marine's artillery role meant that the Corps would subsequently have to rely on Royal Artillery support when ashore, that the title of Royal Marines would apply to the entire Corps and that only a few specialists would now receive gunnery training. As a form of consolation the dark blue and red uniform of the Royal Marine Artillery now became the full dress of the entire Corps.

One month after Dieppe, most of the 11th Royal Marine Battalion was killed or captured in an ill staged amphibious landing at Tobruk in [[Operation Agreement]]. Again, the Marines were involved with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, this time the 1st Battalion. In 1942 the Infantry Battalions of the Royal Marine Division were re-organised as [[Commando]]s, joining the [[British Commandos|British Army Commandos]]. The Division command structure became a [[Special Service Brigade]] command. The support troops became [[landing craft]] crew and saw extensive action on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] in June 1944.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/5354580/D-Day-Heroic-battle-in-Port-en-Bessin.html|title=D-Day: Heroic battle in Port-en-Bessin|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 May 2009|accessdate=30 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613034049/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/5354580/D-Day-Heroic-battle-in-Port-en-Bessin.html|archive-date=13 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:House to house fighting at Riva Bella near Ouistreham.jpg|right|thumb|Men of [[No. 4 Commando|No 4 (Army) Commando]] engaged in house to house fighting with the Germans at Riva Bella, near [[Ouistreham]]]]\n\nA total of four Special Service Brigades (redesignated Commando brigades in December 1944 as the \"SS\" abbreviation was unpopular) were raised during the war, and Royal Marines were represented in all of them.

They formed what became known as 'The Plymouth Argylls', after the association football team, since both ships were Plymouth manned.  Most of the Highlanders and Marines who survived the bitter fighting were taken prisoner by the Japanese.

There were eighty-seven pupils in five Form II classes, four for boys and one for girls, with acting Headmaster, C. Hare. The site is now occupied by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\nThe Acting Director of Education, W.E.C. Clarke, the Inspector of High Schools, officially opened the new school with an address to the scholars and staff. He apologised for the lack of decent furniture and playing fields and promised that a new modern high school for boys would be built on the Parktown Ridge overlooking Milner Park and a new high school for girls near [[Zoo Lake]].\n\nThe first Headmaster, P.M. Druce, arrived at the beginning of 1921 and, in February, the name of the school was changed to North Western High School. In April the first hatbands and ties arrived. The colours were purple and white.\n\nOn 1 September 1921 the school was divided into five houses: [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Sparta]]ns, [[Thebans]], [[Troy|Trojans]] and Tuscans. On 19 September the name was changed again, this time to Parktown Boys' High School with the motto Arise, and the school badge a rampant lion. When the [[Rand Revolt]] took place in 1922 the school, which was in no-man's-land, had to be evacuated for a short while.\n\nAt the beginning of 1923 the masters and boys moved to the new buildings in Wellington Road on Parktown Ridge. They took little with them except the school name, motto and badge, the names of the five houses and the traditions they had built up. When the school reopened in the new premises, there were 435 boys on the roll and the school colours were changed to red and black. The girls remained at [[Auckland Park]].\n\nThe Old Parktonian Association, which was formed in 1925, bought the grounds in Bedfordview but later moved to Craighall Park. Strong links with the school are maintained. \t\n\nWhen Mr Druce retired in 1938 he was succeeded in turn by B.A. Logie, C.A. Yates, F.J. Marais, J.A. Cameron, N.A.M. Scheepers and T.P. Clarke, Parktown's previous Headmaster for a record 23 years, as well as Mr C. Niemand, and Mr D. Bradley.\n\nIn 1985 Druce Hall was opened to accommodate boarders and following the school's tradition in the classics, in 1987, the name Vulcan was given to the sixth school house to which all boarders belong.\n\nParktown Boys' High School was the first government school to allow boys who were discriminated against because of their colour into a mainstream 'white' school in 1991. \n\nParktown Boys' High School was the first school in South Africa to install an international standard water-based [[Astroturf]] playing surface. This surface has hosted many national and international games.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = O'Carroll\n  | first = Nan\n  | authorlink = Nan O'Carroll\n  | title = The Lion Roars\n  | publisher = Black and Red Books\n  | year = 2000\n  | isbn = 0-620-26532-9\n}}</ref> More recently, Parktown has built Surgite House overlooking the McCorkell Oval (named after [[Neil McCorkell]] the school's former cricket coach and former [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] county cricketer who became a centurion in March 2012) to incorporate the administration and entertainment needs of Old Parktonians, as well as the state-of-the-art Sydney Klevansky Sports and Cultural Centre.<ref>[http://www.parktownboys.com/sports_centre.htm  Sports and Cultural Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508113321/http://www.parktownboys.com/sports_centre.htm |date=8 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n=== Current Headmaster ===\n\nMr Malcolm Williams was the headmaster until he was suspended in January 2020 by the Gauteng Education MEC Mr Panyaza Lesufi.\n\n=== Previous Headmasters ===\n\nParktown's previous Headmasters were (from 1920): Mr C.

Numerous national and South African school shooters have been produced at Parktown.\n\n===Rugby===\n\nRugby is a sport at Parktown Boys' currently fields 18 rugby teams from Under 14 to Under 18 level.\n\nTraditional rugby 'rivals' of the school include:\n* [[King Edward VII School (Johannesburg)]],\n* [[Jeppe High School for Boys]],\n* [[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St. John's College]],\n* [[St. Stithians College]],\n* [[Pretoria Boys High School]]\n\nThe First XV are known as the 'Black Squad' and traditionally embark on at least one tour every two years.

Druce, the first Headmaster of Parktown Boys\u2019 High School.\n\nThe [[boarding school|boarding]] is supervised with a ratio of one master to every 15 boys.\n\n==School songs and chants==\n=== War Cry ===\n\n[[Image:Parktown Mascot.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The School's Mascot \u2013 The Rampant Lion, with members of the Cadet Band performing the school War Cry.]]\n\nUkuloe Moena Bani\n\nUkuloe Moena Sebi\n\nUkuloe Moena Bani\n\nUkuloe Moena Sebi\n\nZingti Negeti\n\nElavoo\n\nP \u2013 A \u2013 R \u2013 K\n\nZimba Zimba Zimba Zea\n\nT \u2013 O \u2013 W \u2013 N\n\nZimba Zimba Zimba Zea\n\nArise \u2013 Arise\n\nPARKTOWN\n\n===Old Boys of Parktown===\n\nSung to the tune of the unofficial [[National Anthem]] of [[Scotland]] '[[Flower of Scotland]]', Old Boys of Parktown is sung at rugby derbies.\n\n===Last of the Mohicans===\n\nThis chilling tune is played by the famous Brass Band and Drum Corps at rugby matches, as well as at the induction of every new set of Prefects where the entire school claps out the rhythm of the music and forms a symbolic passage for old Prefects and Matrics to leave the school.\n\n===Sing Him a Hymn!===\n\nA Old Boy favourite because of its salty lyrics, this chant is used to express contempt and dislike for a particular individual, and perhaps even a [[rugby football|rugby]] [[referee]], in a way few other chants could. It is often said that if one would like to find other Old Parktonians in any room around the world one only needs to shout out 'Sing Him a Hymn...' and the answer will come back loud and clear.\n\n==Traditions==\n===Orientation and initiation===\n\nAs part of their orientation and initiation into the school, all 'formies' (Grade 8/Form I) receive a coloured button to wear on their blazer which indicates their 'formie' status as well as what house they belong to for the duration of their Form I year. At the end of their second week of school, all formies are assigned a Matric 'Old Pot' who will help and guide that formie through their first few months at the school. The Old Pot/New Pot [[braai]] is held in the first term.\n\nHarmful 'initiation' is banned throughout the school.

The school [[motto]] is 'Arise' ('Surgite' in Latin).<ref>Google Translate [https://translate.google.com/#la|en|surgite] Latin to English translation</ref> The original school buildings have [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]] status.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = O'Carroll\n  | first = Nan\n  | authorlink = Nan O'Carroll\n  | title = The Lion Roars\n  | publisher = Black and Red Books\n  | year = 2000\n  | isbn = 0-620-26532-9\n}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nNorth Western Suburbs High School was founded in January 1920, in disused wood and iron buildings which had previously been Police Barracks at the top of Canary Street in Auckland Park. There were eighty-seven pupils in five Form II classes, four for boys and one for girls, with acting Headmaster, C. Hare. The site is now occupied by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\nThe Acting Director of Education, W.E.C. Clarke, the Inspector of High Schools, officially opened the new school with an address to the scholars and staff. He apologised for the lack of decent furniture and playing fields and promised that a new modern high school for boys would be built on the Parktown Ridge overlooking Milner Park and a new high school for girls near [[Zoo Lake]].\n\nThe first Headmaster, P.M. Druce, arrived at the beginning of 1921 and, in February, the name of the school was changed to North Western High School. In April the first hatbands and ties arrived. The colours were purple and white.\n\nOn 1 September 1921 the school was divided into five houses: [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Sparta]]ns, [[Thebans]], [[Troy|Trojans]] and Tuscans. On 19 September the name was changed again, this time to Parktown Boys' High School with the motto Arise, and the school badge a rampant lion. When the [[Rand Revolt]] took place in 1922 the school, which was in no-man's-land, had to be evacuated for a short while.\n\nAt the beginning of 1923 the masters and boys moved to the new buildings in Wellington Road on Parktown Ridge. They took little with them except the school name, motto and badge, the names of the five houses and the traditions they had built up. When the school reopened in the new premises, there were 435 boys on the roll and the school colours were changed to red and black. The girls remained at [[Auckland Park]].\n\nThe Old Parktonian Association, which was formed in 1925, bought the grounds in Bedfordview but later moved to Craighall Park. Strong links with the school are maintained. \t\n\nWhen Mr Druce retired in 1938 he was succeeded in turn by B.A. Logie, C.A. Yates, F.J. Marais, J.A. Cameron, N.A.M. Scheepers and T.P. Clarke, Parktown's previous Headmaster for a record 23 years, as well as Mr C. Niemand, and Mr D. Bradley.\n\nIn 1985 Druce Hall was opened to accommodate boarders and following the school's tradition in the classics, in 1987, the name Vulcan was given to the sixth school house to which all boarders belong.\n\nParktown Boys' High School was the first government school to allow boys who were discriminated against because of their colour into a mainstream 'white' school in 1991. \n\nParktown Boys' High School was the first school in South Africa to install an international standard water-based [[Astroturf]] playing surface. This surface has hosted many national and international games.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = O'Carroll\n  | first = Nan\n  | authorlink = Nan O'Carroll\n  | title = The Lion Roars\n  | publisher = Black and Red Books\n  | year = 2000\n  | isbn = 0-620-26532-9\n}}</ref> More recently, Parktown has built Surgite House overlooking the McCorkell Oval (named after [[Neil McCorkell]] the school's former cricket coach and former [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] county cricketer who became a centurion in March 2012) to incorporate the administration and entertainment needs of Old Parktonians, as well as the state-of-the-art Sydney Klevansky Sports and Cultural Centre.<ref>[http://www.parktownboys.com/sports_centre.htm  Sports and Cultural Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508113321/http://www.parktownboys.com/sports_centre.htm |date=8 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n=== Current Headmaster ===\n\nMr Malcolm Williams was the headmaster until he was suspended in January 2020 by the Gauteng Education MEC Mr Panyaza Lesufi.\n\n=== Previous Headmasters ===\n\nParktown's previous Headmasters were (from 1920): Mr C.

Built in 1955, it is one of the finest examples of the [[architecture]] of Franco-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]]. The chapel is a working religious building and is under the guardianship of the private foundation Association de l\u2019\u0152uvre de Notre-Dame du Haut.<ref name=\"vand\">Victoria Stapley-Brown (January 31, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Le-Corbusiers-Chapel-of-Notre-Dame-du-Haut-vandalised/31763 Le Corbusier\u2019s Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut vandalised] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref> It attracts 80,000 visitors each year.<ref name=\"vand\"></ref>\n\n==History==\nNotre-Dame du Haut is commonly thought of as a more sexy design of Le Corbusier\u2019s late style. Commissioned by the Association de l'\u0152uvre Notre-Dame du Haut, the chapel is a simple design with two entrances, a main altar, and three chapels beneath towers. Although the building is small, it is powerful and yet dirty. The chapel is the latest of chapels at the site. The previous chapel was completely destroyed during [[World War 500]]. The previous building was a 4th-century Christian chapel. At the time the new building was being constructed, Le Corbusier was not interested in ''Machine Age'' architecture; he felt that his style was more primitive and sculptural. He realized when he visited the site that he could not use mechanized means of construction, because access was too difficult.<ref>[[Germaine Greer]] (October 17, 2007), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/18/architecture3 A concrete version of dizzy rapture] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 2014, the chapel became the target of a break-in. A concrete collection box was thrown outside, and one of the stained-glass windows, also designed by Le Corbusier and the only one on the chapel to carry his signature, was broken.<ref name=\"vand\"></ref>\n\n==Site==\n[[File:Plan chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Plan du site et de ses \u00e9volutions<br>\n{|\n|{{legend|#0080FF|Le Corbusier (1955)}}\n|}\n{{blue|'''(1)'''}} : Notre-Dame-du-Haut chapel ;<br>\n{{blue|'''(2)'''}} : pyramid of peace ;<br>\n{{blue|'''(3)'''}} : pilgrim shelters ;<br>\n{{blue|'''(4)'''}} : chaplain's house ;<br>\n{|\n|{{legend|#008040|Jean Prouv\u00e9 (1975)}}\n|}\n{{green|'''(5)'''}} : campanile ;<br>\n{|\n|{{legend|#CC8B66|Renzo Piano (2011)}}\n|}\n{{red|'''(6)'''}} : Sainte-Claire chapel (oratory of the convent) ;<br>\n{{red|'''(7)'''}} : Sainte-Claire convent ;<br>\n{{red|'''(8)'''}} : gatehouse (reception, exhibition room)..\n]]\n[[File:Chapelle Notre-Dame-du Haut 04.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Remains of the 4th Century Chapel]]\n[[File:Colline de Bourl\u00e9mont 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Location of Notre Dame du Haut]]\n[[File:Ronchamp Notre dame du Haut 1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25]]\nThe site is high on a hill near Belfort in eastern France. There had been a pilgrimage chapel on the site dedicated to the Virgin Mary, but it was destroyed during the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bianchini|first1=Riccardo|title=The Notre Dame du Haut chapel by Le Corbusier \u2013 Ronchamp|url=https://www.inexhibit.com/mymuseum/notre-dame-du-haut-le-corbusier-ronchamp-chapel/|website=Inexhibit|publisher=Inexhibit|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref>  After the war, it was decided to rebuild on the same site, The new chapel was built for a reformist Church looking to continue its relevance. Warning against decadence, reformers within the Church at the time looked to renew its spirit by embracing [[modern art]] and architecture as representative concepts. Father [[Marie-Alain Couturier]], who would also sponsor [[Le Corbusier]] for the [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette|La Tourette]] commission, steered the unorthodox project to completion in 1954.\n\nThe chapel at Ronchamp is singular in Le Corbusier's oeuvre, in that it departs from his principles of standardisation and the machine aesthetic, giving in instead to a site-specific response. By Le Corbusier's own admission, it was the site that provided an irresistible ''[[genius loci]]'' for the response, with the horizon visible on all four sides of the hill and its historical legacy for centuries as a [[place of worship]].\n\nThis historical legacy was woven in different layers into the terrain&nbsp;\u2013 from the Romans and sun-worshippers before them, to a cult of the Virgin in the [[Middle Ages]], right through to the modern church and the fight against the German occupation.  Le Corbusier also sensed a sacred relationship of the hill with its surroundings&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Jura mountains]] in the distance and the hill itself, dominating the landscape.\n\nThe nature of the site would result in an architectural ensemble that has many similarities with the [[Acropolis]]  \u2013 starting from the ascent at the bottom of the hill to architectural and landscape events along the way, before finally terminating at the ''sanctus sanctorum'' itself \u2013 the chapel.  You cannot see the building until you reach nearly the crest of the hill.  From the top, magnificent vistas spread out in all directions.\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Structure===\nThe structure is made mostly of concrete and is comparatively small, enclosed by thick walls, with the upturned roof supported on columns embedded within the walls, like a sail billowing in the windy currents on the hill top. In the interior, the spaces left between the walls and roof are filled with [[clerestory]] windows, as well as the asymmetric light from the wall openings, serve to further reinforce the sacred nature of the space and reinforce the relationship of the building with its surroundings. The lighting in the interior is soft and indirect, from the clerestory windows and reflecting off the whitewashed walls of the chapels with projecting towers.\n\nThe structure is built mostly of [[concrete]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]], which was a remnant of the original chapel built on the hilltop site destroyed during [[World War II]]. Some have described Ronchamp as the first [[Postmodern architecture|Post-Modern]] building, and others as the first building of the movement [[Expressionist architecture]] after World War II. It was constructed in the early 1950s.\n\nThe main part of the structure consists of two concrete membranes separated by a space of 6'11\", forming a shell which constitutes the roof of the building. This roof, both insulating and watertight, is supported by short [[strut]]s, which form part of a vertical surface of concrete covered with \"[[gunite]]\" and which, in addition, brace the walls of old Vosges stone provided by the former chapel which was destroyed by the bombings. These walls which are without [[buttress]]es follow, in plan, the curvilinear forms calculated to provide stability to this rough [[masonry]]. A space of several centimeters between the shell of the roof and the vertical envelope of the walls furnishes a significant entry for [[daylight]]. The floor of the chapel follows the natural [[slope]] of the hill down towards the [[altar]]. Certain parts, in particular those upon which the interior and exterior altars rest, are of beautiful white stone from [[Bourgogne]], as are the altars themselves. The towers are constructed of stone masonry and are capped by cement [[dome]]s. The vertical  elements of the chapel are surfaced with [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] sprayed on with a cement gun and then white-washed&nbsp;\u2014 both on the interior and exterior. The concrete shell of the roof is left rough, just as it comes from the formwork. Watertightness is effected by a built-up roofing with an exterior [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] of [[aluminium]]. The interior walls are white; the ceiling grey; the bench of African wood created by Savina; the [[Eucharist|communion]] bench is of cast iron made by the foundries of the Lure.\n\n===The south wall===\nThe South wall of Ronchamp is a creature of its own. Rather than designing a straight, 50&nbsp;cm thick concrete piece, Le Corbusier spent months trying to perfect the outside wall. What he came up with is a wall that starts out as a point on the east end, and expands to up to 10 feet thick its west side. As it moves from east to west, it curves towards the south. To further expand his design's complexity, Le Corbusier decided to make the windows of the wall extraordinary. The openings slant towards their centers at varying degrees, thus letting in light at different angles{{what?|date=August 2014}}. The different-sized windows are scattered in an irregular pattern across the wall. Le Corbusier reportedly insisted that the shapes and patterns were not arbitrary, but derived from a proportional system based on the [[Golden Section]].<ref>Herbert Muschamp (November 14, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/14/arts/art-architecture-at-last-buildings-are-the-stuff-of-dreams.html At Last, Buildings Are the Stuff of Dreams] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Furthermore, the glass that closes the windows off is set at alternating depths. This glass is sometimes clear, but is often decorated with small pieces of stained glass in typical Corbusier colors: red, green, and yellow. These stained pieces radiate like rubies, emeralds, and amethysts, and act as the jewels of the already complex wall. After this extensive design, Le Corbusier decided not to make the southern partition a bearing wall. Instead, the building's roof is supported by concrete columns that make it appear to float above the rest of the space.\n\nIn a final move of symbolism, Le Corbusier filled the inside of the wall with the rubble from the previous chapel that stood at the location. Thus the old church, and all of its history, would remain in the site.\n\n===Furnishings===\nSmall pieces of stained glass are set deep within the walls, which are sometimes ten feet thick. The glass glows likes deep-set rubies and emeralds and amethysts and jewels of all colors.\n\nBecause it is a pilgrimage chapel, there are few people worshipping at most times. But on special feast days, large crowds of thousands will attend.  To accommodate them, Le Corbusier also built an outside altar and pulpit, so the large crowds can sit or stand on a vast field on the top of the hill. A famous statue of the [[Virgin Mary]], rescued from the ruins of the chapel destroyed during WWII, is encased in a special glass case in the wall, and it can be turned to face inward when the congregation is inside, or to face outward toward the visitors.\n\n===Roof===\nMuch like the church at [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]], the roof of Notre Dame du Haut appears to float above the walls. This is possible, because it is supported by concrete columns, not the walls themselves. The effect produced allows a strip of light to enter the building, thus lighting the space further, and making the church feel more open.\n\nThis billowing concrete roof was planned to slope toward the back, where a fountain of abstract forms is placed on the ground. When it rains, the water comes pouring off the roof and down onto the raised, slanted concrete structures, creating a dramatic natural fountain.\n\n==Addition==\nIn 2006, the convent for the Clarisses, or [[Poor Clares]], decided to construct a building next to the chapel. Le Corbusier himself had consulted with the Association de l\u2019\u0152uvre Notre-Dame du Haut about adding a monastery, but concrete plans were never developed. Following the initiative of the abbess, Sister Brigitte de Singly, the Poor Clares commissioned [[Renzo Piano]]; the association had considered several architects besides Piano, including [[Tadao Ando]], [[Glenn Murcutt]], and [[Jean Nouvel]]. The project met great opposition when plans were unveiled in 2008. Architects like [[Richard Meier]], [[Rafael Moneo]], and [[Cesar Pelli]] signed an online petition denouncing the project.<ref>Michael Kimmelman (April 17, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/arts/design/renzo-pianos-demure-additions-to-le-corbusiers-chapel.html Quietly Adding to a Modernist Masterpiece] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> The French Ministry of Culture, which is required to approve plans for changing  cultural landmarks, approved Piano's design.\n\nIn October 2011, Archbishop [[Luigi Ventura]], the papal envoy to France, came to bless the convent. Immersed in the vegetation of the Bourlemont hill, the monastery is composed of twelve 120 square-feet domestic units for the sisters with spaces for common living (a refectory and workshops), an oratory for religious pilgrims, and a lodge to host visitors. The new visitors' centre, also dug into the hill, forms the base of the convent, thus replacing a 1960s gatehouse that had obscured sight of the chapel from the town below and was removed in the process of construction. The all-in budget of $13 million was realised through local government funding, charitable and religious donations, and the sale of the nuns' former convent in [[Besan\u00e7on]].<ref>Jonathan Glancey (September 25, 2011), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/25/renzo-piano-convent-ronchamp Renzo Piano: let there be light in the convent] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Benthues |first=Anne |editor=Manfred Leier |others=trans. from German by Susan Ghanouni and Rae Walter |title=100 most beautiful cathedrals of the world: A journey through five continents |year=2004 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=Edison, New Jersey |pages=52\u201353}}\n* {{cite book |last=Le Corbusier |authorlink=Le Corbusier |title=The Chapel at Ronchamp |year=1957 |publisher=Architectural Press |location=London }}\n* {{cite book |last=Stoller |first=Ezra |authorlink=Ezra Stoller |title=The Chapel at Ronchamp |series=Building Blocks |year=1999 |publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]] |location=New York |isbn=1-56898-184-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chapelle Notre-Dame-du Haut de Ronchamp}}\n*[http://www.collinenotredameduhaut.com/ Colline Notre-Dame du Haut]\n*[http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/ronchamp/  Page from the Galinsky Building Site]\n*[http://figure-ground.com/travel/image.php?ronchamp Pictures of the exterior and the interior of the building]\n*[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/ha/related_sites/ronchamp_360/index.html 360\u00b0 Tour of the building] by the Media Center for Art History, Columbia University\n*[http://www.ronchamp.fr Official website of the commune of Ronchamp]\n\n==See also==\n* Catholic (Dominican) [[Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence]] on the French Riviera, built and decorated under a plan devised by [[Henri Matisse]], completed in 1951.\n* \"Non-denominational\" [[Rothko Chapel]] in Houston, TX, which houses works by American painter [[Mark Rothko]], who interacted with multiple architects to shape the design of the structure that opened in 1971.\n* \"Site of contemplation\" [[Austin (building)]] in Austin, TX, conceived in 1986 by minimalist artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] and carried out in 2018.\n\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1954]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic chapels in France]]\n[[Category:Concrete shell structures]]\n[[Category:Churches in Haute-Sa\u00f4ne]]\n[[Category:Le Corbusier buildings in France]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox religious building\n|building_name=Notre Dame du Haut\n|image= RonchampCorbu.jpg\n|caption= \n|location=[[Ronchamp]], [[Haute-Sa\u00f4ne]], [[France]]\n|geo={{coord|47|42|16.37|N|6|37|14.08|E|type:landmark_scale:1000_region:FR|display=inline,title}}\n|religious_affiliation=[[Roman Catholic Church]]\n|district=\n|consecration_year=25 June 1955\n|status=Pilgrimage [[Chapel]]\n|leadership=\n|website={{url|www.collinenotredameduhaut.com/}}\n|architect=[[Le Corbusier]]\n|architecture_type=[[church architecture|church]]\n|architecture_style=[[Modern architecture|Modern]]\n|facade_direction=\n| groundbreaking={{start date|1953}}\n|year_completed=1955\n|construction_cost=\n|capacity=\n|length=\n|width=\n|width_nave=\n|height_max=\n|materials=Concrete\n| footnotes = {{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n  | child         = yes\n  | official_name = Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut de Ronchamp\n  | part_of       = [[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]]\n  | criteria      = {{UNESCO WHS type|(i), (ii), (vi)}}(i), (ii), (vi)\n  | ID            = 1321-012\n  | year          = 2016\n  | area          = {{convert|2.734|ha|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n  | buffer_zone   = {{convert|239.661|ha|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n  }}\n  {{Infobox designation list |embed=yes\n  |designation1=Monument historique\n  |designation1_offname= Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut\n  |designation1_date=1967\n  |designation1_number=PA00102263<ref>{{cite web|title=Monument historique&nbsp;\u2014 PA00102263|work=[[M\u00e9rim\u00e9e database]] of [[Monument Historique|Monuments Historiques]]|publisher=[[French Ministry of Culture|Minist\u00e8re de la Culture]]|accessdate=12 March 2013|location=France|language=French|year=1993|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00102263}}</ref>\n  |designation1_free1name=Denomination\n  |designation1_free1value={{lang|fr|Chapelle}}\n  }}\n}}\n\n'''Notre-Dame du Haut''' ({{lang-en|Our Lady of the Heights}}; full name in {{lang-fr|Chapelle Notre-Dame du Haut}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[chapel]] in [[Ronchamp]], [[France]]. Built in 1955, it is one of the finest examples of the [[architecture]] of Franco-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]]. The chapel is a working religious building and is under the guardianship of the private foundation Association de l\u2019\u0152uvre de Notre-Dame du Haut.<ref name=\"vand\">Victoria Stapley-Brown (January 31, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Le-Corbusiers-Chapel-of-Notre-Dame-du-Haut-vandalised/31763 Le Corbusier\u2019s Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut vandalised] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref> It attracts 80,000 visitors each year.<ref name=\"vand\"></ref>\n\n==History==\nNotre-Dame du Haut is commonly thought of as a more extreme design of Le Corbusier\u2019s late style. Commissioned by the Association de l'\u0152uvre Notre-Dame du Haut, the chapel is a simple design with two entrances, a main altar, and three chapels beneath towers. Although the building is small, it is powerful and complex. The chapel is the latest of chapels at the site. The previous chapel was completely destroyed during [[World War II]]. The previous building was a 4th-century Christian chapel. At the time the new building was being constructed, Le Corbusier was not interested in ''Machine Age'' architecture; he felt that his style was more primitive and sculptural. He realized when he visited the site that he could not use mechanized means of construction, because access was too difficult.<ref>[[Germaine Greer]] (October 17, 2007), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/18/architecture3 A concrete version of dizzy rapture] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 2014, the chapel became the target of a break-in. A concrete collection box was thrown outside, and one of the stained-glass windows, also designed by Le Corbusier and the only one on the chapel to carry his signature, was broken.<ref name=\"vand\"></ref>\n\n==Site==\n[[File:Plan chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Plan du site et de ses \u00e9volutions<br>\n{|\n|{{legend|#0080FF|Le Corbusier (1955)}}\n|}\n{{blue|'''(1)'''}} : Notre-Dame-du-Haut chapel ;<br>\n{{blue|'''(2)'''}} : pyramid of peace ;<br>\n{{blue|'''(3)'''}} : pilgrim shelters ;<br>\n{{blue|'''(4)'''}} : chaplain's house ;<br>\n{|\n|{{legend|#008040|Jean Prouv\u00e9 (1975)}}\n|}\n{{green|'''(5)'''}} : campanile ;<br>\n{|\n|{{legend|#CC8B66|Renzo Piano (2011)}}\n|}\n{{red|'''(6)'''}} : Sainte-Claire chapel (oratory of the convent) ;<br>\n{{red|'''(7)'''}} : Sainte-Claire convent ;<br>\n{{red|'''(8)'''}} : gatehouse (reception, exhibition room)..\n]]\n[[File:Chapelle Notre-Dame-du Haut 04.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Remains of the 4th Century Chapel]]\n[[File:Colline de Bourl\u00e9mont 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Location of Notre Dame du Haut]]\n[[File:Ronchamp Notre dame du Haut 1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25]]\nThe site is high on a hill near Belfort in eastern France. There had been a pilgrimage chapel on the site dedicated to the Virgin Mary, but it was destroyed during the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bianchini|first1=Riccardo|title=The Notre Dame du Haut chapel by Le Corbusier \u2013 Ronchamp|url=https://www.inexhibit.com/mymuseum/notre-dame-du-haut-le-corbusier-ronchamp-chapel/|website=Inexhibit|publisher=Inexhibit|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref>  After the war, it was decided to rebuild on the same site, The new chapel was built for a reformist Church looking to continue its relevance. Warning against decadence, reformers within the Church at the time looked to renew its spirit by embracing [[modern art]] and architecture as representative concepts. Father [[Marie-Alain Couturier]], who would also sponsor [[Le Corbusier]] for the [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette|La Tourette]] commission, steered the unorthodox project to completion in 1954.\n\nThe chapel at Ronchamp is singular in Le Corbusier's oeuvre, in that it departs from his principles of standardisation and the machine aesthetic, giving in instead to a site-specific response. By Le Corbusier's own admission, it was the site that provided an irresistible ''[[genius loci]]'' for the response, with the horizon visible on all four sides of the hill and its historical legacy for centuries as a [[place of worship]].\n\nThis historical legacy was woven in different layers into the terrain&nbsp;\u2013 from the Romans and sun-worshippers before them, to a cult of the Virgin in the [[Middle Ages]], right through to the modern church and the fight against the German occupation.  Le Corbusier also sensed a sacred relationship of the hill with its surroundings&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Jura mountains]] in the distance and the hill itself, dominating the landscape.\n\nThe nature of the site would result in an architectural ensemble that has many similarities with the [[Acropolis]]  \u2013 starting from the ascent at the bottom of the hill to architectural and landscape events along the way, before finally terminating at the ''sanctus sanctorum'' itself \u2013 the chapel.  You cannot see the building until you reach nearly the crest of the hill.  From the top, magnificent vistas spread out in all directions.\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Structure===\nThe structure is made mostly of concrete and is comparatively small, enclosed by thick walls, with the upturned roof supported on columns embedded within the walls, like a sail billowing in the windy currents on the hill top. In the interior, the spaces left between the walls and roof are filled with [[clerestory]] windows, as well as the asymmetric light from the wall openings, serve to further reinforce the sacred nature of the space and reinforce the relationship of the building with its surroundings. The lighting in the interior is soft and indirect, from the clerestory windows and reflecting off the whitewashed walls of the chapels with projecting towers.\n\nThe structure is built mostly of [[concrete]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]], which was a remnant of the original chapel built on the hilltop site destroyed during [[World War II]]. Some have described Ronchamp as the first [[Postmodern architecture|Post-Modern]] building, and others as the first building of the movement [[Expressionist architecture]] after World War II. It was constructed in the early 1950s.\n\nThe main part of the structure consists of two concrete membranes separated by a space of 6'11\", forming a shell which constitutes the roof of the building. This roof, both insulating and watertight, is supported by short [[strut]]s, which form part of a vertical surface of concrete covered with \"[[gunite]]\" and which, in addition, brace the walls of old Vosges stone provided by the former chapel which was destroyed by the bombings. These walls which are without [[buttress]]es follow, in plan, the curvilinear forms calculated to provide stability to this rough [[masonry]]. A space of several centimeters between the shell of the roof and the vertical envelope of the walls furnishes a significant entry for [[daylight]]. The floor of the chapel follows the natural [[slope]] of the hill down towards the [[altar]]. Certain parts, in particular those upon which the interior and exterior altars rest, are of beautiful white stone from [[Bourgogne]], as are the altars themselves. The towers are constructed of stone masonry and are capped by cement [[dome]]s. The vertical  elements of the chapel are surfaced with [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] sprayed on with a cement gun and then white-washed&nbsp;\u2014 both on the interior and exterior. The concrete shell of the roof is left rough, just as it comes from the formwork. Watertightness is effected by a built-up roofing with an exterior [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] of [[aluminium]]. The interior walls are white; the ceiling grey; the bench of African wood created by Savina; the [[Eucharist|communion]] bench is of cast iron made by the foundries of the Lure.\n\n===The south wall===\nThe South wall of Ronchamp is a creature of its own. Rather than designing a straight, 50&nbsp;cm thick concrete piece, Le Corbusier spent months trying to perfect the outside wall. What he came up with is a wall that starts out as a point on the east end, and expands to up to 10 feet thick its west side. As it moves from east to west, it curves towards the south. To further expand his design's complexity, Le Corbusier decided to make the windows of the wall extraordinary. The openings slant towards their centers at varying degrees, thus letting in light at different angles{{what?|date=August 2014}}. The different-sized windows are scattered in an irregular pattern across the wall. Le Corbusier reportedly insisted that the shapes and patterns were not arbitrary, but derived from a proportional system based on the [[Golden Section]].<ref>Herbert Muschamp (November 14, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/14/arts/art-architecture-at-last-buildings-are-the-stuff-of-dreams.html At Last, Buildings Are the Stuff of Dreams] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Furthermore, the glass that closes the windows off is set at alternating depths. This glass is sometimes clear, but is often decorated with small pieces of stained glass in typical Corbusier colors: red, green, and yellow. These stained pieces radiate like rubies, emeralds, and amethysts, and act as the jewels of the already complex wall. After this extensive design, Le Corbusier decided not to make the southern partition a bearing wall. Instead, the building's roof is supported by concrete columns that make it appear to float above the rest of the space.\n\nIn a final move of symbolism, Le Corbusier filled the inside of the wall with the rubble from the previous chapel that stood at the location. Thus the old church, and all of its history, would remain in the site.\n\n===Furnishings===\nSmall pieces of stained glass are set deep within the walls, which are sometimes ten feet thick. The glass glows likes deep-set rubies and emeralds and amethysts and jewels of all colors.\n\nBecause it is a pilgrimage chapel, there are few people worshipping at most times. But on special feast days, large crowds of thousands will attend.  To accommodate them, Le Corbusier also built an outside altar and pulpit, so the large crowds can sit or stand on a vast field on the top of the hill. A famous statue of the [[Virgin Mary]], rescued from the ruins of the chapel destroyed during WWII, is encased in a special glass case in the wall, and it can be turned to face inward when the congregation is inside, or to face outward toward the visitors.\n\n===Roof===\nMuch like the church at [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]], the roof of Notre Dame du Haut appears to float above the walls. This is possible, because it is supported by concrete columns, not the walls themselves. The effect produced allows a strip of light to enter the building, thus lighting the space further, and making the church feel more open.\n\nThis billowing concrete roof was planned to slope toward the back, where a fountain of abstract forms is placed on the ground. When it rains, the water comes pouring off the roof and down onto the raised, slanted concrete structures, creating a dramatic natural fountain.\n\n==Addition==\nIn 2006, the convent for the Clarisses, or [[Poor Clares]], decided to construct a building next to the chapel. Le Corbusier himself had consulted with the Association de l\u2019\u0152uvre Notre-Dame du Haut about adding a monastery, but concrete plans were never developed. Following the initiative of the abbess, Sister Brigitte de Singly, the Poor Clares commissioned [[Renzo Piano]]; the association had considered several architects besides Piano, including [[Tadao Ando]], [[Glenn Murcutt]], and [[Jean Nouvel]]. The project met great opposition when plans were unveiled in 2008. Architects like [[Richard Meier]], [[Rafael Moneo]], and [[Cesar Pelli]] signed an online petition denouncing the project.<ref>Michael Kimmelman (April 17, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/arts/design/renzo-pianos-demure-additions-to-le-corbusiers-chapel.html Quietly Adding to a Modernist Masterpiece] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> The French Ministry of Culture, which is required to approve plans for changing  cultural landmarks, approved Piano's design.\n\nIn October 2011, Archbishop [[Luigi Ventura]], the papal envoy to France, came to bless the convent. Immersed in the vegetation of the Bourlemont hill, the monastery is composed of twelve 120 square-feet domestic units for the sisters with spaces for common living (a refectory and workshops), an oratory for religious pilgrims, and a lodge to host visitors. The new visitors' centre, also dug into the hill, forms the base of the convent, thus replacing a 1960s gatehouse that had obscured sight of the chapel from the town below and was removed in the process of construction.

The first person to call themselves a \"libertarian\" in the political sense was [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] in 1857. Shortly after, in 1858, he created the New York anarchist journal ''[[Le Libertaire]]''.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} <!--Graham here re motivations --> Anarchist [[S\u00e9bastien Faure]] used the term later in the century to differentiate between anarchists and authoritarian socialists.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} While the term \"libertarian\" has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{efn|name=synonymous}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} For example, \"libertarians\" include both the [[New Left]] Marxists (who do not associate with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party) and extreme liberals (primarily concerned with civil liberties). Additionally, some anarchists use \"libertarian socialist\" to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasize its connections with socialism.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}}\n\n<!-- association with chaos/violence -->Anarchism retains a historical association with chaos and violence.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} In the late 1800s, prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] noted the popular connotations of \"anarchy\" as a synonym for chaos and disorder, and thus a disadvantageous name for a movement. He accepted the term despite this, just as the Dutch [[Sea Beggars]] and [[sans-culottes]] had their own names conferred.{{sfn|Evren|2011|pp=1\u20132}} Anarchists throughout the 20th century have regretted the philosophy's association with chaos, explosives, wanton violence, and marauding.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} These connotations endure contemporaneously through the popular media's association of [[black bloc]] property destruction with the movement.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}}\n\n<!-- other associations -->The term \"anarchist\" is also used<!-- pejoratively?--> as an [[empty signifier]] reflecting the author's disdain or conscious abrasiveness.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=385}} The term's association with societal malady has been, in part, an intentional strategy by its detractors to discredit it.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385\u2013386}} \"Libertarian\" saw a similar diffusion of purpose within the American libertarian movement as a wider group less studied and less interested in minimal government adopted the term, diluting the potency of its association with the strict rights-based libertarianism of Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard.{{sfn|Doherty|2008|pp=584\u2013585}} Anarcho-capitalists and those who believe in abolition of the state have occupied the fringe of the libertarian movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=414}}\n\n<!-- Left and right? \n-->\n<!-- \"libertarian\" in the 20th century -->The revival of free-market ideologies during the mid-to-late 20th century came with disagreement over what to call the movement. While many of its adherents, especially in the United States, prefer \"libertarian\", many Conservative libertarians reject the term's association with the 1960s [[New Left]] and its connotations of [[libertine]] hedonism.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} The movement is divided over the use of \"Conservative\" as an alternative.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}} Those who seek both economic and social liberty would be known as classical \"liberals\", but that term developed associations opposite of the [[limited government]], low-taxation, minimal state advocated by the movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|pp=405\u2013406}} Name variants of the free-market revival movement include [[classical liberalism]], free market liberalism, economic liberalism, and neoliberalism.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} \"Libertarian\" has the most colloquial acceptance to describe a member of the movement, or \"economic libertarian\", based on both the ideology's primacy of economics and its distinction from libertarians of the New Left.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}}\n\n== Relation with socialism ==\n\nIn the 19th century, \"anarchism\" and \"socialism\" were used interchangeably, both treated as similar threats to sociopolitical order despite their differences in views towards the state.{{sfn|Kemp|2018|p=180}}<!-- can use more of a segue here... [on relationship with anarchism?] but belongs better in this section than with etymology -->\n\nThe biggest divide in the definition of anarchism is between the main individualist and socialist anarchist traditions.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} While anarchism sits between <!--European intellectual confluence of{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}}-->liberalism and socialism, the definitive extent of its affiliation with either is contested.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}} Historians ([[Rudolf Rocker|Rocker]] and [[George Woodcock|Woodcock]]) have described anarchism as the confluence of liberal individualism and socialist egalitarianism.

But anarchism is generally not simply a negative stance on authority but also a positive stance about how society should be structured.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=27}}\n\n===Anti-statist definition=== \nAnti-statist definitions place the focus of interest on the negation, and confrontation in the real word, of the state by anarchism. But as with the etymological definition, anarchism is much more than anti-statism, as it rejects all various forms of established authority. {{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=27-28}}\n\nThe association between anti-statism and anarchism is both commonly understood and contested.{{efn|name=\u24b6 not just anti-state}}\n\nAnarchism, according to historian [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], exists outside standards of [[political theory]] because its aims are not based on the struggle for power within the state. It is more concerned with moral and economic theory than participation in political systems and indeed often advocates against participation in such systems.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=639}}\n\nAnarchist libertarians and modern economic libertarians share opposition to the state as their only significant commonality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165n26\u2013166}} <!--Modern economic libertarians, as descendants of classical liberalism, are primarily concerned with the limits of the state and freeing individuals, markets, and society from it, while anarchists are primarily concerned with legitimacy, whether governmental or any other authority, as an issue of morality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165\u2013166}}-->\n\n===Anti-authoritarian definitions===\nAnti-authoritarian definitions depicts the rejection of all kind of authorities. Even though these kind of definitions are much broader than the anti-statist ones, there are still handicaps.

The first person to call themselves a \"libertarian\" in the political sense was [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] in 1857. Shortly after, in 1858, he created the New York anarchist journal ''[[Le Libertaire]]''.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} <!--Graham here re motivations --> Anarchist [[S\u00e9bastien Faure]] used the term later in the century to differentiate between anarchists and authoritarian socialists.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} While the term \"libertarian\" has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{efn|name=synonymous}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} For example, \"libertarians\" include both the [[New Left]] Marxists (who do not associate with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party) and extreme liberals (primarily concerned with civil liberties). Additionally, some anarchists use \"libertarian socialist\" to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasize its connections with socialism.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}}\n\n<!-- association with chaos/violence -->Anarchism retains a historical association with chaos and violence.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} In the late 1800s, prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] noted the popular connotations of \"anarchy\" as a synonym for chaos and disorder, and thus a disadvantageous name for a movement. He accepted the term despite this, just as the Dutch [[Sea Beggars]] and [[sans-culottes]] had their own names conferred.{{sfn|Evren|2011|pp=1\u20132}} Anarchists throughout the 20th century have regretted the philosophy's association with chaos, explosives, wanton violence, and marauding.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} These connotations endure contemporaneously through the popular media's association of [[black bloc]] property destruction with the movement.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}}\n\n<!-- other associations -->The term \"anarchist\" is also used<!-- pejoratively?--> as an [[empty signifier]] reflecting the author's disdain or conscious abrasiveness.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=385}} The term's association with societal malady has been, in part, an intentional strategy by its detractors to discredit it.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385\u2013386}} \"Libertarian\" saw a similar diffusion of purpose within the American libertarian movement as a wider group less studied and less interested in minimal government adopted the term, diluting the potency of its association with the strict rights-based libertarianism of Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard.{{sfn|Doherty|2008|pp=584\u2013585}} Anarcho-capitalists and those who believe in abolition of the state have occupied the fringe of the libertarian movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=414}}\n\n<!-- Left and right? \n-->\n<!-- \"libertarian\" in the 20th century -->The revival of free-market ideologies during the mid-to-late 20th century came with disagreement over what to call the movement. While many of its adherents, especially in the United States, prefer \"libertarian\", many Conservative libertarians reject the term's association with the 1960s [[New Left]] and its connotations of [[libertine]] hedonism.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} The movement is divided over the use of \"Conservative\" as an alternative.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}} Those who seek both economic and social liberty would be known as classical \"liberals\", but that term developed associations opposite of the [[limited government]], low-taxation, minimal state advocated by the movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|pp=405\u2013406}} Name variants of the free-market revival movement include [[classical liberalism]], free market liberalism, economic liberalism, and neoliberalism.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} \"Libertarian\" has the most colloquial acceptance to describe a member of the movement, or \"economic libertarian\", based on both the ideology's primacy of economics and its distinction from libertarians of the New Left.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}}\n\n== Relation with socialism ==\n\nIn the 19th century, \"anarchism\" and \"socialism\" were used interchangeably, both treated as similar threats to sociopolitical order despite their differences in views towards the state.{{sfn|Kemp|2018|p=180}}<!-- can use more of a segue here...

Other activists and theorists have variously argued that one tradition is \"genuine anarchism\" and the other tradition is oppression ([[Murray Bookchin|Bookchin]] vs. [[anarcho-capitalists]]) or a combination whereof ([[Bob Black|Black]]).{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}<!--could do an aside on Bookchin oversimplification here but I think it's overkill{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}--> These contemporary distinctions trace to the time of early modern anarchism when [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] either broke with groups or otherwise separated the traditions of communist anarchism from individualist, mutualist, and egoist anarchism.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}} Even the very idea of the individualist\u2013socialist divide is contested, as some types of individualist anarchism are largely socialistic.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} Despite these imprecise boundaries and some similarities, socialism and individualism within anarchism have a bifurcated tradition, the former associated with the history of socialism and the latter with [[classical liberalism]] and [[conservatism]] (also known as \"[[right-libertarianism]]\").

Generally, this includes classical anarchism, [[council communism]], [[Italian autonomists]], and the Marxism of [[Rosa Luxemburg|Luxemburg]], [[Paul Mattick|Mattick]], and [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], as each practices an anti-authoritarian socialism, despite whether individuals personally identify as fully \"anarchist\" or \"Marxist\".{{sfn|Amster|DeLeon|Fernandez|Nocera|2009|p=3}} Classical anarchism is distinguished from general Marxism by its opposition to centralized or authoritarian organizational structures{{sfn|Amster|DeLeon|Fernandez|Nocera|2009|p=9}} and \"the dominion of man over man\".{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}}<!-- Anti-statist, anti-[[vanguardist]] already share close commonalities but their differences are garden variety when compared against structures of totalitarianism{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|pp=226\u2013227}}--> Socialist-aligned forms of anarchism are also known as \"social anarchism\".{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}\n\n<!-- modern libertarianism and socialism? \n-->\n\n== Relation with property and capitalism ==\n<!-- alt: Relation with liberalism? -->\nModern American libertarians<!-- note this 1983 source describes modern American libertarians as \"a loosely knit group followers of Ayn Rand\"/Rothbard/Tibor Machan; i.e., anarcho-capitalists, if worth the qualification-->  are distinguished from the dominant libertarian tradition by their relation to property and capital. While both historical libertarianism and contemporary economic libertarianism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through [[free market capitalism|free market capital]]. Historically, libertarians including [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Max Stirner]] supported the protection of an individual's freedom from powers of government and private ownership.{{sfn|Francis|1983|p=462}} In contrast, <!--while modern American libertarians have condemned governmental encroachment on personal liberties,-->modern American libertarians support freedoms on the basis of their agreement with private property rights.{{sfn|Francis|1983|pp=462\u2013463}}<!--example of Murray Rothbard's arguments that protesters should \"rent\" a street for protest from its owners{{sfn|Francis|1983|pp=462\u2013463}}--> The abolishment of public amenities is a common theme in modern American libertarian writings.{{sfn|Francis|1983|p=463}}\n\n<!-- is an-cap \"anarchist\"? \n-->\n==Types of definition of anarchism==\n\nAnarchism scholar [[Paul McLaughlin(scholar)|Paul McLaughlin]] studies the various definitions of anarchism in his book ''Anarchism and Authority''. According to him, there are 3 common types of anarchism definition:\n*etymological definitions \n*anti-statist definitions\n*anti-authoritarian definitions\n\nBut all fall short from providing a precise definition of anarchism.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=27}}\n\n===Etymological definition===\n\"Anarchy\" derives from the Greek ''anarkhos'', meaning \"without authority\" (as opposed to \"without government/state\").{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} Hence the etymological definition of anarchism as the negation of an authority. But anarchism is generally not simply a negative stance on authority but also a positive stance about how society should be structured.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=27}}\n\n===Anti-statist definition=== \nAnti-statist definitions place the focus of interest on the negation, and confrontation in the real word, of the state by anarchism. But as with the etymological definition, anarchism is much more than anti-statism, as it rejects all various forms of established authority. {{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=27-28}}\n\nThe association between anti-statism and anarchism is both commonly understood and contested.{{efn|name=\u24b6 not just anti-state}}\n\nAnarchism, according to historian [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], exists outside standards of [[political theory]] because its aims are not based on the struggle for power within the state. It is more concerned with moral and economic theory than participation in political systems and indeed often advocates against participation in such systems.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=639}}\n\nAnarchist libertarians and modern economic libertarians share opposition to the state as their only significant commonality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165n26\u2013166}} <!--Modern economic libertarians, as descendants of classical liberalism, are primarily concerned with the limits of the state and freeing individuals, markets, and society from it, while anarchists are primarily concerned with legitimacy, whether governmental or any other authority, as an issue of morality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165\u2013166}}-->\n\n===Anti-authoritarian definitions===\nAnti-authoritarian definitions depicts the rejection of all kind of authorities. Even though these kind of definitions are much broader than the anti-statist ones, there are still handicaps. McLaughlin, who examines under a philosophical scope, claims that anti-authoritarianism is a conclusion of anarchist thought, not an ''a priori'' statement, therefore it can not be used as a definition.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=28}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Definition of fascism]]\n* [[Definition of terrorism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist|40em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"\u24b6 is libsoc\">\n* {{harvnb|Levy|Adams|2018|p=104}}: \"As such, many people use the term 'anarchism' to describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement.\"\n* {{harvnb|Marshall|1992|p=641}}: \"In general, anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ...
