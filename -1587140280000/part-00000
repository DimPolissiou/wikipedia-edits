This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour.\n\n==Origin==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour.\n\n==Origin==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.
