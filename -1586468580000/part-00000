Queller described \"betrayal\" as Lena's [[Achilles' heel|Achilles heel]] due to every member of the Luthor family having betrayed her in some way over the years: \"She has to put on this protective shell, and the last person she thought would betray her was Kara, and that really hurts more deeply than any of the others\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/06/supergirl-season-5-premiere-release-date-introduces-dark-new-threats-ign-first |title=Supergirl: Season 5 Introduces Dark New Threats&nbsp;\u2013 IGN First |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=September 6, 2019 |website=[[IGN]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190907052907/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/06/supergirl-season-5-premiere-release-date-introduces-dark-new-threats-ign-first |archive-date=September 7, 2019 |access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> The season also features the series' [[100 episodes|100th episode]]; teasing this episode, Queller said, \"Characters may reappear\" while Rovner noted, \"We want to treat the fans to an episode that serves the show's past.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvinsider.com/794777/supergirl-season-5-burning-questions-answered/ |title=What's Next for Kara in Season 5?

This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player's point of view, to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have.  The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage.

Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players to set up real-time connections across the world. Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting [[Cheating in online games|cheating]] compared to physical events, and greater [[Latency (engineering)|network latency]], which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and [[exhibition game]]s.\n\nSince the 1990s, professional teams or organized [[clan (computer gaming)|clans]] have set up matches via [[Internet Relay Chat]] networks such as [[QuakeNet]]. As esports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard's]] [[Battle.net]], which has been integrated into both the ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]'' and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]'' series. Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as [[Xbox Live]] and the [[PlayStation Network]]. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a [[game server]], either remotely to each of the competitors, or running on one of the competitor's machines.\n\n===Local area network===\n{{further|LAN Party}}\nAdditionally, competitions are also often conducted over a [[local area network]] or LAN. The smaller network usually has very little [[lag]] and higher [[Quality of service|quality]]. Because competitors must be physically present, LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors. This helps prevent many forms of cheating, such as unauthorized hardware or software [[modding]]. The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events. Many gamers organize [[LAN parties]] or visit [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s, and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs.\n\nIndividual games have taken various approaches to LAN support. In contrast to the original ''[[StarCraft]]'',  ''[[StarCraft II]]'' was released without support for LAN play, drawing some strongly negative reactions from players.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why StarCraft II Still Doesn't Support Local Multiplayer |url=http://kotaku.com/5919892/why-starcraft-ii-still-doesnt-support-local-multiplayer |publisher=Kotaku |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |author=Jason Schreier}}</ref> ''League of Legends'' was originally released for online play only, but announced in October 2012 that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments.<ref>{{cite web |title=League of Legends LAN version in development at Riot Games, Mac client news coming |url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/17/3515164/league-of-legends-lan-version-in-development-at-riot-games-mac-client |date=12 October 2012 |author=Michael McWhertor |website=Polygon |accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref> In September 2013, Valve added general support for LAN play to ''[[Dota 2]]'' in a patch for the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techinasia.com/dota-2-update-lan-feature-worth-excited/ |title=DOTA 2 update: Why the LAN feature is something worth being excited about |author=Xairylle |publisher=TechInAsia |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Players and teams==\nProfessional gamers, or \"pro gamers\", are often associated with gaming teams and/or broader gaming associations. Teams like [[FaZe Clan]], [[OpTic Gaming]], [[Evil Geniuses]], [[Team SoloMid]], [[Cloud9 (eSports)|Cloud9]], [[Fnatic]], [[Mineski-Dota|Mineski]], [[Counter Logic Gaming]], [[SK Telecom T1]], [[Splyce]], [[Team EnVyUs]], and [[Natus Vincere]] consist of several professionals. These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games within [[Evolution Championship Series]], or ''Hearthstone'' tournaments. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware. Prominent esports sponsors include companies such as [[Logitech]] and [[Razer USA|Razer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esfiworld.com/interview-with-razers-global-e-sports-manager-the-business-behind-sponsoring-teams/ |title=Interview with Razer's global e-sports manager: The business behind sponsoring teams |author=Brent Ruiz |date=3 February 2013 |publisher=ESFI World |accessdate=10 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822230651/http://www.esfiworld.com/interview-with-razers-global-e-sports-manager-the-business-behind-sponsoring-teams/ |archivedate=22 August 2013 }}</ref> Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.customesports.com |title=Custom Esports Jerseys and Apparel |date=|access-date= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}</ref> and on their social media, in 2016 the biggest teams have social media followings of over a million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=OpTic Gaming\u2122 (@OpTicGaming) {{!}} Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/OpTicGaming|website=twitter.com|access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref> Associations include the [[Korean e-Sports Association]] (KeSPA), the [[International e-Sports Federation]] (IeSF), the [[British eSports Association|British esports Association]], and the [[World eSports Association|World esports Association]] (WESA).\n\nSome traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, such as [[Rick Fox]]'s ownership of [[Echo Fox]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-18/former-nba-player-rick-fox-buys-esports-team-gravity |title=Former NBA Player Rick Fox Buys eSports Team Gravity |first=Scott |last=Soshnick |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref> [[Jeremy Lin]]'s ownership of [[Team VGJ]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van Allen|first1=Eric|title=Jeremy Lin endorses new Dota 2 team VGJ|url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17579673/jeremy-lin-endorse-new-dota-2-team-vgj|website=ESPN|accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref> [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s investment in [[NRG Esports]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17209251/shaq-nrg-esports-pick-overwatch-team |title=Shaq, NRG Esports pick up Overwatch team |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> Some association football teams, such as [[FC Schalke 04]] in Germany,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/esports/story/_/id/15552685/soccer-org-schalke-04-finalizes-league-championship-series-roster-picks-fox |title=Sources: Soccer org Schalke 04 finalizes League Championship Series roster, picks up Fox |work=espn.com}}</ref> [[Paris Saint-Germain eSports|Paris Saint-Germain esports]] in France;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/paris-saint-germain/story/2977336/psg-unveil-first-three-signings-in-ambitious-esports-venture |title=PSG unveil first three signings in ambitious eSports venture |first=Jonathan |last=Johnson |date=20 October 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> [[Besiktas JK]], [[Fenerbahce S.K.]], and [[Galatasaray]] in Turkey; [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] in Greece either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Espor nedir?

Athletes from traditional sports' training is almost entirely based on honing their physical prowess in performing that sport, such as muscle memory, exercising, and dieting.

Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season. Those that do well, in addition to prize money, may be promoted into a higher-level league, while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward. For example, until 2018 Riot Games runs several ''League of Legends'' series, with the [[League of Legends Championship Series]] being the top-tier series. Teams that did not do well were relegated to the [[League of Legends Challenger Series]], replaced by the better performing teams from that series. This format was discontinued when Riot opted to use the franchise format in mid-2018.\n\n=== Franchised leagues ===\n[[File:Fuel_vs_Excelsior_2019_Stage_3.jpg|thumb|right|A match from the second season of the Overwatch League, occurring at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles]]\nWith rising interest in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the franchise approach used in [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of North American leagues (Franchise and minor league system)|North American professional sports]], in which all teams, backed by a major financial sponsor to support the franchise, participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post-season games.

Universities across the world (mostly China and America) began offering scholarship opportunities to incoming freshmen to join their collegiate Esports teams. According to Schaeperkoetter (2017) and others, the potential impact that an eSports program could have on a university, coupled with the growing interest that universities are showing in such a program, combine to make this line of research relevant in sport literature.<ref>Schaeperkoetter, C.

These governing bodies may have various levels of involvement with the esport, from being part of esports regulation to simply acting more as a [[trade group]] and public face for esports.\n\nThe [[International Esports Federation]] (IESF) was one of the first such bodies. Originally formed in 2008 to help promote esports in the southeast Asian region, it has grown to include 56 member countries from across the global. The IESF has managed annual Esport World Championships for teams from its member countries across multiple games.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1076046/seoul-to-host-2019-esports-world-championships | title = Seoul to host 2019 Esports World Championships | first = Mike | last = Rowbottom | date = February 28, 2019 | accessdate = December 20, 2019 | work = [[Inside the Games]] }}</ref>\n\nThe European Esports Federation was formed in April 2019 and includes UK, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Russia, Slovenia, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine.

Yet, one of the biggest issues with the esports [[gambling industry]] has been its target audience. Thus, as an important part of the esports audience is underage most governments have been a bit skeptical regarding this market\u2019s moral view.

On the other hand, due to the nature of esports, there are plenty of innovative ways to bet, which are based on in-game milestones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/03/betting-is-esports-biggest-and-most-underappreciated-opportunity/|title=Betting is esports\u2019 biggest and most underappreciated opportunity|date=2019-06-03|website=VentureBeat|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> For example, [[League of Legends|League of Legend]] bettors may place their money on which team/champion will take the \u201cFirst Blood\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lolbettingsites.com/lol-esports-bets/|title=LoL esports bets explained \u27a0 Best esports advice|website=LoLBettingSites.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> On the other hand, [[First-person shooter|First-person shooters]] like [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]] is also open to \u201cFirst Map\u201d bets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skrilla.com/en-eu/guides/csgo-esports-betting-skrillas-guide/|title=CS:GO Betting And Prediction Guide|website=skrilla.com|language=en-eu|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> Besides, some bookers allow \u201codds & even\u201d bets which allow players to take chances on whether the final count of a game, mostly in kills, will be an odd or even number. Furthermore, there are different types of betting in esports based on the means of the bet.

In the 2000s, [[real-time strategy]] games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean [[internet caf\u00e9]]s, with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though the most popular games as of the late 2010s are ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'', ''[[Rocket League]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros.

This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player's point of view, to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have.  The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage.

Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players to set up real-time connections across the world. Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting [[Cheating in online games|cheating]] compared to physical events, and greater [[Latency (engineering)|network latency]], which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and [[exhibition game]]s.\n\nSince the 1990s, professional teams or organized [[clan (computer gaming)|clans]] have set up matches via [[Internet Relay Chat]] networks such as [[QuakeNet]]. As esports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard's]] [[Battle.net]], which has been integrated into both the ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]'' and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]'' series. Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as [[Xbox Live]] and the [[PlayStation Network]]. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a [[game server]], either remotely to each of the competitors, or running on one of the competitor's machines.\n\n===Local area network===\n{{further|LAN Party}}\nAdditionally, competitions are also often conducted over a [[local area network]] or LAN. The smaller network usually has very little [[lag]] and higher [[Quality of service|quality]]. Because competitors must be physically present, LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors. This helps prevent many forms of cheating, such as unauthorized hardware or software [[modding]]. The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events. Many gamers organize [[LAN parties]] or visit [[Internet caf\u00e9]]s, and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs.\n\nIndividual games have taken various approaches to LAN support. In contrast to the original ''[[StarCraft]]'',  ''[[StarCraft II]]'' was released without support for LAN play, drawing some strongly negative reactions from players.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why StarCraft II Still Doesn't Support Local Multiplayer |url=http://kotaku.com/5919892/why-starcraft-ii-still-doesnt-support-local-multiplayer |publisher=Kotaku |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |author=Jason Schreier}}</ref> ''League of Legends'' was originally released for online play only, but announced in October 2012 that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments.<ref>{{cite web |title=League of Legends LAN version in development at Riot Games, Mac client news coming |url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/17/3515164/league-of-legends-lan-version-in-development-at-riot-games-mac-client |date=12 October 2012 |author=Michael McWhertor |website=Polygon |accessdate=7 September 2013}}</ref> In September 2013, Valve added general support for LAN play to ''[[Dota 2]]'' in a patch for the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techinasia.com/dota-2-update-lan-feature-worth-excited/ |title=DOTA 2 update: Why the LAN feature is something worth being excited about |author=Xairylle |publisher=TechInAsia |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Players and teams==\nProfessional gamers, or \"pro gamers\", are often associated with gaming teams and/or broader gaming associations.

These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games within [[Evolution Championship Series]], or ''Hearthstone'' tournaments. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware.

Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season. Those that do well, in addition to prize money, may be promoted into a higher-level league, while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward. For example, until 2018 Riot Games runs several ''League of Legends'' series, with the [[League of Legends Championship Series]] being the top-tier series. Teams that did not do well were relegated to the [[League of Legends Challenger Series]], replaced by the better performing teams from that series.

The illegality of esport gambling has created a [[black market]] and virtual currency. And since it is not regulated, this may encourage match-fixing by players themselves, and lead to issues with underage gambling due to the draw of video games. A bright example can be represented by [[skin gambling]], where virtual items earned in games are used as a currency, and it let users bet on the outcome of matches.<ref name=\"wapost betting\"/>\n\nEsports gambling in the United States has been illegal under the federal [[Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992]] (PASPA) until May 2018. The Act prevented all but five states from allowing gambling on sporting events.<ref name=\"wapost betting\"/> However, regulation of esports betting still depended on state law. Some betting houses in Nevada, where sports betting has been already exempted under PASPA, classify esports as non-competitive \"other events\" similar to the selection of the [[Heisman Trophy]] winner or [[NFL Draft]] which are considered as legal.<ref name=\"wapost betting\">{{cite web | title = Esports bookmaking?

On the other hand, due to the nature of esports, there are plenty of innovative ways to bet, which are based on in-game milestones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/03/betting-is-esports-biggest-and-most-underappreciated-opportunity/|title=Betting is esports\u2019 biggest and most underappreciated opportunity|date=2019-06-03|website=VentureBeat|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> For example, [[League of Legends|League of Legend]] bettors may place their money on which team/champion will take the \u201cFirst Blood\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lolbettingsites.com/lol-esports-bets/|title=LoL esports bets explained \u27a0 Best esports advice|website=LoLBettingSites.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> On the other hand, [[First-person shooter|First-person shooters]] like [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]] is also open to \u201cFirst Map\u201d bets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skrilla.com/en-eu/guides/csgo-esports-betting-skrillas-guide/|title=CS:GO Betting And Prediction Guide|website=skrilla.com|language=en-eu|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> Besides, some bookers allow \u201codds & even\u201d bets which allow players to take chances on whether the final count of a game, mostly in kills, will be an odd or even number. Furthermore, there are different types of betting in esports based on the means of the bet.
