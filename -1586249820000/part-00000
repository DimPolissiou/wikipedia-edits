The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on \"family-oriented entertainment\", and features no [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R-rated]], [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|NC-17-rated]] or [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA-rated]] programming.\n\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation, and the service has 28.6 million subscribers {{as of|2020|02|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn late 2015, Disney launched a predecessor of Disney+ called DisneyLife only in Britain, as a test for the streaming market.\n\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |last=Miller |first=Daniel |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on \"family-oriented entertainment\", and features no [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R-rated]], [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|NC-17-rated]] or [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA-rated]] programming.\n\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. The service was expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. It became available in India in April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Further expansions are planned for Europe and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation, and the service has 28.6 million subscribers {{as of|2020|02|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |last=Miller |first=Daniel |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.

Gangster Kabir Bhai decides to eliminate Karan instead. In comes Vijju, a hitman who returns to Mumbai after a long exile in Paris, France in order to perform one last job. While the gangsters and Vijju try to take down Karan, Karan is trying to woo his old college friend Tanya, and Tanya's friend Amrita is trying to figure out the relationship between Vijju and her mother. Vijju later reveals that he is not the contract killer and is rather trying to protect his son, ACP Karan. The story rolls on, showing Vijju climbing the ladder of underworld to reach Kabir and plot with him the murder of Karan. One of Kabir Bhai's associates, {{Proper name|Yera}}, goes against his decision of roping in Vijju and attempts to shoot Karan. He misses narrowly and returns to base, facing mockery from Vijju. Meanwhile, Vijju meets his estranged wife Sita and tries to patch the relationship. {{Proper name|Yera}} attempts once again and is successful to pump some bullets into Karan, failing Vijju's attempts to stop him from going to the place of shootout. A hurt and angry Vijju then admits Karan to a hospital and visits Kabir's den.

The term Partitions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth is effectively not used in literature on this subject.}} were  three [[partition (politics)|partitions]] of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] that took place toward the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of sovereign [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Russian Empire]], which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures and annexations.<ref name=\"Brit\" /><ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Judy |last1=Batt |first2=Kataryna |last2=Wolczuk |title=Region, State and Identity in Central and Eastern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=153}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Sinkoff |title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2004 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nThe [[First Partition of Poland]] was decided on August 5, 1772. Two decades later, Russian and Prussian troops entered the Commonwealth again and the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]] was signed on January 23, 1793. Austria did not participate in the Second Partition. The [[Third Partition of Poland]] took place on October 24, 1795, in reaction to the unsuccessful Polish [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the previous year. With this partition, the Commonwealth ceased to exist.<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n\nIn English, the term \"Partitions of Poland\" is sometimes used geographically as [[toponymy]], to mean the three parts that the partitioning powers divided the Commonwealth into, namely:  the [[Austrian Partition]], the [[Prussian Partition]] and the [[Russian Partition]]. In Polish, there are two separate words for the two meanings. The consecutive acts of dividing and [[annexation]] of Poland are referred to as ''{{lang|pl|rozbi\u00f3r}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|pl|rozbiory}}''), while the term ''{{lang|pl|zab\u00f3r}}'' (pl. ''{{lang|pl|zabory}}'') means each part of the Commonwealth annexed in 1772\u201395 becoming part of Imperial Russia, Prussia, or Austria. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the borders of the three partitioned sectors were redrawn; the Austrians established [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] in the Austrian partition, whereas the Russians gained [[Warsaw]] from Prussia and formed an autonomous [[polity]] of [[Congress Poland]] in the Russian partition.\n\nIn Polish historiography, the term [[#Fourth Partition|\"Fourth Partition of Poland\"]] has also been used, in reference to any subsequent annexation of Polish lands by foreign invaders. Depending on source and historical period, this could mean the events of [[Congress of Vienna|1815]], or [[Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland|1832]] and [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|1846]], or [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939]]. The term \"Fourth Partition\" in a temporal sense can also mean the diaspora communities that played an important political role in re-establishing the Polish sovereign state after 1918.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Allegory of the 1st partition of Poland crop.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the [[First Partition of Poland|1st partition]] of [[Poland]], showing [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia (left), [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] and [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia (right) quarrelling over their territorial seizures]]\n[[File:Alegoria Umarlej Polski.jpg|thumb|[[W\u0142odzimierz Tetmajer]], ''Allegory of Dead Poland'', St. Nicholas Cathedral, [[Kalisz]]]]\n\nDuring the reign of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] (1632\u201348), the ''{{lang|la|[[liberum veto]]}}'' was developed, a policy of parliamentary procedure based on the assumption of the political equality of every \"gentleman/[[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]]\", with the corollary that unanimous consent was needed for all measures.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> A single member of parliament's belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency (usually simply his own estate), even after the act had been approved, became enough to strike the act. Thus it became increasingly difficult to undertake action. The ''{{lang|la|liberum veto}}'' also provided openings for foreign diplomats to get their ways, through bribing nobles to exercise it.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Thus, one could characterise Poland\u2013Lithuania in its final period (mid-18th century) before the partitions as already in a state of disorder and not a completely sovereign state, and almost as a [[vassal state]],<ref name=\"Scott\" /> with Russian [[tsar]]s effectively choosing Polish kings. This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]].\n\nIn 1730 the neighbors of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (''{{lang|pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]]}}''), namely Prussia, Austria and Russia, signed a secret agreement to maintain the ''{{lang|la|status quo}}'': specifically, to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change. Their alliance later became known in Poland as the \"[[Treaty of the Three Black Eagles|Alliance of the Three Black Eagles]]\" (or ''{{lang|de|L\u00f6wenwolde}}'s Treaty''), because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol (in contrast to the [[coat of arms of Poland|white eagle]], a symbol of Poland). The Commonwealth had been forced to rely on Russia for protection against the rising [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which demanded a slice of the northwest in order to unite its Western and Eastern portions; this would leave the Commonwealth with a [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast only in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Catherine had to use diplomacy to win Austria to her side.\n\nThe Commonwealth had remained neutral in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), yet it sympathized with the alliance of France, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], and Russia, and allowed Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against Prussia. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy. Through the [[szlachta|Polish nobles]] whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw, ambassador and Prince [[Nicholas Repnin]], Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so-called [[Repnin Sejm]] of 1767, named after ambassador Repnin, who effectively dictated the terms of that Sejm (and ordered the capture and exile to [[Kaluga]] of some vocal opponents of his policies,<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite book |first=Hamish M. |last=Scott |title=The Emergence of the Eastern Powers, 1756\u20131775 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-79269-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN052179269X&pg=PA182&dq=Repnin+Poland |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref name=\"Steed,\">H.

This new constitution undid the reforms made in 1764 under [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw II]].

Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the resulting reaction among some of Poland's Roman Catholics, as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the [[Bar Confederation|Confederation of Bar]] of 1768\u20131772, formed in [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]], where the Poles tried to expel Russian forces from Commonwealth territory.<ref name=\"Scott\" /><ref name=\"Seton-Watson\" /> The irregular and poorly commanded Polish forces had little chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a major defeat. Adding to the chaos was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Cossacks|Cossack]] and peasant rebellion, the [[Koliyivshchyna]], which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of [[szlachta|noblemen]] (''{{lang|pl|szlachta}}''), Jews, [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniates]], and Catholic priests, before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.\n\nIn 1769 Austria annexed a small territory of [[Spi\u0161|Spisz]] and in 1770 it annexed [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Nowy Targ]]. These territories had been a bone of contention between Poland and [[Hungary]], which was a part of the Austrian crown lands.\n\n=== First Partition ===\n{{Main|First Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1773-1789.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth after the First Partition, as a protectorate of the Russian Empire (1773\u201389)]]\n\nIn February 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in [[Vienna]]. Early in August, Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously invaded the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, 1772, the occupation manifesto was issued, much to the consternation of a country too exhausted by the endeavors of the [[Confederation of Bar]] to offer successful resistance;<ref name=\"Brit\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466910/Partitions-of-Poland |title=Partitions of Poland |year=2008 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> nevertheless, several battles and sieges took place, as Commonwealth troops refused to lay down their arms (most notably, in [[Tyniec]], [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]]).\n\nThe partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] was elated with his success; Prussia took most of German-speaking [[Royal Prussia]] (without [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]]) that stood between its possessions in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], as well as Ermland ([[Warmia]]), northern areas of [[Greater Poland]] along the [[Note\u0107]] River (the [[Netze District]]), and parts of [[Kujawy|Kuyavia]] (but not the city of [[Toru\u0144]]).<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Despite token criticism of the partition from Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]], Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg]], was proud of wresting as large a share as he did, with the rich [[salt mining|salt mines]] of [[Bochnia]] and [[Wieliczka]]. To Austria fell [[Zator]] and Auschwitz ([[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]), part of [[Lesser Poland]] embracing parts of the counties of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Sandomierz|Sandomir]] and the whole of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], less the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine of Russia]] was also very satisfied. By this \"diplomatic document\" Russia came into possession of that section of [[Livonia]] that had remained in Commonwealth control, and of [[Belarus]] embracing the counties of [[Vitebsk]], [[Polotsk]] and [[Mstsislaw|Mstislavl]].<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n[[File:Rejtan Upadek Polski Matejko.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Rejtan (painting)|Rejtan at Sejm 1773]]'', oil on canvas by Jan Matejko, 1866, {{convert|282|x|487|cm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]\n\nBy this partition, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 30% of its territory and half of its population<ref name=\"Brit\" /> (four million people), of which a large portion had not been ethnically Polish. By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly gained control over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous customs duties, Prussia accelerated the collapse of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nAfter having occupied their respective territories, the three partitioning powers demanded that King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw]] and the [[Sejm]] approve their action. When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. The so-called [[Partition Sejm]], with Russian military forces threatening the opposition, on September 18, 1773, signed the treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories.\n\n=== Second Partition ===\n{{Main|Second Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 2.png|thumb|300px|right|The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Second Partition (1793)]]\n\nBy 1790 the First Polish Republic had been weakened to such a degree that it was forced into an unnatural and terminal alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The [[Polish\u2013Prussian alliance|Polish\u2013Prussian Pact]] of 1790 was signed. The conditions of the Pact contributed to the subsequent final two partitions of Poland\u2013Lithuania.\n\nThe [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May Constitution of 1791]] enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of the [[Repnin Sejm]]. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] then at high tide in France, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.\n\nIn the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|War in Defense of the Constitution]], pro-Russian conservative Polish [[magnate]]s, the [[Targowica Confederation|Confederation of Targowica]], fought against Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians would help them restore the [[Golden Liberty]]. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the [[Grodno Sejm]], last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the Second Partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough land so that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province [[South Prussia]], with [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] (and later Warsaw) as the capital of the new province.\n\nTargowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support, and in 1794 the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] began.\n\n=== Third Partition ===\n{{Main|Third Partition of Poland}}\nKosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire. The partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty, dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth between their three countries.\n\nThe Russian part included {{convert|120000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1.2&nbsp;million people with [[Vilnius]], the Prussian part (new provinces of [[New East Prussia]] and [[New Silesia]]) {{convert|55000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1&nbsp;million people with Warsaw, and the Austrian {{convert|47000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} with 1.2&nbsp;million and [[Lublin]] and Krak\u00f3w.\n\n== Summary ==\nWith regard to population, in the First Partition, Poland lost over four to five million citizens (about a third of its population of 14&nbsp;million before the partitions).<ref name=\"LukowskiZawadzki2001-96\">{{cite book |author1=Jerzy Lukowski |author2=W.

After his defeat and the implementation of the [[Congress of Vienna]] treaty in 1815, the Russian-dominated [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] was created in its place. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with [[Warsaw]]) and, after crushing [[November Uprising|an insurrection in 1831]], the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. After the [[January Uprising|uprising of 1863]], [[Russification]] of Polish secondary schools was imposed and the literacy rate dropped dramatically. In the Austrian sector which now was called [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Poles fared better and were allowed to have representation in Parliament and to form their own universities, and Krak\u00f3w with [[Lw\u00f3w|Lemberg]] (Lw\u00f3w/Lviv) became centers of Polish culture and education. Meanwhile, Prussia [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanized]] the entire school system of its Polish subjects, and had no more respect for Polish culture and institutions than the Russian Empire. In 1915 a [[client state]] of the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] was proposed and accepted by the [[Central Powers]] of World War I: the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]]. After the end of World War I, the Central Powers' surrender to the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]], the chaos of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] finally allowed and helped the restoration of Poland's full independence after 123 years.\n\n== Fourth Partition ==\n[[File:Occupation of Poland 1939.png|right|thumb|250px|The partition of Poland according to [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|the German\u2013Soviet Pact]]; division of Polish territories in the years 1939\u20131941]]\nThe term \"Fourth Partition of Poland\" may refer to any subsequent division of Polish lands, including:\n* after the [[Napoleonic era]], the 1815 division of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]];\n* the 1832 incorporation of the \"[[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom]]\" into Russia, the 1846 incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow|Republic of Krak\u00f3w]] into Austria, and the 1848 incorporation of the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] into Prussia; and\n* the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|1939 division of Poland]] between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] pursuant to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref name=\"Brecher\">{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Brecher |first2=Jonathan |last2=Wilkenfeld |title=A Study of Crisis |year=1997 |pages=255 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-10806-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&pg=PA255&dq=Zeligowski+state }}</ref>\nIf one accepts more than one of those events as partitions, fifth, sixth, and even seventh partitions can be counted, but these terms are very rare.

The partitions were conducted by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Russian Empire]], which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures and annexations.<ref name=\"Brit\" /><ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Judy |last1=Batt |first2=Kataryna |last2=Wolczuk |title=Region, State and Identity in Central and Eastern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=153}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Sinkoff |title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2004 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nThe [[First Partition of Poland]] was decided on August 5, 1772. Two decades later, Russian and Prussian troops entered the Commonwealth again and the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]] was signed on January 23, 1793. Austria did not participate in the Second Partition. The [[Third Partition of Poland]] took place on October 24, 1795, in reaction to the unsuccessful Polish [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the previous year. With this partition, the Commonwealth ceased to exist.<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n\nIn English, the term \"Partitions of Poland\" is sometimes used geographically as [[toponymy]], to mean the three parts that the partitioning powers divided the Commonwealth into, namely:  the [[Austrian Partition]], the [[Prussian Partition]] and the [[Russian Partition]]. In Polish, there are two separate words for the two meanings. The consecutive acts of dividing and [[annexation]] of Poland are referred to as ''{{lang|pl|rozbi\u00f3r}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|pl|rozbiory}}''), while the term ''{{lang|pl|zab\u00f3r}}'' (pl. ''{{lang|pl|zabory}}'') means each part of the Commonwealth annexed in 1772\u201395 becoming part of Imperial Russia, Prussia, or Austria. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the borders of the three partitioned sectors were redrawn; the Austrians established [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] in the Austrian partition, whereas the Russians gained [[Warsaw]] from Prussia and formed an autonomous [[polity]] of [[Congress Poland]] in the Russian partition.\n\nIn Polish historiography, the term [[#Fourth Partition|\"Fourth Partition of Poland\"]] has also been used, in reference to any subsequent annexation of Polish lands by foreign invaders. Depending on source and historical period, this could mean the events of [[Congress of Vienna|1815]], or [[Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland|1832]] and [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|1846]], or [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939]]. The term \"Fourth Partition\" in a temporal sense can also mean the diaspora communities that played an important political role in re-establishing the Polish sovereign state after 1918.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Allegory of the 1st partition of Poland crop.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the [[First Partition of Poland|1st partition]] of [[Poland]], showing [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia (left), [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] and [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia (right) quarrelling over their territorial seizures]]\n[[File:Alegoria Umarlej Polski.jpg|thumb|[[W\u0142odzimierz Tetmajer]], ''Allegory of Dead Poland'', St. Nicholas Cathedral, [[Kalisz]]]]\n\nDuring the reign of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] (1632\u201348), the ''{{lang|la|[[liberum veto]]}}'' was developed, a policy of parliamentary procedure based on the assumption of the political equality of every \"gentleman/[[Szlachta|Polish nobleman\", with the corollary that unanimous consent was needed for all measures.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> A single member of parliament's belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency (usually simply his own estate), even after the act had been approved, became enough to strike the act. Thus it became increasingly difficult to undertake action. The ''{{lang|la|liberum veto}}'' also provided openings for foreign diplomats to get their ways, through bribing nobles to exercise it.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Thus, one could characterise Poland\u2013Lithuania in its final period (mid-18th century) before the partitions as already in a state of disorder and not a completely sovereign state, and almost as a [[vassal state]],<ref name=\"Scott\" /> with Russian [[tsar]]s effectively choosing Polish kings. This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]].\n\nIn 1730 the neighbors of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (''{{lang|pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]]}}''), namely Prussia, Austria and Russia, signed a secret agreement to maintain the ''{{lang|la|status quo}}'': specifically, to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change. Their alliance later became known in Poland as the \"[[Treaty of the Three Black Eagles|Alliance of the Three Black Eagles]]\" (or ''{{lang|de|L\u00f6wenwolde}}'s Treaty''), because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol (in contrast to the [[coat of arms of Poland|white eagle]], a symbol of Poland). The Commonwealth had been forced to rely on Russia for protection against the rising [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which demanded a slice of the northwest in order to unite its Western and Eastern portions; this would leave the Commonwealth with a [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast only in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Catherine had to use diplomacy to win Austria to her side.\n\nThe Commonwealth had remained neutral in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), yet it sympathized with the alliance of France, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], and Russia, and allowed Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against Prussia. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy. Through the [[szlachta|Polish nobles]] whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw, ambassador and Prince [[Nicholas Repnin]], Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so-called [[Repnin Sejm]] of 1767, named after ambassador Repnin, who effectively dictated the terms of that Sejm (and ordered the capture and exile to [[Kaluga]] of some vocal opponents of his policies,<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite book |first=Hamish M. |last=Scott |title=The Emergence of the Eastern Powers, 1756\u20131775 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-79269-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN052179269X&pg=PA182&dq=Repnin+Poland |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref name=\"Steed,\">H.

Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the resulting reaction among some of Poland's Roman Catholics, as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the [[Bar Confederation|Confederation of Bar]] of 1768\u20131772, formed in [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]], where the Poles tried to expel Russian forces from Commonwealth territory.<ref name=\"Scott\" /><ref name=\"Seton-Watson\" /> The irregular and poorly commanded Polish forces had little chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a major defeat. Adding to the chaos was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Cossacks|Cossack]] and peasant rebellion, the [[Koliyivshchyna]], which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of [[szlachta|noblemen]] (''{{lang|pl|szlachta}}''), Jews, [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniates]], and Catholic priests, before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.\n\nIn 1769 Austria annexed a small territory of [[Spi\u0161|Spisz]] and in 1770 it annexed [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Nowy Targ]]. These territories had been a bone of contention between Poland and [[Hungary]], which was a part of the Austrian crown lands.\n\n=== First Partition ===\n{{Main|First Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1773-1789.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth after the First Partition, as a protectorate of the Russian Empire (1773\u201389)]]\n\nIn February 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in [[Vienna]]. Early in August, Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously invaded the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, 1772, the occupation manifesto was issued, much to the consternation of a country too exhausted by the endeavors of the [[Confederation of Bar]] to offer successful resistance;<ref name=\"Brit\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466910/Partitions-of-Poland |title=Partitions of Poland |year=2008 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> nevertheless, several battles and sieges took place, as Commonwealth troops refused to lay down their arms (most notably, in [[Tyniec]], [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]]).\n\nThe partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] was elated with his success; Prussia took most of German-speaking [[Royal Prussia]] (without [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]]) that stood between its possessions in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], as well as Ermland ([[Warmia]]), northern areas of [[Greater Poland]] along the [[Note\u0107]] River (the [[Netze District]]), and parts of [[Kujawy|Kuyavia]] (but not the city of [[Toru\u0144]]).<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Despite token criticism of the partition from Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]], Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg]], was proud of wresting as large a share as he did, with the rich [[salt mining|salt mines]] of [[Bochnia]] and [[Wieliczka]]. To Austria fell [[Zator]] and Auschwitz ([[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]), part of [[Lesser Poland]] embracing parts of the counties of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Sandomierz|Sandomir]] and the whole of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], less the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine of Russia]] was also very satisfied. By this \"diplomatic document\" Russia came into possession of that section of [[Livonia]] that had remained in Commonwealth control, and of [[Belarus]] embracing the counties of [[Vitebsk]], [[Polotsk]] and [[Mstsislaw|Mstislavl]].<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n[[File:Rejtan Upadek Polski Matejko.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Rejtan (painting)|Rejtan at Sejm 1773]]'', oil on canvas by Jan Matejko, 1866, {{convert|282|x|487|cm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]\n\nBy this partition, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 30% of its territory and half of its population<ref name=\"Brit\" /> (four million people), of which a large portion had not been ethnically Polish. By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly gained control over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous customs duties, Prussia accelerated the collapse of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nAfter having occupied their respective territories, the three partitioning powers demanded that King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw]] and the [[Sejm]] approve their action. When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. The so-called [[Partition Sejm]], with Russian military forces threatening the opposition, on September 18, 1773, signed the treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories.\n\n=== Second Partition ===\n{{Main|Second Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 2.png|thumb|300px|right|The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Second Partition (1793)]]\n\nBy 1790 the First Polish Republic had been weakened to such a degree that it was forced into an unnatural and terminal alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The [[Polish\u2013Prussian alliance|Polish\u2013Prussian Pact]] of 1790 was signed. The conditions of the Pact contributed to the subsequent final two partitions of Poland\u2013Lithuania.\n\nThe [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May Constitution of 1791]] enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of the [[Repnin Sejm]]. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] then at high tide in France, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.\n\nIn the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|War in Defense of the Constitution]], pro-Russian conservative Polish [[magnate]]s, the [[Targowica Confederation|Confederation of Targowica]], fought against Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians would help them restore the [[Golden Liberty]]. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the [[Grodno Sejm]], last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the Second Partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough land so that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province [[South Prussia]], with [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] (and later Warsaw) as the capital of the new province.\n\nTargowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support, and in 1794 the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] began.\n\n=== Third Partition ===\n{{Main|Third Partition of Poland}}\nKosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire. The partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty, dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth between their three countries.\n\nThe Russian part included {{convert|120000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1.2&nbsp;million people with [[Vilnius]], the Prussian part (new provinces of [[New East Prussia]] and [[New Silesia]]) {{convert|55000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1&nbsp;million people with Warsaw, and the Austrian {{convert|47000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} with 1.2&nbsp;million and [[Lublin]] and Krak\u00f3w.\n\n== Summary ==\nWith regard to population, in the First Partition, Poland lost over four to five million citizens (about a third of its population of 14&nbsp;million before the partitions).<ref name=\"LukowskiZawadzki2001-96\">{{cite book |author1=Jerzy Lukowski |author2=W.

After his defeat and the implementation of the [[Congress of Vienna]] treaty in 1815, the Russian-dominated [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] was created in its place. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with [[Warsaw]]) and, after crushing [[November Uprising|an insurrection in 1831]], the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. After the [[January Uprising|uprising of 1863]], [[Russification]] of Polish secondary schools was imposed and the literacy rate dropped dramatically. In the Austrian sector which now was called [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Poles fared better and were allowed to have representation in Parliament and to form their own universities, and Krak\u00f3w with [[Lw\u00f3w|Lemberg]] (Lw\u00f3w/Lviv) became centers of Polish culture and education. Meanwhile, Prussia [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanized]] the entire school system of its Polish subjects, and had no more respect for Polish culture and institutions than the Russian Empire. In 1915 a [[client state]] of the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] was proposed and accepted by the [[Central Powers]] of World War I: the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]].
