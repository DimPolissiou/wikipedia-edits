Prematurely eliminated, [[Vittorio Pozzo]] lost his position as sole commissioner of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] and [[Ferruccio Novo]] took his place.\n\nNew season began in mid-September with a Torino almost identical to that of the previous championships; there was only [[Franco Ossola]] permanently in place of [[Pietro Ferraris]], who, at age 36, had moved to [[Novara Calcio|Novara]]. The [[central midfielder|midfielder]] [[Rubens Fadini]] arrived from Gallarate, [[Dino Ballarin]], brother of the goalkeeper [[Aldo Ballarin|Aldo]] was signed from Chioggia; the Hungarian-Czechoslovakian [[J\u00falius Schubert]], a left-sided midfielder; and strikers [[Emile Bongiorni]] and [[Ruggero Grava]] arrived from [[Racing Club de France|Racing Parigi]] and [[CO Roubaix-Tourcoing|Roubaix-Tourcoing]] respectively.\nThe club began the season after a long tour in [[Brazil]] where the team met [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]], losing only once. During the season, reduced to 24 teams after three promotions and relegations, [[Ernest Erbstein]] was appointed as the team's technical director and the Englishman [[Leslie Lievesley]] became the coach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chesterfield-fc.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10435~979069,00.html | title = Past players |publisher=Chesterfield F.C. | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}</ref>\nThe campaign also saw injuries to [[Virgilio Maroso]], [[Eusebio Castigliano]], [[Romeo Menti]] and [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofc.it/storia|title=La Storia del Torino Fc|publisher=Torino Football Club|language=Italian|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>, plus the long suspension for [[Aldo Ballarin]]. The Granata, which debuted with a victory against [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], suffered a defeat in the second round to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]; the team recovered with five straight wins, including that of the [[Turin derby|derby]], but lost again, in [[Milan]], against the ''Rossoneri''.\nThe club would relinquish the lead in the standings<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ormezzano|title=Toro 49|p= 164}}.</ref>, then recapture it, finishing midway through the season on par with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], from which a third defeat was suffered, losing 3\u20130. In the return leg of the derby Torino would defeat [[Juventus]] 3\u20130. \nTorino's advantage increased in the standings, gaining a maximum of six point on [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in second place<ref>{{cite book|author=Colombero,|title=Pacifico|p=120}}</ref>. However, a pair of draws (in [[Trieste]] and [[Bari]]) allowed Inter to close the gap within four points from Torino. On 30 April 1949, the two clubs met in Milan, ending 0\u20130, with Torino approaching their fifth consecutive title (the record would be equaled).\nThe team travelled to Portugal to play in a friendly against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. However, upon return Torino perished in the [[Superga air disaster]].\n\n=== Superga air disaster ===\n{{main|Superga air disaster}}\nThe airplane with the team crashed at [[Basilica di Superga]] nearby Torino. There were deaths of team chairmen and club workers, baggage men and three of the best journalists  in the country at the time: [[Renato Casalbore]] (founder of Tuttosport magazine); [[Renato Tosatti]] (from journal Gazzetta del Popolo) and [[Luigi Cavallero]] (from journal La Stampa). \nThe shocking corpse identification was made by former Italian National Team manager [[Vittorio Pozzo]]. The spezzino player [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]], injured, did not travel to Lisboa. The following persons in the Torino circle did not travel: second goalkeeper [[Renato Gandolfi]] (instead third  goalkeeper [[Dino Ballarin]] did), the radio anchor [[Nicol\u00f2 Carosio]] and former manager of Italian National Team also journalist Vittorio Pozzo (Torino prefered to give the seat to Cavallero).\n<ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Jennings |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46788983 |title=The plane crash that killed Serie A's champions and their English coach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpWbGJPo1-c&source=video&vgc=rss&usg=AFQjCNFfzesVbEpVRJXx4KxoHr8LKgclPQ |title=TG-R \"Leonardo\": possibili cause della sciagura di Superga: l'ipotesi dell'altimetro guasto|publisher= Andrea Sinaglia YouTube }}</ref>\n\n====Legacy====\nThe impact of the tragedy in Italy was colossal. An official estimate of about one million persons attended funerals at Piazza in the city of Torino to say goodbye to the players and club officials. \nThe shock of the tragedy was the main reason for the long travel on boat across the Atlantic Ocean by Italian National Team to play the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil rather than use an airplane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/speciale/mondiali-verso-russia-2018/brasile-1950-la-seconda-squadra-un-uruguay-stellare-e-un-india-a-piedi-nudi_1214304-201802a.shtml|title=Brasile 1950, la seconda squadra: un Uruguay stellare e un'India a piedi...nudi|author=Andrea Saronni|date=18 May 2018}}</ref>\nRebuilding of Torino as a competitive squad lasted a long term and could not win another championship until 1976.\n\n==== List of victims ====\n;Players\n* [[Valerio Bacigalupo]]\n* [[Aldo Ballarin]]\n* [[Dino Ballarin]]\n* [[\u00c9mile Bongiorni]]\n* [[Eusebio Castigliano]]\n* [[Rubens Fadini]]\n* [[Guglielmo Gabetto]]\n* [[Ruggero Grava]]\n* [[Giuseppe Grezar]]\n* [[Ezio Loik]]\n* [[Virgilio Maroso]]\n* [[Danilo Martelli]]\n* [[Valentino Mazzola]](Captain)\n* [[Romeo Menti]]\n* [[Piero Operto]]\n* [[Franco Ossola]]\n* [[Mario Rigamonti]]\n* [[J\u00falius Schubert]]\n;Club officials\n* Arnaldo Agnisetta\n* Ippolito Civalleri\n* Andrea Bonaiuti (coordinator of team travels)\n;Managers\n* [[Egri Erbstein]]\n* [[Leslie Lievesley]]\n* Osvaldo Cortina (physical)\n;Journalists\n* [[Renato Casalbore]]\n* Renato Tosatti\n* Luigi Cavallero\n;Baggage Men\n* Pierluigi Meroni\n* Celeste D'Inca\n* Cesare Biancardi\n* Antonio Pangrazi\n\n== Squad ==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Valerio Bacigalupo]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Dino Ballarin]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Renato Gandolfi]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Aldo Ballarin]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Virgilio Maroso]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Piero Operto]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Rigamonti]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Biglino]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Eusebio Castigliano]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Rubens Fadini]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Luigi Giuliano]]}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Grezar]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Ezio Loik]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Danilo Martelli]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=CZE|name=[[J\u00falius Schubert]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Alfio Balbiano]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=FRA|name=[[\u00c9mile Bongiorni]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Guglielmo Gabetto]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=FRA|name=[[Ruggero Grava]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Valentino Mazzola]]}} (Captain)\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Romeo Menti]] II}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Franco Ossola]]}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Youth Squad ===\nAfter [[Superga air disaster]], youth squad (primavera)  disputed the last four round of the competition: they are not considered title winners due to Italian Federation (FIGC) actually assigned the championship to  the senior squad.\n\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|pos=GK|nat=ITA|name=[[Guido Vandone]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Bersia]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Sergio Lussu]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Sergio Mari]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=DF|nat=ITA|name=[[Umberto Motto]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Oscar Ferrari]]}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Gianmarinaro]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=MF|nat=ITA|name=[[Lando Macchi]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Mario Audisio]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Francone]]}}\n{{fs player|pos=FW|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Marchetto]]}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Transfers ===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n\n!

Game which Toro lost 4-3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toro.it/press/view/3228|title=3 May 1949: Benfica-Torino 4-3|publisher=toro.it}}</ref> Torino was named winner of the championship  by  the Federation, and the Youth squad was able to play the last 4 rounds.\nFinished a short summer interval from the end of previous season, competition officially resumed in Italy after the [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. Prematurely eliminated, [[Vittorio Pozzo]] lost his position as sole commissioner of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] and [[Ferruccio Novo]] took his place.\n\nNew season began in mid-September with a Torino almost identical to that of the previous championships; there was only [[Franco Ossola]] permanently in place of [[Pietro Ferraris]], who, at age 36, had moved to [[Novara Calcio|Novara]]. The [[central midfielder|midfielder]] [[Rubens Fadini]] arrived from Gallarate, [[Dino Ballarin]], brother of the goalkeeper [[Aldo Ballarin|Aldo]] was signed from Chioggia; the Hungarian-Czechoslovakian [[J\u00falius Schubert]], a left-sided midfielder; and strikers [[Emile Bongiorni]] and [[Ruggero Grava]] arrived from [[Racing Club de France|Racing Parigi]] and [[CO Roubaix-Tourcoing|Roubaix-Tourcoing]] respectively.\nThe club began the season after a long tour in [[Brazil]] where the team met [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]], losing only once. During the season, reduced to 24 teams after three promotions and relegations, [[Ernest Erbstein]] was appointed as the team's technical director and the Englishman [[Leslie Lievesley]] became the coach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chesterfield-fc.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10435~979069,00.html | title = Past players |publisher=Chesterfield F.C. | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}</ref>\nThe campaign also saw injuries to [[Virgilio Maroso]], [[Eusebio Castigliano]], [[Romeo Menti]] and [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofc.it/storia|title=La Storia del Torino Fc|publisher=Torino Football Club|language=Italian|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>, plus the long suspension for [[Aldo Ballarin]]. The Granata, which debuted with a victory against [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], suffered a defeat in the second round to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]; the team recovered with five straight wins, including that of the [[Turin derby|derby]], but lost again, in [[Milan]], against the ''Rossoneri''.\nThe club would relinquish the lead in the standings<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ormezzano|title=Toro 49|p= 164}}.</ref>, then recapture it, finishing midway through the season on par with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], from which a third defeat was suffered, losing 3\u20130. In the return leg of the derby Torino would defeat [[Juventus]] 3\u20130. \nTorino's advantage increased in the standings, gaining a maximum of six point on [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in second place<ref>{{cite book|author=Colombero,|title=Pacifico|p=120}}</ref>. However, a pair of draws (in [[Trieste]] and [[Bari]]) allowed Inter to close the gap within four points from Torino. On 30 April 1949, the two clubs met in Milan, ending 0\u20130, with Torino approaching their fifth consecutive title (the record would be equaled).\nThe team travelled to Portugal to play in a friendly against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. However, upon return Torino perished in the [[Superga air disaster]].\n\n=== Superga air disaster ===\n{{main|Superga air disaster}}\nThe airplane with the team crashed at [[Basilica di Superga]] nearby Torino. There were deaths of team chairmen and club workers, baggage men and three of the best journalists  in the country at the time: [[Renato Casalbore]] (founder of Tuttosport magazine); [[Renato Tosatti]] (from journal Gazzetta del Popolo) and [[Luigi Cavallero]] (from journal La Stampa). \nThe shocking corpse identification was made by former Italian National Team manager [[Vittorio Pozzo]].

During much of this time, non-elite tillers and pastoralists, such as the Kurmi, were part of a social spectrum that blended only indistinctly into the elite landowning classes at one end, and the menial or ritually polluting classes at the other.<ref name=bayly-p41/>\n\nThe Kurmi were famed as market gardeners.<ref name=\"Bayly1988-p478\">{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=C.

They were able, therefore, to grow valuable market crops such as potatoes, melons and tobacco immediately around the village, sow fine grains in the ''manjha'', and restrict the poor millet subsistence crops to the periphery. A network of ''ganjs'' (fixed rural markets) and Kurmi or Kacchi settlements could transform a local economy within a year or two.<ref name=\"Bayly1988-p101\">{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=C.

The divergent claims to status in the nineteenth century (and earlier) illustrate the point that for non-Muslims, while varna was generally accepted as the basis for identity, on the whole little agreement prevailed with respect to the place of the individual and the jati within a varna hierarchy.<ref name=\"Pinch1996-p85\" /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough the free peasant farm was the mainstay of farming in many parts of north India in the 18th century, in some regions, a combination of climatic, political, and demographic factors led to the increased dependence of peasant cultivators such as the Kurmi.<ref name=\"Bayly1988-p478\" />  In the Benares division, which had come under the revenue purview of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] in 1779, the [[Chalisa famine]] of 1783 and the relentless revenue demand from the Company reduced the status of many Kurmi cultivators.<ref name=\"Bayly1988-p478\" />  A British revenue agent wrote in 1790, \"It unfortunately happened that during the famine aforesaid a great proportion of the Kurmis, Kacchis and Koeris were in this district as well as in others supplanted by Brahmans ... \" and bemoaned the loss of agricultural revenue in part due to, \"this unfavourable mutation amongst the cultivators ...\"<ref name=\"Bayly1988-p478\" />\n\n\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, economic pressures on the large landowning classes increased noticeably.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  The prices of agricultural lands fell at the same time that the East India Company, after acquiring the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] (later the [[North-Western Provinces]]) in 1805, began to press landowners for more [[Company rule in India#Revenue collection|land revenue]].<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  The annexation of Awadh in 1856 created more fear and discontent among the landed elite, and may have contributed to the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  Economic pressures also opened marginal areas to intensive agriculture and turned the fortunes of the non-elite peasants, such as the Kurmi, who worked them.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  After the rebellion, the landowning classes, defeated but still pressed economically in the new [[British Raj]], attempted to treat their tenants and labourers as people of lowly birth and to demand unpaid labour from them.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  According to historical anthropologist [[Susan Bayly]], <blockquote> In some instances these were attempts to stave off decline by reinvigorating or intensifying existing forms of customary service. Elsewhere these were wholly novel demands, many being imposed on 'clean' tillers and cattle-keepers like the Ram- and Krishna-loving Koeris, Kurmis and Ahirs ... In either case, these calls were buttressed with appeals to Sanskritic varna theory and Brahmanical caste convention. ... Kurmi and Goala/Ahir tillers who held tenancies from these 'squireens' found themselves being identified as Shudras, that is, people who were mandated to serve those of the superior Kshatriya and Brahman varnas.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe elite landowning classes, such as Rajputs and [[Bhumihar]]s, now sought to present themselves as flagbearers of the ancient Hindu tradition.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  At the same time, there was a proliferation of [[Brahmin|Brahmanical]] rituals in the daily life of the elite, a greater stress on pure bloodlines, more stringent conditions placed on matrimonial alliances, and, as noted by some social reformers of the day, an increase among the Rajputs of [[female infanticide]], a practice that had little history among the Kurmi.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />\n<center>\n<div style=\"float:center; width:1000px;\">\n{{Gallery|width=200 |lines=4\n|File:India1909PrevailingRaces.JPG|The map of the prevailing \"races\" of India (now discredited) based on the 1901 Census of British India.

H. Risley]] (1851\u20131911) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Edgar Thurston]], who were disciples of the French race theorist Topinard and his European followers, subsumed discussions of caste into theories of biologically determined race essences, ... Their great rivals were the material or occupational theorists led by the ethnographer and folklorist [[William Crooke]] (1848\u20131923), author of one of the most widely read provincial ''Castes and Tribes'' surveys, and such other influential scholar-officials as [[Denzil Ibbetson]] and E. A. H. Blunt.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /></blockquote>\n\nSeeing caste as a fundamental force in Indian life, Risley, especially, influenced official views as expressed in both the Censuses of British India and the [[Imperial Gazetteer of India|Imperial Gazetteer]] brought out by Hunter.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  Risley is best known for the now discounted attribution of all differences in caste to varying proportions of seven racial types which included \"Dravidian,\" \"Aryo-Dravidian,\" and \"Indo-Aryan\". The Kurmi fell into two such categories.

In the north, these observers claimed, a field of 'second-rate barley' would belong to a Rajput or Brahman who took pride in shunning the plough and secluding his womenfolk. Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator. These, said such commentators as Denzil Ibbetson and E. A. H. Blunt, were the qualities of the non-patrician 'peasant'&nbsp;\u2013 the thrifty Jat or canny Kurmi in upper India, .... Similar virtues would be found among the smaller market-gardening populations, these being the people known as Keoris in Hindustan, ....<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Twentieth century===\nAs the economic pressures on the patrician landed groups continued through the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth, there were increasing demands for unpaid labour directed at the Kurmi and other non-elite cultivators.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  The landed elites' demands were couched in avowals of their ancient rights as \"twice-born\" landowners and of the Kurmi's alleged lowly, even servile, status, which required them to serve.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  At times encouraged by sympathetic British officials and at other times carried by the groundswell of egalitarian sentiment being espoused then by the devotional [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] movements, especially those based on [[Tulsidas]]'s ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'', the Kurmi largely resisted these demands.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  Their resistance, however, did not take the form of denial of caste or of caste-based imposition, but rather of disagreement about where they stood in the caste ranking.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  A noteworthy attribute of the resulting Kurmi-kshatriya movement was the leadership provided by educated Kurmis who were now filling the lower and middle levels of government jobs.<ref name=\"Pinch1996-p85\" /> According to William Pinch: <blockquote> The mantle of leadership in this phase befell the well-connected Ramdin Sinha, a government forester who had gained notoriety by resigning from his official post to protest a provincial circular of 1894 that included Kurmis as a \"depressed community\" and barred them therefore from recruitment into the police service. The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref name=\"Pinch1996-p85\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy. This was followed by an organisation in Awadh that sought to draw other communities&nbsp;\u2014 such as the [[Patidar]]s, [[Maratha]]s, [[Kapu]]s, [[Reddy]]s and [[Naidu]]s&nbsp;\u2014 under the umbrella of the Kurmi name. This body then campaigned for Kurmis to classify themselves as Kshatriya in the 1901 census and, in 1910, led to the formation of the [[All India Kurmi Kshatriya Mahasabha]].<ref name=Jaffrelot2003p197>{{cite book |title=India's silent revolution: the rise of the lower castes in North India |page=197 |first=Christophe |last=Jaffrelot |publisher=C.

They lost badly but in 1934 the three communities formed the [[Triveni Sangh]] political party, which allegedly had a million dues-paying members by 1936. However, the organisation was hobbled by competition from the Congress-backed [[Backward Class]] Federation, which was formed around the same time, and by co-option of community leaders by the Congress party. The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior.

Their great rivals were the material or occupational theorists led by the ethnographer and folklorist [[William Crooke]] (1848\u20131923), author of one of the most widely read provincial ''Castes and Tribes'' surveys, and such other influential scholar-officials as [[Denzil Ibbetson]] and E. A. H. Blunt.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /></blockquote>\n\nSeeing caste as a fundamental force in Indian life, Risley, especially, influenced official views as expressed in both the Censuses of British India and the [[Imperial Gazetteer of India|Imperial Gazetteer]] brought out by Hunter.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  Risley is best known for the now discounted attribution of all differences in caste to varying proportions of seven racial types which included \"Dravidian,\" \"Aryo-Dravidian,\" and \"Indo-Aryan\". The Kurmi fell into two such categories. In the ethnological map of India published in the 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India and based on the 1901 Census supervised by Risley, the Kurmi of the United Provinces were classified as \"Aryo-Dravidian,\" whereas the Kurmi of the [[Central Provinces]] were counted among \"Dravidians\".<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /> In the 1901 Census of India, the category of [[varna]], the four-fold graded system, was included in the official classification of caste,<ref name=\"RudolphRudolph1984\">{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Lloyd I.|last2=Rudolph|first2=Susanne Hoeber|title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7guY1ut-0lwC|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73137-7|page=116}}</ref> the only time this was the case.{{efn|Although influential, Risley's attempt did not achieve the end which he sought: people were unable to determine in which group they should classify themselves, the localised system he adopted could not be transposed onto the national stage, and some groups took advantage of the situation deliberately to seek reclassification and therefore satisfy their aspirations. L. I. and S. H. Rudolph have commented that \"Risley's work, as a scientific effort, seemed based on mistaken premises.

In the north, these observers claimed, a field of 'second-rate barley' would belong to a Rajput or Brahman who took pride in shunning the plough and secluding his womenfolk. Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator. These, said such commentators as Denzil Ibbetson and E. A. H. Blunt, were the qualities of the non-patrician 'peasant'&nbsp;\u2013 the thrifty Jat or canny Kurmi in upper India, .... Similar virtues would be found among the smaller market-gardening populations, these being the people known as Keoris in Hindustan, ....<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Twentieth century===\nAs the economic pressures on the patrician landed groups continued through the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth, there were increasing demands for unpaid labour directed at the Kurmi and other non-elite cultivators.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  The landed elites' demands were couched in avowals of their ancient rights as \"twice-born\" landowners and of the Kurmi's alleged lowly, even servile, status, which required them to serve.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  At times encouraged by sympathetic British officials and at other times carried by the groundswell of egalitarian sentiment being espoused then by the devotional [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] movements, especially those based on [[Tulsidas]]'s ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'', the Kurmi largely resisted these demands.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  Their resistance, however, did not take the form of denial of caste or of caste-based imposition, but rather of disagreement about where they stood in the caste ranking.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  A noteworthy attribute of the resulting Kurmi-kshatriya movement was the leadership provided by educated Kurmis who were now filling the lower and middle levels of government jobs.<ref name=\"Pinch1996-p84\"/> According to William Pinch: <blockquote> The mantle of leadership in this phase befell the well-connected Ramdin Sinha, a government forester who had gained notoriety by resigning from his official post to protest a provincial circular of 1894 that included Kurmis as a \"depressed community\" and barred them therefore from recruitment into the police service. The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy.

They lost badly but in 1934 the three communities formed the [[Triveni Sangh]] political party, which allegedly had a million dues-paying members by 1936. However, the organisation was hobbled by competition from the Congress-backed [[Backward Class]] Federation, which was formed around the same time, and by co-option of community leaders by the Congress party. The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior.

The Fields were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was built in 220 BC. The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted annually in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. A theatre dedicated to Apollo was also set up in 179 BC, close to the temple of Apollo, and later rebuilt under the dictatorship of [[Caesar]]. The rebuilding of the theatre necessitated shortening the Circus itself, and required that several temples be destroyed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=507}}</ref> \n\nThe temple of Apollo \"''in circo''\" acquired special significance under Augustus, as a popular legend developed that he had been sired by the god while his mother [[Atia (mother of Augustus)|Atia]] was visiting the temple.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> Augustus undertook myriad new constructions around the Circus, and probably had it paved for the first time. Most notably Augustus demolished the small theater dedicated to Apollo, as well as the temples of Diana and Pietas, to build the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] on the eastern side of the Circus.<ref name=\"Flaminius\">{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=510-511}}</ref> Augustus also built the [[Porticus Octaviae]], which hemmed in the Circus on its northeastern side.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/GF-008.html|title=Rome Alive: A Source Guide to the Ancient City, Vol. 1| author=Peter Aicher| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci| year=2004}}</ref> Augustus' relation [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 38 BC)|Lucius Marcius Phillipus]] restored the [[Temple of Hercules Musarum]] with a surrounding portico that could be accessed from the Circus.<ref name=\"Flaminius\"/>\n\nIn AD 15, statues to the deified Augustus were erected, dedicated by [[Gaius Norbanus Flaccus (consul 15)|C. Norbanus Flaccus]]. Also inside was the [[Porticus Octaviae]]. The entrance to the piazza was marked by one of three large marble arches erected in honor of [[Germanicus]], engraved with records of his military conquests. \n\nA fragment of the [[Severan marble plan]] preserves a mention of the Circus Flaminius.\n\n==Use==\nThe Circus Flaminius was never meant to rival the much larger [[Circus Maximus]], and, unlike the Circus Maximus, it was not just an entertainment venue. It almost certainly lacked a track designed for [[chariot racing]].<ref>[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211</ref> The only ''ludi'' held there were the [[Taurian Games]], which featured horseback racing around turning posts ''(metae)''.<ref>[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.154; also recorded by the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]''.</ref> The obscure Taurian Games were held to [[propitiation|propitiate]] the gods of the underworld ''([[Di Inferi|di inferi]])'', and seem to have been symbolically grounded in the site itself, as they were never moved to a different circus. Equestrian events were also associated with underworld deities in other rituals and festivals in the Campus Martius. [[Strabo]] makes no mention of equestrian activities taking place in the Circus Flaminius.

The Fields were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was built in 220 BC. The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted annually in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. A theatre dedicated to Apollo was also set up in 179 BC, close to the temple of Apollo, and later rebuilt under the dictatorship of [[Caesar]]. The rebuilding of the theatre necessitated shortening the Circus itself, and required that several temples be destroyed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=507}}</ref> \n\nThe temple of Apollo \"''in circo''\" acquired special significance under Augustus, as a popular legend developed that he had been sired by the god while his mother [[Atia (mother of Augustus)|Atia]] was visiting the temple.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> \n\nAugustus undertook myriad new constructions around the Circus, and probably had it paved for the first time. Most notably Augustus demolished the small theater dedicated to Apollo, as well as the temples of Diana and Pietas, to build the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] on the eastern side of the Circus.<ref name=\"Flaminius\">{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=510-511}}</ref> Augustus also built the [[Porticus Octaviae]], which hemmed in the Circus on its northeastern side.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/GF-008.html|title=Rome Alive: A Source Guide to the Ancient City, Vol. 1| author=Peter Aicher| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci| year=2004}}</ref> Augustus' relation [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 38 BC)|Lucius Marcius Phillipus]] restored the [[Temple of Hercules Musarum]] with a surrounding portico that could be accessed from the Circus.<ref name=\"Flaminius\"/>\n\nIn AD 15, statues to the deified Augustus were erected, dedicated by [[Gaius Norbanus Flaccus (consul 15)|C. Norbanus Flaccus]]. Also inside was the [[Porticus Octaviae]]. The entrance to the piazza was marked by one of three large marble arches erected in honor of [[Germanicus]], engraved with records of his military conquests. \n\nA fragment of the [[Severan marble plan]] preserves a mention of the Circus Flaminius.\n\n==Use==\nThe Circus Flaminius was never meant to rival the much larger [[Circus Maximus]], and, unlike the Circus Maximus, it was not just an entertainment venue. It almost certainly lacked a track designed for [[chariot racing]].<ref>[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211</ref> The only ''ludi'' held there were the [[Taurian Games]], which featured horseback racing around turning posts ''(metae)''.<ref>[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.154; also recorded by the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]''.</ref> The obscure Taurian Games were held to [[propitiation|propitiate]] the gods of the underworld ''([[Di Inferi|di inferi]])'', and seem to have been symbolically grounded in the site itself, as they were never moved to a different circus. Equestrian events were also associated with underworld deities in other rituals and festivals in the Campus Martius. [[Strabo]] makes no mention of equestrian activities taking place in the Circus Flaminius. [[Valerius Maximus]], who is likely to be in error, is the only ancient source that claims the ''Ludi Plebeii'' ([[Plebeian Games]]) were held there. In 2 BC, the circus was flooded for the slaughter of 36 crocodiles to commemorate the building of the [[Forum of Augustus]].<ref> Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 55.10</ref>\n\nThe Circus also hosted ceremonies related to the [[Roman triumph]], as the Flaminian Fields traditionally figured along the triumphal route towards Capitoline Hill.

According to the education policy of 1972, the government decided to upgrade the college to the level of University of Engineering & Technology after shifting it to Nawabshah. Consequently, the first year classes were started at Nawabshah in February, 1974.\n\nIn July 1976, this institution was declared as an additional campus of the University of Sindh through amendment in the Sindh University Act, 1972 and was headed by a Pro-Vice Chancellor. The additional campus was eventually upgraded to the level of University on 15th March, 1977 through an ordinance. Later-on, the Provincial Assembly of Sindh also passed an Act in this regard and named the institution as Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Nawabshah.\n\nIn 1980, the Government decided to shift Mehran University of Engineering and Technology to Jamshoro and the campus at Nawabshah was declared as a constituent college of Mehran University; renamed as Mehran University College of Engineering and Technology (MUCET), Nawabshah\". On 7th August 1996, MUCET was upgraded to the level of a university through an ordinance and later through an act of Sindh Assembly and was renamed as Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering, Science and Technology (QUEST), Nawabshah. At present, QUEST is accredited with the Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and is the member of Association of Commonwealth Universities.\n\n==Academic departments==\n* Department of Mechanical Engineering\n* Department of Electrical Engineering\n* Department of Energy & Environment Engineering\n* Department of Electronic Engineering\n* Department of Civil Engineering\n* Department of Computer Systems Engineering\n* Department of Information Technology\n* Department of Computer Science\n* Department of Mathematics And Statistics\n* Department of Basic Sciences And Related Studies\n* Department of Chemical Engineering\n* Department of Telecommunication Engineering\n*Department of English (Language and Literature)\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Undergraduate program===\nThe system of education is the term system.

is honored after the former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. \n===<small>History</small>===\nThe Sindh University Engineering college Jamshoro was established in 1963 as a constituent college of the University of Sindh to provide adequate opportunity of engineering education to the people belonging to the interior of Sindh Province. According to the education policy of 1972, the government decided to upgrade the college to the level of University of Engineering & Technology after shifting it to Nawabshah. Consequently, the first year classes were started at Nawabshah in February, 1974.\n\nIn July 1976, this institution was declared as an additional campus of the University of Sindh through amendment in the Sindh University Act, 1972 and was headed by a Pro-Vice Chancellor. The additional campus was eventually upgraded to the level of University on 15th March, 1977 through an ordinance. Later-on, the Provincial Assembly of Sindh also passed an Act in this regard and named the institution as Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Nawabshah.\n\nIn 1980, the Government decided to shift Mehran University of Engineering and Technology to Jamshoro and the campus at Nawabshah was declared as a constituent college of Mehran University; renamed as Mehran University College of Engineering and Technology (MUCET), Nawabshah\". On 7th August 1996, MUCET was upgraded to the level of a university through an ordinance and later through an act of Sindh Assembly and was renamed as Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering, Science and Technology (QUEST), Nawabshah. At present, QUEST is accredited with the Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and is the member of Association of Commonwealth Universities.\n\n==Academic departments==\n* Department of Mechanical Engineering\n* Department of Electrical Engineering\n* Department of Energy & Environment Engineering\n* Department of Electronic Engineering\n* Department of Civil Engineering\n* Department of Computer Systems Engineering\n* Department of Information Technology\n* Department of Computer Science\n* Department of Mathematics And Statistics\n* Department of Basic Sciences And Related Studies\n* Department of Chemical Engineering\n* Department of Telecommunication Engineering\n*Department of English (Language and Literature)\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Undergraduate program===\nThe system of education is the term system.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} extension opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with service from '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''), which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} along the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. This service split into two and re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

They then pursued [[Austria]]n manufacturer Elin to produce a propulsion system for the prototype while they awaited Rockwell.

Streetcar]] system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} extension opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with service from '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''), which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} along the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. This service split into two and re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which closed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].
