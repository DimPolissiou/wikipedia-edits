Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using coal to produce a wide range of valuable{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} commodities.\n\nBecause the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} and China{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} where there are abundant coal resources.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.\n\n==Etymology and basic philosophy==\n[[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px|\"Aikid\u014d\" written with \"[[Qi|ki]]\" in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]]\n\nThe word \"aikido\" is formed of three [[kanji]]:\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ai''&nbsp;\u2013 joining, unifying, combining, fitting\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ki''&nbsp;\u2013 spirit, energy, mood, morale\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d''&nbsp;\u2013 way, path\n\nThe term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\" or \"Way of unifying energy\", in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last         = Pranin\n |first        = Stanley\n |title        = Aiki\n |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n |year         = 2007\n |url          = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |accessdate   = 21 August 2007\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |archivedate  = 26 September 2007\n |url-status      = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]]\nAikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 14 December 1883&nbsp;\u2013 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=O-Sensei \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |archivedate=26 August 2014 \n |df= \n}}</ref> The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century.<ref>Draeger, Donn F.

At that time Ueshiba referred to his martial art as '''\"Aiki Bud\u014d\"'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name=\"Aikido\"/>\n\n===Religious influences===\n[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Onisaburo Deguchi]]\nAfter Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Oomoto Foundation\n| title = The Teachings\n| work = Teachings and Scriptures\n| publisher = Netinformational Commission\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| accessdate = 14 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| archivedate= 13 August 2007 \n| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

This trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by [[Hiroshi Tada]]; and Germany in 1965 by [[Katsuaki Asai]]. Designated the \"Official Delegate for Europe and Africa\" by Morihei Ueshiba, [[Masamichi Noro]] arrived in France in September 1961. [[Seiichi Sugano]] was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.\n\n===Proliferation of independent organizations===\n{{further|Aikido styles}}\n{{see also|List of aikidoka|l1=List of aikid\u014dka}}\n\nThe largest aikido organization is the [[Aikikai Foundation]], which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has developed into many styles, most of which were formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nThe earliest independent styles to emerge were [[Yoseikan Aikido]], begun by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] in 1931,<ref name=\"Mochizuki\"/> [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido, founded by [[Gozo Shioda]] in 1955,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Yoshinkan Aikido \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225749/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |archivedate=26 September 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> and [[Shodokan Aikido]], founded by [[Kenji Tomiki]] in 1967.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite book\n| last = Shishido\n| first = Fumiaki\n| authorlink = Fumiaki Shishida\n|last2=Nariyama\n|first2=Tetsuro\n|authorlink2= Tetsuro Nariyama\n| title = Aikido: Tradition and the Competitive Edge\n| publisher = Shodokan Publishing USA\n| year = 2002\n| isbn = 978-0-9647083-2-7\n}}</ref> The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n==Ki==\n[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido. The term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}. It was written as {{lang|ja|\u6c23}} until the [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|writing reforms after World War II]], and this older form still is seen on occasion.\n\nThe character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|\"health\"|\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"shyness\"|\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This concept was known as [[Takemusu]] Aiki, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'', with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development ranked separately.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and [[Physical exercise|conditioning]], as well as specific techniques.<ref name=\"AFL\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma\n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/aikidoforlife0000homm/page/20 20]\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://archive.org/details/aikidoforlife0000homm/page/20\n}}</ref> Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of [[throw (grappling)|throws]], beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.<ref name=\"AFL\"/> The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and [[Pinning hold|pins]]. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.\n\n===Fitness===\n[[File:A\u00efkido-shihoo nage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Uke (martial arts)|Ukemi]] ({{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u8eab}}) is very important for safe practice]]\nPhysical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[endurance]], with less emphasis on [[strength training]]. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] or [[pilates]]. For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|\u6e96\u5099\u4f53\u64cd|''junbi tais\u014d''}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |last=Pranin  |first=Stanley  |title=Jumbi Taiso  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido  |year=2006  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190245/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340  |archivedate=16 October 2007  |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Roles of ''uke'' and ''tori''===\nAikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique\u2014the {{lang|ja|\u53d6\u308a}} ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|\u4ed5\u624b}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|\u6295\u3052}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name=\"afl2\"/>\n\nBoth halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''tori'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name=\"afl2\"/> Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed.

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend the movement of ''tori'' with the movement of ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px\"\n|-\n! rank !! belt !! color !! type\n|-\n| ''ky\u016b'' || [[File:Judo white belt.svg|65px]] || white || ''mudansha'' / ''y\u016bky\u016bsha''\n|-\n| ''dan'' || [[File:Judo black belt.svg|65px]] || black || ''y\u016bdansha''\n|}\n\nThe uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.

In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.

Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.\n\n==Etymology and basic philosophy==\n[[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px|\"Aikid\u014d\" written with \"[[Qi|ki]]\" in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]]\n\nThe word \"aikido\" is formed of three [[kanji]]:\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ai''&nbsp;\u2013 joining, unifying, combining, fitting\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ki''&nbsp;\u2013 spirit, energy, mood, morale\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d''&nbsp;\u2013 way, path\n\nThe term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\" or \"Way of unifying energy\", in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last         = Pranin\n |first        = Stanley\n |title        = Aiki\n |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n |year         = 2007\n |url          = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |accessdate   = 21 August 2007\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n |archivedate  = 26 September 2007\n |url-status      = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]]\nAikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 14 December 1883&nbsp;\u2013 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=O-Sensei \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |archivedate=26 August 2014 \n |df= \n}}</ref> The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century.<ref>Draeger, Donn F.

At that time Ueshiba referred to his martial art as '''\"Aiki Bud\u014d\"'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name=\"Aikido\"/>\n\n===Religious influences===\n[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Onisaburo Deguchi]]\nAfter Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Oomoto Foundation\n| title = The Teachings\n| work = Teachings and Scriptures\n| publisher = Netinformational Commission\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| accessdate = 14 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| archivedate= 13 August 2007 \n| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

Designated the \"Official Delegate for Europe and Africa\" by Morihei Ueshiba, [[Masamichi Noro]] arrived in France in September 1961.

Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and are taught throughout the world.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n==Ki==\n[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido. The term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}. It was written as {{lang|ja|\u6c23}} until the [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|writing reforms after World War II]], and this older form still is seen on occasion.\n\nThe character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|\"health\"|\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"shyness\"|\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This concept was known as [[Takemusu]] Aiki, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'', with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development ranked separately.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training.

In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power.

For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|\u6e96\u5099\u4f53\u64cd|''junbi tais\u014d''}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  |last=Pranin  |first=Stanley  |title=Jumbi Taiso  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido  |year=2006  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190245/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340  |archivedate=16 October 2007  |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Roles of ''uke'' and ''tori''===\nAikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique\u2014the {{lang|ja|\u53d6\u308a}} ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|\u4ed5\u624b}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|\u6295\u3052}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name=\"afl2\"/>\n\nBoth halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''tori'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name=\"afl2\"/> Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.\n\nSome basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"single hand double-handed grab\"|\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo|\"double single-handed grab\"|\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed.\n* {{Nihongo|'''\"Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed.

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend the movement of ''tori'' with the movement of ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nFrom these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations. For example, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\"; ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'', for example, refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'' (referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab).\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques; a strike, even if it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px\"\n|-\n! rank !! belt !! color !! type\n|-\n| ''ky\u016b'' || [[File:Judo white belt.svg|65px]] || white || ''mudansha'' / ''y\u016bky\u016bsha''\n|-\n| ''dan'' || [[File:Judo black belt.svg|65px]] || black || ''y\u016bdansha''\n|}\n\nThe uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick (\"[[judo]]-style\"), and thin (\"[[karate]]-style\") cotton tops are used.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.\n\nMost aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or [[indigo]] trousers called a ''[[hakama]]'' (used also in [[Naginatajutsu]], [[kendo]], and [[iaido]]). In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training. The attacks initiated by ''uke'' (and which ''tori'' must defend against) have been criticized as being \"weak\", \"sloppy\", and \"little more than caricatures of an attack\".<ref name=\"Pranin-aikido today\">{{cite journal| last = Pranin| first = Stanley| title = Aikido Practice Today| journal = Aiki News| volume = 86| publisher = Aiki News| date = Fall 1990| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| accessdate = 2 November 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231252/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| archivedate = 21 November 2007| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Ledyard| first = George S.| title = Non-Traditional Attacks| work = aikiweb.com|date=June 2002| url = http://www.aikiweb.com/training/ledyard3.html| accessdate = 29 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080725060329/http://www.aikiweb.com/training/ledyard3.html| archivedate= 25 July 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Weak attacks from ''uke'' allow for a conditioned response from ''tori'', and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.<ref name=\"Pranin-aikido today\"/> To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. [[Shodokan Aikido]] addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format.<ref name=\"ACE\"/> Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=3104|title=In response to the articles by Stanley Pranin&nbsp;\u2013 Martial arts in a state of decline?

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.<ref name=\"Pranin-status quo\">{{cite journal| last = Pranin| first = Stanley| title = Challenging the Status Quo| journal = Aiki News| volume = 98| publisher = Aiki News| year = 1994| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=12| accessdate = 2 November 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231241/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=12| archivedate = 21 November 2007| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nConversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. According to Minoru Shibata of Aikido Journal, \"O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts.\"<ref name=\"Shibata-Dilemma\">{{cite journal| last = Shibata| first = Minoru J.| title = A Dilemma Deferred: An Identity Denied and Dismissed| journal = Aikido Journal | year = 2007| url = http://members.aikidojournal.com/public/a-dilemma-deferred-an-identity-denied-and-dismissed/| accessdate = 11 March 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231751/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=263| archivedate= 21 November 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional ''[[jujutsu]]'' or ''[[kenjutsu]]'' are diverging from what Ueshiba taught. Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that \"[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals {{sic}} of the paradigm that he demonstrated.\"<ref name=\"Shibata-Dilemma\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Clear}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|d=Q43114|n=no|b=no|s=no|voy=no|mw=no|species=no|wikt=aikido}}\n<!-- Please see Talk concerning Styles and External Links.

In January 1976 [[Anatoly Karpov]] became the highest-rated player on the FIDE list, FIDE having dropped Fischer (whose rating was higher than Karpov's) from the list [[Bobby Fischer#Sudden obscurity|due to inactivity]]. In January 1984, the third world number one was [[Garry Kasparov]]. Anatoly Karpov briefly held the world number one ranking in July 1985, and the fourth world number one, [[Vladimir Kramnik]], briefly held the ranking in January 1996. Other than these two brief periods, Kasparov dominated for some 22 years from 1984 until his retirement from professional chess on 10 March 2005. In January 1990, he surpassed Fischer's peak of 2785 and became the first player ever to achieve a 2800 rating. In July 1999, he reached his peak rating, 2851. This was the highest FIDE rating in history until January 2013, when it was surpassed by [[Magnus Carlsen]].\n\nOn Kasparov's retirement, the world number one ranking passed to [[Veselin Topalov]], since Kasparov was removed from the rating list in April 2006 due to inactivity. In April 2007, [[Viswanathan Anand]] became the sixth player to top the rankings.<ref>[http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/ap2007.html FIDE January 2007 Rating List: Top 100], The Week In Chess</ref> Kramnik briefly returned to the number one ranking in January 2008, but was again joint number one by rating, being placed first in the list due to having played more games in the rating period in question. For most of the period April 2007 to November 2009, the top ranking was held by either Anand or Topalov. The seventh and current world number one is [[Magnus Carlsen]], who first achieved this ranking in the January 2010 list, and has been world number one since July 2011 after having lost and reclaimed the position from Anand during 2010 and 2011.\n\n==Publication details==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThere were unofficial lists in 1964, 1969, 1970 and January 1971, as the [[Elo rating]] system was first introduced.{{where|date=August 2019}}\n\nFrom 1971 to 1980, there was one main rating list published each year (for a total of 10), initially published in July from 1971 to 1973, then once in May (1974), before switching to annual publication in January from 1975 to 1980 (in this period, some supplements and amendments were also published).\n\nFrom 1981 to July 2000, two lists per year were published, in January and July (for a total of 39 lists). In July 2000, the publication schedule was increased to four times a year (January, April, July, October) operating from July 2000 to July 2009 (for a total of 36 lists). In July 2009, the publication schedule was increased again, to six times a year (January, March, May, July, September, November) operating from July 2009 to July 2012 (for a total of 18 lists). In July 2012 the publication schedule was increased again to the current monthly schedule.\n\nPublication of the rating lists in the 1970s and 1980s was in ''[[Chess Informant]]'' and other chess publications. The number of games played by individuals during the rating period was added to the lists from July 1985 onwards. Player ID numbers were used from January 1990. From January 1999, the practice of rounding to the nearest five Elo points was discontinued, and ratings were then rounded to the nearest Elo point for publication. From July 2000 onwards, the ratings are available from the FIDE website.<ref name=\"History of Elo ratings 1971-2001\"/>\n\nIn January 2010 former World Champion [[Boris Spassky]] criticized the current emphasis on ratings rather than World Champions.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/kings_don_rule_d1N8Uq7aXJtkGMsU5SNi3K Spassky ''Kings Don't Rule'']</ref> Although Spassky was World Champion during the inception of the FIDE rankings in 1971, he never became the number-one rated player in the world; since July 1971 he and Vladimir Kramnik are the only undisputed World Champions to never become ranked world number-one during their tenure as champions.\n\n==List of world number ones==\n=== Top players (list) ===\nThe following is a list of the players ranked number one on the FIDE rating system from the first official list in July 1971 to the present day, along with their ratings during the periods in question.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These seven players include six undisputed world chess champions, with Topalov being the only player to achieve the number one ranking without becoming undisputed world champion, though he was FIDE world champion from 2005 to 2006, and is still an active player. Kramnik and Spassky are the only world champions in the period in question to never have been world number one while being champion.\n\nFischer was top of the lists successively five times over a period of 4.5 years, though he is considered to have already become the number one player in the world before the official list started, as he topped the unofficial list in 1970. Karpov topped the list 12 times, successively 11 times over a period of 8 years, and once for 6 months. Kasparov has been world number one on the official list 54 times over a period of 22 years, and 31 times successively over nearly a decade from July 1996 to January 2006; he was number one 3 times successively over 1.5 years, then 20 times successively over 10 years, then finally 31 times over 9 years and 9 months. Kramnik was world number one 2 times (for 6 and 3 months), for a total of 9 months. Topalov has been world number one successively 4 and 6 times (a total of 10 times), for 12 months and 15 months respectively (for a total of 27 months). Anand has been world number one successively 2 and 3 times (a total of 5 times), for 6 months and 9 months respectively (for a total of 15 months). Carlsen has been world number one a record 108 times, including a record 96 consecutive times from July 2011 until June 2019.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Time at FIDE number one and youngest age at FIDE number one (through April 30, 2020)\n|-\n!

In January 1976 [[Anatoly Karpov]] became the highest-rated player on the FIDE list, FIDE having dropped Fischer (whose rating was higher than Karpov's) from the list [[Bobby Fischer#Sudden obscurity|due to inactivity]]. In January 1984, the third world number one was [[Garry Kasparov]]. Anatoly Karpov briefly held the world number one ranking in July 1985, and the fourth world number one, [[Vladimir Kramnik]], briefly held the ranking in January 1996. Other than these two brief periods, Kasparov dominated for some 22 years from 1984 until his retirement from professional chess on 10 March 2005. In January 1990, he surpassed Fischer's peak of 2785 and became the first player ever to achieve a 2800 rating. In July 1999, he reached his peak rating, 2851. This was the highest FIDE rating in history until January 2013, when it was surpassed by [[Magnus Carlsen]].\n\nOn Kasparov's retirement, the world number one ranking passed to [[Veselin Topalov]], since Kasparov was removed from the rating list in April 2006 due to inactivity. In April 2007, [[Viswanathan Anand]] became the sixth player to top the rankings.<ref>[http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/ap2007.html FIDE January 2007 Rating List: Top 100], The Week In Chess</ref> Kramnik briefly returned to the number one ranking in January 2008, but was again joint number one by rating, being placed first in the list due to having played more games in the rating period in question. For most of the period April 2007 to November 2009, the top ranking was held by either Anand or Topalov. The seventh and current world number one is [[Magnus Carlsen]], who first achieved this ranking in the January 2010 list, and has been world number one since July 2011 after having lost and reclaimed the position from Anand during 2010 and 2011.\n\n==Publication details==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThere were unofficial lists in 1964, 1969, 1970 and January 1971, as the [[Elo rating]] system was first introduced.{{where|date=August 2019}}\n\nFrom 1971 to 1980, there was one main rating list published each year (for a total of 10), initially published in July from 1971 to 1973, then once in May (1974), before switching to annual publication in January from 1975 to 1980 (in this period, some supplements and amendments were also published).\n\nFrom 1981 to July 2000, two lists per year were published, in January and July (for a total of 39 lists). In July 2000, the publication schedule was increased to four times a year (January, April, July, October) operating from July 2000 to July 2009 (for a total of 36 lists). In July 2009, the publication schedule was increased again, to six times a year (January, March, May, July, September, November) operating from July 2009 to July 2012 (for a total of 18 lists). In July 2012 the publication schedule was increased again to the current monthly schedule.\n\nPublication of the rating lists in the 1970s and 1980s was in ''[[Chess Informant]]'' and other chess publications. The number of games played by individuals during the rating period was added to the lists from July 1985 onwards. Player ID numbers were used from January 1990. From January 1999, the practice of rounding to the nearest five Elo points was discontinued, and ratings were then rounded to the nearest Elo point for publication. From July 2000 onwards, the ratings are available from the FIDE website.<ref name=\"History of Elo ratings 1971-2001\"/>\n\nIn January 2010 former World Champion [[Boris Spassky]] criticized the current emphasis on ratings rather than World Champions.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/kings_don_rule_d1N8Uq7aXJtkGMsU5SNi3K Spassky ''Kings Don't Rule'']</ref> Although Spassky was World Champion during the inception of the FIDE rankings in 1971, he never became the number-one rated player in the world; since July 1971 he and Vladimir Kramnik are the only undisputed World Champions to never become ranked world number-one during their tenure as champions.\n\n==List of world number ones==\n=== Top players (list) ===\nThe following is a list of the players ranked number one on the FIDE rating system from the first official list in July 1971 to the present day, along with their ratings during the periods in question.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These seven players include six undisputed world chess champions, with Topalov being the only player to achieve the number one ranking without becoming undisputed world champion, though he was FIDE world champion from 2005 to 2006, and is still an active player. Kramnik and Spassky are the only world champions in the period in question to never have been world number one while being champion.\n\nFischer was top of the lists successively five times over a period of 4.5 years, though he is considered to have already become the number one player in the world before the official list started, as he topped the unofficial list in 1970. Karpov topped the list 12 times, successively 11 times over a period of 8 years, and once for 6 months. Kasparov has been world number one on the official list 54 times over a period of 22 years, and 31 times successively over nearly a decade from July 1996 to January 2006; he was number one 3 times successively over 1.5 years, then 20 times successively over 10 years, then finally 31 times over 9 years and 9 months. Kramnik was world number one 2 times (for 6 and 3 months), for a total of 9 months. Topalov has been world number one successively 4 and 6 times (a total of 10 times), for 12 months and 15 months respectively (for a total of 27 months). Anand has been world number one successively 2 and 3 times (a total of 5 times), for 6 months and 9 months respectively (for a total of 15 months). Carlsen has been world number one a record 108 times, including a record 96 consecutive times from July 2011 until June 2019.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\"\n|+Time at FIDE number one and youngest age at FIDE number one (through April 30, 2020)\n|-\n!
