[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

Democracy is an obstacle to this suppression of freedom which the centralized direction of economic activity requires.

According to Hayek, it is in this way that it becomes possible for [[totalitarian]] leaders to rise to power as happened in the years following World War I.<ref name=\"Hayek\"/> [[Austrian School]] economists such as Hayek and his mentor [[Ludwig Mises]] also continually used the word ''socialism'' as a synonym for authoritarian socialism, central planning and state socialism, conflating it with fascism,<ref name=\"Mises\">Mises, Ludwig (1936) [1922].

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay), also [condemning] wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not.

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy. The market is planned by a central government agency, generally a state planning commission.\n* Socially-equitable distribution of the national income in which goods and services are provided for free by the state that supplement private consumption.\n\nThis economic model is greatly characterized by the government's central planning.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\">Wilczynski, J.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland.

Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

[[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals. [And] an economy cannot be politically tailored to perfection\".<ref name=\"Ader\"/><ref name=\"Wellisz\">Wellisz, Stanislaw (1964).

In 1913, prior to both [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the former Soviet Union had a GDP per capita of $1,488 in 1990 international dollars which grew 461% to $6,871 by 1990. After its dissolution in December 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998. By comparison, Western Europe grew from a higher base of $3,688 international dollars by a comparable 457% to $16,872 in the same period and reached $17,921 by 1998.<ref name=\"Maddison\">Maddison, Angus (2001).

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1981).

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

This view distinguished Bordiga from Marxist\u2013Leninists, who tended and still tend to telescope the first two stages and so have money and the other exchange categories surviving into socialism, but Bordiga would have none of this.

He won the men's singles gold medal at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic Games]], where he represented [[Czechoslovakia]], and played in two [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles finals. In 1987 he won the [[WCT Finals]], the season-ending championship for the [[World Championship Tennis]] tour.\n\nHis son [[Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 Jr.|Miloslav Jr.]] is a professional tennis player.<ref>[http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100054820 ITF Tennis \u2013 Mens Circuit \u2013 Player Biography: MECIR, Miloslav (SVK)]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was born in [[Bojnice]], Czechoslovakia (now part of [[Slovakia]]).\n\nHe reached two [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] finals in 1984 and began 1985 by beating [[Jimmy Connors]] in the semifinal at Philadelphia, before losing to world No. 1 [[John McEnroe]] in the final. He won his first ATP singles title in Rotterdam later that year, and ended 1985 ranked just outside the world's top 10.\n\nHe consolidated his position as a world class player in 1986, beating rising [[Stefan Edberg]] in straight sets at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], before losing to defending champion [[Boris Becker]] in the quarterfinals. He reached his first Grand Slam final at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] later that year, beating [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Boris Becker]] along the way to the final, where he faced fellow Czechoslovak, defending champion and world No. 1, [[Ivan Lendl]]. The 1986 US Open was notable for the fact that four players from Czechoslovakia competed in the two singles finals for men and women \u2013 Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 and Lendl, [[Helena Sukov\u00e1]] and [[Martina Navratilova]]. Lendl won the match in straight sets 6\u20134, 6\u20132, 6\u20130. Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159's 1986 US Open final appearance was the last major final to see a player still using a wooden racket.\n\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 improved further in 1987, winning six singles and six doubles titles, notably winning the [[WCT Finals]] in Dallas, where he defeated John McEnroe in four sets. He met Lendl again in three high-profile matches that year, winning the final of the [[Miami Masters|Lipton International Players Championships]] in Key Biscayne, Florida, while Lendl won the final of the [[Hamburg Masters|German Open]] in Hamburg and the semifinals of the French Open.\n\nBy this time, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159's sedate playing style was known to frustrate a lot of the more-powerful top ranked players. The Swedish players, in particular, were said to dislike playing against him.\n\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was on top form at Wimbledon in 1988, where he defeated [[Mats Wilander]] in the quarterfinal. It was Wilander's only Grand Slam singles defeat of the year (he won the 1988 Australian Open, French Open and US Open) yet Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 beat him 6\u20133, 6\u20131, 6\u20133. He took a two-set lead in the semifinal against Edberg with a similar display, and later led by a break of serve in the final set, but Edberg eventually wore him down on the way to his first Wimbledon crown.\n\nThe highlight of Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159's career came later in 1988 when he was selected to represent Czechoslovakia in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympics]]. He defeated [[Eric Jelen]], [[Jeremy Bates (tennis)|Jeremy Bates]], [[Guy Forget]] and [[Michiel Schapers]] and then in the men's singles semifinals he exacted revenge over [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] champion Edberg, in a five-set match 3\u20136, 6\u20130, 1\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20132. He then met [[Tim Mayotte]] of the U.S. in the men's singles final and won in four sets 3\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20134, 6\u20132 to claim the gold medal. He also won a bronze medal in the men's doubles, partnering [[Milan \u0160rejber]].\n\nIn 1989, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 reached his second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open in Melbourne. Again he came up against Lendl and lost in straight sets 6\u20132, 6\u20132, 6\u20132. It was a tactical victory for Lendl, whose win saw him to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking from Wilander. After the match, Lendl apologized to the crowd, explaining that he and coach [[Tony Roche]] had decided the best tactic against Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was to hit shots deep and down the centre of the court, denying his opponent the angles he thrived on.\n\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was a member of the Czechoslovak teams that won the [[World Team Cup]] in 1987 and the inaugural [[Hopman Cup]] in 1989. He is currently the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[Davis Cup]] captain.\n\nDuring his career, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 won 11 singles titles and nine doubles titles. His career-high world ranking in both singles and doubles was world No. 4. His final career singles title came in 1989 at [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]]. His last doubles title was also won in 1989 in Rotterdam.\n\nThroughout most of 1989 and into 1990, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 suffered from a worsening back injury and he retired in July 1990, aged just 26.\n\n==Playing style==\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2009}}\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was a finesse player whose career straddled the transition from wooden and metal racquets towards modern graphite composites. He was noted for his touch shots as well as the ability to disguise his shots, particularly his two-handed backhand. His court coverage and graceful footwork earned him the nickname \"The Big Cat\". The French called him \"Le Prestidigitateur\" (The Conjuror).\n\nMany top players used to cite Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 as the one player they most enjoyed watching because of his beautifully simple style and touch. He was known as the \"Swede Killer\" for the success that he had against Swedish players, especially [[Mats Wilander]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220021536/http://geocities.com/edhead01us/tapes.html  Stefan Edberg's matches on tape<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Major finals==\n===Grand

({{IPA-sk|\u02c8mil\u0254sla\u028a\u032f \u02c8m\u025bt\u0283i\u02d0\u027e}}; born 19 May 1964) is a former professional tennis player from [[Slovakia]]. He won the men's singles gold medal at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic Games]], where he represented [[Czechoslovakia]], and played in two [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles finals. In 1987 he won the [[WCT Finals]], the season-ending championship for the [[World Championship Tennis]] tour.\n\nHis son [[Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 Jr.|Miloslav Jr.]] is a professional tennis player.<ref>[http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100054820 ITF Tennis \u2013 Mens Circuit \u2013 Player Biography: MECIR, Miloslav (SVK)]</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was born in [[Bojnice]], Czechoslovakia (now part of [[Slovakia]]).\n\nHe reached two [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] finals in 1984 and began 1985 by beating [[Jimmy Connors]] in the semifinal at Philadelphia, before losing to world No. 1 [[John McEnroe]] in the final. He won his first ATP singles title in Rotterdam later that year, and ended 1985 ranked just outside the world's top 10.\n\nHe consolidated his position as a world class player in 1986, beating rising [[Stefan Edberg]] in straight sets at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], before losing to defending champion [[Boris Becker]] in the quarterfinals. He reached his first Grand Slam final at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] later that year, beating [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Boris Becker]] along the way to the final, where he faced fellow Czechoslovak, defending champion and world No. 1, [[Ivan Lendl]]. The 1986 US Open was notable for the fact that four players from Czechoslovakia competed in the two singles finals for men and women \u2013 Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 and Lendl, [[Helena Sukov\u00e1]] and [[Martina Navratilova]]. Lendl won the match in straight sets 6\u20134, 6\u20132, 6\u20130. Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159's 1986 US Open final appearance was the last major final to see a player still using a wooden racket.\n\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 improved further in 1987, winning six singles and six doubles titles, notably winning the [[WCT Finals]] in Dallas where he defeated John McEnroe in four sets. He met Lendl again in three high-profile matches that year, winning the final of the [[Miami Masters|Lipton International Players Championships]] in Key Biscayne, Florida, while Lendl won the final of the [[Hamburg Masters|German Open]] in Hamburg and the semifinals of the French Open.\n\nBy this time, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159's sedate playing style was known to frustrate a lot of the more-powerful top ranked players. The Swedish players, in particular, were said to dislike playing against him.\n\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was on top form at Wimbledon in 1988, where he defeated [[Mats Wilander]] in the quarterfinal. It was Wilander's only Grand Slam singles defeat of the year (he won the 1988 Australian Open, French Open and US Open) yet Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 beat him 6\u20133, 6\u20131, 6\u20133. He took a two-set lead in the semifinal against Edberg with a similar display, and later led by a break of serve in the final set, but Edberg eventually wore him down on the way to his first Wimbledon crown.\n\nThe highlight of Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159's career came later in 1988 when he was selected to represent Czechoslovakia in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympics]]. He defeated [[Eric Jelen]], [[Jeremy Bates (tennis)|Jeremy Bates]], [[Guy Forget]] and [[Michiel Schapers]] and then in the men's singles semifinals he exacted revenge over [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] champion Edberg, in a five-set match 3\u20136, 6\u20130, 1\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20132. He then met [[Tim Mayotte]] of the U.S. in the men's singles final and won in four sets 3\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20134, 6\u20132 to claim the gold medal. He also won a bronze medal in the men's doubles, partnering [[Milan \u0160rejber]].\n\nIn 1989, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 reached his second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open in Melbourne. Again he came up against Lendl and lost in straight sets 6\u20132, 6\u20132, 6\u20132. It was a tactical victory for Lendl, whose win saw him to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking from Wilander. After the match, Lendl apologized to the crowd, explaining that he and coach [[Tony Roche]] had decided the best tactic against Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was to hit shots deep and down the centre of the court, denying his opponent the angles he thrived on.\n\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was a member of the Czechoslovak teams that won the [[World Team Cup]] in 1987 and the inaugural [[Hopman Cup]] in 1989. He is currently the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[Davis Cup]] captain.\n\nDuring his career, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 won 11 singles titles and nine doubles titles. His career-high world ranking in both singles and doubles was world No. 4. His final career singles title came in 1989 at [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]]. His last doubles title was also won in 1989 in Rotterdam.\n\nThroughout most of 1989 and into 1990, Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 suffered from a worsening back injury and he retired in July 1990, aged just 26.\n\n==Playing style==\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2009}}\nMe\u010d\u00ed\u0159 was a finesse player whose career straddled the transition from wooden and metal racquets towards modern graphite composites. He was noted for his touch shots as well as the ability to disguise his shots, particularly his two-handed backhand. His court coverage and graceful footwork earned him the nickname \"The Big Cat\". The French called him \"Le Prestidigitateur\" (The Conjuror).\n\nMany top players used to cite Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159 as the one player they most enjoyed watching because of his beautifully simple style and touch. He was known as the \"Swede Killer\" for the success that he had against Swedish players, especially [[Mats Wilander]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220021536/http://geocities.com/edhead01us/tapes.html  Stefan Edberg's matches on tape<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Major finals==\n===Grand
