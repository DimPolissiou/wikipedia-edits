Gacy responds angrily that he will. Lunch is interrupted again when Steve, an employee of Gacy's, complains he has not been paid for two weeks. Gacy says he will be paid and orders him off his property. Gacy consults a friend who advises [[Calcium oxide|lime]] for the smell.\n\nWhile driving at night Gacy abducts a man and brings him back to his garage and tells him about his problems, then releases him. At work Gacy angrily berates his workers for smoking on the job. He asks his latest employee how he's enjoying working for him and if he enjoys wrestling. They wrestle in Gacy's back yard where Gacy pins him down and Steve, watching with another man, calls him a [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]. Gacy is furious.\n\nThe next day, Steve and two other men attack Gacy as he comes out of a shop. Steve takes the money from Gacy's wallet, gives some to the other men and tells Gacy that he quits. Late that night, Gacy's wife, Kara, is awake in bed when she hears a car pull up. Gacy gets out and brings out someone [[Handcuffs|handcuffed]] and bundles him into the garage. Investigating, Kara finds clothes strewn about in the garage. She runs to the crawl space entrance where Gacy bursts out, saying that he had been laying down lime.\n\nGacy hosts his [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] [[Costume party|fancy dress party]] during which he offers Tom Kovacs a job and a speech is made honoring Gacy as an asset to the community. He hires an [[Pest control|exterminator]] to take care of the [[maggot]]s and [[cockroach]]es gathering in the crawl space. Questioned by two police officers about Steve's disappearance, he says Steve told him he was going to Costa Rica or Puerto Rico. One day, Gacy hits one of his employees over the head with a hammer. After cleaning him up, he pays him for his silence and lets him go. Kara discovers a pair of handcuffs and some homosexual magazines in the garage. Gacy blames some employees, saying \"you know how I feel about homos\". A few days later, Kara takes the two girls and leaves Gacy alone with his mother. Tom is having problems at home so Gacy suggests he rent Gacy's spare room.\n\nAnother late evening, Gacy picks up a male prostitute and stuffs a [[chloroform]]ed rag into his face. The prostitute awakens suspended by chains in Gacy's garage. The next morning, Gacy leaves the prostitute in the park where he stumbles away. Gacy lays concrete in the crawl space to try and cover the stench. He meets with Jim Burle and agrees to buy his car. Inviting Burle in for a drink, he instead drowns him in the bath tub. Gacy is running out of room in the crawl space. As Gacy and Tom are watching a video reel of how Gacy started his business, the video cuts to pornography. Tom freaks out and spends the night awake and terrified.\n\nTom decides to leave, but Gacy tricks him into being handcuffed and starts strangling him. Tom manages to escape and runs to the police.

''Paper Mario'' was re-released for Nintendo's [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in July 2007 as well as [[Wii U]] Virtual Console in 2015.\n\n''Paper Mario'' is set in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] as the protagonist [[Mario]] tries to rescue [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who has imprisoned the seven \"Star Spirits\", lifted her castle into the sky and has defeated his foe after stealing the Star Rod from Star Haven and making himself [[Wiktionary: invincible|invincible]]. To save Mushroom Kingdom, rescue Peach, get the castle back, and defeat Bowser, Mario must locate the Star Spirits, who can negate the effects of the stolen Star Rod, by defeating Bowser's minions guarding the star spirits. The player controls Mario and a number of partners to solve puzzles in the game's [[overworld]] and defeat enemies in a turn-based battle system. The battles are unique in that the player can influence the effectiveness of attacks by performing required controller inputs known as \"action commands\".\n\n''Paper Mario'' is the second [[List of Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing game]] to be released (following ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'') and is the first installment for the [[List of Mario role-playing games#Paper Mario series|''Paper Mario'' series]].

The Mario Brothers then head to the castle, and as Mario is about to have some quiet time with Peach, her castle is suddenly lifted by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]'s fortress. After his invasion and victory over Mario, the attached fortress serves as the location for playable side quests of the kidnapped Peach. In the main quest, Mario tries to retrieve all of the seven imprisoned Star Spirits on land,<ref name=\"IGN\"/> where most of the locations are linked to the central Toad Town, which acts as the game's hub area. The story's main conflict arises when Bowser invades Star Haven, the residence for the Star Spirits, and steals the Star Rod.\n\n=== Story and characters ===\nThe game's story centers on Mario as he tries to reclaim the seven Star Spirits, who have been sealed in playing cards by Bowser and his assistant, [[Kammy Koopa]].<ref name=\"RPGFan\"/> Their combined power is required to negate the effects of the Star Rod, which makes Bowser invincible. Once Mario rescues all of them, he uses their assistance to defeat Bowser and rescue Peach. The story is presented in the context of a [[novel]], with each adventure involving the rescue of a Star Spirit denoted as a single chapter. Peach is playable between chapters, where she allies with a star kid named Twink in the castle to relay vital information to Mario regarding his quest.<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/>\n\nMario allies with eight partners in total, each of whom represents a different type of enemy from the ''Mario'' franchise. These allies are:\n* Goombario, a [[Goomba]] who has the ability to tell the player about any character, environment, and enemy\n* Kooper, a [[Koopa Troopa]] with the ability to throw his shell at otherwise unreachable objects\n* Bombette, a Bob-omb with the ability to blow up weak parts of walls\n* Parakarry, a [[Koopa Troopa|Paratroopa]] with the ability to help Mario cross gaps too large to jump across\n* Lady Bow, a [[Boo (character)|Boo]] with the ability to make Mario become invisible and transparent\n* Watt, a Li'l Sparky with the ability to light up rooms and reveal hidden objects\n* Sushie, a Cheep-Cheep with the ability to allow Mario to swim\n* Lakilester, a [[Lakitu]] with the ability to allow Mario to traverse dangerous environments, such as spikes and lava.\n\nAfter Peach's castle is sent back to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to [[Luigi]], who had remained at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then followed by a [[parade]] during the credits.\n\n== Development ==\n''Paper Mario'' was developed by [[Intelligent Systems]]. Kumiko Takeda and Kaori Aoki wrote the game's script, while Naohiko Aoyama was the art director responsible for the game's distinctive graphical style.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Credits for Paper Mario|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|url= http://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/paper-mario/credits |accessdate=2006-03-18}}</ref> The game was initially called ''Super Mario RPG 2'', was slated for release on the [[64DD]],<ref>{{cite magazine|title=In Development |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1997|page=58 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NEXT_Generation_29#page/n58|quote=The original Super NES game was programmed by Square, but the Nintendo 64 version will be handled, amid some controversy, by Nintendo in-house.}}</ref> and was first revealed at [[Nintendo Space World]] '97, a former video game [[trade fair|trade show]] hosted by Nintendo.

[[IGN]]'s [[Matt Casamassina]] praised the game's accessibility, commenting that \"it serves as the perfect introductory game to any person hoping to explore the genre\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Nonetheless, other reviewers complained about the \"brain-dead easy\" puzzles and bosses requiring \"basic strategy at best\".<ref name=\"RPGamer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/mario/pmario/reviews/pmariostrev1.html|title=RPGamer\u2014Paper Mario|website=RPGamer|accessdate=2008-08-17|last=Tidwell |first=Mikel}}</ref> The game's nostalgic value was lauded, with reviewers noting the sense of familiarity with the ''Mario'' series present in the game's settings and characters.<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> The game has often been compared to the previous Mario RPG title, ''[[Super Mario RPG]]''.

IGN noted some paper-based visual effects such as when Mario folds in a bed to sleep, but complained about character zoom-ins, which revealed \"a pixelated mass of colors\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Although reviewers claimed that the novel graphical style was initially confusing, most welcomed the style eventually,<ref name=\"Eurogamer\"/> with GameSpot claiming that it was \"extremely well done\".<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/> The audio was also mainly praised, although reviewers criticised the lack of voice acting and character-specific sound effects.<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> RPGFan were particularly critical of the game's \"generic filler music\", despite enjoying use of multiple songs simultaneously.<ref name=\"RPGFan\"/>\n\nChester Barber reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \"One of the best RPGs ever, and definitely the best RPG available for Nintendo 64.

These allies are:\n* Goombario, a [[Goomba]] who has the ability to tell the player about any character, environment, and enemy\n* Kooper, a [[Koopa Troopa]] with the ability to throw his shell at otherwise unreachable objects\n* Bombette, a Bob-omb with the ability to blow up weak parts of walls\n* Parakarry, a [[Koopa Troopa|Paratroopa]] with the ability to help Mario cross gaps too large to jump across\n* Lady Bow, a [[Boo (character)|Boo]] with the ability to make Mario become invisible and transparent\n* Watt, a Li'l Sparky with the ability to light up rooms and reveal hidden objects\n* Sushie, a Cheep-Cheep with the ability to allow Mario to swim\n* Lakilester, a [[Lakitu]] with the ability to allow Mario to traverse dangerous environments, such as spikes and lava.\n\nAfter Peach's castle is sent back to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to [[Luigi]], who had remained at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then followed by a [[parade]] during the credits.\n\n== Development ==\n''Paper Mario'' was developed by [[Intelligent Systems]].

[[IGN]]'s [[Matt Casamassina]] praised the game's accessibility, commenting that \"it serves as the perfect introductory game to any person hoping to explore the genre\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Nonetheless, other reviewers complained about the \"brain-dead easy\" puzzles and bosses requiring \"basic strategy at best\".<ref name=\"RPGamer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/mario/pmario/reviews/pmariostrev1.html|title=RPGamer\u2014Paper Mario|website=RPGamer|accessdate=2008-08-17|last=Tidwell |first=Mikel}}</ref> The game's nostalgic value was lauded, with reviewers noting the sense of familiarity with the ''Mario'' series present in the game's settings and characters.<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> The game has often been compared to the previous Mario RPG title, ''[[Super Mario RPG]]''. [[Eurogamer]]'s Tom Bramwell judged that \"''Paper Mario'' is a vastly superior game to ''SMRPG''\",<ref name=\"Eurogamer\"/> while IGN compared the game's simple plot unfavourably with the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game and RPGFan claimed that some of ''Paper Mario''{{'}}s story was copied from it.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> RPGFan also questioned the name of ''Paper Mario'', as there were, in their opinion, insufficient gameplay features or aspects which used the paper theme to justify the name.<ref name=\"RPGFan\"/>\n\nCritics lauded the game's blend of RPG and platforming aspects.<ref name=\"Eurogamer\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot\"/> [[GameSpot]] noted the \"exciting and somewhat strategic\" battle system, which requires the player exploit the enemies' weak points.<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/> The \"refreshing\" action command features was praised in particular for adding originality to a battle formula that was present in many games of the same genre.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> IGN claimed the game was \"the best RPG for Nintendo 64\", calling it \"fantastically deep, intuitively designed, and wonderfully rewarding\".<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Despite this, enemy design itself was bemoaned for being \"corny and generic\", with notable exceptions to some of the ''Paper Mario''{{'}}s original boss characters.<ref name=\"RPGFan\"/> Eurogamer noted how \"Of the various characters you meet, none is of less importance than any other\", welcoming the partner characters and their relating puzzles.<ref name=\"Eurogamer\"/> GameSpot praised the game's use of humour and side quests, with references to the control of Peach in particular.<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/>\n\nThe reaction to the game's visuals was generally positive. IGN noted some paper-based visual effects such as when Mario folds in a bed to sleep, but complained about character zoom-ins, which revealed \"a pixelated mass of colors\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Although reviewers claimed that the novel graphical style was initially confusing, most welcomed the style eventually,<ref name=\"Eurogamer\"/> with GameSpot claiming that it was \"extremely well done\".<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/> The audio was also mainly praised, although reviewers criticised the lack of voice acting and character-specific sound effects.<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> RPGFan were particularly critical of the game's \"generic filler music\", despite enjoying use of multiple songs simultaneously.<ref name=\"RPGFan\"/>\n\nChester Barber reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \"One of the best RPGs ever, and definitely the best RPG available for Nintendo 64.

The move lured United goalkeeper [[Tom Presthus]] off his line, at which point Nowak passed across the box to oncoming Fire midfielder [[Jerzy Podbro\u017cny]] who scored an easy tap-in at the back post.

Nowak was credited with his second assist of the match, and Chicago headed into the second half with all the momentum and maintained the clean sheet on the way to the club's first league championship.

It was contested by [[D.C. United]], the two-time reigning champions, and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], the first [[expansion team]] to reach the final. Chicago won the match 2\u20130, with goals from [[Jerzy Podbro\u017cny]] and [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (soccer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]].\n\nChicago became the first expansion team to win the MLS Cup and also was the first MLS club to win both the league championship and the [[U.S. Open Cup]] in a single season, completing a domestic [[double (association football)|double]]. D.C. in turn became the first team to reach three consecutive finals and the first club to fail to score; D.C. also posted the best record in MLS that year with 24 wins (the L.A. Galaxy also won that same number of games), which is also a record that stands today.\n\nAs the top two finishers in the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]], both D.C. United and Chicago Fire earned the right to represent the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in the [[1999 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]]. The clubs faced off once again in the third-place match of the continental tournament, almost a year after meeting in MLS Cup 1998. That match ended in a 2\u20132 draw.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:2008-1226-Pasadena-008-RoseBowl.jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] hosted the [[MLS Cup]] final for the first time.]]\n\nThe [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]], was announced as the host venue for MLS Cup 1998 on October 25, 1997.
