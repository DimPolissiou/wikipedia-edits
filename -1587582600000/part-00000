Emboldened with this power, Adora leads a group of other magical princesses in an alliance to defeat the evil Horde, who are led by Lord [[Hordak]].\n\nThe series premiered as a [[Netflix]] [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|original program]] on November 13, 2018.

This evil army is led by [[Hordak]], a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the whole of Etheria. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic sword that transforms her into the Princess of Power, [[She-Ra]]. After realizing the suffering that the Horde has inflicted on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora joins the Resistance in the fight against the Horde through rebuilding the Princess Alliance, a group of other [[magical girl]]s that once all opposed Hordak. Adora's newfound allegiance to the Resistance pits her against her former best friend [[Catra]], whose feelings of abandonment twist her personal ambitions, leading her to become Adora's mortal enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/53992/she-ra-reboot-netflix-news|title=She-Ra: first look at Netflix reboot|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, Adora reassembles the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault, although engineer princess Entrapta defects to the Horde when she believes her allies have abandoned her. In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the warlord Horde Prime; due to the usual poor military decisions by Glimmer, both Adora and the sword are captured by Catra, providing Entrapta the means to get the portal operational, Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it. In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend Glimmer, Angella's daughter and Bright Moon's new queen, especially when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria; after the superweapon is started, once again due to poor and selfish decisions by Glimmer, she destroys the sword to prevent the weapon from activating, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal and becomes accessible to Horde Prime's armada.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{see also|List of She-Ra: Princess of Power and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as [[She-Ra|Adora / She-Ra]]\n** LaLa Nestor as young Adora\n* [[Karen Fukuhara]] as Glimmer, Princess (later Queen) of Bright Moon\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as [[Catra]]\n** Juliet Donenfeld as young Catra\n* [[Marcus Scribner]] as Bow\n* [[Reshma Shetty]] as Angella, Queen of Bright Moon\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as [[Shadow Weaver (character)|Shadow Weaver]]\n* Keston John as [[Hordak]], Horde Prime, [[Grizzlor]],<ref>{{cite news |title=KESTON JOHN VOICES |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Keston-John/ |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |work=Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref> Additional Voices\n* [[Lauren Ash]] as [[Scorpia (Princesses of Power)|Scorpia]]\n* [[Christine Woods]] as [[Entrapta]], Princess of Dryl\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Perfuma, Princess of Plumeria, Additional Voices\n* [[Jordan Fisher]] as Sea Hawk, Seneschal and Soda Pop\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Mermista, Princess of Salineas\n* Merit Leighton as Frosta, Princess of the Kingdom of Snows\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Castaspella\n* [[Krystal Joy Brown]] as Netossa, rebel princess\n* [[Noelle Stevenson]] as Spinnerella, rebel princess\n* Morla Gorrondona as Light Hope, Additional Voices\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Razz, Additional Voices\n* [[Adam Ray (comedian)|Adam Ray]] as [[Swift Wind]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Huntara<ref name=\"io901\">{{cite web |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=She-Ra Season 3 Is Coming This Summer and It's Bringing Geena Davis With It |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/she-ra-season-3-is-coming-this-summer-and-its-bringing-1834681402 |publisher=io9 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Zehra Fazal]] as Mara\n* Chris Jai Alex as George, one of Bow's fathers\n* Regi Davis as Lance, one of Bow's fathers\n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lonnie, Additional Voices\n* Antony Del Rio as Kyle, Additional Voices\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as King Micah\n** [[Taylor Gray]] as Young Micah\n* Jake Eberle as Norwyn and Tung Lashor\n* [[Jacob Tobia]] as Double Trouble\n* [[Amanda C.

A [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the 1985 [[Filmation]] series ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'', the 2018 series tells the tale of a teenager named Adora, who gains powers that allow her to turn into [[She-Ra|the titular heroine]].

This evil army is led by [[Hordak]], a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the whole of Etheria. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic sword that transforms her into the Princess of Power, [[She-Ra]]. After realizing the suffering that the Horde has inflicted on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora joins the Resistance in the fight against the Horde through rebuilding the Princess Alliance, a group of other [[magical girl]]s that once all opposed Hordak. Adora's newfound allegiance to the Resistance pits her against her former best friend [[Catra]], whose feelings of abandonment twist her personal ambitions, leading her to become Adora's mortal enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/53992/she-ra-reboot-netflix-news|title=She-Ra: first look at Netflix reboot|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, Adora reassembles the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault, although engineer princess Entrapta defects to the Horde when she believes her allies have abandoned her. In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the warlord Horde Prime; Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it. In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend Glimmer, Angella's daughter and Bright Moon's new queen, especially when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria; she destroys the sword to prevent the weapon from activating, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal and becomes accessible to Horde Prime's armada.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{see also|List of She-Ra: Princess of Power and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as [[She-Ra|Adora / She-Ra]]\n** LaLa Nestor as young Adora\n* [[Karen Fukuhara]] as Glimmer, Princess (later Queen) of Bright Moon\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as [[Catra]]\n** Juliet Donenfeld as young Catra\n* [[Marcus Scribner]] as Bow\n* [[Reshma Shetty]] as Angella, Queen of Bright Moon\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as [[Shadow Weaver (character)|Shadow Weaver]]\n* Keston John as [[Hordak]], Horde Prime, [[Grizzlor]],<ref>{{cite news |title=KESTON JOHN VOICES |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Keston-John/ |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |work=Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref> Additional Voices\n* [[Lauren Ash]] as [[Scorpia (Princesses of Power)|Scorpia]]\n* [[Christine Woods]] as [[Entrapta]], Princess of Dryl\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Perfuma, Princess of Plumeria, Additional Voices\n* [[Jordan Fisher]] as Sea Hawk, Seneschal and Soda Pop\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Mermista, Princess of Salineas\n* Merit Leighton as Frosta, Princess of the Kingdom of Snows\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Castaspella\n* [[Krystal Joy Brown]] as Netossa, rebel princess\n* [[Noelle Stevenson]] as Spinnerella, rebel princess\n* Morla Gorrondona as Light Hope, Additional Voices\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Razz, Additional Voices\n* [[Adam Ray (comedian)|Adam Ray]] as [[Swift Wind]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Huntara<ref name=\"io901\">{{cite web |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=She-Ra Season 3 Is Coming This Summer and It's Bringing Geena Davis With It |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/she-ra-season-3-is-coming-this-summer-and-its-bringing-1834681402 |publisher=io9 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Zehra Fazal]] as Mara\n* Chris Jai Alex as George, one of Bow's fathers\n* Regi Davis as Lance, one of Bow's fathers\n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lonnie, Additional Voices\n* Antony Del Rio as Kyle, Additional Voices\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as King Micah\n** [[Taylor Gray]] as Young Micah\n* Jake Eberle as Norwyn and Tung Lashor\n* [[Jacob Tobia]] as Double Trouble\n* [[Amanda C.

Though there is no official definition of its boundaries, it is generally considered to reach from the western shore of the [[Schuylkill River]], to City Avenue to the northwest, [[Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia|Cobbs Creek]] to the southwest, and the [[SEPTA]] [[Media/Elwyn Line]] to the south.  An alternate definition includes all city land west of the Schuylkill; this would also include [[Southwest Philadelphia]] and its neighborhoods.  The eastern side of West Philadelphia is also known as [[University City, Philadelphia|University City]].\n\n==Topography==\n[[File:West Philadelphia from One Liberty Observation Deck.jpg|thumb|right|View of West Philadelphia from One Liberty Observation Deck]]\nThe topography of West Philadelphia is composed of rolling hills rising slowly from the [[Schuylkill River]] toward [[Cobbs Creek]] in the west and toward [[Belmont Plateau]] in the northwest. This gradual elevation makes the skyline of Center City visible from many points in West Philadelphia. The [[Wynnefield]] neighborhood is a location frequently used by photographers and organizers of civic events.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], 216,433 people live among the ZIP codes of 19104, 19131, 19139, 19143 and 19151.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&geo_id=86000US19104&_geoContext=01000US%7C86000US19131&_street=&_county=&_cityTown=&_state=04000US42&_zip=19104&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|title=American FactFinder - Community Facts|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200216041546/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&geo_id=86000US19104&_geoContext=01000US%7C86000US19131&_street=&_county=&_cityTown=&_state=04000US42&_zip=19104&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|archive-date=16 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20090604162745/http://westphillydata.library.upenn.edu/infoR_ZipCode.htm Map])\n\n===Racial demographics===\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2017}}\n* Non-Hispanic Black or African-American: 164,921 (76.2%)\n* Non-Hispanic White/European: 37,010 (17.1%)\n* Hispanic or Latino: 4,328 (2.0%)\n* American Indian: 4,112 (1.9%)\n* Asian: 3,246 (1.5%)\n* Mixed or Other: 2,813 (1.3%)\n\nStarting with the first wave of [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants in the early 19th century, West Philadelphia was home to large numbers of European immigrants and their descendants. The area's African American population began growing in the 1880s through the migration of blacks from the southern states; [[white flight]] in the early 1960s completed the transition to a majority-black population.\n\nSince the 1980s, [[gentrification]], immigration, and the [[Urban Indian]] relocation movement have brought more racial diversity. Arrivals from [[East Asia]] and [[Latin America]], mainly Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans, have given the area  small [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] and [[Asian American]] populations. The community has a fair number of [[Afro-Caribbean]]/[[Caribbean American]] residents, from the [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Barbados]], and other areas of the [[West Indies]], as well as a growing number of [[African immigration to the United States|African]] immigrants.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[Image:Calvary UMC Philly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Calvary United Methodist Church, Philadelphia|Calvary United Methodist Church]], built in 1905.]]\n[[The Woodlands Cemetery]], which is located near the west bank of the Schuylkill River, was originally the estate of [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]] who bought the property in 1735 from descendants of Blockley Township's founder, William Warner, who hailed from [[Brockley]], England. Warner was the first known European west of the Schuylkill. In 1840, the property was transformed into a cemetery with an arboretum of over 1,000 trees.  It holds the graves of many famous Philadelphians.\n\n[[Satterlee Hospital]], one of the largest Union Army hospitals of the Civil War, operated from 1862 to 1865; part of its grounds are now the northern section of [[Clark Park]].\n\nWest Philadelphia's population expanded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thanks in large part to horsecars, then streetcars, and [[Schuylkill River]] bridges that allowed middle-class breadwinners to commute into the Central Business District a few miles to the east. West Philadelphia was among the early [[streetcar suburbs]], and a portion of it is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District]].\n\nThe western portion of the neighborhood was once home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country (and much striking Victorian-era architecture remains). The area has declined in prominence over the last 50 years, thanks in part to increasing crime and the migration of many middle and upper-class residents to suburbs and other sections of the city.\n\nWest Philadelphia drew national attention in 1978 and 1985 for violent clashes between police and an Afro-centric, back-to-nature group called [[MOVE]]. During the latter confrontation, police firebombed the group's headquarters, killing 11 people and destroying an entire block of Osage Avenue and Pine Street.\n\nIn recent years, parts of West Philadelphia have undergone \"Penntrification,\" a term that reflects the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s role in [[gentrification]] of the neighborhood; including a campaign to rename part of the area [[University City, Philadelphia|University City]] (the designation now appears on maps as well as public street signs and government listings). Many young professionals and families have moved into the area.\n\nIn 2008, the area around the [[Please Touch Museum]], [[Philadelphia Zoo]], and the [[Mann Music Center]] was designated the [[Centennial District, Philadelphia|Centennial District]]: an area to be revitalized by the country's 250th birthday in 2026.\n\n==Housing==\n[[Image:Queen anne house.JPG|thumb|250px|A common style of Queen Anne house with a wrap-around porch.]]\nMost of the houses in West Philadelphia are [[Terraced house|row houses]], although there are areas of [[semi-detached]] and [[Single-family detached home|detached]] houses. The earliest developments began in 1850 and the final period of mass construction ended in 1930. Development was enabled by the creation of the [[horsecar]], which pushed development to about 43rd Street, and, after the arrival of the electrified streetcar in 1892, accelerated to the west and southwest.<ref name=\"route34\">{{cite web| title =Studio 34's Eponymous Trolley, or, A Short History of Route 34| publisher =Studio 34: Yoga Healing Arts| year =2008| url =http://www.studio34yoga.com/trolley.shtml| accessdate =2008-03-11| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080709051920/http://www.studio34yoga.com/trolley.shtml| archivedate =2008-07-09}}</ref>   (See [[West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District]] and the [[Market-Frankford Line|Market Street Line]].)\n\nLargely commissioned by speculative developers and designed by some of the city's most prolific architects, they were purchased by industrial managers and other professionals who led the first movement of upper and [[middle class]] from the more crowded city center. Developers found they could increase profits by catering to this emerging group, shrinking lot sizes, and building more compact, less ornate houses.\n\n[[Image:Brick twin in WPhilly.JPG|thumb|250px|Twin rowhouse, typical of West Philadelphia neighborhoods.]]\n[[Image:Common brick rowhouse multiunit.jpg|thumb|250px|Multi-unit rowhouse, the most common style of rowhouse in West Philadelphia.]]\nInitial development was divided into block lots and sold in 1852 with the condition that \"substantial stone or brick buildings\" be erected. The houses in this grouping are primarily three-story Italianate buildings, linked by material, decorative detail, and form. Located around Chester Avenue, an additional but smaller and less ornate 16 Italianate, brownstone, semi-detached houses, similar in form to the initial houses. The [[setback (land use)|setback]] of these houses was 25 feet, allowing generous front yards.\n\nAnother development on Locust Street, a project by banker and West Philly resident [[Clarence Howard Clark]], was composed of three-story, two-bay, brick, restrained [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] rowhouses. The street was unified by front yards, and enclosed by decorative iron fences. The houses melded the suburban principles of front porches and greenspace with the urban rowhouse form, producing profitable, yet desirable, middle-class suburban housing.\n\nOther developments introduced [[urban density]] and architectural uniformity: the Queen Anne style with columned porches and decorative spindlework, brickwork and corbelling; steeply pitched gables with fishscale slate shingles; turrets; balconies; and windows with a single pane surrounded by small panes. These houses are typical of the early 20th-century developments in West Philadelphia, and are unified by rhythmic patterning of porch and gable features. The second story, projecting, semi-hexagonal bay is incorporated into this design, an element which defines the later rowhouses.\n\nThe western reaches of West Philadelphia included miles of two-story rowhouses with bay windows above classical columned front porches. What resulted was a collection of [[Colonial Revival]] houses with [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] influences, which reflect the sophisticated tastes of post-[[World War I]] Philadelphians. For the first time in West Philadelphia, houses had garages. Later Tudor and Spanish Revival houses, and the Art Deco influenced apartment houses also filled in available lot spaces between developments and made it possible for more middle-class Philadelphians to move to the area.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Elevated Rail===\nOne of West Philadelphia's most prominent features is the \"El\", or [[SEPTA]]'s [[Market-Frankford Line]] or Blue Line. Completed in 1907, this elevated subway line linked West Philadelphia, [[Millbourne (MFL station)|Millbourne]] and [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]] to Center City and then later to [[Frankford, Philadelphia|Frankford]].\n\n[[Image:MarketFrankfordLineTrain.jpg|thumb|250px|An \"El\" headed westbound from 52nd Street station headed toward 69th Street Terminal]]\nRunning above and, for a portion, under [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]], this transportation link is one of Philadelphia's two major transit lines that transport hundreds of thousands of students and workers daily into and around the city. The El once powered the economic engine of West Philadelphia.\n\nRetail districts lined every street where there was a station as well as along Market Street. Most recently many of these retail districts with the exception of [[52nd Street station (Market\u2013Frankford Line)|52nd Street]] have been converted to largely residential areas. One of the aggravating factors in this change has been the recent reconstruction of the EL which, due to detours of the \"number streets\" or numbered North-South thoroughfares and closure of large portions of Market Street, have led to many remaining businesses failing.\n\n===Light Rail===\n[[Image:4500 Baltimore Avenue.jpg|thumb|250px|SEPTA'S Route 34 trolley in the 4500 block of [[Baltimore Pike|Baltimore Avenue]].]]\nAnother major transit link in West Philadelphia are the five [[SEPTA Subway-Surface Trolley Lines|Subway Surface Lines]], often called the Green Lines for their representation on SEPTA route maps. These include five of Philadelphia's remaining six streetcar lines. Combined, these trolley routes convey more than 150,000 passengers daily, and operate 24-hour schedules, even in blizzards.\n\nThe [[SEPTA Route 10|Route 10]] trolley runs along [[Lancaster Pike|Lancaster Avenue]] from 63rd and Malvern Avenue through to 36th and Ludlow Streets where a portal allows access to the subway tunnel into Center City. The [[SEPTA Route 34|Route 34]] trolley runs along [[Baltimore Pike|Baltimore Avenue]] from [[Cobbs Creek]] at 61st Street to the transit tunnel at 40th Street in [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]]. The [[SEPTA Route 13|Route 13]] trolley runs along Chester Avenue from the transit tunnel at 40th Street and Baltimore Avenue to 67th Street where it turns off Chester Avenue and continues along PA Route 13 into [[Yeadon, Pennsylvania|Yeadon, Delaware County]] on to its terminus at Green Lane.\n\nThe [[SEPTA Route 11|Route 11]] trolley runs along Woodland Avenue from the transit tunnel at 40th Street to the city line at [[Cobbs Creek]] and continues into [[Darby, Pennsylvania|Darby Borough]]. Finally, the [[SEPTA Route 36|Route 36]] trolley is the longest trolley Green Line service. The 36 trolley leaves the 40th Street transit tunnel running along Woodland Avenue until 49th Street where it turns south to continue along Lindbergh Boulevard turning at Elmwood Avenue starting at 55th Street. Route 36 terminates in [[Southwest Philadelphia]] at Island Avenue west and 73rd Street, near the [[Philadelphia International Airport]].\n\nTwo other trolley lines originally ran through West Philly. The Route 38 trolley, running from Wynfield to Center City via Belmont Avenue, and the Route 31 trolley, running from Overbrook to Center City via Haverford Avenue, were replaced by diesel buses when the [[Philadelphia Transit Company]] transferred control of the trolley service to [[National City Lines]].\n\n===Regional Rail===\n[[Image:Regrail.jpg|thumb|250px|A SEPTA Media/Elwyn Line Silverliner IV at 30th Street Station]]West Philadelphia is also served by five of SEPTA's thirteen [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail Lines]], which transport thousands of commuters daily to and from Center City and University City, and provide a quick and inexpensive link to the Philadelphia International Airport. [All 13 serve [[30th Street Station]] on the edge of West Philadelphia.] The [[Airport Line (SEPTA)|Airport Line]] serves University City at University City Station in the University of Pennsylvania, going on to southern-most Southwest Philadelphia and the airport. The [[Media/Elwyn Line]] also serves University City and portions of Southwest Philadelphia before continuing to [[Media, Pennsylvania|Media]] and points beyond.\n\nThe Paoli/Thorndale Line serves Overbrook and Wynnefield, and continues to the [[Pennsylvania Main Line|\"Main Line\"]] communities and Paoli. However, the Paoli/Thorndale does not stop anywhere between 30th Street and City Line Avenue, instead bypassing most of West Philadelphia ever since the closure of [[52nd Street station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|52nd Street station]]. The [[Cynwyd Line]] is a limited-service express line from Center City to the Bala Cynwyd neighborhood of Lower Merion Township.\n\nMost of these passenger trips originate outside of the city, but more West Philly residents are using SEPTA's multi-ride \"Transpass\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, which allows unlimited rides on SEPTA vehicles within the city limits.\n\nCommunity groups have called on SEPTA to reopen closed Regional Rail stations in areas further away from the Market-Frankford Line and the Broad Street Line.\n\n===Streets===\nWest Philadelphia's streets are laid out in a [[Grid plan|modified grid]]. The main thoroughfare, [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]], runs East and West, paralleled to the north and south by smaller streets named for tree species. North-south streets are named for number that rise consecutively from 30th Street at the [[Schuylkill River]] to 77th Street on the far western edge near [[Cobbs Creek]] and to the block-long 90th Street in Southwest Philadelphia near the airport.\n\nThe highest numbered street to run any considerable distance contiguously is 58th Street, which runs from the northern frontier of West Philadelphia at City Avenue south to the Schuylkill River. 77th and 86th Streets run just a few blocks before they leave the city for surrounding jurisdictions. (For example, 84th Street becomes Hook Road when it crosses into Sharon Hill.)  The 77th Street in Overbrook is not contiguous with the 77th Street in the column of streets that ends with 90th Street in Southwest Philadelphia.  The two 77th Streets (as well as all numbered streets after 58th) are miles apart.\n\nThe street grid ends at Cobbs Creek Park along with the western political boundary of Philadelphia, but many of the street names and a roughly similar street grid (it begins to degrade outside the city) continue beyond the city limits into Upper Darby Township, into which Market Street runs uninterrupted to 69th street at the El terminal, where it turns into West Chester Pike and runs through Delaware County and into Chester County.  With the exception of Market Street, these streets can be regarded as being \"named after\" the streets in West Philadelphia, not continuations, as they are cut off by the park. The numbering pattern is impure; someone traveling along Market Street into Upper Darby would cross 62nd Street, then Cobbs Creek Parkway/63rd St, then several named streets until finally arriving at 69th Street, skipping 64-68.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Every day, thousands of vehicles travel this route, which is one of the major commuter routes into and out of Philadelphia from Delaware and Chester Counties. In the 1960s and 1960s, illuminated signs announced what speed to drive to travel 4.3 miles into Center City without stopping for a red light. The streets were once lined with actual American [[Chestnut]] and [[walnut]] trees that touched across the five lanes of roadway, but many were removed due to [[Chestnut blight]] and replaced with a mix of sycamore and poplar trees. City officials found these species much more tolerant of the urban environment and resistant to disease. A handful of chestnut trees remain near Cobbs Creek.\n\n[[Lancaster Avenue]] begins at 34th street near [[Drexel University]]; runs westward to the city line at [[City Avenue]]; and continues on as [[U.S. Route 30]] to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pittsburgh]]. and the [[West Virginia]] border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jflashphoto.com/LancasterAve|title=Lancaster Avenue, West Philadelphia|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> One of the major retail strips in West Philadelphia, it is lined with shops and restaurants through to 64th Street in the Wynnefield neighborhood.

Though there is no official definition of its boundaries, it is generally considered to reach from the western shore of the [[Schuylkill River]], to City Avenue to the northwest, [[Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia|Cobbs Creek]] to the southwest, and the [[SEPTA]] [[Media/Elwyn Line]] to the south.  An alternate definition includes all city land west of the Schuylkill; this would also include [[Southwest Philadelphia]] and its neighborhoods.  The eastern side of West Philadelphia is also known as [[University City, Philadelphia|University City]].\n\n==Topography==\n[[File:West Philadelphia from One Liberty Observation Deck.jpg|thumb|right|View of West Philadelphia from One Liberty Observation Deck]]\nThe topography of West Philadelphia is composed of rolling hills rising slowly from the [[Schuylkill River]] toward [[Cobbs Creek]] in the west and toward [[Belmont Plateau]] in the northwest. This gradual elevation makes the skyline of Center City visible from many points in West Philadelphia. The [[Wynnefield]] neighborhood is a location frequently used by photographers and organizers of civic events.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], 216,433 people live among the ZIP codes of 19104, 19131, 19139, 19143 and 19151.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&geo_id=86000US19104&_geoContext=01000US%7C86000US19131&_street=&_county=&_cityTown=&_state=04000US42&_zip=19104&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|title=American FactFinder - Community Facts|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200216041546/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&geo_id=86000US19104&_geoContext=01000US%7C86000US19131&_street=&_county=&_cityTown=&_state=04000US42&_zip=19104&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null:null&_keyword=&_industry=|archive-date=16 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20090604162745/http://westphillydata.library.upenn.edu/infoR_ZipCode.htm Map])\n\n===Racial demographics===\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2017}}\n* Non-Hispanic Black or African-American: 164,921 (76.2%)\n* Non-Hispanic White/European: 37,010 (17.1%)\n* Hispanic or Latino: 4,328 (2.0%)\n* American Indian: 4,112 (1.9%)\n* Asian: 3,246 (1.5%)\n* Mixed or Other: 2,813 (1.3%)\n\nStarting with the first wave of [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants in the early 19th century, West Philadelphia was home to large numbers of European immigrants and their descendants. The area's African American population began growing in the 1880s through the migration of blacks from the southern states; [[white flight]] in the early 1960s completed the transition to a majority-black population.\n\nSince the 1980s, [[gentrification]], immigration, and the [[Urban Indian]] relocation movement have brought more racial diversity. Arrivals from [[East Asia]] and [[Latin America]], mainly Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans, have given the area  small [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] and [[Asian American]] populations. The community has a fair number of [[Afro-Caribbean]]/[[Caribbean American]] residents, from the [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], [[Barbados]], and other areas of the [[West Indies]], as well as a growing number of [[African immigration to the United States|African]] immigrants.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[Image:Calvary UMC Philly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Calvary United Methodist Church, Philadelphia|Calvary United Methodist Church]], built in 1905.]]\n[[The Woodlands Cemetery]], which is located near the west bank of the Schuylkill River, was originally the estate of [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]] who bought the property in 1735 from descendants of Blockley Township's founder, William Warner, who hailed from [[Brockley]], England. Warner was the first known European west of the Schuylkill. In 1840, the property was transformed into a cemetery with an arboretum of over 1,000 trees.  It holds the graves of many famous Philadelphians.\n\n[[Satterlee Hospital]], one of the largest Union Army hospitals of the Civil War, operated from 1862 to 1865; part of its grounds are now the northern section of [[Clark Park]].\n\nWest Philadelphia's population expanded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thanks in large part to horsecars, then streetcars, and [[Schuylkill River]] bridges that allowed middle-class breadwinners to commute into the Central Business District a few miles to the east. West Philadelphia was among the early [[streetcar suburbs]], and a portion of it is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District]].\n\nThe western portion of the neighborhood was once home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country (and much striking Victorian-era architecture remains). The area has declined in prominence over the last 50 years, thanks in part to increasing crime and the migration of many middle and upper-class residents to suburbs and other sections of the city.\n\nWest Philadelphia drew national attention in 1978 and 1985 for violent clashes between police and an Afro-centric, back-to-nature group called [[MOVE]]. During the latter confrontation, police firebombed the group's headquarters, killing 11 people and destroying an entire block of Osage Avenue and Pine Street.\n\nIn recent years, parts of West Philadelphia have undergone \"Penntrification,\" a term that reflects the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s role in [[gentrification]] of the neighborhood; including a campaign to rename part of the area [[University City, Philadelphia|University City]] (the designation now appears on maps as well as public street signs and government listings). Many young professionals and families have moved into the area.\n\nIn 2008, the area around the [[Please Touch Museum]], [[Philadelphia Zoo]], and the [[Mann Music Center]] was designated the [[Centennial District, Philadelphia|Centennial District]]: an area to be revitalized by the country's 250th birthday in 2026.\n\n==Housing==\n[[Image:Queen anne house.JPG|thumb|250px|A common style of Queen Anne house with a wrap-around porch.]]\nMost of the houses in West Philadelphia are [[Terraced house|row houses]], although there are areas of [[semi-detached]] and [[Single-family detached home|detached]] houses. The earliest developments began in 1850 and the final period of mass construction ended in 1930. Development was enabled by the creation of the [[horsecar]], which pushed development to about 43rd Street, and, after the arrival of the electrified streetcar in 1892, accelerated to the west and southwest.<ref name=\"route34\">{{cite web| title =Studio 34's Eponymous Trolley, or, A Short History of Route 34| publisher =Studio 34: Yoga Healing Arts| year =2008| url =http://www.studio34yoga.com/trolley.shtml| accessdate =2008-03-11| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080709051920/http://www.studio34yoga.com/trolley.shtml| archivedate =2008-07-09}}</ref>   (See [[West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District]] and the [[Market-Frankford Line|Market Street Line]].)\n\nLargely commissioned by speculative developers and designed by some of the city's most prolific architects, they were purchased by industrial managers and other professionals who led the first movement of upper and [[middle class]] from the more crowded city center. Developers found they could increase profits by catering to this emerging group, shrinking lot sizes, and building more compact, less ornate houses.\n\n[[Image:Brick twin in WPhilly.JPG|thumb|250px|Twin rowhouse, typical of West Philadelphia neighborhoods.]]\n[[Image:Common brick rowhouse multiunit.jpg|thumb|250px|Multi-unit rowhouse, the most common style of rowhouse in West Philadelphia.]]\nInitial development was divided into block lots and sold in 1852 with the condition that \"substantial stone or brick buildings\" be erected. The houses in this grouping are primarily three-story Italianate buildings, linked by material, decorative detail, and form. Located around Chester Avenue, an additional but smaller and less ornate 16 Italianate, brownstone, semi-detached houses, similar in form to the initial houses. The [[setback (land use)|setback]] of these houses was 25 feet, allowing generous front yards.\n\nAnother development on Locust Street, a project by banker and West Philly resident [[Clarence Howard Clark]], was composed of three-story, two-bay, brick, restrained [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] rowhouses. The street was unified by front yards, and enclosed by decorative iron fences. The houses melded the suburban principles of front porches and greenspace with the urban rowhouse form, producing profitable, yet desirable, middle-class suburban housing.\n\nOther developments introduced [[urban density]] and architectural uniformity: the Queen Anne style with columned porches and decorative spindlework, brickwork and corbelling; steeply pitched gables with fishscale slate shingles; turrets; balconies; and windows with a single pane surrounded by small panes. These houses are typical of the early 20th-century developments in West Philadelphia, and are unified by rhythmic patterning of porch and gable features. The second story, projecting, semi-hexagonal bay is incorporated into this design, an element which defines the later rowhouses.\n\nThe western reaches of West Philadelphia included miles of two-story rowhouses with bay windows above classical columned front porches. What resulted was a collection of [[Colonial Revival]] houses with [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] influences, which reflect the sophisticated tastes of post-[[World War I]] Philadelphians. For the first time in West Philadelphia, houses had garages. Later Tudor and Spanish Revival houses, and the Art Deco influenced apartment houses also filled in available lot spaces between developments and made it possible for more middle-class Philadelphians to move to the area.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Elevated Rail===\nOne of West Philadelphia's most prominent features is the \"El\", or [[SEPTA]]'s [[Market-Frankford Line]] or Blue Line. Completed in 1907, this elevated subway line linked West Philadelphia, [[Millbourne (MFL station)|Millbourne]] and [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]] to Center City and then later to [[Frankford, Philadelphia|Frankford]].\n\n[[Image:MarketFrankfordLineTrain.jpg|thumb|250px|An \"El\" headed westbound from 52nd Street station headed toward 69th Street Terminal]]\nRunning above and, for a portion, under [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]], this transportation link is one of Philadelphia's two major transit lines that transport hundreds of thousands of students and workers daily into and around the city. The El once powered the economic engine of West Philadelphia.\n\nRetail districts lined every street where there was a station as well as along Market Street. Most recently many of these retail districts with the exception of [[52nd Street station (Market\u2013Frankford Line)|52nd Street]] have been converted to largely residential areas. One of the aggravating factors in this change has been the recent reconstruction of the EL which, due to detours of the \"number streets\" or numbered North-South thoroughfares and closure of large portions of Market Street, have led to many remaining businesses failing.\n\n===Light Rail===\n[[Image:4500 Baltimore Avenue.jpg|thumb|250px|SEPTA'S Route 34 trolley in the 4500 block of [[Baltimore Pike|Baltimore Avenue]].]]\nAnother major transit link in West Philadelphia are the five [[SEPTA Subway-Surface Trolley Lines|Subway Surface Lines]], often called the Green Lines for their representation on SEPTA route maps. These include five of Philadelphia's remaining six streetcar lines. Combined, these trolley routes convey more than 150,000 passengers daily, and operate 24-hour schedules, even in blizzards.\n\nThe [[SEPTA Route 10|Route 10]] trolley runs along [[Lancaster Pike|Lancaster Avenue]] from 63rd and Malvern Avenue through to 36th and Ludlow Streets where a portal allows access to the subway tunnel into Center City. The [[SEPTA Route 34|Route 34]] trolley runs along [[Baltimore Pike|Baltimore Avenue]] from [[Cobbs Creek]] at 61st Street to the transit tunnel at 40th Street in [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]]. The [[SEPTA Route 13|Route 13]] trolley runs along Chester Avenue from the transit tunnel at 40th Street and Baltimore Avenue to 67th Street where it turns off Chester Avenue and continues along PA Route 13 into [[Yeadon, Pennsylvania|Yeadon, Delaware County]] on to its terminus at Green Lane.\n\nThe [[SEPTA Route 11|Route 11]] trolley runs along Woodland Avenue from the transit tunnel at 40th Street to the city line at [[Cobbs Creek]] and continues into [[Darby, Pennsylvania|Darby Borough]]. Finally, the [[SEPTA Route 36|Route 36]] trolley is the longest trolley Green Line service. The 36 trolley leaves the 40th Street transit tunnel running along Woodland Avenue until 49th Street where it turns south to continue along Lindbergh Boulevard turning at Elmwood Avenue starting at 55th Street. Route 36 terminates in [[Southwest Philadelphia]] at Island Avenue west and 73rd Street, near the [[Philadelphia International Airport]].\n\nTwo other trolley lines originally ran through West Philly. The Route 38 trolley, running from Wynfield to Center City via Belmont Avenue, and the Route 31 trolley, running from Overbrook to Center City via Haverford Avenue, were replaced by diesel buses when the [[Philadelphia Transit Company]] transferred control of the trolley service to [[National City Lines]].\n\n===Regional Rail===\n[[Image:Regrail.jpg|thumb|250px|A SEPTA Media/Elwyn Line Silverliner IV at 30th Street Station]]West Philadelphia is also served by five of SEPTA's thirteen [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail Lines]], which transport thousands of commuters daily to and from Center City and University City, and provide a quick and inexpensive link to the Philadelphia International Airport. [All 13 serve [[30th Street Station]] on the edge of West Philadelphia.] The [[Airport Line (SEPTA)|Airport Line]] serves University City at University City Station in the University of Pennsylvania, going on to southern-most Southwest Philadelphia and the airport. The [[Media/Elwyn Line]] also serves University City and portions of Southwest Philadelphia before continuing to [[Media, Pennsylvania|Media]] and points beyond.\n\nThe Paoli/Thorndale Line serves Overbrook and Wynnefield, and continues to the [[Pennsylvania Main Line|\"Main Line\"]] communities and Paoli. However, the Paoli/Thorndale does not stop anywhere between 30th Street and City Line Avenue, instead bypassing most of West Philadelphia ever since the closure of [[52nd Street station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|52nd Street station]]. The [[Cynwyd Line]] is a limited-service express line from Center City to the Bala Cynwyd neighborhood of Lower Merion Township.\n\nMost of these passenger trips originate outside of the city, but more West Philly residents are using SEPTA's multi-ride \"Transpass\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, which allows unlimited rides on SEPTA vehicles within the city limits.\n\nCommunity groups have called on SEPTA to reopen closed Regional Rail stations in areas further away from the Market-Frankford Line and the Broad Street Line.\n\n===Streets===\nWest Philadelphia's streets are laid out in a [[Grid plan|modified grid]]. The main thoroughfare, [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]], runs East and West, paralleled to the north and south by smaller streets named for tree species. North-south streets are named for number that rise consecutively from 30th Street at the [[Schuylkill River]] to 77th Street on the far western edge near [[Cobbs Creek]] and to the block-long 90th Street in Southwest Philadelphia near the airport.\n\nThe highest numbered street to run any considerable distance contiguously is 58th Street, which runs from the northern frontier of West Philadelphia at City Avenue south to the Schuylkill River. 77th and 86th Streets run just a few blocks before they leave the city for surrounding jurisdictions. (For example, 84th Street becomes Hook Road when it crosses into Sharon Hill.)  The 77th Street in Overbrook is not contiguous with the 77th Street in the column of streets that ends with 90th Street in Southwest Philadelphia.  The two 77th Streets (as well as all numbered streets after 58th) are miles apart.\n\nThe street grid ends at Cobbs Creek Park along with the western political boundary of Philadelphia, but many of the street names and a roughly similar street grid (it begins to degrade outside the city) continue beyond the city limits into Upper Darby Township, into which Market Street runs uninterrupted to 69th street at the El terminal, where it turns into West Chester Pike and runs through Delaware County and into Chester County.  With the exception of Market Street, these streets can be regarded as being \"named after\" the streets in West Philadelphia, not continuations, as they are cut off by the park. The numbering pattern is impure; someone traveling along Market Street into Upper Darby would cross 62nd Street, then Cobbs Creek Parkway/63rd St, then several named streets until finally arriving at 69th Street, skipping 64-68.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Every day, thousands of vehicles travel this route, which is one of the major commuter routes into and out of Philadelphia from Delaware and Chester Counties. In the 1960s and 1960s, illuminated signs announced what speed to drive to travel 4.3 miles into Center City without stopping for a red light. The streets were once lined with actual American [[Chestnut]] and [[walnut]] trees that touched across the five lanes of roadway, but many were removed due to [[Chestnut blight]] and replaced with a mix of sycamore and poplar trees. City officials found these species much more tolerant of the urban environment and resistant to disease. A handful of chestnut trees remain near Cobbs Creek.\n\n[[Lancaster Avenue]] begins at 34th street near [[Drexel University]]; runs westward to the city line at [[City Avenue]]; and continues on as [[U.S. Route 30]] to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pittsburgh]]. and the [[West Virginia]] border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jflashphoto.com/LancasterAve|title=Lancaster Avenue, West Philadelphia|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> One of the major retail strips in West Philadelphia, it is lined with shops and restaurants through to 64th Street in the Wynnefield neighborhood.

The prime minister is [[Imperial Investiture|appointed]] by the [[Emperor of Japan]] after being designated by the [[National Diet]] and must enjoy the [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] to remain in office. He is the head of the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] and appoints and dismisses the other [[Minister of State|ministers of state]]. The literal translation of the Japanese name for the office is ''Minister for the Comprehensive Administration of (''or'' the Presidency over) the Cabinet''.\n\n== History ==\nBefore the adoption of the [[Meiji Constitution]], Japan had in practice no written [[constitution]]. Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system known as ''[[ritsury\u014d]]'' was enacted in the late [[Asuka period]] and early [[Nara period]]. It described a government based on an elaborate and rational [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] bureaucracy, serving, in theory, under the ultimate authority of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]; although in practice, real power was often held elsewhere, such as in the hands of the [[Fujiwara clan]], who intermarried with the [[Imperial House of Japan |Imperial Family]] in the [[Heian period]], or by the ruling ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. Theoretically, the last ''ritsury\u014d'' code, the [[Y\u014dr\u014d Code]] enacted in 752, was still in force at the time of the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nUnder this system, the {{Nihongo|''[[Daij\u014d-daijin]]''|\u592a\u653f\u5927\u81e3||Chancellor of the Realm}}<ref>''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', Kenkyusha Limited, {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}</ref> was the head of the ''[[Daij\u014d-kan]]'' (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan's pre-modern Imperial government during the [[Heian period]] and until briefly under the [[Meiji Constitution]] with the appointment of [[Sanj\u014d Sanetomi]] in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] to the new position of Prime Minister,<ref>Legal framework for Prime Minister and Cabinet in the Empire: [http://dajokan.ndl.go.jp/SearchSys/Details.pl?ID=01701439&FLKEY=0026561378456292 Daj\u014dkan proclamation No. 69 of December 22, 1885 (\u5185\u95a3\u8077\u6a29, ''naikaku shokken'')], later replaced by [http://hourei.ndl.go.jp/SearchSys/viewEnkaku.do?i=gaKY08sYF4fjXji9%2fGm3mg%3d%3d Imperial edict No. 135 of 1889 (\u5185\u95a3\u5b98\u5236, ''naikaku kansei'')] in effect until 1947</ref> four years before the enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution]], which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly.<ref>Article 55 of the Imperial Constitution only bound the ministers of state, i.e. all members of the cabinet including the prime minister, to \"give their advice to the Emperor and be responsible for it.\"</ref><ref>[[Kantei]]: [http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/cabinet_system/index.html Cabinet System of Japan]</ref> It took its current form with the adoption of the [[Constitution of Japan]] in 1947.\n\nTo date, 62 people have served this position. [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] was the current prime minister. He re-took the office on December 26, 2012. He is the first former Prime Minister to return to office since 1948, and the [[List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Japan#Rank_by_length_of_total_tenures|longest serving Prime Minister to date]].\n\n==Appointment==\nThe Prime Minister is designated by both houses of the [[National Diet|Diet]], before the conduct of any other business. For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the [[Two-round system|run-off]] system. If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common candidate. Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree within ten days, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any Prime Minister it wants.<ref>Article 67 of the [[Constitution of Japan]]</ref> The candidate is then presented with his or her commission, and formally [[Imperial Investiture|appointed]] to office by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]].<ref>Article 6 of the [[Constitution of Japan]]</ref> \n\nIn practice, the Prime Minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition.\n\n==Qualifications==\n* Must be a member of either house of the Diet. (This implies a minimum age of 25 and a Japanese nationality requirement.)\n* Must be a \"civilian\". This excludes serving members of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]. Former military persons may be appointed prime minister despite the \"civilian\" requirement, [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] being one prominent example.\n\n==Role==\n\n===Constitutional roles===\n* Exercises \"control and supervision\" over the entire executive branch.<ref>Article 5 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Presents bills to the Diet on behalf of the Cabinet.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Article 72 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Signs laws and Cabinet orders (along with other members of the Cabinet).<ref>Article 74 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Appoints all Cabinet ministers, and can dismiss them at any time.<ref>Article 68 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* May permit legal action to be taken against Cabinet ministers.<ref>Article 75 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Must make reports on domestic and foreign relations to the Diet.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Must report to the Diet upon demand to provide answers or explanations.<ref>Article 63 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* May advise the Emperor to dissolve the Diet's House of Representatives.<ref>Article 7 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n\n===Statutory roles===\n* Presides over meetings of the Cabinet.<ref>Cabinet Act2012, article 4</ref>\n* [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]].<ref>Self-Defense Forces Act of 1954</ref>\n* May override a court injunction against an administrative act upon showing of cause.<ref>[[Administrative Litigation Act]], article 27</ref>\n\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the Prime Minister is both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the Prime Minister is the leader. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of [[cabinet collective responsibility]], the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the Prime Minister's authority.\n\n==Insignia==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Standard of the Prime Minister of Japan.svg|Standard of the Prime Minister\nFile:Emblem of the Prime Minister of Japan.svg|[[Government Emblem of Japan|Emblem of the Prime Minister]]\nFile:Go-shichi no kiri crest 2.svg|Mon (crest) of the Prime Minister\n</gallery>\n\n== Official office and residence==\n[[File:Soridaijinkantei2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Kantei, the [[Prime Minister's Official Residence (Japan)|Prime Minister's Official Residence]]]]\n\nLocated near the Diet building, the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan is called the {{Nihongo|''[[Kantei]]''|\u5b98\u90b8}}.

Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of [[count]], [[viscount]] or [[baron]], depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the Prime Minister. The two highest ranks, [[marquess]] and [[prince]], were only bestowed upon highly distinguished statesmen, and were not granted to a Prime Minister after 1928. The last Prime Minister who was a peer was Baron [[Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara]], who served as Prime Minister from October 1945 to May 1946. The peerage was abolished when the [[Constitution of Japan]] came into effect in May 1947.\n\nCertain eminent Prime Ministers have been awarded the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], typically in the degree of Grand Cordon. The highest honour in the Japanese honours system, the Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, has only been conferred upon select Prime Ministers and eminent statesmen; the last such award to a living Prime Minister was to [[Saionji Kinmochi]] in 1928. More often, the Order of the Chrysanthemum has been a posthumous distinction; the Collar of the order was last awarded posthumously to former Prime Minister [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] in June 1975. The Grand Cordon has typically been posthumously awarded; the most recent such award was to [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]] in July 2006.\n\nAfter relinquishing office, the Prime Minister is normally accorded the second or senior third rank in the court order of precedence, and is usually raised to the senior second rank posthumously. Certain distinguished Prime Ministers have been posthumously raised to the first rank; the last such award was to Sato Eisaku in 1975. Since the 1920s, following their tenure in office, Prime Ministers have typically been conferred with the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Paulownia Flowers]] (until 2003 a special higher class of the Order of the Rising Sun), depending on tenure and eminence. However, honours may be withheld due to misconduct or refusal on the part of the Prime Minister (for example, [[Kiichi Miyazawa]]).\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of prime ministers of Japan]]\n*[[List of Japanese prime ministers by longevity]]\n*[[Official state car#Japan|Official state car]]\n*[[Air transports of heads of state and government#Japan|Air transports of heads of state and government]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* ''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', Kenkyusha Limited, Tokyo 1991, {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Prime ministers of Japan}}\n*[http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/index-e.html Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet] Official website\n*[http://www.geocities.co.jp/WallStreet-Bull/6515/rekidaiNaikaku.htm List of Japanese cabinets 1885 to 1989]\u3000{{in lang|ja}}\nhttps://danganronpa.fandom.com/wiki/Junko_Enoshima president of japan\n\n{{Japan topics}}\n{{Prime Ministers of Japan}}\n{{Prime Minister}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prime Minister Of Japan}}\n[[Category:Politics of Japan]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Japan| ]]\n[[Category:1885 establishments in Japan]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|a list of Japanese Prime Ministers|List of prime ministers of Japan}}\n{{short description|Head of government of Japan}}\n{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Infobox Political post\n| post = Prime Minister\n| body = Japan<br>{{nobold|{{lang|ja|\u5185\u95a3\u7dcf\u7406\u5927\u81e3}}}}\n| insignia = Emblem of the Prime Minister of Japan.svg\n| insigniasize = 150\n| insigniacaption = Emblem of the Prime Minister of Japan\n| image = File:Shinz\u014d Abe Official.jpg\n| imagesize = \n| incumbent = [[Shinzo Abe]]\n| incumbentsince = 26 December 2012\n| residence = [[Prime Minister's Official Residence (Japan)|Kantei]]\n| style = [[Excellency|His Excellency]]\n| nominator = [[National Diet]]\n| appointer = HM [[Emperor of Japan|The Emperor]]\n| termlength = Four years or fewer, renewable indefinitely.{{efn|The Cabinet shall resign en masse after a general election of members of the House of Representatives.

The prime minister is [[Imperial Investiture|appointed]] by the [[Emperor of Japan]] after being designated by the [[National Diet]] and must enjoy the [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] to remain in office. He is the head of the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] and appoints and dismisses the other [[Minister of State|ministers of state]]. The literal translation of the Japanese name for the office is ''Minister for the Comprehensive Administration of (''or'' the Presidency over) the Cabinet''.\n\n== History ==\nBefore the adoption of the [[Meiji Constitution]], Japan had in practice no written [[constitution]]. Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system known as ''[[ritsury\u014d]]'' was enacted in the late [[Asuka period]] and early [[Nara period]]. It described a government based on an elaborate and rational [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] bureaucracy, serving, in theory, under the ultimate authority of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]; although in practice, real power was often held elsewhere, such as in the hands of the [[Fujiwara clan]], who intermarried with the [[Imperial House of Japan |Imperial Family]] in the [[Heian period]], or by the ruling ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. Theoretically, the last ''ritsury\u014d'' code, the [[Y\u014dr\u014d Code]] enacted in 752, was still in force at the time of the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nUnder this system, the {{Nihongo|''[[Daij\u014d-daijin]]''|\u592a\u653f\u5927\u81e3||Chancellor of the Realm}}<ref>''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', Kenkyusha Limited, {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}</ref> was the head of the ''[[Daij\u014d-kan]]'' (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan's pre-modern Imperial government during the [[Heian period]] and until briefly under the [[Meiji Constitution]] with the appointment of [[Sanj\u014d Sanetomi]] in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of [[It\u014d Hirobumi]] to the new position of Prime Minister,<ref>Legal framework for Prime Minister and Cabinet in the Empire: [http://dajokan.ndl.go.jp/SearchSys/Details.pl?ID=01701439&FLKEY=0026561378456292 Daj\u014dkan proclamation No. 69 of December 22, 1885 (\u5185\u95a3\u8077\u6a29, ''naikaku shokken'')], later replaced by [http://hourei.ndl.go.jp/SearchSys/viewEnkaku.do?i=gaKY08sYF4fjXji9%2fGm3mg%3d%3d Imperial edict No. 135 of 1889 (\u5185\u95a3\u5b98\u5236, ''naikaku kansei'')] in effect until 1947</ref> four years before the enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution]], which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly.<ref>Article 55 of the Imperial Constitution only bound the ministers of state, i.e. all members of the cabinet including the prime minister, to \"give their advice to the Emperor and be responsible for it.\"</ref><ref>[[Kantei]]: [http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/cabinet_system/index.html Cabinet System of Japan]</ref> It took its current form with the adoption of the [[Constitution of Japan]] in 1947.\n\nTo date, 62 people have served this position. [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] was the current prime minister. He re-took the office on December 26, 2012. He is the first former Prime Minister to return to office since 1948, and the [[List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Japan#Rank_by_length_of_total_tenures|longest serving Prime Minister to date]].\n\n==Appointment==\nThe Prime Minister is designated by both houses of the [[National Diet|Diet]], before the conduct of any other business. For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the [[Two-round system|run-off]] system. If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common candidate. Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree within ten days, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any Prime Minister it wants.<ref>Article 67 of the [[Constitution of Japan]]</ref> The candidate is then presented with his or her commission, and formally [[Imperial Investiture|appointed]] to office by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]].<ref>Article 6 of the [[Constitution of Japan]]</ref> \n\nIn practice, the Prime Minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition.\n\n==Qualifications==\n* Must be a member of either house of the Diet. (This implies a minimum age of 25 and a Japanese nationality requirement.)\n* Must be a \"civilian\". This excludes serving members of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]. Former military persons may be appointed prime minister despite the \"civilian\" requirement, [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] being one prominent example.\n\n==Role==\n\n===Constitutional roles===\n* Exercises \"control and supervision\" over the entire executive branch.<ref>Article 5 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Presents bills to the Diet on behalf of the Cabinet.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Article 72 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Signs laws and Cabinet orders (along with other members of the Cabinet).<ref>Article 74 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Appoints all Cabinet ministers, and can dismiss them at any time.<ref>Article 68 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* May permit legal action to be taken against Cabinet ministers.<ref>Article 75 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* Must make reports on domestic and foreign relations to the Diet.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Must report to the Diet upon demand to provide answers or explanations.<ref>Article 63 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n* May advise the Emperor to dissolve the Diet's House of Representatives.<ref>Article 7 of the Constitution of Japan</ref>\n\n===Statutory roles===\n* Presides over meetings of the Cabinet.<ref>Cabinet Act2012, article 4</ref>\n* [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]].<ref>Self-Defense Forces Act of 1954</ref>\n* May override a court injunction against an administrative act upon showing of cause.<ref>[[Administrative Litigation Act]], article 27</ref>\n\nUnlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the Prime Minister is both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the Prime Minister is the leader. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of [[cabinet collective responsibility]], the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the Prime Minister's authority.\n\n==Insignia==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Standard of the Prime Minister of Japan.svg|Standard of the Prime Minister\nFile:Emblem of the Prime Minister of Japan.svg|[[Government Emblem of Japan|Emblem of the Prime Minister]]\nFile:Go-shichi no kiri crest 2.svg|Mon (crest) of the Prime Minister\n</gallery>\n\n== Official office and residence==\n[[File:Soridaijinkantei2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Kantei, the [[Prime Minister's Official Residence (Japan)|Prime Minister's Official Residence]]]]\n\nLocated near the Diet building, the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan is called the {{Nihongo|''[[Kantei]]''|\u5b98\u90b8}}.
