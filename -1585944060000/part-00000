{"title_page": "Music of Poland", "text_new": "The '''Music of Poland''' covers diverse aspects of music and musical traditions which have originated, and are practiced in [[Poland]]. Artists from Poland include world-famous [[classical music|classical]] [[composers]] like [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Karol Szymanowski]] and [[Henryk G\u00f3recki]]; renowned pianists like [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], and [[Krystian Zimerman]]; as well as [[popular music]] artists, and traditional, regionalised [[folk music]] ensembles that create a rich and lively music scene at the grassroots level. The musicians of Poland, over the course of history, have developed and popularized a variety of [[music genres]] and [[folk dances]] such as [[mazurka]], [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], [[krakowiak]], [[Polska (dance)|polska]] [[partner dance]], [[oberek]]; as well as the [[sung poetry]] genre (''poezja \u015bpiewana'') and others.\n\nPolish music exhibits influences from a broad variety of [[world music]] styles which are represented by critically acclaimed [[singer-songwriter]]s and [[pop icon]]s including [[Margaret (singer)|Margaret]], [[Maria Peszek]], [[Myslovitz]], [[Edyta Bartosiewicz]], [[Doda (singer)|Doda]]; as well as [[jazz music]]ians [[Tomasz Sta\u0144ko]], [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[W\u0142odek Pawlik]], [[Adam Makowicz]], [[Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer]], [[Micha\u0142 Urbaniak]]; [[death metal|death]] and [[black metal]] music bands [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]], [[Vader (band)|Vader]], [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]];Hate along with prog rock SBB, Riverside, [[film music|film]] and [[contemporary classical music]] composers [[Wojciech Kilar]], [[Jan A.P. Kaczmarek]], [[Zbigniew Preisner]], [[Abel Korzeniowski]], [[Krzesimir D\u0119bski]], and [[Krzysztof Meyer]] among many others.\n\n==Medieval and renaissance music==\n[[File:Martinus Leopolita.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Marcin Leopolita]], c. 1570]]\n\nThe origin of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century, from which manuscripts have been found in [[Stary S\u0105cz]], containing [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions related to the Parisian [[Notre Dame School]]. Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'', may also date back to this period. The first known notable composer, [[Miko\u0142aj z Radomia]], lived in the 15th century.\n\nDuring the 16th century, mostly two musical ensembles \u2013 both based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and belonging to the [[King of Poland|King]] and the [[Archbishop]] of [[Wawel]] \u2013 led the rapid innovation of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include [[Wac\u0142aw z Szamotu\u0142]], [[Miko\u0142aj Ziele\u0144ski]], [[Nicolaus Cracoviensis]], [[Marcin Leopolita]] and [[Miko\u0142aj Gom\u00f3\u0142ka]], who composed \"Melodies to Polish Psalter\". [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf |title=The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas |work=www.semper.pl |page=244 |accessdate=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7rxPZrB?url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Strona tytu\u0142owa Melodii na Psalterz polski Miko\u0142aja Gom\u00f3\u0142ki.jpg|thumb|left|Cover page of the ''\"Melodies for the Polish Psalter\"'' composed by [[Miko\u0142aj Gom\u00f3\u0142ka]], 1580]]\n\n==Baroque music==\n\nDuring the 17th century, Polish composers from this period focused on [[baroque]] religious music, [[concerto]]s for voices, instruments, and [[basso continuo]], a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The most renowned composer of this period is [[Adam Jarz\u0119bski]], known for his instrumental works such as ''Chromatica'', ''Tamburetta'', ''Sentinella'', ''Bentrovata'', and ''Nova Casa''. Other composers include [[Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki]], [[Franciszek Lilius]], [[Bart\u0142omiej P\u0119kiel]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Sylwester Szarzy\u0144ski]] and [[Marcin Mielczewski]]. Also, in the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]]. These included [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Giovanni Francesco Anerio]], and [[Marco Scacchi]].\n\nIn addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of ''Galatea'' (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy.  Shortly after this performance, the court produced [[Francesca Caccini]]'s opera ''[[La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d\u2019Alcina]]'', which she had written for Prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] three years earlier when he was in Italy.  Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman.  When W\u0142adys\u0142aw was king (as W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art.  The composers of these operas are not known:  they may have been Poles working under [http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Marco_Scacchi Marco Scacchi] in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by W\u0142adys\u0142aw.\n\n==Classical and romantic music==\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], 1838]]\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the [[Polonaise (dance)|Polonaise]] and [[Mazurka]] \u2014 perhaps the first distinctively Polish [[art music]]. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]], [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]], [[Juliusz Zar\u0119bski]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]], and, most famously, [[Fryderyk Chopin]]. Chopin remains very well known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including [[mazurka]]s, [[nocturne]]s, [[waltz]]es and [[concerto]]s, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces.  The same period saw [[Stanislaw Moniuszko|Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]], the leading individual in the successful development of [[Polish opera]], still renowned for operas like ''[[Halka]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Manor]]''. The first national [[opera]], ''[[:pl:Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale|Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale]]'' written by [[Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski]] and [[:pl:Jan Stefani|Jan Stefani]] premiered on 1 March 1794. In the 19th century the most popular composers were [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]], [[Franciszek Lessel]], and [[Ignacy Dobrzy\u0144ski]]. Important opera composers were [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]]. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most prominent composers were [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u017bele\u0144ski (musician)|W\u0142adys\u0142aw Zele\u0144ski]] and [[Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz]]. [[Karol Szymanowski]] gained prominence prior to World War II. [[J\u00f3zef Koffler]] was the first Polish [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone composer]] (dodecaphonist).\n\n===Contemporary classical music===\n[[File:Wojciech Kilar 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wojciech Kilar]], classical and film music composer in 2006]]\nBetween the wars, a group of new and emerging composers formed the Association of Young Polish Musicians; which included future luminaries [[Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz]], [[Zygmunt Mycielski]], [[Micha\u0142 Spisak]] and [[Tadeusz Szeligowski]].<ref name=\"Erhardt\">{{cite book |trans-title=50 lat Zwi\u0105zku Kompozytor\u00f3w Polskich |title=Fifty Years of the Polish Composers' Association |author=Ludwik Erhardt |publisher=Warszawa : Zwi\u0105zek Kompozytor\u00f3w Polskich |year=1995 |OCLC=271705498 |work=[in:] Composing the Party Line: Music and Politics in Early Cold War Poland By David G.

Following the fall of communism it was bought by Warner Music Poland. It dealt with the wide range of music tastes, folk, popular, classical and children's music.\n\n==Traditional folk music==\nPolish [[folk music]] was collected in the 19th century by [[Oskar Kolberg]], as part of a wave of Polish [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]].{{r|Broughton2000}} After [[World War II]], in the [[Polish People's Republic]], folk traditions were commonly cultivated, but public performances and broadcasts had also highly organized and officially promoted forms. State-supported, large-scale folk ensembles became prominent.{{r|Broughton2000}} The most famous of these were [[Mazowsze (folk group)|Mazowsze]] and [[\u015al\u0105sk Song and Dance Ensemble|\u015al\u0105sk]], both of which still perform. Though such bands presented interpretations of regional folk repertoire, the overall sound was a homogenized mixture of Polish styles. There were more authentic groups, such as [[S\u0142owianki]], but the sanitized image of folk music made the whole field unattractive to some audiences, and many traditions dwindled rapidly.\n\nPolish dance music, especially the [[mazurka]] and [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], were popularized by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere.{{r|Broughton2000}} These are triple time dances, while five-beat forms are more common in the northeast and duple-time dances like the [[krakowiak]] come from the south. The 'polonaise' comes from the French word for 'Polish' used to identify its origin among the Polish aristocracy who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called ''chodzony''.{{r|Broughton2000}} The polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life, and became an integral part of the Polish music.\n\n===Podhale===\nWhile folk music lost popularity in Poland, especially in urban areas, the tourist destination of [[Podhale]] has retained its traditions lively.{{r|Broughton2000}} The regional capital, [[Zakopane]], has been a center for art since the late 19th century, when people like composer [[Karol Szymanowski]], who discovered Goral folk music there, made the area chic among Europe's intellectuals.{{r|Broughton2000}} Though a part of Poland, Podhale's musical life is more closely related to that found in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] mountains of Ukraine, Slovakia, Moravia in Czech Republic and [[Transylvania]].\n\nLocal ensembles use [[string instrument]]s like [[violin]]s and a [[cello]] to play distinctive scales with augumented fourth, mainly the [[lydian mode]] and [[acoustic scale]], in Poland called ''skala podhala\u0144ska'' (. The distinctive singing style used in this scale is called ''lidyzowanie''. The lead violin (''prym'') are accompanied by several second violins (''sekund'') and a three-stringed cello (''basy'').{{r|Broughton2000}} Duple-time dances like the ''krzesany'', ''zb\u00f3jnicki'' (the Brigand's Dance) and ''ozwodna'' are popular.  The ozwodna has a five-bar melodic structure which is quite unusual. The krzesany is an extremely swift dance, while the zb\u00f3jnicki is well-known and is perceived as being most \"typical\" of Podhale and Northern Slovakia. Folk songs typically focus on heroes like [[Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk]].<ref name=\"Broughton2000\">Broughton, Simon (2000), \"Hanging on in the Highlands\".

These events often attract more than 250,000 people and are comparable to the gatherings in [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] and [[Roskilde]].\n\nIn jazz music, Polish musicians created a specific style, which was most famous in 60s and 70s. Some famous Polish jazz artists are: [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski]], [[Adam Makowicz]], [[Tomasz Sta\u0144ko]], [[Micha\u0142 Urbaniak]], [[Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer]].

One of the first Polish black metal bands, founded in late 1979, was [[Kat (band)|Kat]] from Katowice, which was originally classified as thrash, and heavy metal. Kat was big influence on the whole Polish heavy metal music, developing their harsh sound with straightforward satanic lyrics, and later were heavily inspired by the poetry of [[Tadeusz Mici\u0144ski]].

Artrosis quickly reached popularity in Poland with albums released by local label Morbid Noizz Productions. In the late 1990s Artrosis became subject of interest from [[Tilo Wolff]]s label Hall of Sermon witch released English version of one of their albums. Band reached its popularity in the early 2000s with a contract from Metal Mind Productions. Till 2011 band released seven Polish and four English language albums remaining active.

Only UnSun reached international acclaim with a recording deal from [[Century Media Records]], and albums charting in Japan, although after two albums released the group went on hiatus due to problems with vocalist health.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Polish composers]]\n* [[Culture of Poland]]\n* [[History of music]]\n* [[Classical music]]\n* [[Popular music]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Broughton, Simon. \"Hanging on in the Highlands\". 2000.

Artists from Poland include world-famous [[classical music|classical]] [[composers]] like [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Karol Szymanowski]] and [[Henryk G\u00f3recki]]; renowned pianists like [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], and [[Krystian Zimerman]]; as well as [[popular music]] artists, and traditional, regionalised [[folk music]] ensembles that create a rich and lively music scene at the grassroots level. The musicians of Poland, over the course of history, have developed and popularized a variety of [[music genres]] and [[folk dances]] such as [[mazurka]], [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], [[krakowiak]], [[Polska (dance)|polska]] [[partner dance]], [[oberek]]; as well as the [[sung poetry]] genre (''poezja \u015bpiewana'') and others.\n\nPolish music exhibits influences from a broad variety of [[world music]] styles which are represented by critically acclaimed [[singer-songwriter]]s and [[pop icon]]s including [[Margaret (singer)|Margaret]], [[Maria Peszek]], [[Myslovitz]], [[Edyta Bartosiewicz]], [[Doda (singer)|Doda]]; as well as [[jazz music]]ians [[Tomasz Sta\u0144ko]], [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[W\u0142odek Pawlik]], [[Adam Makowicz]], [[Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer]], [[Micha\u0142 Urbaniak]]; [[death metal|death]] and [[black metal]] music bands [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]], [[Vader (band)|Vader]], [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]]; along with [[film music|film]] and [[contemporary classical music]] composers [[Wojciech Kilar]], [[Jan A.P. Kaczmarek]], [[Zbigniew Preisner]], [[Abel Korzeniowski]], [[Krzesimir D\u0119bski]], and [[Krzysztof Meyer]] among many others.\n\n==Medieval and renaissance music==\n[[File:Martinus Leopolita.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Marcin Leopolita]], c. 1570]]\n\nThe origin of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century, from which manuscripts have been found in [[Stary S\u0105cz]], containing [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions related to the Parisian [[Notre Dame School]]. Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'', may also date back to this period. The first known notable composer, [[Miko\u0142aj z Radomia]], lived in the 15th century.\n\nDuring the 16th century, mostly two musical ensembles \u2013 both based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and belonging to the [[King of Poland|King]] and the [[Archbishop]] of [[Wawel]] \u2013 led the rapid innovation of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include [[Wac\u0142aw z Szamotu\u0142]], [[Miko\u0142aj Ziele\u0144ski]], [[Nicolaus Cracoviensis]], [[Marcin Leopolita]] and [[Miko\u0142aj Gom\u00f3\u0142ka]], who composed \"Melodies to Polish Psalter\". [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf |title=The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas |work=www.semper.pl |page=244 |accessdate=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7rxPZrB?url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Strona tytu\u0142owa Melodii na Psalterz polski Miko\u0142aja Gom\u00f3\u0142ki.jpg|thumb|left|Cover page of the ''\"Melodies for the Polish Psalter\"'' composed by [[Miko\u0142aj Gom\u00f3\u0142ka]], 1580]]\n\n==Baroque music==\n\nDuring the 17th century, Polish composers from this period focused on [[baroque]] religious music, [[concerto]]s for voices, instruments, and [[basso continuo]], a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The most renowned composer of this period is [[Adam Jarz\u0119bski]], known for his instrumental works such as ''Chromatica'', ''Tamburetta'', ''Sentinella'', ''Bentrovata'', and ''Nova Casa''. Other composers include [[Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki]], [[Franciszek Lilius]], [[Bart\u0142omiej P\u0119kiel]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Sylwester Szarzy\u0144ski]] and [[Marcin Mielczewski]]. Also, in the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]]. These included [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Giovanni Francesco Anerio]], and [[Marco Scacchi]].\n\nIn addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of ''Galatea'' (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy.  Shortly after this performance, the court produced [[Francesca Caccini]]'s opera ''[[La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d\u2019Alcina]]'', which she had written for Prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] three years earlier when he was in Italy.  Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman.  When W\u0142adys\u0142aw was king (as W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art.  The composers of these operas are not known:  they may have been Poles working under [http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Marco_Scacchi Marco Scacchi] in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by W\u0142adys\u0142aw.\n\n==Classical and romantic music==\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], 1838]]\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the [[Polonaise (dance)|Polonaise]] and [[Mazurka]] \u2014 perhaps the first distinctively Polish [[art music]]. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]], [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]], [[Juliusz Zar\u0119bski]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]], and, most famously, [[Fryderyk Chopin]]. Chopin remains very well known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including [[mazurka]]s, [[nocturne]]s, [[waltz]]es and [[concerto]]s, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces.  The same period saw [[Stanislaw Moniuszko|Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]], the leading individual in the successful development of [[Polish opera]], still renowned for operas like ''[[Halka]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Manor]]''. The first national [[opera]], ''[[:pl:Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale|Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale]]'' written by [[Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski]] and [[:pl:Jan Stefani|Jan Stefani]] premiered on 1 March 1794. In the 19th century the most popular composers were [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]], [[Franciszek Lessel]], and [[Ignacy Dobrzy\u0144ski]]. Important opera composers were [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]]. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most prominent composers were [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u017bele\u0144ski (musician)|W\u0142adys\u0142aw Zele\u0144ski]] and [[Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz]]. [[Karol Szymanowski]] gained prominence prior to World War II. [[J\u00f3zef Koffler]] was the first Polish [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone composer]] (dodecaphonist).\n\n===Contemporary classical music===\n[[File:Wojciech Kilar 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wojciech Kilar]], classical and film music composer in 2006]]\nBetween the wars, a group of new and emerging composers formed the Association of Young Polish Musicians; which included future luminaries [[Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz]], [[Zygmunt Mycielski]], [[Micha\u0142 Spisak]] and [[Tadeusz Szeligowski]].<ref name=\"Erhardt\">{{cite book |trans-title=50 lat Zwi\u0105zku Kompozytor\u00f3w Polskich |title=Fifty Years of the Polish Composers' Association |author=Ludwik Erhardt |publisher=Warszawa : Zwi\u0105zek Kompozytor\u00f3w Polskich |year=1995 |OCLC=271705498 |work=[in:] Composing the Party Line: Music and Politics in Early Cold War Poland By David G.

Following the fall of communism it was bought by Warner Music Poland. It dealt with the wide range of music tastes, folk, popular, classical and children's music.\n\n==Traditional folk music==\nPolish [[folk music]] was collected in the 19th century by [[Oskar Kolberg]], as part of a wave of Polish [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]].{{r|Broughton2000}} After [[World War II]], in the [[Polish People's Republic]], folk traditions were commonly cultivated, but public performances and broadcasts had also highly organized and officially promoted forms. State-supported, large-scale folk ensembles became prominent.{{r|Broughton2000}} The most famous of these were [[Mazowsze (folk group)|Mazowsze]] and [[\u015al\u0105sk Song and Dance Ensemble|\u015al\u0105sk]], both of which still perform. Though such bands presented interpretations of regional folk repertoire, the overall sound was a homogenized mixture of Polish styles. There were more authentic groups, such as [[S\u0142owianki]], but the sanitized image of folk music made the whole field unattractive to some audiences, and many traditions dwindled rapidly.\n\nPolish dance music, especially the [[mazurka]] and [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], were popularized by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere.{{r|Broughton2000}} These are triple time dances, while five-beat forms are more common in the northeast and duple-time dances like the [[krakowiak]] come from the south. The 'polonaise' comes from the French word for 'Polish' used to identify its origin among the Polish aristocracy who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called ''chodzony''.{{r|Broughton2000}} The polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life, and became an integral part of the Polish music.\n\n===Podhale===\nWhile folk music lost popularity in Poland, especially in urban areas, the tourist destination of [[Podhale]] has retained its traditions lively.{{r|Broughton2000}} The regional capital, [[Zakopane]], has been a center for art since the late 19th century, when people like composer [[Karol Szymanowski]], who discovered Goral folk music there, made the area chic among Europe's intellectuals.{{r|Broughton2000}} Though a part of Poland, Podhale's musical life is more closely related to that found in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] mountains of Ukraine, Slovakia, Moravia in Czech Republic and [[Transylvania]].\n\nLocal ensembles use [[string instrument]]s like [[violin]]s and a [[cello]] to play distinctive scales with augumented fourth, mainly the [[lydian mode]] and [[acoustic scale]], in Poland called ''skala podhala\u0144ska'' (. The distinctive singing style used in this scale is called ''lidyzowanie''. The lead violin (''prym'') are accompanied by several second violins (''sekund'') and a three-stringed cello (''basy'').{{r|Broughton2000}} Duple-time dances like the ''krzesany'', ''zb\u00f3jnicki'' (the Brigand's Dance) and ''ozwodna'' are popular.  The ozwodna has a five-bar melodic structure which is quite unusual. The krzesany is an extremely swift dance, while the zb\u00f3jnicki is well-known and is perceived as being most \"typical\" of Podhale and Northern Slovakia. Folk songs typically focus on heroes like [[Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk]].<ref name=\"Broughton2000\">Broughton, Simon (2000), \"Hanging on in the Highlands\".

These events often attract more than 250,000 people and are comparable to the gatherings in [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] and [[Roskilde]].\n\nIn jazz music, Polish musicians created a specific style, which was most famous in 60s and 70s. Some famous Polish jazz artists are: [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski]], [[Adam Makowicz]], [[Tomasz Sta\u0144ko]], [[Micha\u0142 Urbaniak]], [[Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer]].

Artrosis quickly reached popularity in Poland with albums released by local label Morbid Noizz Productions. In the late 1990s Artrosis became subject of interest from [[Tilo Wolff]]s label Hall of Sermon witch released English version of one of their albums. Band reached its popularity in the early 2000s with a contract from Metal Mind Productions. Till 2011 band released seven Polish and four English language albums remaining active.
