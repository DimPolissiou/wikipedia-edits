{"title_page": "Field marshal", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n\n{{Military ranks | state=expanded}}\n'''Field marshal''' (or '''field-marshal''', abbreviated as '''FM''') is a very senior military rank, ordinarily senior to the [[general officer]] ranks. Usually it is the highest rank in an army, and when it is, few (if any) persons are appointed to it. It is considered as a [[five-star rank]] (OF-10) in modern-day armed forces in many countries. Promotion to the rank of field marshal in many countries historically required extraordinary military achievement by a general (a wartime victory). However, the rank has also been used as a [[Division (military)|divisional command]] rank and also as a [[brigade]] command rank.  Examples of the different uses of the rank include [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Pakistan]], [[Prussia]]/[[Germany]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] for an extraordinary achievement; Spain and [[Mexico]] for a divisional command ({{lang-es|link=no|mariscal de campo}}); and France, [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] for a brigade command ({{lang-fr|link=no|mar\u00e9chal de camp}}, {{lang-pt|marechal de campo}}).\n\nThe origin of the term dates to the early [[Middle Ages]], originally meaning the keeper of the king's horses (from [[Old German]] ''Marh-scalc'' = \"horse-servant\"), from the time of the early [[Franks|Frankish]] kings. The exact wording of the titles used by field marshals varies: examples include \"[[marshal]]\" and \"[[field marshal general]]\". The air force equivalent in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and many Middle Eastern air forces is [[marshal of the air force]] (not to be confused with [[air marshal]]). Navies, which usually do not use the nomenclature employed by armies or air forces, use titles such as \"[[fleet admiral]],\" \"[[grand admiral]]\" or \"[[admiral of the fleet]]\" for the equivalent rank. The traditional attribute distinguishing a field marshal is a [[baton (symbol)|baton]]. The baton nowadays is purely ornamental, and as such may be richly decorated. That said, it is not necessary for the insignia to be a baton (Such is the case in Russia post-1991 and the former Soviet Union, which use a jewelled star referred to as a [[Marshal's star]]).\n\n==Field marshal ranks by country==\n\n<!-- Alphabetic by country name please -->\n\n===Afghanistan===\n[[File:Afgn-Army-Marshal(Field Marshal).svg|alt=|thumb|upright=0.25|[[Ranks of the Afghan Armed Forces|Afghan National Army (ANA) insignia]]]]\n[[Mohammed Fahim|Field Marshal Mohammad Qasim Fahim]] was a politician in Afghanistan who served as Vice President from June 2002 until December 2004 and from November 2009 until his death. Between September 2001 and December 2004, he also served as Defense Minister under the Afghan Transitional Administration.\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Field marshal (Australia)}}\nThe first appointment to the rank was [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Sir William Birdwood]], who received the honour in March 1925. [[Thomas Blamey|Sir Thomas Blamey]] was the second appointment to the rank, and was the first and so far only Australian-born field marshal. He was promoted to the rank on the insistence of [[Sir Robert Menzies]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], in June 1950. His field marshal's [[Baton (symbol)|baton]] is on display in the [[Second World War]] galleries at the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]]. The third appointment, and the only living Australian field marshal, is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was promoted to the rank on 1 April 1954.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{main|Marshal (Brazil)}}\nWhen Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, the Portuguese system of ranks was maintained by the [[Brazilian Army]], including the rank of ''marechal de campo''. In the second half of the 19th century, the rank of ''marechal de campo'' was replaced, both in Portugal and Brazil, by the rank of ''general de brigada'' (brigade general). This last rank still exists today in the Brazilian Army, but corresponds to the present rank of ''major-general'' (major-general) in the Portuguese Army. \nToday, the Rank of ''Marechal'' is the maximum rank available but only awarded during wartime. The [[Brazilian Air Force]] has the similar rank of [[Air Marshal]].\n\n===China===\nDuring [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial rule]] in China, different dynasties gave different titles to generals. A very similar title is \"\u53f8\u99ac\" ([[Sima (office)|sima]]) in the Eastern Han dynasty, which literally means \"master of horse\", and later became a two-character surname too. \"\u53f8\u99ac\" is one of the [[Three Excellencies]] in Eastern Han, who is in charge of the country's military affairs. Later, a more common title for a field marshal or a commandant was (\u5143\u5e25 ''[[Yuan Shuai]]'') or [[grand marshal|grand field marshal]] (\u5927\u5143\u5e25 ''da yuan shuai''). One of the most famous of these generals was [[Yue Fei]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]. Since the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949, it has promoted 10 military commanders to the rank of marshal, all in 1955 and abolished in 1965. Since then, the rank has remained defunct.\n\n===Egypt===\n{{Main|Mushir (Egypt)}}\nThe Arab Republic of Egypt has had (9) field marshals. Currently there are two living field marshals; ex military commander in chief [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] (Active Duty) and President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] (Active Duty). Previous field marshals are [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] (Active Duty), [[Ahmad Ismail Ali]] (Active Duty), [[Mohamed Abdel Ghani Elgamasy]] (Active Duty), [[Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala]] (Active Duty), [[Mohammed Aly Fahmy]] (honorary), [[Ahmed Badawi]] (posthumously), and [[Admiral]]. [[Fouad Mohamed Abou Zikry]] (honorary).\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Field marshal (Finland)}}\n[[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] was promoted to Field Marshal in 1933. In 1942 he was promoted to Marshal of Finland, which really is not a distinctive military rank but an honour.\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Mar\u00e9chal de camp}}\nIn the French army of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', the normal brigade command rank was field marshal (''mar\u00e9chal de camp''). In 1793, during the [[French Revolution]], the rank of field marshal was replaced by the rank of brigade general. The rank insignia of field marshal was two stars (one-star being used for a senior colonel rank). The French field marshal rank was below [[lieutenant-general]], which in 1793 became [[divisional-general]]. In the title ''mar\u00e9chal de camp'' and the English \"field marshal\", there is an etymological confusion in the French ''camp'' between the English words \"camp\" and \"field\". The French rank of field marshal should not be confused with the rank of [[Marshal of France]], which has been the highest rank of the [[French Army]] since the higher dignity of [[Marshal General of France]] was abolished in 1848 (although in theory it is not an actual rank but a \"state dignity\").\n\n===German-speaking lands===\n{{Main|Generalfeldmarschall}}\n[[File:Wehrmacht GenFeldmarschall 1945h.jpg|thumb|Generalfeldmarschall]]\n''Generalfeldmarschall'' (''general field marshal, field marshal general, or field marshal'' / {{Audio|De-Generalfeldmarschall-pronunciation.ogg|<small>listen</small>}}, abbreviated to '''''Feldmarschall''''') was the most senior general officer rank in the armies of several German states, including Saxony, Brandenburg-Prussia, Prussia, the German Empire, and lastly, Germany (from 1918). In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the rank ''Feldmarschall'' was used. The rank was also given to generals in southern German States and Austria by the Holy Roman Emperor during the existence of the [[List of field marshals of the Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]] up to 1806.\n\n===Greece===\n[[File:GR-Army-OF10 (1937).svg|upright=0.25|thumb|Insignia of Field Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]]]]\n'''''Stratarches''''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2}}), meaning ''Ruler of the Army'' in Greek, is a title for senior military commanders dating back to classical antiquity, in the sense of \"commander-in-chief\". In modern Greek usage, it has been used to translate the rank of [[Field Marshal]]. In this sense, the rank was borne by the [[Kings of Greece]] since 1939, and has been awarded only once in modern Greek history to a professional officer: [[Alexandros Papagos]] in 1949 for his leadership in the [[Greco-Italian War|Greek victory against Fascist Italy]] in World War II and against the [[Democratic Army of Greece|Communist forces]] in the [[Greek Civil War]]. The rank is not retained by the current (since 1974) [[Third Hellenic Republic]].\n\n===India===\n{{Main|Field marshal (India)}}\n[[File:Field Marshal of the Indian Army.svg|50px|thumb|Indian insignia]]\nField marshal is the highest attainable rank in the [[Indian Army]]. It is a ceremonial / war time rank. There have been two Indian field marshals to date: [[Kodandera Madappa Cariappa]], the 1st Indian Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army in 1986 (much after his retirement), and [[Sam Manekshaw]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|title=Did You Know That Only 3 People Have Been Given The Highest Ranks In The Indian Armed Forces?|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Highest-ranks-in-Indian-Armed-Forces/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104090735/https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Highest-ranks-in-Indian-Armed-Forces|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Libya===\n{{main|Field marshal (Libya)}}\n[[Khalifa Haftar]] was the first to receive this rank in [[Libya]] from the [[House of Representatives (Libya)]] in 2016 after the liberation of oil ports in the [[Operation Swift Lightning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27492354|title=Profile: Libya's military strongman Khalifa Haftar|date=15 September 2016|accessdate=8 May 2018|via=www.bbc.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227132639/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27492354|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{main|Field marshal (Pakistan)}}\n[[File:OF-10 Pakistan Army.svg|upright=0.25|thumb|Pakistani insignia]]\n[[Muhammad Ayub Khan|Ayub Khan]] (1907-1974) was the only field marshal in the history of Pakistan. He was the [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|second]] [[president of Pakistan]] and the first native [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|commander in chief]] of the army.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{main|Field marshal (Philippines)}}\nUS Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was the first and only field marshal in the history of the [[Philippine Army]], a position he held while also acting as the [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines|Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines]] with a rank of major general. [[Manuel L. Quezon|President Quezon]] conferred the rank of field marshal on 24 August 1936 and MacArthur's duty included the supervision of the creation of the Philippines nation-state.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main|List of Marshals of Portugal}}\nIn the [[Portuguese Army]], the rank of ''marechal de campo'' was created in 1762, as the most junior general officer rank. Hierarchically, it was between the rank of ''tenente-general'' (lieutenant-general) and the rank of ''brigadeiro'' (brigadier), this last one not being considered a general rank, but a kind of [[senior colonel]].\n\nIn Portugal, the ranks of ''marechal-general'' (marshal-general) and ''marechal do Ex\u00e9rcito'' (marechal of the Army) or simply ''marechal'' also existed. Distinctively from the rank of ''marechal de campo'', the ranks of ''marechal-general'' and ''marechal'' were the highest in the Portuguese Army, usually being reserved for the commanders-in-chief of the Army. Latter, the rank of ''marechal-general'' became reserved for the [[King of Portugal|Monarch]], as a mere honorary dignity.\n\n===Romania===\n{{Main|Mare\u0219al (Romania)}}\n[[File:Romania-Army-OF-10.svg|upright=0.25|thumb|Romanian ''Mare\u0219al'']]\n\n''Mare\u0219al'' is the highest rank in the [[Romanian Armed Forces]].  The rank of ''mare\u0219al'' can only be bestowed to a [[General]] or [[Admiral]] ({{lang-ro|amiral}}), in time of war for exceptional military merits, by the [[President of Romania]] and confirmed by the [[Supreme Council of National Defense (Romania)|Supreme Council of National Defense]].\n\n===Serbia and Yugoslavia===\n{{Main|Vojvoda (Serbia and Yugoslavia)|Vojvoda}}\n[[Image:SrpskiCinovi18.PNG|upright=0.25|right|thumb|Serbian ''voivode'']]\n\nIn Serbian, field marshal can be translated as {{Lang-sr|label=none|\u041f\u043e\u0459\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043b|Poljski Marshal}}, and in Serbia and Yugoslavia it was similar to rank [[Vojvoda (Serbia and Yugoslavia)]] that has some similarities compared to [[Generalfeldmarschall]], [[Marshal of France]] and [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)]] but also differs in way of promotion, duration and style. It was the highest rank in the army of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] until the [[Second World War]]. It was first created with the passing of the law on the ''Organization of the Army'' of the Kingdom of Serbia in 1901. The law was passed on the suggestion of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] (later [[Divisional General]]) [[Milo\u0161 Vasi\u0107 (General)|Milo\u0161 Vasi\u0107]] who was minister of defense at the time. The rank was awarded only during the war for particular military contributions of top generals and as honorable title. [[Yugoslav People's Army]] had rank of Marshal used only by [[Josip Broz Tito]] as supreme commander, for more details see [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n{{Main|Field marshal (Sri Lanka)}}\n[[File:Sri Lanka-army-OF-10.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|Sri Lankan \u0dc6\u0dd3\u0dbd\u0dca\u0da9\u0dca \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dbd\u0dca]]\nField Marshal is the highest rank in the [[Sri Lanka Army]]. It is a ceremonial rank. [[Sarath Fonseka]] is the first and, to date, only Sri Lankan officer to hold the rank. He was promoted to the position on 22 March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.lk/news/sri-lanka/item/6744-sarath-fonseka-promoted-sri-lanka-s-first-ever-field-marshal|title=Sarath Fonseka promoted  Sri Lanka's first ever Field Marshal|last=SureshikaThilakarathna|website=news.lk|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711031904/https://www.news.lk/news/sri-lanka/item/6744-sarath-fonseka-promoted-sri-lanka-s-first-ever-field-marshal|archivedate=11 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Thailand===\n{{main|Field marshal (Thailand)}}\n[[File:RTA OF-10 (Field Marshal).svg|thumb|upright=0.25|Thai ''Chom Phon'' (\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e25)]]\n\nIn the [[Royal Thai Army]] the rank of [[Field marshal (Thailand)|''Chom Phon'']] ({{lang-th|\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e25, \u0e08\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e17\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e01}}) was created in 1888, together with all other military ranks along western lines, by King [[Chulalongkorn]]. Until the first appointment in 1910, the rank was reserved solely for the reigning monarch. Currently the rank is in abeyance.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{main|Mare\u015fal (Turkey)}}\nIn the [[Turkish Armed Forces]], the corresponding rank is ''mare\u015fal''. Its origins can be traced to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and to the military of [[Persia]], where it was called \"\u0645\u0634\u064a\u0631\" ''(m\u00fc\u015fir)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tdkterim.gov.tr/bts/?kategori=verilst&kelime=m%FC%FEir&ayn=tam |title=Great Turkish Dictionary |publisher=[[Turkish Language Association]] |accessdate=1 August 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and bestowed upon senior commanders upon order of the ruling [[sultan]]. The rank of ''mare\u015fal'' can only be bestowed by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly]], and only given to a general who leads an army, navy or air force successfully in three battles or at various front lines at the same time, gaining a victory over the enemy. Only two persons have been bestowed the rank: [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], the founder of modern [[Turkey]], and his [[List of Chiefs of the Turkish General Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]], both for their successes in the [[Turkish War of Independence]].\n\n===Uganda===\n{{main|Field marshal (Uganda)}}\nField Marshal [[Idi Amin]] was the military dictator and third president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. Amin joined the British colonial regiment, the King's African Rifles in 1946, serving in Somalia and Kenya. Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Ugandan Army and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971, deposing Milton Obote. He later promoted himself to field marshal while he was the head of state.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Field marshal (United Kingdom)}}\n[[File:British Army OF-10.svg|upright=0.25|thumb|United Kingdom insignia|alt=Shoulder insignia consisting of crossed golden batons surrounded by golden oak leaf embellishment, topped with a crown.]]\n\n[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], held the rank of a field marshal, or equivalent rank, in eight armies.  Nine of his field marshal batons are on display in [[Apsley House]] (see [[Batons of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]).\n\n===United States===\nNo branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]] has ever used the rank of field marshal. However, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was commissioned a [[Field Marshal (Philippines)|field marshal]] of the [[Philippine Army]] in 24 August 1936, serving until 31 December 1937, while still a serving [[United States Army]] officer. On 14 December 1944, Congress created the rank of \"[[General of the Army (United States)|general of the army]]\", a five-star rank equivalent to that of field marshal in other countries. Two days later, [[George Marshall]] was promoted to this rank, becoming the first five-star general in American history.

Usually it is the highest rank in an army, and when it is, few (if any) persons are appointed to it. It is considered as a [[five-star rank]] (OF-10) in modern-day armed forces in many countries. Promotion to the rank of field marshal in many countries historically required extraordinary military achievement by a general (a wartime victory). However, the rank has also been used as a [[Division (military)|divisional command]] rank and also as a [[brigade]] command rank.  Examples of the different uses of the rank include [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Pakistan]], [[Prussia]]/[[Germany]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] for an extraordinary achievement; Spain and [[Mexico]] for a divisional command ({{lang-es|link=no|mariscal de campo}}); and France, [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] for a brigade command ({{lang-fr|link=no|mar\u00e9chal de camp}}, {{lang-pt|marechal de campo}}).\n\nThe origin of the term dates to the early [[Middle Ages]], originally meaning the keeper of the king's horses (from [[Old German]] ''Marh-scalc'' = \"horse-servant\"), from the time of the early [[Franks|Frankish]] kings. The exact wording of the titles used by field marshals varies: examples include \"[[marshal]]\" and \"[[field marshal general]]\". The air force equivalent in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and many Middle Eastern air forces is [[marshal of the air force]] (not to be confused with [[air marshal]]). Navies, which usually do not use the nomenclature employed by armies or air forces, use titles such as \"[[fleet admiral]],\" \"[[grand admiral]]\" or \"[[admiral of the fleet]]\" for the equivalent rank. The traditional attribute distinguishing a field marshal is a [[baton (symbol)|baton]]. The baton nowadays is purely ornamental, and as such may be richly decorated. That said, it is not necessary for the insignia to be a baton (Such is the case in Russia post-1991 and the former Soviet Union, which use a jewelled star referred to as a [[Marshal's star]]).\n\n==Field marshal ranks by country==\n\n<!-- Alphabetic by country name please -->\n\n===Afghanistan===\n[[File:Afgn-Army-Marshal(Field Marshal).svg|alt=|thumb|upright=0.25|[[Ranks of the Afghan Armed Forces|Afghan National Army (ANA) insignia]]]]\n[[Mohammed Fahim|Field Marshal Mohammad Qasim Fahim]] was a politician in Afghanistan who served as Vice President from June 2002 until December 2004 and from November 2009 until his death. Between September 2001 and December 2004, he also served as Defense Minister under the Afghan Transitional Administration.\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Field marshal (Australia)}}\nThe first appointment to the rank was [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Sir William Birdwood]], who received the honour in March 1925. [[Thomas Blamey|Sir Thomas Blamey]] was the second appointment to the rank, and was the first and so far only Australian-born field marshal. He was promoted to the rank on the insistence of [[Sir Robert Menzies]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], in June 1950. His field marshal's [[Baton (symbol)|baton]] is on display in the [[Second World War]] galleries at the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]]. The third appointment, and the only living Australian field marshal, is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was promoted to the rank on 1 April 1954.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{main|Marshal (Brazil)}}\nWhen Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, the Portuguese system of ranks was maintained by the [[Brazilian Army]], including the rank of ''marechal de campo''. In the second half of the 19th century, the rank of ''marechal de campo'' was replaced, both in Portugal and Brazil, by the rank of ''general de brigada'' (brigade general). This last rank still exists today in the Brazilian Army, but corresponds to the present rank of ''major-general'' (major-general) in the Portuguese Army. \nToday, the Rank of ''Marechal'' is the maximum rank available but only awarded during wartime. The [[Brazilian Air Force]] has the similar rank of [[Air Marshal]].\n\n===China===\nDuring [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial rule]] in China, different dynasties gave different titles to generals. A very similar title is \"\u53f8\u99ac\" ([[Sima (office)|sima]]) in the Eastern Han dynasty, which literally means \"master of horse\", and later became a two-character surname too. \"\u53f8\u99ac\" is one of the [[Three Excellencies]] in Eastern Han, who is in charge of the country's military affairs. Later, a more common title for a field marshal or a commandant was (\u5143\u5e25 ''[[Yuan Shuai]]'') or [[grand marshal|grand field marshal]] (\u5927\u5143\u5e25 ''da yuan shuai''). One of the most famous of these generals was [[Yue Fei]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]. Since the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949, it has promoted 10 military commanders to the rank of marshal, all in 1955 and abolished in 1965. Since then, the rank has remained defunct.\n\n===Egypt===\n{{Main|Mushir (Egypt)}}\nThe Arab Republic of Egypt has had (9) field marshals. Currently there are two living field marshals; ex military commander in chief [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] (Active Duty) and President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] (Active Duty). Previous field marshals are [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] (Active Duty), [[Ahmad Ismail Ali]] (Active Duty), [[Mohamed Abdel Ghani Elgamasy]] (Active Duty), [[Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala]] (Active Duty), [[Mohammed Aly Fahmy]] (honorary), [[Ahmed Badawi]] (posthumously), and [[Admiral]]. [[Fouad Mohamed Abou Zikry]] (honorary).\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Field marshal (Finland)}}\n[[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] was promoted to Field Marshal in 1933. In 1942 he was promoted to Marshal of Finland, which really is not a distinctive military rank but an honour.\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Mar\u00e9chal de camp}}\nIn the French army of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', the normal brigade command rank was field marshal (''mar\u00e9chal de camp''). In 1793, during the [[French Revolution]], the rank of field marshal was replaced by the rank of brigade general. The rank insignia of field marshal was two stars (one-star being used for a senior colonel rank). The French field marshal rank was below [[lieutenant-general]], which in 1793 became [[divisional-general]]. In the title ''mar\u00e9chal de camp'' and the English \"field marshal\", there is an etymological confusion in the French ''camp'' between the English words \"camp\" and \"field\". The French rank of field marshal should not be confused with the rank of [[Marshal of France]], which has been the highest rank of the [[French Army]] since the higher dignity of [[Marshal General of France]] was abolished in 1848 (although in theory it is not an actual rank but a \"state dignity\").\n\n===German-speaking lands===\n{{Main|Generalfeldmarschall}}\n[[File:Wehrmacht GenFeldmarschall 1945h.jpg|thumb|Generalfeldmarschall]]\n''Generalfeldmarschall'' (''general field marshal, field marshal general, or field marshal'' / {{Audio|De-Generalfeldmarschall-pronunciation.ogg|<small>listen</small>}}, abbreviated to '''''Feldmarschall''''') was the most senior general officer rank in the armies of several German states, including Saxony, Brandenburg-Prussia, Prussia, the German Empire, and lastly, Germany (from 1918). In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the rank ''Feldmarschall'' was used. The rank was also given to generals in southern German States and Austria by the Holy Roman Emperor during the existence of the [[List of field marshals of the Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]] up to 1806.\n\n===Greece===\n[[File:GR-Army-OF10 (1937).svg|upright=0.25|thumb|Insignia of Field Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]]]]\n'''''Stratarches''''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2}}), meaning ''Ruler of the Army'' in Greek, is a title for senior military commanders dating back to classical antiquity, in the sense of \"commander-in-chief\". In modern Greek usage, it has been used to translate the rank of [[Field Marshal]]. In this sense, the rank was borne by the [[Kings of Greece]] since 1939, and has been awarded only once in modern Greek history to a professional officer: [[Alexandros Papagos]] in 1949 for his leadership in the [[Greco-Italian War|Greek victory against Fascist Italy]] in World War II and against the [[Democratic Army of Greece|Communist forces]] in the [[Greek Civil War]]. The rank is not retained by the current (since 1974) [[Third Hellenic Republic]].\n\n===India===\n{{Main|Field marshal (India)}}\n[[File:Field Marshal of the Indian Army.svg|50px|thumb|Indian insignia]]\nField marshal is the highest attainable rank in the [[Indian Army]]. It is a ceremonial / war time rank. There have been two Indian field marshals to date: [[Kodandera Madappa Cariappa]], the 1st Indian Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army in 1986 (much after his retirement), and [[Sam Manekshaw]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|title=Did You Know That Only 3 People Have Been Given The Highest Ranks In The Indian Armed Forces?|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Highest-ranks-in-Indian-Armed-Forces/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104090735/https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Highest-ranks-in-Indian-Armed-Forces|archivedate=4 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Libya===\n{{main|Field marshal (Libya)}}\n[[Khalifa Haftar]] was the first to receive this rank in [[Libya]] from the [[House of Representatives (Libya)]] in 2016 after the liberation of oil ports in the [[Operation Swift Lightning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27492354|title=Profile: Libya's military strongman Khalifa Haftar|date=15 September 2016|accessdate=8 May 2018|via=www.bbc.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227132639/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27492354|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{main|Field marshal (Pakistan)}}\n[[File:OF-10 Pakistan Army.svg|upright=0.25|thumb|Pakistani insignia]]\n[[Muhammad Ayub Khan|Ayub Khan]] (1907-1974) was the only field marshal in the history of Pakistan. He was the [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|second]] [[president of Pakistan]] and the first native [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|commander in chief]] of the army.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{main|Field marshal (Philippines)}}\nUS Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was the first and only field marshal in the history of the [[Philippine Army]], a position he held while also acting as the [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines|Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines]] with a rank of major general. [[Manuel L. Quezon|President Quezon]] conferred the rank of field marshal on 24 August 1936 and MacArthur's duty included the supervision of the creation of the Philippines nation-state.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main|List of Marshals of Portugal}}\nIn the [[Portuguese Army]], the rank of ''marechal de campo'' was created in 1762, as the most junior general officer rank. Hierarchically, it was between the rank of ''tenente-general'' (lieutenant-general) and the rank of ''brigadeiro'' (brigadier), this last one not being considered a general rank, but a kind of [[senior colonel]].\n\nIn Portugal, the ranks of ''marechal-general'' (marshal-general) and ''marechal do Ex\u00e9rcito'' (marechal of the Army) or simply ''marechal'' also existed. Distinctively from the rank of ''marechal de campo'', the ranks of ''marechal-general'' and ''marechal'' were the highest in the Portuguese Army, usually being reserved for the commanders-in-chief of the Army. Latter, the rank of ''marechal-general'' became reserved for the [[King of Portugal|Monarch]], as a mere honorary dignity.\n\n===Romania===\n{{Main|Mare\u0219al (Romania)}}\n[[File:Romania-Army-OF-10.svg|upright=0.25|thumb|Romanian ''Mare\u0219al'']]\n\n''Mare\u0219al'' is the highest rank in the [[Romanian Armed Forces]].  The rank of ''mare\u0219al'' can only be bestowed to a [[General]] or [[Admiral]] ({{lang-ro|amiral}}), in time of war for exceptional military merits, by the [[President of Romania]] and confirmed by the [[Supreme Council of National Defense (Romania)|Supreme Council of National Defense]].\n\n===Serbia and Yugoslavia===\n{{Main|Vojvoda (Serbia and Yugoslavia)|Vojvoda}}\n[[Image:SrpskiCinovi18.PNG|upright=0.25|right|thumb|Serbian ''voivode'']]\n\nIn Serbian, field marshal can be translated as {{Lang-sr|label=none|\u041f\u043e\u0459\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043b|Poljski Marshal}}, and in Serbia and Yugoslavia it was similar to rank [[Vojvoda (Serbia and Yugoslavia)]] that has some similarities compared to [[Generalfeldmarschall]], [[Marshal of France]] and [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)]] but also differs in way of promotion, duration and style. It was the highest rank in the army of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] until the [[Second World War]]. It was first created with the passing of the law on the ''Organization of the Army'' of the Kingdom of Serbia in 1901. The law was passed on the suggestion of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] (later [[Divisional General]]) [[Milo\u0161 Vasi\u0107 (General)|Milo\u0161 Vasi\u0107]] who was minister of defense at the time. The rank was awarded only during the war for particular military contributions of top generals and as honorable title. [[Yugoslav People's Army]] had rank of Marshal used only by [[Josip Broz Tito]] as supreme commander, for more details see [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n{{Main|Field marshal (Sri Lanka)}}\n[[File:Sri Lanka-army-OF-10.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|Sri Lankan \u0dc6\u0dd3\u0dbd\u0dca\u0da9\u0dca \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dbd\u0dca]]\nField Marshal is the highest rank in the [[Sri Lanka Army]].

Until the first appointment in 1910, the rank was reserved solely for the reigning monarch. Currently the rank is in abeyance.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{main|Mare\u015fal (Turkey)}}\nIn the [[Turkish Armed Forces]], the corresponding rank is ''mare\u015fal''. Its origins can be traced to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and to the military of [[Persia]], where it was called \"\u0645\u0634\u064a\u0631\" ''(m\u00fc\u015fir)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tdkterim.gov.tr/bts/?kategori=verilst&kelime=m%FC%FEir&ayn=tam |title=Great Turkish Dictionary |publisher=[[Turkish Language Association]] |accessdate=1 August 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and bestowed upon senior commanders upon order of the ruling [[sultan]]. The rank of ''mare\u015fal'' can only be bestowed by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly]], and only given to a general who leads an army, navy or air force successfully in three battles or at various front lines at the same time, gaining a victory over the enemy. Only two persons have been bestowed the rank: [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], the founder of modern [[Turkey]], and his [[List of Chiefs of the Turkish General Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]], both for their successes in the [[Turkish War of Independence]].\n\n===Uganda===\n{{main|Field marshal (Uganda)}}\nField Marshal [[Idi Amin]] was the military dictator and third president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. Amin joined the British colonial regiment, the King's African Rifles in 1946, serving in Somalia and Kenya. Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Ugandan Army and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971, deposing Milton Obote. He later promoted himself to field marshal while he was the head of state.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Field marshal (United Kingdom)}}\n[[File:British Army OF-10.svg|upright=0.25|thumb|United Kingdom insignia|alt=Shoulder insignia consisting of crossed golden batons surrounded by golden oak leaf embellishment, topped with a crown.]]\n\n[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], held the rank of a field marshal, or equivalent rank, in eight armies.  Nine of his field marshal batons are on display in [[Apsley House]] (see [[Batons of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]).\n\n===United States===\nNo branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]] has ever used the rank of field marshal. However, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] was commissioned a [[Field Marshal (Philippines)|field marshal]] of the [[Philippine Army]] in 24 August 1936, serving until 31 December 1937, while still a serving [[United States Army]] officer. On 14 December 1944, Congress created the rank of \"[[General of the Army (United States)|general of the army]]\", a five-star rank equivalent to that of field marshal in other countries. Two days later, [[George Marshall]] was promoted to this rank, becoming the first five-star general in American history.

The board has nearly the same layout as that used in [[xiangqi]], except the janggi board has no \"river\" in the central row. The pieces consist of disks marked with identifying characters and are placed on the line intersections (as in [[xiangqi]] and [[Go (board game)|Go]]). Janggi pieces are traditionally [[octagon]]al in shape, and differ in size according to their rank. The sides are Blue (or sometimes Green), which moves first, versus Red. Each side has a ''palace'' that is 3 lines by 3 lines (9 positions) in the centre of their side of the board against the back edge. The palace contains four diagonal lines extending outwards from the centre, forming an \"X\" shape.\n\n===Pieces===\nThe pieces are labeled with [[hanja]] (Chinese characters). The labels on the blue pieces are all written in the [[semi-cursive script]]. For instance, the blue chariot or ''cha'' has a cursive version of {{lang|ko-Hant|\u8eca}}, which looks something like {{lang|zh-Hans|\u8f66}} (the [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified Chinese]] equivalent of the [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional character]]).\n\n====General====\n[[Image: Red King (svg).svg|50px]]\n[[Image: Green King (svg).svg|50px]]\n\nThe pieces that are equivalent to the [[King (chess)|kings]] in Western chess are actually referred to as military generals (''janggun'') in Korean. They are labelled with the [[Chinese character]] ''Han'' (in Chinese [[pinyin]]: ''H\u00e0n''; {{lang|ko-Hant|\u6f22}}) on the red side, and ''Cho'' (''Ch\u01d4''; {{lang|ko-Hant|\u695a}}) on the blue side. They represent the rival states of [[Han (state)|Han]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] that fought for power in the post-[[Qin Dynasty]] interregnum period in China (see [[Chu\u2013Han contention]]). In North Korea, the Chu\u2013Han setup is not used; the red general there is called ''jang'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5c07}}, \"general\") and the blue general is called ''gwan'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5b98}}, \"minister\").  Both kings can also be referred to generally as ''gung'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5bae}}, \"palace\").<ref>[[:ko:\uc7a5\uae30#.EC.83.B9.EC.B9.98.EC.99.80.EC.9D.98 .EC.B0.A8.EC.9D.B4.EC.A0.90]]</ref>\n\nJanggi differs from its [[xiangqi|Chinese counterpart]] in that the janggi general starts the game from the central intersection of the palace, rather than from the centre intersection of the back edge. The general may move one step per turn along marked board lines to any of the nine points within the palace. There are four diagonal lines in the palace connecting the centre position to the corners. When the general is checkmated the game is lost. The general cannot leave the palace under any circumstances. If the generals come to face each other across the board, and the player to move does not move away, this is ''bikjang''\u2014a draw. This rule is different from that of [[xiangqi]] where it is illegal for the generals to face.\n\nIf there is no move for the general to make without getting into check or checkmate, but it is safe for it to stand still, the person may pass their turn (leave the general in position and make no move).\n\n====Guards====\n[[Image: Red Sa (svg).svg|50px]]\n[[Image: Green Sa (svg).svg|50px]]\n\nThe pieces are labeled ''sa'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u58eb}}) and are civilian government officials (i.e. council members serving the commander in chief). They are often called guards, since they stay close to the general. Other names are assistants or mandarins.\n\nThe guards start to the left and right of the general on the first rank. They move the same as the general, one step per turn along marked lines in the palace. The guards are one of the weakest pieces because they may not leave the palace. They are valuable for protecting the general.\n\n====Horses====\n[[Image: Red Ma (svg).svg|50px]]\n[[Image: Green Ma (svg).svg|50px]]\n\nCalled the horse or ''ma'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u99ac}}), this piece moves and captures exactly like the [[Xiangqi#Horse|horse in xiangqi]] (i.e. one step orthogonally then one step diagonally outward, with no jumping). A horse can be transposed with an adjacent elephant in the initial setup.\n\n====Elephants====\n[[Image: Red Sang (svg).svg|50px]]\n[[Image: Green Sang (svg).svg|50px]]\n\nThe elephants or ''sang'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u8c61}}) begin the game to the left and right of the guards. They move one point orthogonally followed by two points diagonally away from their starting point, ending on the opposite corner of a 2\u00d73 rectangle. Like the horse, the elephant is blocked from moving by any intervening pieces. Unlike [[xiangqi]], which confines elephants to their own side of the board behind a \"river\", in janggi there is no river and  elephants are not limited to one side of the board. The janggi elephant can therefore be used more offensively than the xiangqi elephant. An elephant can be transposed with an adjacent horse in the initial setup.\n\n====Chariots====\n[[Image: Red Cha (svg).svg|50px]]\n[[Image: Green Cha (svg).svg|50px]]\n\nThese are labelled ''cha'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u8eca}}). Like the [[Rook (chess)|rook]] in Western chess, the chariot moves and captures in a straight line either horizontally or vertically. Additionally, the chariot may move along the diagonal lines inside either palace, but only in a straight line. The two chariots begin the game in the corners. The chariot is the most powerful piece in the game.\n\n====Cannons====\n[[Image: Red Po (svg).svg|50px]]\n[[Image: Green Po (svg).svg|50px]]\n\nThese are labelled ''po'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5305}}). Each player has two cannons. The cannons are placed on the row behind the soldiers, directly in front of the horses (if the horses are put on the file next to the chariots). The cannon moves by jumping another piece horizontally or vertically. The jump can be performed over any distance provided that there is exactly one piece anywhere between the original position and the target. In order to capture a piece, there must be exactly one piece (friendly or otherwise) between the cannon and the piece to be captured. The cannon then moves to that point and captures the piece. They may also move or capture diagonally along the diagonal lines in either palace, provided there is an intervening piece in the centre (i.e. it can only happen if the cannon is at a corner of the palace) They are powerful at the beginning of the game when \"hurdles\" are plentiful, but lose value rapidly with attrition. The other piece over which the cannon jumps may not be another cannon. A cannon may also not capture another cannon. Unlike [[xiangqi]], janggi requires cannons to jump in order to move, as well as capture. This means in the starting position, there are no valid moves available for the cannon.\n\n====Soldiers====\n[[Image: Red Byung (svg).svg|50px]]\n[[Image: Green Zol (svg).svg|50px]]\n\nThese are labelled ''byeong'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5175}}) (soldiers, general term for a soldier) for Red and ''jol'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5352}}) (also means soldiers, usually lowest ranking soldiers) for Blue. Each side has five soldiers, initially placed on alternating points, one row back from the edge of where the river would be in xiangqi. Unlike [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] in Western chess, they move and capture one point either straight forward or sideways. (Unlike xiangqi, where soldiers must be promoted to move sideways.) There is no promotion; once they reach the end of the board they may only move sideways. Soldiers may also move one point diagonally forward when within the enemy palace.\n\n===Setting up===\nIn tournaments, the elder player, or higher ranked player, conceals a soldier from each side in their hands. The opponent selects a hand to determine their colour. After that, Han places their pieces first, followed by Cho placing theirs. (The reason both sides are not placed simultaneously is because the positions of horse and elephant can be transposed, giving some strategical advantage to the player who places last.)\n\nAfter the pieces are set up, Cho moves first.\n\n===Ending the game===\nThe game is won by [[Checkmate|checkmating]] the opposing general. This is called ''oetong'' ({{lang|ko|\uc678\ud1b5}}).\n\nIn Western chess, [[stalemate]] is achieved when no legal moves are possible. However, the stalemate is not a draw in janggi. The player must pass their turn when no legal moves are possible. If neither player can move legally, or if neither player can win because neither player has enough pieces, the game ends in a draw.\n\nA player may decide to make a move such that their general faces the opponent's general unobstructed (a condition called ''bikjang''). In this situation, the opponent can either call a draw, or make a move that breaks the condition. In many cases, the bikjang rule can be used to force the opponent to call a draw on a losing game, by forcing them to sacrifice a valuable piece to break the bikjang position. It may not apply in some games, and usually the players will consent on the validity of the rule before the game begins.\n\nCheck is announced by declaring ''janggun'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5c07\u8ecd}}), meaning \"general\". Getting out of janggun is called meonggun, and one may declare ''meonggun'' while escaping from janggun. But it is not necessary to say ''janggun'' out loud.\n\n===Miscellaneous rules===\nIn South Korean tournaments, according to rules set by the Korean Janggi Association,<ref>http://www.kja.or.kr/</ref> there is no draw in any form, including draw by perpetual check or repetition of position. If a position repeats three times, a referee is called to determine who is at fault. Usually the referee orders the player who is losing to make a different move, so the player who is winning can press for an advantage. Sometimes it is not technically clear who is to blame, and different referees may differ as to which player must deviate, or whether repetition is mutually forced. This rule is applied because a winner and a loser must be decided during the game. If both players have less than 30 piece points, however, a draw is allowed by both repetition and perpetual check.\n\nIn tournaments where draws are not allowed, draws are resolved by adding up the points of their pieces that are still on the board.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! Piece !! Points\n |-\n | chariots || align=\"center\" | 13\n |-\n | cannons || align=\"center\" | 7\n |-\n | horses || align=\"center\" | 5\n |-\n | elephants || align=\"center\" | 3\n |-\n | guards || align=\"center\" | 3\n |-\n | soldiers || align=\"center\" | 2\n|}\n\nBecause the player with the blue pieces (''cho'') starts, they have an advantage. To compensate for this, Red receives 1.5 points (called 'deom' (\ub364) in Korean), the half-point being to avoid ties. So when the game starts, Blue has 72 points and Red has 73.5 points. If neither side can force a win, the player with the most points is declared the winner.\n\n==In South Korean culture==\n[[Image:Janggi-seoul.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Playing janggi on [[Seoul]]'s streets]]\nIn South Korea one will often see older men crowding around a single janggi board while two men play for small amounts of money.  These games are played year round, especially in city parks in [[Seoul]].  Janggi is occasionally played as a gambling game, and it is currently less popular in South Korea than the [[strategy game]] baduk (known in the West as [[Go (board game)|go]]).\n\nThe [[Korea Janggi Association]] is responsible for promoting janggi in South Korea.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Gwangsanghui]] (\u5ee3\u8c61\u6231, \uad11\uc0c1\ud76c)\u2014an 18th-century Janggi variant<ref name=\"\u97e9\u56fd\u53e4\u5178\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e93 \u300a\u4a13\u6df5\u96c6\u00b7\u5ee3\u8c61\u6231\u5fd7\u300b\">{{cite web|url=http://db.itkc.or.kr/index.jsp?bizName=MM&url=/itkcdb/text/nodeViewIframe.jsp?bizName=MM&seojiId=kc_mm_a513&gunchaId=av027&muncheId=01&finId=021&NodeId=&setid=2526027&Pos=0&TotalCount=11&searchUrl=ok|title=<span lang=\"zh\">\u97e9\u56fd\u53e4\u5178\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e93 \u300a\u4a13\u6df5\u96c6\u00b7\u5ee3\u8c61\u6231\u5fd7\u300b</span>|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130423124005/http://db.itkc.or.kr/index.jsp?bizName=MM&url=/itkcdb/text/nodeViewIframe.jsp%3FbizName=MM&seojiId=kc_mm_a513&gunchaId=av027&muncheId=01&finId=021&NodeId=&setid=2526027&Pos=0&TotalCount=11&searchUrl=ok |archive-date=2013-04-23 }}</ref>\n*[[List of Korea-related topics]]\n*[[Xiangqi]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite magazine\n |last=Maynard\n |first=Malcolm\n |title=Janggi: The Chess of Korea\n |editor=Kerry Handscomb\n |publisher=Carpe Diem Publishing\n |magazine=Abstract Games\n |date=Winter 2002\n |issue=12\n |pages=6\u201311\n |issn=1492-0492}}\n*{{cite magazine\n |last=Maynard\n |first=Malcolm\n |title=Janggi: Addenda\n |editor=Kerry Handscomb\n |publisher=Carpe Diem Publishing\n |magazine=Abstract Games\n |date=Autumn 2003\n |issue=15\n |page=28\n |issn=1492-0492}}\n*{{cite book\n |last=Murray\n |first=H.

Soldiers may also move one point diagonally forward when within the enemy palace.\n\n===Setting up===\nIn tournaments, the elder player, or higher ranked player, conceals a soldier from each side in their hands. The opponent selects a hand to determine their colour. After that, Han places their pieces first, followed by Cho placing theirs. (The reason both sides are not placed simultaneously is because the positions of horse and elephant can be transposed, giving some strategical advantage to the player who places last.)\n\nAfter the pieces are set up, Cho moves first.\n\n===Ending the game===\nThe game is won by [[Checkmate|checkmating]] the opposing general. This is called ''oetong'' ({{lang|ko|\uc678\ud1b5}}).\n\nIn Western chess, [[stalemate]] is achieved when no legal moves are possible. However, the stalemate is not a draw in janggi. The player must pass their turn when no legal moves are possible. If neither player can move legally, or if neither player can win because neither player has enough pieces, the game ends in a draw.\n\nA player may decide to make a move such that their general faces the opponent's general unobstructed (a condition called ''bikjang''). In this situation, the opponent can either call a draw, or make a move that breaks the condition. In many cases, the bikjang rule can be used to force the opponent to call a draw on a losing game, by forcing them to sacrifice a valuable piece to break the bikjang position. It may not apply in some games, and usually the players will consent on the validity of the rule before the game begins.\n\nCheck is announced by declaring ''janggun'' ({{lang|ko-Hant|\u5c07\u8ecd}}), meaning \"general\". Getting out of janggun is called meonggun, and one may declare ''meonggun'' while escaping from janggun. But it is not necessary to say ''janggun'' out loud.\n\n===Miscellaneous rules===\nIn South Korean tournaments, according to rules set by the Korean Janggi Association,<ref>http://www.kja.or.kr/</ref> there is no draw in any form, including draw by perpetual check or repetition of position. If a position repeats three times, a referee is called to determine who is at fault. Usually the referee orders the player who is losing to make a different move, so the player who is winning can press for an advantage. Sometimes it is not technically clear who is to blame, and different referees may differ as to which player must deviate, or whether repetition is mutually forced. This rule is applied because a winner and a loser must be decided during the game. If both players have less than 30 piece points, however, a draw is allowed by both repetition and perpetual check.\n\nIn tournaments where draws are not allowed, draws are resolved by adding up the points of their pieces that are still on the board.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! Piece !! Points\n |-\n | chariots || align=\"center\" | 13\n |-\n | cannons || align=\"center\" | 7\n |-\n | horses || align=\"center\" | 5\n |-\n | elephants || align=\"center\" | 3\n |-\n | guards || align=\"center\" | 3\n |-\n | soldiers || align=\"center\" | 2\n|}\n\nBecause the player with the blue pieces (''cho'') starts, they have an advantage. To compensate for this, Red receives 1.5 points (called 'deom' (\ub364) in Korean), the half-point being to avoid ties. So when the game starts, Blue has 72 points and Red has 73.5 points. If neither side can force a win, the player with the most points is declared the winner.\n\n==In South Korean culture==\n[[Image:Janggi-seoul.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Playing janggi on [[Seoul]]'s streets]]\nIn South Korea one will often see older men crowding around a single janggi board while two men play for small amounts of money.  These games are played year round, especially in city parks in [[Seoul]].  Janggi is occasionally played as a gambling game, and it is currently less popular in South Korea than the [[strategy game]] baduk (known in the West as [[Go (board game)|go]]).\n\nThe [[Korea Janggi Association]] is responsible for promoting janggi in South Korea.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Gwangsanghui]] (\u5ee3\u8c61\u6231, \uad11\uc0c1\ud76c)\u2014an 18th-century Janggi variant<ref name=\"\u97e9\u56fd\u53e4\u5178\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e93 \u300a\u4a13\u6df5\u96c6\u00b7\u5ee3\u8c61\u6231\u5fd7\u300b\">{{cite web|url=http://db.itkc.or.kr/index.jsp?bizName=MM&url=/itkcdb/text/nodeViewIframe.jsp?bizName=MM&seojiId=kc_mm_a513&gunchaId=av027&muncheId=01&finId=021&NodeId=&setid=2526027&Pos=0&TotalCount=11&searchUrl=ok|title=<span lang=\"zh\">\u97e9\u56fd\u53e4\u5178\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e93 \u300a\u4a13\u6df5\u96c6\u00b7\u5ee3\u8c61\u6231\u5fd7\u300b</span>|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130423124005/http://db.itkc.or.kr/index.jsp?bizName=MM&url=/itkcdb/text/nodeViewIframe.jsp%3FbizName=MM&seojiId=kc_mm_a513&gunchaId=av027&muncheId=01&finId=021&NodeId=&setid=2526027&Pos=0&TotalCount=11&searchUrl=ok |archive-date=2013-04-23 }}</ref>\n*[[List of Korea-related topics]]\n*[[Xiangqi]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite magazine\n |last=Maynard\n |first=Malcolm\n |title=Janggi: The Chess of Korea\n |editor=Kerry Handscomb\n |publisher=Carpe Diem Publishing\n |magazine=Abstract Games\n |date=Winter 2002\n |issue=12\n |pages=6\u201311\n |issn=1492-0492}}\n*{{cite magazine\n |last=Maynard\n |first=Malcolm\n |title=Janggi: Addenda\n |editor=Kerry Handscomb\n |publisher=Carpe Diem Publishing\n |magazine=Abstract Games\n |date=Autumn 2003\n |issue=15\n |page=28\n |issn=1492-0492}}\n*{{cite book\n |last=Murray\n |first=H.

His mother was the daughter of Eugene Macarthy, one time manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. She was left in very poor circumstances and the family had a great struggle to exist. Phil's grandfather, a country gentleman, had some talent as a draughtsman and liked making caricatures. At the age of twelve, in Leeds, Phil became friendly with Fred Fox, whose father was the scenic artist at the recently opened Grand Theatre. This gave him a free run of the theatre, where he used to sketch sections of other people's designs for costumes, as well as sketching actors' portraits for which he received a shilling, later rising to five shillings. Another of his contemporaries was Walter Curtis, who became prominent as a [[music hall]] comedian and general entertainer. Soon, Phil May had begun to earn his living in a solicitor's office; before he was fifteen he had acted as time-keeper at a foundry, had tried to become a [[jockey]] and had been on the stage at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and Leeds. He was fond of drawing and when only fourteen years old had drawings accepted for the ''Yorkshire Gossip''. When he was about seventeen he went to [[London]] with a [[gold sovereign|sovereign]] in his pocket. He suffered extreme want, sleeping out in the parks and streets, until he obtained employment as designer to a theatrical [[costumier]]. He also drew [[poster]]s and [[cartoon]]s, and for about two years worked for the ''St Stephens Review'', until he was advised to go to [[Australia]] for his health.\n\n[[File:Phil May in Vanity fair.jpg|thumb|210px|\"Phil\", by [[Leslie Ward]], in ''Vanity Fair'', 1895.]]\n\nDuring the three years (1886\u20131889) he spent there he was attached to ''The Sydney Bulletin'', or ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' as it was better known, for which many of his best drawings were made. He produced about 800 drawings for ''The Bulletin''. On his return to [[Europe]] he went to [[Paris]] by way of [[Rome]], where he worked hard for some time before he appeared in 1892 in London to resume his interrupted connection with the ''St Stephens Review''. His studies of the London [[guttersnipe]] and the [[coster-girl]] rapidly made him famous. His overflowing sense of fun, his genuine sympathy with his subjects, and his kindly wit were on a par with his artistic ability. It was often said that the extraordinary economy of line which was a characteristic feature of his drawings had been forced upon him by the deficiencies of the printing machines of the ''Sydney Bulletin''. It was in fact the result of a laborious process which involved a number of preliminary sketches, and a carefully considered system of elimination. His later work included some excellent political portraits. He became a regular member of the staff of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1896, and in his later years his services were retained exclusively for ''Punch'' and ''[[The Graphic]]''. He was a founder member in 1898 of the [[London Sketch Club]]. He died from tuberculosis in 1903 at his home in [[St John's Wood]], London.<ref name=adb>{{cite web|last1=Heseltine|first1=H.P.|title=May, Philip William (Phil) (1864\u20131903)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/may-philip-william-phil-4178|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref>\n\n==Influence and reputation==\nMay was a major influence on the style of cartoon drawing in the 20th century. In 1918, [[Percy Bradshaw]] wrote in ''The Art of the Illustrator'' that May \"surely gave more magic to a single line than any draftsman who has ever lived, and he was unquestionably the creator of the simplified technique of modern humorous drawing\".<ref>Bradshaw, The Art of the Illustrator, 1918.</ref> May's work was a major influence on [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]].

From 1892-1904 there were thirteen editions of ''Phil May's Illustrated Winter Annual'' with three supplemental ''Summer Annuals''.<ref name=adb/> In addition to his ''Summer'' and ''Winter Annuals'' various collections were published, including ''Phil May's Sketch Book'' (1895), ''Phil May's Guttersnipes'' (1896), ''Phil May's Graphic Pictures'' and ''Phil May's A.
