Beginning in the 1970s, Hanja began to experience a gradual decline in commercial or unofficial writing in the South due to government intervention, with some South Korean newspapers now only using Hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as to the future of Hanja in South Korea.

The alphabetical order of the Korean alphabet does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, first are [[velar consonant]]s, then [[Coronal consonant|coronals]], [[Labial consonant|labials]], [[sibilant]]s, etc. The vowels come after the consonants.\n\n=== Historical orders ===\nThe order from the ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]'' in 1446 was:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u314b \u3181 \u3137 \u314c \u3134 \u3142 \u314d \u3141 \u3148 \u314a \u3145 \u3186 \u314e \u3147 \u3139 \u317f}} \n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}\n\nIn 1527, [[Choe Sejin]] reorganized the alphabet in [[Hunmongjahoe]]:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3181 \u314b \u314c \u314d \u3148 \u314a \u317f \u3147 \u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u318d}}\n\nThis is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double letters that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (') and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (ng). Thus, when the [[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n governments implemented full use of the Korean alphabet, they ordered these letters differently, with North Korea placing new letters at the end of the alphabet and South Korea grouping similar letters together.\n\n=== North Korean order ===\nThe new, double, letters are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the ' {{lang|ko|\u3147|nocat=yes}}, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.\n\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3138 \u3143 \u3146 \u3149 \u3147}}\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u3150 \u3152 \u3154 \u3156 \u315a \u315f \u3162 \u3158 \u315d \u3159 \u315e}}\n\nAll digraphs and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s, including the old diphthongs {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}}, are placed after the simple vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.\n\nThe order of the final letters is:\n\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3146}}\n\nUnlike when it is initial, this {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} is pronounced, as the nasal {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng,'' which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double letters are placed to the very end, as in the initial order, but the combined consonants are ordered immediately after their first element.\n\n=== South Korean order ===\nIn the Southern order, double letters are placed immediately after their single counterparts:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131\u3132\u3134\u3137\u3138\u3139\u3141\u3142\u3143\u3145\u3146\u3147\u3148\u3149\u314a\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3150 \u3151 \u3152 \u3153 \u3154 \u3155 \u3156 \u3157 \u3158 \u3159 \u315a \u315b \u315c \u315d \u315e \u315f \u3160 \u3161 \u3162 \u3163}}\n\nThe modern [[monophthong]]al vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: ''i'' is added first, then [[Iotization|iotized]], then iotized with added ''i''. [[Diphthong]]s beginning with ''w'' are ordered according to their spelling, as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} or {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} plus a second vowel, not as separate [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.\n\nThe order of the final letters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}) is:\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3132 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3146 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e}}\n\n(\"None\" means there is no final letter.)\n\nEvery syllable begins with a consonant (or the silent \u3147) that is followed by a vowel (e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2e4}}). Some syllables such as \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ec}}\" and \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ed}}\" have a final consonant or final consonant cluster ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}). Then, 399 combinations are possible for \"two-letter syllables\" and 10,773 possible combinations for syllables with more than two \"letters\" (27 possible final endings), for a total of 11,172 possible combinations of Korean alphabet \"letters\" to form syllables.\n\n==Letter names==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Giyuk.ogg|title=Korean consonants|description=names of the Korean consonant letters (South Korean)\n|filename2=Korean vowels.ogg|title2=Korean vowels|description2=names of the Korean vowel letters\n}}\nLetters in the Korean alphabet were named by Korean linguist [[Choe Sejin]] in 1527. South Korea uses Choe's traditional names, most of which follow the format of ''letter'' + ''i'' + ''eu'' + ''letter''. Choe described these names by listing Hanja characters with similar pronunciations. However, as the syllables {{lang|ko|\uc73d}} ''euk'', {{lang|ko|\uc743}} ''eut'', and {{lang|ko|\uc74f}} ''eut'' did not occur in Hanja, Choe gave those letters the modified names {{lang|ko|\uae30\uc5ed}} ''gi'''yeok''''', {{lang|ko|\ub514\uadff}} ''di'''geut''''', and {{lang|ko|\uc2dc\uc637}} ''si'''ot''''', using Hanja that did not fit the pattern (for \uae30\uc5ed) or native Korean syllables (for \ub514\uadff and \uc2dc\uc637).\n\nOriginally, Choe gave {{lang|ko|\u3148}}, {{lang|ko|\u314a}}, {{lang|ko|\u314b}}, {{lang|ko|\u314c}}, {{lang|ko|\u314d}}, and {{lang|ko|\u314e}} the irregular one-syllable names of ''ji'', ''chi'', ''\u1e33i'', ''\u1e6di'', ''p\u0323i'', and ''hi'', because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]''. However, after establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which let all consonants be used as finals, the names changed to the present forms.\n\nNorth Korea regularized Choe's original names when it made the Korean alphabet its official orthography.\n\n=== In North Korea ===\nThe chart below shows names used in North Korea for consonants in the Korean alphabet.

The Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three, grouping sounds into [[syllable]]s, using distinct symbols for [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]], and in some cases using distinct strokes to indicate [[distinctive feature]]s such as [[place of articulation]] ([[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]]) and [[manner of articulation]] ([[plosive]], [[nasal stop|nasal]], [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]) for consonants, and [[iotization]] (a preceding ''i-''sound), [[Vowel harmony|harmonic class]] and [[i-mutation]] for vowels.\n\nFor instance, the consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} \u1e6d {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is a plosive, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3186}} ''\u0294'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} ''g'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}} ''j'', which have the same stroke (the last is an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], a plosive\u2013fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is aspirated, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e}} ''h'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b}} ''\u1e33'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314a}} ''ch'', which also have this stroke; and the bottom stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is alveolar, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3134}} ''n'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}} ''l''. (This element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants, though this is not certain.) Two consonants, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations: {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~silence for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{IPA|[m]}}~{{IPA|[w]}} for obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}.\n\nWith vowel letters, a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels that ''can'' be iotized; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel ''is'' iotized. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, [[yin and yang|\"light\"]] (top or right) or [[yin and yang|\"dark\"]] (bottom or left). In the modern alphabet, an additional vertical stroke indicates [[i-mutation]], deriving {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315a}} {{IPA|[\u00f8]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315f}} {{IPA|[y]}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} {{IPA|[a]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} {{IPA|[o]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} {{IPA|[u]}}. However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally [[diphthong]]s ending in the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Indeed, in many [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialects]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} including the standard [[Seoul Dialect|dialect of Seoul]], some of these may still be diphthongs. Note: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} {{IPA|[e]}} as a morpheme is \u3153 combined with \u3163 as a vertical stroke. As a phoneme, its sound is not by i-mutation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} {{IPA|[\u028c]}}.\n\nBeside the letters, the Korean alphabet originally employed [[diacritic mark]]s to indicate [[pitch accent]]. A syllable with a high pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uac70\uc131}}) was marked with a dot (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302e</span>) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0c1\uc131}}) was marked with a double dot, like a colon (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302f</span>).

A now obsolete letter, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3186}}, represented a [[glottal stop]], which is pronounced in the throat and had closure represented by the top line, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131\u3137\u3148}}. Derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3186}} is {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e}}, in which the extra stroke represents a burst of aspiration.\n\n=== Vowel design ===\n[[File:Hangul Vowel Diag.svg|thumb|450px|A diagram showing the derivation of vowels in the Korean alphabet.]]\n\nVowel letters are based on three elements:\n\n* A horizontal line representing the flat Earth, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]''.\n* A point for the Sun in the heavens, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yang]]''. (This becomes a short stroke when written with a brush.)\n* A vertical line for the upright Human, the neutral mediator between the Heaven and Earth.\n\nShort strokes (dots in the earliest documents) were added to these three basic elements to derive the vowel letter:\n\n====Simple vowels====\n* Horizontal letters: these are mid-high back vowels.\n** bright {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} ''o''\n** dark {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} ''u''\n** dark {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} ''eu'' (''\u016d'')\n* Vertical letters: these were once low vowels.\n** bright {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} ''a''\n** dark {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} ''eo'' (''\u014f'')\n** bright {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u119e}}\n** neutral {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i''\n\n====Compound vowels====\nThe Korean alphabet does not have a letter for ''w'' sound. Since an ''o'' or ''u'' before an ''a'' or ''eo'' became a {{IPA|[w]}} sound, and {{IPA|[w]}} occurred nowhere else, {{IPA|[w]}} could always be analyzed as a [[phoneme|phonemic]] ''o'' or ''u'', and no letter for {{IPA|[w]}} was needed. However, vowel harmony is observed: \"dark\" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}}&nbsp;''u'' with \"dark\" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}}&nbsp;''eo'' for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315d}} ''wo;'' \"bright\" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}&nbsp;''o'' with \"bright\" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}&nbsp;''a'' for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3158}} ''wa'':\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3158}}&nbsp;<small>''wa''</small> = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}&nbsp;<small>''o''</small> + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}&nbsp;<small>''a''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315d}}&nbsp;<small>''wo''</small> = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}}&nbsp;<small>''u''</small> + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}}&nbsp;<small>''eo''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3159}}&nbsp;<small>''wae''</small> = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}&nbsp;<small>''o''</small> + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}}&nbsp;<small>''ae''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315e}}&nbsp;<small>''we''</small> = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}}&nbsp;<small>''u''</small> + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}}&nbsp;<small>''e''</small>\n\nThe compound vowels ending in {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i'' were originally [[diphthong]]s.

Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the baseline of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a ''y'' sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153\u314f\u315c\u3157}}.) A preceding ''y'' sound, called \"iotization\", was indicated by doubling this dot: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155\u3151\u3160\u315b}} <small>''yeo, ya, yu, yo''</small>. The three vowels that could not be iotized were written with a single stroke: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} <small>''eu, (arae a), i''</small>.\n\n{|class=\"infobox wikitable\" style=\"width:120px;\"\n|-\n!Simple\n!Iotized\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}}\n|\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}}\n|\n|}\n\nThe simple iotized vowels are:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}&nbsp;<small>''ya''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} &nbsp;<small>''a''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}&nbsp;<small>''yeo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} &nbsp;<small>''eo''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}&nbsp;<small>''yo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} &nbsp;<small>''o''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}&nbsp;<small>''yu''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} &nbsp;<small>''u''</small>\n\nThere are also two iotized diphthongs:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3152}}&nbsp;<small>''yae''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} &nbsp;<small>''ae''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3156}}&nbsp;<small>''ye''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} &nbsp;<small>''e''</small>\n\nThe Korean language of the 15th century had [[vowel harmony]] to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical [[morpheme]]s changed according to their environment, falling into groups that \"harmonized\" with each other. This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang'': If a root word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have ''yang'' vowels; conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes had to be ''yin'' as well. There was a third harmonic group called \"mediating\" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels.\n\nThe Korean neutral vowel was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u315c\u3153}} ''eu, u, eo''; the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3157\u314f}} ''\u0259, o, a,'' with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} were chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin'', ''yang'', and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}} ''\u0259'' is now obsolete except in the Jeju language.)\n\nThe third parameter in designing the vowel letters was choosing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century.\n\nThe uncertainty is primarily with the three letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3153\u314f}}. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *\u0264, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*\u0259, *e, *a}}. A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as {{IPA|*\u028c, *\u0264, *a}}.<ref>[http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/whitman/FrellWhitman.pdf The Japanese/Korean Vowel Correspondences] by Bjarke Frellesvig and John Whitman.

Here, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}} symbolically stands for the (sun in) heaven, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} stands for the (flat) earth, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} stands for an (upright) human. The original sequence of the Korean vowels, as stated in [[Hunminjeongeum]], listed these three vowels first, followed by various combinations. Thus, the original order of the vowels was: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}.

Note the dots on the vowels, the geometric symmetry of ''s'' and ''j'' in the first two syllables, the asymmetrical lip at the top-left of the ''d'' in the third, and the distinction between initial and final ''ieung'' in the last.]]\n[[File:Phagspa-Hangul comparison.svg|thumb|\n(Top) 'Phags-pa letters {{IPA|[k, t, p, s, l]}}, and their supposed Korean derivatives {{IPA|[k, t, p, ts, l]}}. Note the lip on both 'Phags-pa {{IPA|[t]}} and the Korean alphabet {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}}.<br/>\n(Bottom) Derivation of 'Phags-pa ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' from variants of the letter {{IPA|[h]}} (left) plus a subscript {{IPA|[w]}}, and analogous composition of the Korean alphabet ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' from variants of the basic letter {{IPA|[p]}} plus a circle.]]\n\nAlthough the ''Hunminjeong'eum Haerye'' explains the design of the consonantal letters in terms of [[articulatory phonetics]], as a purely innovative creation, several theories suggest which external sources may have inspired or influenced King Sejong's creation. Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University studied possible connections between Hangul and the Mongol [['Phags-pa script]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. He believed that the role of 'Phags-pa script in the creation of the Korean alphabet was quite limited:\n\n{{quotation|It should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that ['Phags-pa script's] role was quite limited ... Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: \"According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from ''the Mongol's [[phags-pa script]]''.\"<ref>''The Korean language reform of 1446: the origin, background, and Early History of the Korean Alphabet'', Gari Keith Ledyard. University of California, 1966, p. 367\u2013368.</ref> An affine theory states that the consonants are derived from the shape of the speaker's lips and tongue during the pronunciation of the consonants (initially, at least), but this would appear somewhat to strain credulity.<ref>Peter T. Daniels and William Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 219-220</ref>}}\n\nLedyard posits that five of the Korean letters have shapes inspired by 'Phags-pa; a sixth basic letter, the null initial {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}}, was invented by Sejong. The rest of the letters were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye''. However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'', but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}}.\n\nThe ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted the {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} (''gojeon'', \"''G\u01d4'' Seal Script\") in creating the Korean alphabet. The {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} has never been identified. The primary meaning of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' is \"old\" (\"Old Seal Script\"), frustrating philologists because the Korean alphabet bears no functional similarity to Chinese {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u7bc6\u5b57}} ''zhu\u00e0nz\u00ec'' [[seal script]]s. However, Ledyard believes {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' may be a pun on {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4}} ''M\u011bngg\u01d4'' \"Mongol\", and that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} is an abbreviation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4\u7bc6\u5b57}} \"Mongol Seal Script\", that is, the formal variant of the 'Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were 'Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.\n\nIf this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] China after the fall of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as \"barbarians\".\n\nAccording to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for consonant clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314a}}. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181 \u3134 \u3141 \u3145}}) were derived by ''removing'' the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it is easy to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} by removing the top, it is not clear how to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} in the traditional account, since the shape of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} is not analogous to those of the other plosives.\n\nThe explanation of the letter ''ng'' also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ''ng'', but by King Sejong's day, initial ''ng'' was either silent or pronounced {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ''ng'' (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}) would have looked almost identical to the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} was added to the null symbol {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} to create {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} and ''ng'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} was eventually lost.)\n\nAnother letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, which transcribed the Chinese [[Syllable onset|initial]] {{lang|zh|\u5fae}}. This represented either ''m'' or ''w'' in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} [m] plus {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (from 'Phags-pa [w]). In 'Phags-pa, a loop under a letter represented ''w'' after vowels, and Ledyard hypothesized that this became the loop at the bottom of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}. In 'Phags-pa the Chinese initial {{lang|zh|\u5fae}} is also transcribed as a compound with ''w'', but in its case the ''w'' is placed under an ''h''. Actually, the Chinese consonant series {{lang|zh|\u5fae\u975e\u6577}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' is transcribed in 'Phags-pa by the addition of a ''w'' under three graphic variants of the letter for ''h'', and the Korean alphabet parallels this convention by adding the ''w'' loop to the labial series {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141\u3142\u314d}} ''m'', ''b'', ''p'', producing now-obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171\u3178\u3184}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f.'' (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)\n\nAs a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Korean letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'' [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the 'Phags-pa {{Phagspa|v|\ua84a|da}} ''d'' [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} ''d''.\n\n==Obsolete letters==\n[[File:Hankidoemhanja.png|thumb|''[[Hankido]]'' [<sub>'''H.N-GI-DO'''</sub>], a martial art, using the obsolete vowel ''arae-a'' (top)|alt=|left|180x180px]]\n''Main article:'' [[Historical Chinese phonology]]\n\nNumerous obsolete Korean letters and sequences are no longer used in Korean.

Two modifications of the letter {{lang|ko|\u3139}} were introduced, one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which is silent finally, and one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which doubled between vowels. A hybrid {{lang|ko|\u3142-\u315c}} letter was introduced for words that alternated between those two sounds (that is, a {{IPA|/b/}}, which became {{IPA|/w/}} before a vowel).

Instead, letters are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] or [[morpheme|morphemic]] blocks of at least two and often three: a consonant or a doubled consonant called the ''initial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\ucd08\uc131, \u521d\u8072</span> ''choseong'' [[syllable onset]]), a vowel or [[diphthong]] called the ''medial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc911\uc131, \u4e2d\u8072</span> ''jungseong'' [[syllable nucleus]]), and, optionally, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the ''final'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc885\uc131, \u7d42\u8072</span> ''jongseong'' [[syllable coda]]). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the [[zero consonant|null initial]] {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ieung'' is used as a placeholder. (In the modern Korean alphabet, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two letters, an initial and a medial. Although the Korean alphabet had historically been organized into syllables, in the modern orthography it is first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone.\n\nThe sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng'' only occurs in final position, while the doubled letters that can occur in final position are limited to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3146}} ''ss'' and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3132}} ''kk''.\n\nNot including obsolete letters, 11,172 blocks are possible in the Korean alphabet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Letter placement within a block ===\n{{Alphabet}}\nThe placement or \"stacking\" of letters in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.\n\nConsonant and vowel sequences such as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3144}} ''bs,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315d}} ''wo,'' or obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3175}} ''bsd,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318b}} ''\u00fcye'' are written left to right.\n\nVowels (medials) are written under the initial consonant, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the vowel has a horizontal axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} ''eu,'' then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i,'' then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3162}} ''ui,'' then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:60px;\"|initial||  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:60px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|med.<br />2\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|med.&nbsp;1\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nA final consonant, if present, is always written at the bottom, under the vowel.

Therefore:\n* Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc74d}} ''eup'';\n* Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc30d}} ''ssang'';\n* Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down): {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub41c}} ''doen'';\n* Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1f}} ''balp''.\n\n=== Block shape ===\nNormally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block, so someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake the Korean alphabet for Hanja or Chinese.\n\nHowever, some recent fonts (for example Eun,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Korean.html|title=Korean Unicode Fonts|first=Craig|last=Welch|website=www.wazu.jp}}</ref> {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|HY\uae4a\uc740\uc0d8\ubb3cM}}, UnJamo) move towards the European practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and use whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u65b9\u5757\u5b57}}). They break one or more of the traditional rules:\n* Do not stretch initial consonant vertically, but leave [[Space (punctuation)|white space]] below if no lower vowel and/or no final consonant.\n* Do not stretch right-hand vowel vertically, but leave white space below if no final consonant. (Often the right-hand vowel extends farther down than the left-hand consonant, like a [[descender]] in European typography).\n* Do not stretch final consonant horizontally, but leave white space to its left.\n* Do not stretch or pad each block to a [[fixed width]], but allow [[kerning]] (variable width) where syllable blocks with no right-hand vowel and no double final consonant can be narrower than blocks that do have a right-hand vowel or double final consonant.\n\nThese fonts have been used as design accents on signs or headings, rather than for typesetting large volumes of body text.\n\n=== Linear Korean ===\nThere was a minor and unsuccessful movement in the early twentieth century to abolish syllabic blocks and write the letters individually and in a row, in the fashion of writing [[Latin alphabet]] as in English and other European languages, instead of the standard convention of \ubaa8\uc544\uc4f0\uae30 (''moa-sseugi'' 'assembled writing'). For example, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e\u314f\u3134\u3131\u3161\u3139}} would be written for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ud55c\uae00}} ''(Hangeul).''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&pg=PA162 |title=Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary - Keith L.

Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectal variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in multiple ways. Sejong seemed to prefer [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a [[phoneme|phonemic]] one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history the Korean alphabet was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns and later in verbs. The modern Korean alphabet is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase ''motaneun sarami'':\n\n<!-- vv These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. vv -->\n{{unordered list\n|1= Phonetic transcription and translation:\n{{block indent|<poem>motaneun sarami\n{{IPA|[mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.\u027ea.mi]}}\n''a person who cannot do it''</poem>}}\n|2= Phonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubaa8\ud0c0\ub294\uc0ac\ub77c\ubbf8}}\n{{IPA|/mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.la.mi/}}</poem>}}\n|3= Morphophonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\ud558\ub294\uc0ac\ub78c\uc774}}\n{{IPA|{{!}}mot-ha-n\u026fn-sa.lam-i{{!}}}}</poem>}}\n|4= Morpheme-by-morpheme [[interlinear gloss|gloss]]:\n{{block indent|1=<nowiki/>\n{{(!}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\u2013\ud558\u2013\ub294}}{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c{{=}}\uc774}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}mot-ha-neun{{!!}}saram=i\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}cannot-do-{{bracket|[[attributive verb|attributive]]}}{{!!}}person=[subject]\n{{!)}}}}\n}}\n<!-- ^^ These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. ^^ -->\n\nAfter the [[Gabo Reform]] in 1894, the [[Joseon Dynasty]] and later the [[Korean Empire]] started to write all official documents in the Korean alphabet. Under the government's management, proper usage of the Korean alphabet and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by Japan in 1910.\n\nThe [[Government-General of Korea]] popularised a writing style that mixed Hanja and the Korean alphabet, and was used in the later Joseon dynasty. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, to be relatively phonemic. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There is no source that Imperial Japanese Gov't took any part in revising Korean Orthography. A talk page discussion suggests that this entire paragraph is made-up and has been consistently be here at least since 2007. Rather, the opposite is commonly expressed in Korean documents, for example, Oppression against Korean Language Society. |date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[Hangul Society]], founded by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for orthography of the Korean alphabet is called ''Hangeul Matchumbeop'', whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.\n\n=== Mixed scripts ===\n[[File:Gardena in mixed Latin-hangul.jpg|thumb|The U.S. city of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in the Korean alphabet, with the {{IPA|[\u0261]}} written as Latin {{angle bracket|G}}. (Compare this large {{angle bracket|G}} with the smaller {{angle bracket|G}} in all-Latin ''Gardena'' below: The large {{angle bracket|G}} is fused (at bottom-right) with the Korean alphabet {{angle bracket|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}}} that would normally be used to transcribe ''Gardena''.)]]\nSince the Late Joseon dynasty period, various [[Korean mixed script|Hanja-Hangul mixed systems]] were used. In these systems, Hanja were used for lexical roots, and the Korean alphabet for grammatical words and inflections, much as ''kanji'' and ''kana'' are used in Japanese. Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.\n\n[[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|Indo-Arabic numerals]] are mixed in with the Korean alphabet, e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|2007\ub144 3\uc6d4 22\uc77c}} (22 March 2007).\n\n[[Latin script]] and occasionally other scripts may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated [[loanword]]s. Very occasionally non-Hangul letters may be mixed into Korean syllabic blocks, as {{nobreak|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|G\u314f}}}} ''Ga'' at right.\n\n==Readability==\nBecause of syllable clustering, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is more natural for the reader than dividing them into phonemes).<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=71}}</ref> Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=73}}</ref> Unlike linear alphabets such as [[Latin-script alphabet|those derived from Latin]], Korean orthography allows the reader to \"utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields\".<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=70}}</ref> Finally, since Korean syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the [[lexicon]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Hangul TypeStyles sansPen.svg|150x150px|right]]\nThe Korean alphabet may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is from top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Latin script was promoted by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], and has become overwhelmingly prevalent.\n\nIn ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'', the Korean alphabet was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found in stone carvings (on statues, for example).\n\nOver the centuries, an ink-brush style of [[calligraphy]] developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as traditional Korean calligraphy. This brush style is called ''gungche'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\uccb4 \u5bae\u9ad4}}), which means \"Palace Style\" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (''gungnyeo,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\ub140 \u5bae\u5973}}) of the court in [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]].\n\nModern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century. In 1993, new names for both [[Ming (typefaces)|Myeongjo]] ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u660e\u671d}}) and [[East Asian gothic typeface|Gothic]] styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names ''Batang'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc14\ud0d5}}, meaning \"background\") and ''Dotum'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub3cb\uc6c0}}, meaning \"stand out\") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nA sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish ''-eung'' from ''-ung'' even in small or untidy print, as the ''jongseong ieung'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}}) of such fonts usually lacks a [[serif]] that could be mistaken for the short vertical line of the letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} ''(u)''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Hangul consonant and vowel tables]]\n* [[Hangul orthography]]\n*[[Hangul supremacy|Hangul Scientific Supremacy]] \n* [[Korean phonology]]\n* [[Korean language and computers]]\n* [[Korean mixed script]]\n* [[Korean romanization]]\n** [[McCune-Reischauer]]\n** [[Revised Romanization]]\n** [[Yale Romanization of Korean]]\n* [[Korean braille]]\n* [[Korean manual alphabet]]\n* [[Korean spelling alphabet]]\n* [[Myongjo]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last=Chang | first=Suk-jin | title=Korean |location=Philadelphia | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-1-55619-728-4 | chapter=Scripts and Sounds }} (Volume 4 of the ''London Oriental and African Language Library'').\n* {{cite book |last = Hannas |first = William C. |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Kim-Renaud |editor-first=Young-Key |title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC |year=1997 |publisher=University of Hawai`i Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1723-7 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |first1=Iksop |last1=Lee |first2=Samuel Robert |last2=Ramsey |title=The Korean Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NN-yIdLOkCoC |year=2000 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-9130-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |title=Hangeul Matchumbeop |year=1988 |publisher=The Ministry of Education of South Korea |url = http://www.korean.go.kr/search/grammar/rule/collect_rule.html }}\n* {{cite book |isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4 |title=Writing Systems |first=Geoffrey |last=Sampson |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1990 |ref=Sampson |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/writingsystems00geof }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Silva |first=David J. |title=Western attitudes toward the Korean language: An Overview of Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth-Century Mission Literature |journal=[[Korean Studies (journal)|Korean Studies]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=270\u2013286 |year=2002 |doi=10.1353/ks.2004.0013 |hdl=10106/11257 |url=https://uta-ir.tdl.org/uta-ir/bitstream/10106/11257/1/WesternAttitudesKoreanLanguage-Silva.pdf }}\n* {{cite book |first=Ho-Min |last=Sohn |title=The Korean Language |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx6gdJIOcoQC |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36943-5 |series=Cambridge Language Surveys }}\n* {{cite book |first=Jae Jung |last=Song |title=The Korean Language: Structure, Use and Context |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D36c9l_u0sC |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-203-39082-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Insup |chapter=The Korean writing system: An alphabet?

The alphabetical order of the Korean alphabet does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, first are [[velar consonant]]s, then [[Coronal consonant|coronals]], [[Labial consonant|labials]], [[sibilant]]s, etc. The vowels come after the consonants.\n\n=== Historical orders ===\nThe order from the ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]'' in 1446 was:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u314b \u3181 \u3137 \u314c \u3134 \u3142 \u314d \u3141 \u3148 \u314a \u3145 \u3186 \u314e \u3147 \u3139 \u317f}} \n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}\n\nIn 1527, [[Choe Sejin]] reorganized the alphabet in [[Hunmongjahoe]]:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3181 \u314b \u314c \u314d \u3148 \u314a \u317f \u3147 \u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u318d}}\n\nThis is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double letters that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (') and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (ng). Thus, when the [[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n governments implemented full use of the Korean alphabet, they ordered these letters differently, with North Korea placing new letters at the end of the alphabet and South Korea grouping similar letters together.\n\n=== North Korean order ===\nThe new, double, letters are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the ' {{lang|ko|\u3147|nocat=yes}}, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.\n\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3138 \u3143 \u3146 \u3149 \u3147}}\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u3150 \u3152 \u3154 \u3156 \u315a \u315f \u3162 \u3158 \u315d \u3159 \u315e}}\n\nAll digraphs and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s, including the old diphthongs {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}}, are placed after the simple vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.\n\nThe order of the final letters is:\n\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3146}}\n\nUnlike when it is initial, this {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} is pronounced, as the nasal {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng,'' which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double letters are placed to the very end, as in the initial order, but the combined consonants are ordered immediately after their first element.\n\n=== South Korean order ===\nIn the Southern order, double letters are placed immediately after their single counterparts:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131\u3132\u3134\u3137\u3138\u3139\u3141\u3142\u3143\u3145\u3146\u3147\u3148\u3149\u314a\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3150 \u3151 \u3152 \u3153 \u3154 \u3155 \u3156 \u3157 \u3158 \u3159 \u315a \u315b \u315c \u315d \u315e \u315f \u3160 \u3161 \u3162 \u3163}}\n\nThe modern [[monophthong]]al vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: ''i'' is added first, then [[Iotization|iotized]], then iotized with added ''i''. [[Diphthong]]s beginning with ''w'' are ordered according to their spelling, as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} or {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} plus a second vowel, not as separate [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.\n\nThe order of the final letters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}) is:\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3132 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3146 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e}}\n\n(\"None\" means there is no final letter.)\n\nEvery syllable begins with a consonant (or the silent \u3147) that is followed by a vowel (e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2e4}}). Some syllables such as \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ec}}\" and \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ed}}\" have a final consonant or final consonant cluster ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}). Then, 399 combinations are possible for \"two-letter syllables\" and 10,773 possible combinations for syllables with more than two \"letters\" (27 possible final endings), for a total of 11,172 possible combinations of Korean alphabet \"letters\" to form syllables.\n\n==Letter names==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Giyuk.ogg|title=Korean consonants|description=names of the Korean consonant letters (South Korean)\n|filename2=Korean vowels.ogg|title2=Korean vowels|description2=names of the Korean vowel letters\n}}\nLetters in the Korean alphabet were named by Korean linguist [[Choe Sejin]] in 1527. South Korea uses Choe's traditional names, most of which follow the format of ''letter'' + ''i'' + ''eu'' + ''letter''. Choe described these names by listing Hanja characters with similar pronunciations. However, as the syllables {{lang|ko|\uc73d}} ''euk'', {{lang|ko|\uc743}} ''eut'', and {{lang|ko|\uc74f}} ''eut'' did not occur in Hanja, Choe gave those letters the modified names {{lang|ko|\uae30\uc5ed}} ''gi'''yeok''''', {{lang|ko|\ub514\uadff}} ''di'''geut''''', and {{lang|ko|\uc2dc\uc637}} ''si'''ot''''', using Hanja that didn't fit the pattern (for \uae30\uc5ed) or native Korean syllables (for \ub514\uadff and \uc2dc\uc637).\n\nOriginally, Choe gave {{lang|ko|\u3148}}, {{lang|ko|\u314a}}, {{lang|ko|\u314b}}, {{lang|ko|\u314c}}, {{lang|ko|\u314d}}, and {{lang|ko|\u314e}} the irregular one-syllable names of ''ji'', ''chi'', ''\u1e33i'', ''\u1e6di'', ''p\u0323i'', and ''hi'', because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]''. However, after establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which let all consonants be used as finals, the names changed to the present forms.\n\nNorth Korea regularized Choe's original names when it made the Korean alphabet its official orthography.\n\n=== In North Korea ===\nThe chart below shows names used in North Korea for consonants in the Korean alphabet.

The Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three, grouping sounds into [[syllable]]s, using distinct symbols for [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]], and in some cases using distinct strokes to indicate [[distinctive feature]]s such as [[place of articulation]] ([[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]]) and [[manner of articulation]] ([[plosive]], [[nasal stop|nasal]], [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]) for consonants, and [[iotization]] (a preceding ''i-''sound), [[Vowel harmony|harmonic class]] and [[i-mutation]] for vowels.\n\nFor instance, the consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} \u1e6d {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is a plosive, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3186}} ''\u0294'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} ''g'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}} ''j'', which have the same stroke (the last is an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], a plosive\u2013fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is aspirated, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e}} ''h'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b}} ''\u1e33'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314a}} ''ch'', which also have this stroke; and the bottom stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is alveolar, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3134}} ''n'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}} ''l''. (This element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants, though this is not certain.) Two consonants, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations: {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~silence for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{IPA|[m]}}~{{IPA|[w]}} for obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}.\n\nWith vowel letters, a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels that ''can'' be iotized; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel ''is'' iotized. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, [[yin and yang|\"light\"]] (top or right) or [[yin and yang|\"dark\"]] (bottom or left). In the modern alphabet, an additional vertical stroke indicates [[i-mutation]], deriving {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315a}} {{IPA|[\u00f8]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315f}} {{IPA|[y]}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} {{IPA|[a]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} {{IPA|[o]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} {{IPA|[u]}}. However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally [[diphthong]]s ending in the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Indeed, in many [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialects]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} including the standard [[Seoul Dialect|dialect of Seoul]], some of these may still be diphthongs. Note: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} {{IPA|[e]}} as a morpheme is \u3153 combined with \u3163 as a vertical stroke. As a phoneme, its sound is not by i-mutation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} {{IPA|[\u028c]}}.\n\nBeside the letters, the Korean alphabet originally employed [[diacritic mark]]s to indicate [[pitch accent]]. A syllable with a high pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uac70\uc131}}) was marked with a dot (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302e</span>) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0c1\uc131}}) was marked with a double dot, like a colon (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302f</span>).

Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the baseline of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a ''y'' sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153\u314f\u315c\u3157}}.) A preceding ''y'' sound, called \"iotization\", was indicated by doubling this dot: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155\u3151\u3160\u315b}} <small>''yeo, ya, yu, yo''</small>. The three vowels that could not be iotized were written with a single stroke: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} <small>''eu, (arae a), i''</small>.\n\n{|class=\"infobox wikitable\" style=\"width:120px;\"\n|-\n!Simple\n!Iotized\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}}\n|\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}}\n|\n|}\n\nThe simple iotized vowels are:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}&nbsp;<small>''ya''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} &nbsp;<small>''a''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}&nbsp;<small>''yeo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} &nbsp;<small>''eo''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}&nbsp;<small>''yo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} &nbsp;<small>''o''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}&nbsp;<small>''yu''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} &nbsp;<small>''u''</small>\n\nThere are also two iotized diphthongs:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3152}}&nbsp;<small>''yae''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} &nbsp;<small>''ae''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3156}}&nbsp;<small>''ye''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} &nbsp;<small>''e''</small>\n\nThe Korean language of the 15th century had [[vowel harmony]] to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical [[morpheme]]s changed according to their environment, falling into groups that \"harmonized\" with each other. This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang'': If a root word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have ''yang'' vowels; conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes had to be ''yin'' as well. There was a third harmonic group called \"mediating\" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels.\n\nThe Korean neutral vowel was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u315c\u3153}} ''eu, u, eo''; the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3157\u314f}} ''\u0259, o, a,'' with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} were chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin'', ''yang'', and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}} ''\u0259'' is now obsolete except in the Jeju language.)\n\nThe third parameter in designing the vowel letters was choosing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century.\n\nThe uncertainty is primarily with the three letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3153\u314f}}. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *\u0264, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*\u0259, *e, *a}}. A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as {{IPA|*\u028c, *\u0264, *a}}.<ref>[http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/whitman/FrellWhitman.pdf The Japanese/Korean Vowel Correspondences] by Bjarke Frellesvig and John Whitman.

The original sequence of the Korean vowels, as stated in [[Hunminjeongeum]], listed these three vowels first, followed by various combinations. Thus, the original order of the vowels was: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}.

Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University studied possible connections between Hangul and the Mongol [['Phags-pa script]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. He believed that the role of 'Phags-pa script in the creation of the Korean alphabet was quite limited:\n\n{{quotation|It should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that ['Phags-pa script's] role was quite limited ... Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: \"According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from ''the Mongol's [[phags-pa script]]''.\"<ref>''The Korean language reform of 1446: the origin, background, and Early History of the Korean Alphabet'', Gari Keith Ledyard.

The rest of the letters were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye''. However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'', but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}}.\n\nThe ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted the {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} (''gojeon'', \"''G\u01d4'' Seal Script\") in creating the Korean alphabet. The {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} has never been identified. The primary meaning of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' is \"old\" (\"Old Seal Script\"), frustrating philologists because the Korean alphabet bears no functional similarity to Chinese {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u7bc6\u5b57}} ''zhu\u00e0nz\u00ec'' [[seal script]]s. However, Ledyard believes {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' may be a pun on {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4}} ''M\u011bngg\u01d4'' \"Mongol\", and that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} is an abbreviation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4\u7bc6\u5b57}} \"Mongol Seal Script\", that is, the formal variant of the 'Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were 'Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.\n\nIf this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] China after the fall of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as \"barbarians\".\n\nAccording to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for consonant clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314a}}. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181 \u3134 \u3141 \u3145}}) were derived by ''removing'' the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it is easy to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} by removing the top, it is not clear how to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} in the traditional account, since the shape of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} is not analogous to those of the other plosives.\n\nThe explanation of the letter ''ng'' also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ''ng'', but by King Sejong's day, initial ''ng'' was either silent or pronounced {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ''ng'' (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}) would have looked almost identical to the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} was added to the null symbol {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} to create {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} and ''ng'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} was eventually lost.)\n\nAnother letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, which transcribed the Chinese [[Syllable onset|initial]] {{lang|zh|\u5fae}}. This represented either ''m'' or ''w'' in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} [m] plus {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (from 'Phags-pa [w]). In 'Phags-pa, a loop under a letter represented ''w'' after vowels, and Ledyard hypothesized that this became the loop at the bottom of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}. In 'Phags-pa the Chinese initial {{lang|zh|\u5fae}} is also transcribed as a compound with ''w'', but in its case the ''w'' is placed under an ''h''. Actually, the Chinese consonant series {{lang|zh|\u5fae\u975e\u6577}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' is transcribed in 'Phags-pa by the addition of a ''w'' under three graphic variants of the letter for ''h'', and the Korean alphabet parallels this convention by adding the ''w'' loop to the labial series {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141\u3142\u314d}} ''m'', ''b'', ''p'', producing now-obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171\u3178\u3184}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f.'' (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)\n\nAs a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Korean letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'' [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the 'Phags-pa {{Phagspa|v|\ua84a|da}} ''d'' [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} ''d''.\n\n==Obsolete letters==\n[[File:Hankidoemhanja.png|thumb|''[[Hankido]]'' [<sub>'''H.N-GI-DO'''</sub>], a martial art, using the obsolete vowel ''arae-a'' (top)|alt=|left|180x180px]]\n''Main article:'' [[Historical Chinese phonology]]\n\nNumerous obsolete Korean letters and sequences are no longer used in Korean.

Two modifications of the letter {{lang|ko|\u3139}} were introduced, one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which is silent finally, and one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which doubled between vowels. A hybrid {{lang|ko|\u3142-\u315c}} letter was introduced for words that alternated between those two sounds (that is, a {{IPA|/b/}}, which became {{IPA|/w/}} before a vowel).

Instead, letters are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] or [[morpheme|morphemic]] blocks of at least two and often three: a consonant or a doubled consonant called the ''initial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\ucd08\uc131, \u521d\u8072</span> ''choseong'' [[syllable onset]]), a vowel or [[diphthong]] called the ''medial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc911\uc131, \u4e2d\u8072</span> ''jungseong'' [[syllable nucleus]]), and, optionally, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the ''final'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc885\uc131, \u7d42\u8072</span> ''jongseong'' [[syllable coda]]). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the [[zero consonant|null initial]] {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ieung'' is used as a placeholder. (In the modern Korean alphabet, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two letters, an initial and a medial. Although the Korean alphabet had historically been organized into syllables, in the modern orthography it is first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone.\n\nThe sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng'' only occurs in final position, while the doubled letters that can occur in final position are limited to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3146}} ''ss'' and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3132}} ''kk''.\n\nNot including obsolete letters, 11,172 blocks are possible in the Korean alphabet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Letter placement within a block ===\n{{Alphabet}}\nThe placement or \"stacking\" of letters in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.\n\nConsonant and vowel sequences such as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3144}} ''bs,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315d}} ''wo,'' or obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3175}} ''bsd,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318b}} ''\u00fcye'' are written left to right.\n\nVowels (medials) are written under the initial consonant, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the vowel has a horizontal axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} ''eu,'' then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i,'' then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3162}} ''ui,'' then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:60px;\"|initial||  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:60px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|med.<br />2\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|med.&nbsp;1\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nA final consonant, if present, is always written at the bottom, under the vowel.

Therefore:\n* Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc74d}} ''eup'';\n* Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc30d}} ''ssang'';\n* Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down): {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub41c}} ''doen'';\n* Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1f}} ''balp''.\n\n=== Block shape ===\nNormally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block, so someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake the Korean alphabet for Hanja or Chinese.\n\nHowever, some recent fonts (for example Eun,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Korean.html|title=Korean Unicode Fonts|first=Craig|last=Welch|website=www.wazu.jp}}</ref> {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|HY\uae4a\uc740\uc0d8\ubb3cM}}, UnJamo) move towards the European practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and use whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u65b9\u5757\u5b57}}). They break one or more of the traditional rules:\n* Do not stretch initial consonant vertically, but leave [[Space (punctuation)|white space]] below if no lower vowel and/or no final consonant.\n* Do not stretch right-hand vowel vertically, but leave white space below if no final consonant.

For example, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e\u314f\u3134\u3131\u3161\u3139}} would be written for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ud55c\uae00}} ''(Hangeul).''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&pg=PA162 |title=Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary - Keith L.

Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectal variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in multiple ways. Sejong seemed to prefer [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a [[phoneme|phonemic]] one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history the Korean alphabet was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns and later in verbs. The modern Korean alphabet is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase ''motaneun sarami'':\n\n<!-- vv These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. vv -->\n{{unordered list\n|1= Phonetic transcription and translation:\n{{block indent|<poem>motaneun sarami\n{{IPA|[mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.\u027ea.mi]}}\n''a person who cannot do it''</poem>}}\n|2= Phonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubaa8\ud0c0\ub294\uc0ac\ub77c\ubbf8}}\n{{IPA|/mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.la.mi/}}</poem>}}\n|3= Morphophonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\ud558\ub294\uc0ac\ub78c\uc774}}\n{{IPA|{{!}}mot-ha-n\u026fn-sa.lam-i{{!}}}}</poem>}}\n|4= Morpheme-by-morpheme [[interlinear gloss|gloss]]:\n{{block indent|1=<nowiki/>\n{{(!}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\u2013\ud558\u2013\ub294}}{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c{{=}}\uc774}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}mot-ha-neun{{!!}}saram=i\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}cannot-do-{{bracket|[[attributive verb|attributive]]}}{{!!}}person=[subject]\n{{!)}}}}\n}}\n<!-- ^^ These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. ^^ -->\n\nAfter the [[Gabo Reform]] in 1894, the [[Joseon Dynasty]] and later the [[Korean Empire]] started to write all official documents in the Korean alphabet. Under the government's management, proper usage of the Korean alphabet and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by Japan in 1910.\n\nThe [[Government-General of Korea]] popularised a writing style that mixed Hanja and the Korean alphabet, and was used in the later Joseon dynasty. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, to be relatively phonemic. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There is no source that Imperial Japanese Gov't took any part in revising Korean Orthography. A talk page discussion suggests that this entire paragraph is made-up and has been consistently be here at least since 2007. Rather, the opposite is commonly expressed in Korean documents, for example, Oppression against Korean Language Society. |date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[Hangul Society]], founded by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for orthography of the Korean alphabet is called ''Hangeul Matchumbeop'', whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.\n\n=== Mixed scripts ===\n[[File:Gardena in mixed Latin-hangul.jpg|thumb|The U.S. city of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in the Korean alphabet, with the {{IPA|[\u0261]}} written as Latin {{angle bracket|G}}. (Compare this large {{angle bracket|G}} with the smaller {{angle bracket|G}} in all-Latin ''Gardena'' below: The large {{angle bracket|G}} is fused (at bottom-right) with the Korean alphabet {{angle bracket|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}}} that would normally be used to transcribe ''Gardena''.)]]\nSince the Late Joseon dynasty period, various [[Korean mixed script|Hanja-Hangul mixed systems]] were used. In these systems, Hanja were used for lexical roots, and the Korean alphabet for grammatical words and inflections, much as ''kanji'' and ''kana'' are used in Japanese. Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.\n\n[[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|Indo-Arabic numerals]] are mixed in with the Korean alphabet, e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|2007\ub144 3\uc6d4 22\uc77c}} (22 March 2007).\n\n[[Latin script]] and occasionally other scripts may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated [[loanword]]s. Very occasionally non-Hangul letters may be mixed into Korean syllabic blocks, as {{nobreak|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|G\u314f}}}} ''Ga'' at right.\n\n==Readability==\nBecause of syllable clustering, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is more natural for the reader than dividing them into phonemes).<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=71}}</ref> Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=73}}</ref> Unlike linear alphabets such as [[Latin-script alphabet|those derived from Latin]], Korean orthography allows the reader to \"utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields\".<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=70}}</ref> Finally, since Korean syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the [[lexicon]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Hangul TypeStyles sansPen.svg|150x150px|right]]\nThe Korean alphabet may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is from top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Latin script was promoted by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], and has become overwhelmingly prevalent.\n\nIn ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'', the Korean alphabet was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found in stone carvings (on statues, for example).\n\nOver the centuries, an ink-brush style of [[calligraphy]] developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as traditional Korean calligraphy. This brush style is called ''gungche'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\uccb4 \u5bae\u9ad4}}), which means \"Palace Style\" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (''gungnyeo,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\ub140 \u5bae\u5973}}) of the court in [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]].\n\nModern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century. In 1993, new names for both [[Ming (typefaces)|Myeongjo]] ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u660e\u671d}}) and [[East Asian gothic typeface|Gothic]] styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names ''Batang'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc14\ud0d5}}, meaning \"background\") and ''Dotum'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub3cb\uc6c0}}, meaning \"stand out\") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nA sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish ''-eung'' from ''-ung'' even in small or untidy print, as the ''jongseong ieung'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}}) of such fonts usually lacks a [[serif]] that could be mistaken for the short vertical line of the letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} ''(u)''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Hangul consonant and vowel tables]]\n* [[Hangul orthography]]\n*[[Hangul supremacy|Hangul Scientific Supremacy]] \n* [[Korean phonology]]\n* [[Korean language and computers]]\n* [[Korean mixed script]]\n* [[Korean romanization]]\n** [[McCune-Reischauer]]\n** [[Revised Romanization]]\n** [[Yale Romanization of Korean]]\n* [[Korean braille]]\n* [[Korean manual alphabet]]\n* [[Korean spelling alphabet]]\n* [[Myongjo]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last=Chang | first=Suk-jin | title=Korean |location=Philadelphia | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-1-55619-728-4 | chapter=Scripts and Sounds }} (Volume 4 of the ''London Oriental and African Language Library'').\n* {{cite book |last = Hannas |first = William C. |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Kim-Renaud |editor-first=Young-Key |title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC |year=1997 |publisher=University of Hawai`i Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1723-7 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |first1=Iksop |last1=Lee |first2=Samuel Robert |last2=Ramsey |title=The Korean Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NN-yIdLOkCoC |year=2000 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-9130-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |title=Hangeul Matchumbeop |year=1988 |publisher=The Ministry of Education of South Korea |url = http://www.korean.go.kr/search/grammar/rule/collect_rule.html }}\n* {{cite book |isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4 |title=Writing Systems |first=Geoffrey |last=Sampson |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1990 |ref=Sampson |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/writingsystems00geof }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Silva |first=David J. |title=Western attitudes toward the Korean language: An Overview of Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth-Century Mission Literature |journal=[[Korean Studies (journal)|Korean Studies]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=270\u2013286 |year=2002 |doi=10.1353/ks.2004.0013 |hdl=10106/11257 |url=https://uta-ir.tdl.org/uta-ir/bitstream/10106/11257/1/WesternAttitudesKoreanLanguage-Silva.pdf }}\n* {{cite book |first=Ho-Min |last=Sohn |title=The Korean Language |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx6gdJIOcoQC |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36943-5 |series=Cambridge Language Surveys }}\n* {{cite book |first=Jae Jung |last=Song |title=The Korean Language: Structure, Use and Context |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D36c9l_u0sC |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-203-39082-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Insup |chapter=The Korean writing system: An alphabet?

She is the female aspect of [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] and in some origin stories she comes from his tears:\n\n\"Then at last Avalokiteshvara arrived at the summit of Marpori, the 'Red Hill', in Lhasa. Gazing out, he perceived that the lake on Otang, the 'Plain of Milk', resembled the Hell of Ceaseless Torment. Myriad beings were undergoing the agonies of boiling, burning, hunger, thirst, yet they never perished, sending forth hideous cries of anguish all the while. When Avalokiteshvara saw this, tears sprang to his eyes. A teardrop from his right eye fell to the plain and became the reverend [[Bhrikuti]], who declared: \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavour!\" Bhrikuti was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's right eye, and was reborn in a later life as the Nepalese princess Tritsun. A teardrop from his left eye fell upon the plain and became the reverend Tara. She also declared, \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavor!\" T\u0101r\u0101 was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's left eye.\"\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 manifests in many different forms. In Tibet, these forms included Green T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Nepalese Princess ([[Bhrikuti]]),<ref>((Min Bahadur Shakya |title=The Life and Contribution of the Nepalese Princess Bhrikuti Devi to Tibetan History |year=2009 |publisher=Pilgrims Publishing})</ref> and White T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo ([[Princess Wencheng]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Sakyapa Sonam Gyaltsen |title=The Clear Mirror: A Traditional Account of Tibet's Golden Age |year=1996 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |pages=64\u201365 |isbn=1-55939-048-4 }}</ref>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is also known as a [[salvation|saviouress]], as a heavenly deity who hears the cries of beings experiencing misery in [[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]].\n\nWhether the T\u0101r\u0101 figure originated as a Buddhist or Hindu goddess is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars.

As one of the three deities of long life, White Tara (''Saraswati'') is associated with longevity. White Tara counteracts illness and thereby helps to bring about a long life.

Her name is Jnanachanrda or Yeshe Dawa, which means \"Moon of [[:wikt:primordial|Primordial]] Awareness\". For quite a number of [[aeon]]s she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning [[bodhicitta]] - the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further. At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only \"weak minded worldlings\" who see gender as a barrier to attaining [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until [[samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]] is no more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/samhita-arni-points-out-how-caste-and-gender-prejudice-are-inextricably-linked/article17433634.ece|title=Gender doesn\u2019t come in the way of Nirvana|last=Arni|first=Samhita|date=2017-03-09|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-12-14|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> She then stays in a palace in a state of [[meditation]] for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme [[bodhi]] as the Goddess T\u0101r\u0101 in many world systems to come.\n\nWith this story in mind, it is interesting to juxtapose this with a quotation from the [[14th Dalai Lama]] about T\u0101r\u0101, spoken at a conference on Compassionate Action in Newport Beach, CA in 1989:\n\n<blockquote>There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess T\u0101r\u0101. Following her cultivation of [[bodhicitta]], the bodhisattva's motivation, she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and she felt that there were too few people who attained [[Buddhahood]] as women. So she vowed, \"I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all my lifetimes along the path I vow to be born as a woman, and in my final lifetime when I attain Buddhahood, then, too, I will be a woman.\"</blockquote>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101, then, embodies certain ideals which make her attractive to women practitioners, and her emergence as a Bodhisattva can be seen as a part of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism's reaching out to women, and becoming more inclusive even in 6th-century CE [[India]].\n\n==Symbols and associations==\n[[File:Green tara 1947 wk.jpg|upright|thumb|Painting of Buddhist goddess Green Tara by Prithvi Man Chitrakari done in 1947.]]\nT\u0101r\u0101's name literally means \"star\" or \"planet\", and therefore she is associated with navigation and travel both literally and metaphorically as spiritual crossing to the 'other side' of the ocean of existence (enlightenment).<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 310</ref> Hence she is known literally as \"she who saves\" in Tibetan.<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref> In the ''108 Names of the Holy Tara'', Tara is 'Leader of the caravans ..... who showeth the way to those who have lost it' and she is named as ''Dhruva'', the Sanskrit name for the [[North Star]].<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref>\n\nAccording to Miranda Shaw, \"[[Motherhood]] is central to the conception of Tara\".<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316</ref> Her titles include \"loving mother\", \"supreme mother\", \"mother of the world\",  \"universal mother\" and \"mother of all Buddhas\".<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316-317</ref>\n\nShe is most often shown with the blue lotus or night lotus (''utpala''), which releases its fragrance with the appearance of the moon and therefore T\u0101r\u0101 is also associated with the moon and night.<ref>Beer, Robert; The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols, page 170</ref><ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref> \n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is also a forest goddess, particularly in her form as ''Khadiravani'', \"dweller in the Khadira forest\" and is generally associated with plant life, flowers, acacia (khadira) trees and the wind. Because of her association with nature and plants, T\u0101r\u0101 is also known as a healing goddess (especially as White T\u0101r\u0101) and as a goddess of nurturing quality and fertility.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 324</ref> Her pure land in Mount Potala is described as \"Covered with manifold trees and creepers, resounding with the sound of many birds, And with murmur of waterfalls, thronged with wild beasts of many kinds; Many species of flowers grow everywhere.\"<ref>Edward Conze, Buddhist Texts Through the Ages, p.196.</ref> Her association with the wind element (vaayu) also means that she is swift in responding to calls for any aid.\n\n==T\u0101r\u0101 as a saviouress==\n[[File:GreenTara150.jpg|upright|thumb|Green Tara, [[Nepal]], 14th century.

Bell Fund, 1966, 66.179.]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 also embodies many of the qualities of feminine principle. She is known as the Mother of Mercy and Compassion. She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children. As Green T\u0101r\u0101 she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter within the samsaric world. As White T\u0101r\u0101 she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. As Red T\u0101r\u0101 she teaches discriminating awareness about created phenomena, and how to turn raw desire into compassion and love. As Blue T\u0101r\u0101 ([[Ekajati]]) she becomes a protector in the [[Nyingma]] lineage, who expresses a ferocious, wrathful, female energy whose invocation destroys all Dharmic obstacles and engenders good luck and swift spiritual awakening.<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nWithin [[Tibetan Buddhism]], she has 21 major forms in all, each tied to a certain color and energy. And each offers some feminine attribute, of ultimate benefit to the spiritual aspirant who asks for her assistance.\n\nAnother quality of feminine principle which she shares with the [[dakini]]s is playfulness. As [[John Blofeld]] expands upon in ''Bodhisattva of Compassion'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=Bodhisattva of Compassion: The Mystical Tradition of Kuan Yin |year=2009 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |quote= |url=https://archive.org/details/bodhisattvaofcom00john |isbn=1-59030-735-6 |url-access=registration }}</ref> T\u0101r\u0101 is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of [[dharma]] practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In ''Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Thinley Norbu |title=Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis |year=1999 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |isbn=0-87773-885-8 }}</ref> Thinley Norbu explores this as \"Playmind\". Applied to T\u0101r\u0101 one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development.\n\nThese qualities of feminine principle then, found an expression in Indian [[Mahayana]] Buddhism and the emerging [[Vajrayana]] of Tibet, as the many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, as dakinis, as [[Prajnaparamita]], and as many other local and specialized feminine divinities. As the worship of T\u0101r\u0101 developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose and set down [[sadhana]]s, or tantric meditation practices. Two ways of approach to her began to emerge. In one common folk and lay practitioners would simply directly appeal to her to ease some of the travails of worldly life. In the second, she became a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity whose practice would be used by monks or tantric yogis in order to develop her qualities in themselves, ultimately leading through her to the source of her qualities, which are [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]], Enlightened Compassion, and Enlightened Mind.\n\n==T\u0101r\u0101 as a Tantric deity==\n[[File:Tara thangka.jpg|thumb|right|18th-century Eastern [[Tibet]]an [[thanka]], with the Green Tara (Samaya Tara Yogini) in the center and the Blue, Red, White and Yellow taras in the corners, [[Rubin Museum of Art]]]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 as a focus for tantric deity [[yoga]] can be traced back to the time period of [[Padmasambhava]]. There is a Red T\u0101r\u0101 practice which was given by Padmasambhava to [[Yeshe Tsogyal]]. He asked that she [[terton|hide it as a treasure]]. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as [[Sakya Trizin]], present head of the [[Sakyapa]] sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], who released it to his western students.\n\nMartin Willson in ''In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101'' traces many different lineages of T\u0101r\u0101 Tantras, that is T\u0101r\u0101 scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}</ref> For example, a T\u0101r\u0101 sadhana was revealed to [[Tilopa]] (988\u20131069 CE), the human father of the [[Karma Kagyu]]. [[Atisa]], the great translator and founder of the [[Kadampa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of T\u0101r\u0101. He composed a praise to her, and three T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhanas. Martin Willson's work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that T\u0101r\u0101 as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day.\n\nThe practices themselves usually present T\u0101r\u0101 as a tutelary deity (thug dam, [[yidam]]) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one's mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from [[Jnana|Buddha Jnana]]. As John Blofeld puts it in ''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet'':\n\n{{quote|The function of the Yidam is one of the profound mysteries of the Vajrayana...Especially during the first years of practice the Yidam is of immense importance. Yidam is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit word \"I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva\"\u2014the in-dwelling deity; but, where the Hindus take the I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva for an actual deity who has been invited to dwell in the devotee's heart, the Yidams of Tantric Buddhism are in fact the emanations of the adepts own mind. Or are they? To some extent they seem to belong to that order of phenomena which in Jungian terms are called archetypes and are therefore the common property of the entire human race. Even among Tantric Buddhists, there may be a division of opinion as to how far the Yidams are the creations of individual minds. What is quite certain is that they are not independently existing gods and goddesses; and yet, paradoxically, there are many occasions when they must be so regarded.''<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: A Practical Guide to the Theory, Purpose, and Techniques of Tantric Meditation |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |page=176 |isbn=0-14-019336-7 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:Kurukulla (Red Tara) - AMNH - DSC06232.JPG|thumb|[[Kurukulla]] thangka, American Museum of Natural History, Manhattan, New York City]]\n[[File:Sarasvati thangka.jpg|thumb|[[Sarasvati]] thangka, Eastern Tibet, 18th century]]\nThere are many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, including various popular lists of 21 different emanations of T\u0101r\u0101. Green T\u0101r\u0101, (\u015by\u0101mat\u0101r\u0101) associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity is the most depicted and the central aspect of T\u0101r\u0101 from which others such as the 21 T\u0101r\u0101s emanate. In her Green form, she is often also known as Khadirava\u1e47i-T\u0101r\u0101 (T\u0101r\u0101 of the acacia forest), who appeared to [[Nagarjuna]] in the Khadiravani forest of [[South India]] and protects from the eight great fears. She is often accompanied by her two attendants M\u0101r\u012bc\u012b and Ekaja\u1e6d\u0101. Dharmachari Purna writes on the various forms of Tara:\n\n<blockquote>T\u0101r\u0101 is in fact the name of a whole class of deities. She appears in all the five colours of the Jinas. There are at least ten green forms, seven white, five yellow, two blue and one red. As Sarvaj\u00f1amitra says of her form: 'It is a universal form, varied like crystal, since it changes according to circumstance'.She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her figure is shown in virtually all postures from standing to sitting, full lotus, half lotus, one leg down, and both legs down. There is apparently also a reclining T\u0101r\u0101. She has two-armed forms, four arms, eight arms, twelve arms, and Getty even mentions a Tibetan painting showing a standing T\u0101r\u0101 with 'one thousand heads and arms'. Ghosh lists seventy-six distinct forms of T\u0101r\u0101, and tradition tells us there are one hundred and eight names for her.<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Sarvajnamitra she has a \u201cuniversal form\u201d (''visva-rupa''), that encompasses all living beings and deities, and which changes with the needs of each being.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 337</ref>\n\nOther forms of T\u0101r\u0101 include:\n\n*White T\u0101r\u0101, (Sitat\u0101r\u0101) with two arms seated on a white lotus and with eyes on her hand and feet, as well as a third eye on her forehead (thus she is also known as \"Seven eyed\").

Apart from her many emanations named T\u0101r\u0101 of varying colors, other Mahayana female divinities that became part of Tara's theology include [[Janguli]], [[Parnasabari]], Cunda, [[Kurukulla]], [[Mahamayuri]], [[Usnisavijaya]], and [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]]. Based on this principle of T\u0101r\u0101 as the central female divinity, [[Dakinis]] were also seen as emanations of her.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 341</ref>\n\n==Sadhanas of T\u0101r\u0101==\n[[File:Tara, Gyantse Kumbum.JPG|thumb|Tara statue. [[Gyantse]] Kumbum. 1993]]\n[[Sadhana]]s in which T\u0101r\u0101 is the [[yidam]] (meditational deity) can be extensive or quite brief. Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her [[mantra]] is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the T\u0101r\u0101 sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism. Two examples are Zabtik Drolchok<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Zabtik_Drolchok</ref> and Chime Pakme Nyingtik.<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chim%C3%A9_Phakm%C3%A9_Nyingtik</ref>\n\nIn this case during the creation phase of T\u0101r\u0101 as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as T\u0101r\u0101. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the [[yidam]] and also the emptiness of one's ordinary self.\n\nThis occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the \"self\" is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one's self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of [[Emptiness]] and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking T\u0101r\u0101's energy through its [[Sanskrit]] [[seed syllable]]s and this purifies and activates certain psychic centers of the body ([[chakras]]). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization.\n\nTherefore, even in a simple T\u0101r\u0101 [[sadhana]] a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as ''Deity Yoga'', compiled by the present Dalai Lama,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] |title=Deity Yoga: In Action and Performance Tantra |year=1987 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |quote= | url= |isbn=0-937938-50-5 }}</ref> which explores all the ramifications of working with a [[yidam]] in Tantric practices.\n\nThe end results of doing such T\u0101r\u0101 practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]], and other obstacles and obscurations.\n\nThe mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels ([[nadis]]) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing T\u0101r\u0101's perfected form one acknowledges one's own perfected form, that is one's intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic [[phenomena]] as being inherently real and permanent.\n\nThe practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one's inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self.\n\nAs [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], in his ''Introduction to the Red T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhana'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] |title=Red Tara Commentary: Instructions for the Concise Practice Known as Red Tara\u2014An Open Door to Bliss |year=1998 |publisher=Padma Publishing |quote= | url= |isbn=1-881847-04-7 }}</ref> notes of his lineage: \"T\u0101r\u0101 is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, T\u0101r\u0101 [[meditation]] is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion\".\n\nThere are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as \"internal\" and \"external\". Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration.\n\n<blockquote>The preparations are of two types: external and internal. The external preparations consist of cleaning the meditation room, setting up a shrine with images of Buddha Shakyamuni and Green Tara, and setting out a beautiful arrangement of offerings.  We can use water to represent nectar for drinking, water for bathing the feet, and perfume. For the remaining offerings\u2014flowers, incense, light, and pure food\u2014if possible we should set out the actual substances. As for internal preparations, we should try to improve our compassion, bodhichitta, and correct view of emptiness through the practice of the stages of the path, and to receive a Tantric empowerment of Green Tara. It is possible to participate in group pujas if we have not yet received an empowerment, but to gain deep experience of this practice we need to receive an empowerment. The main internal preparation is to generate and strengthen our faith in Arya Tara, regarding her as the synthesis of all Gurus, Yidams, and Buddhas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905093605/http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-05 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tara statue near Kulu.jpg|Tara statue near [[Kullu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.\nFile:Ratnagiri ei3-40.jpg|Medititating Tara, [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]], India, 8th century\n</gallery>\n\n==Terma teachings related to T\u0101r\u0101==\n[[Terma (Buddhism)|Terma]] teachings are \"hidden teachings\" said to have been left by [[Padmasambhava]] (8th century) and others for the benefit of future generations.

She appears as a female [[bodhisattva]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, and as a female [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. She is known as the \"mother of liberation\", and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements.

T\u0101r\u0101 may more properly be understood as different aspects of the same quality, as bodhisattvas are often considered [[personification]]s of Buddhist [[method]]s.\n\nThere is also recognition in some schools of [[Buddhism]] of ''twenty-one T\u0101r\u0101s''. A practice text entitled ''[[Praises to the Twenty-One Taras]]'', is the most important text on Tara in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Another key text is the ''Tantra Which is the Source for All the Functions of Tara, Mother of All the Tathagatas''.<ref>Beyer, Stephan; The Cult of Tara Magic and Ritual, page 13.</ref> \n\nThe main T\u0101r\u0101 [[mantra]] is the same for Buddhists and Hindus alike: {{IAST|o\u1e43 t\u0101re tutt\u0101re ture sv\u0101h\u0101}}. It is pronounced by Tibetans and Buddhists who follow the [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan traditions]] as {{IAST|o\u1e43 t\u0101re tu t\u0101re ture soha}}.

She is the female aspect of [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] and in some origin stories she comes from his tears:\n\n\"Then at last Avalokiteshvara arrived at the summit of Marpori, the 'Red Hill', in Lhasa. Gazing out, he perceived that the lake on Otang, the 'Plain of Milk', resembled the Hell of Ceaseless Torment. Myriad beings were undergoing the agonies of boiling, burning, hunger, thirst, yet they never perished, sending forth hideous cries of anguish all the while. When Avalokiteshvara saw this, tears sprang to his eyes. A teardrop from his right eye fell to the plain and became the reverend [[Bhrikuti]], who declared: \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavour!\" Bhrikuti was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's right eye, and was reborn in a later life as the Nepalese princess Tritsun. A teardrop from his left eye fell upon the plain and became the reverend Tara. She also declared, \"Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavor!\" T\u0101r\u0101 was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's left eye.\"\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 manifests in many different forms. In Tibet, these forms included Green T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Nepalese Princess ([[Bhrikuti]]),<ref>((Min Bahadur Shakya |title=The Life and Contribution of the Nepalese Princess Bhrikuti Devi to Tibetan History |year=2009 |publisher=Pilgrims Publishing})</ref> and White T\u0101r\u0101's manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo ([[Princess Wencheng]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Sakyapa Sonam Gyaltsen |title=The Clear Mirror: A Traditional Account of Tibet's Golden Age |year=1996 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |pages=64\u201365 |isbn=1-55939-048-4 }}</ref>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is also known as a [[salvation|saviouress]], as a heavenly deity who hears the cries of beings experiencing misery in [[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]].\n\nWhether the T\u0101r\u0101 figure originated as a Buddhist or Hindu goddess is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars. Mallar Ghosh believes her to have originated as a form of the goddess [[Durga]] in the Hindu [[Puranas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Mallar Ghosh |title=Development of Buddhist Iconography in Eastern India |year=1980 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |page=17 |isbn=81-215-0208-X }}</ref> Today, she is worshiped both in Buddhism and in [[Shaktism]] (Hinduism) as one of the ten [[Mahavidya]]s. It may be true that goddesses entered Buddhism from Shaktism (i.e. the worship of local or folk goddesses prior to the more institutionalized [[Hinduism]] which had developed by the early medieval period (i.e. [[Middle kingdoms of India]]). According to Beyer, it would seem that the feminine principle makes its first appearance in Buddhism as the goddess who personified prajnaparamita.<ref name=\"beyer\">{{cite book |author=Stephen Beyer |title=The Cult of T\u0101r\u0101: Magic and Ritual in Tibet (Hermeneutics: Studies in the History of Religions) |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |pages= |isbn=0-520-03635-2 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:OM TARE TU TTARE.svg|thumb|left|<div align =\"center\">The Mantra of T\u0101r\u0101<br>''O\u1e40 T\u0100RE TUTT\u0100RE TURE SVAH\u0100'' <br>in the ''La\u00f1ja'' variant of [[Ranjana alphabet|Ranjana]] and [[Tibetan alphabet]]s.</div>]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 came to be seen as an expression of the compassion of perfected wisdom only later, with her earliest textual reference being the ''[[Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa]]'' (c. 5th\u20138th centuries CE).<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=40| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}</ref> The earliest, solidly identifiable image of T\u0101r\u0101 is most likely that which is still found today at cave 6 within the rock-cut Buddhist monastic complex of the [[Ellora Caves]] in [[Maharashtra]] (c. 7th century CE), with her worship being well established by the onset of the [[Pala Empire]] in [[Eastern India]] (8th century CE).<ref>{{cite book |author=Mallar Ghosh |title=Development of Buddhist Iconography in Eastern India |year=1980 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |page=6 |isbn=81-215-0208-X }}</ref>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 became a very popular [[Vajrayana]] deity with the rise of Tantra in 8th-century Pala and, with the movement of Indian Buddhism into Tibet through [[Padmasambhava]], the worship and practices of T\u0101r\u0101 became incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as well.<ref name=\"beyer\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Khenchen Palden Sharab |author2=Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal  |title=Tara's Enlightened Activity: Commentary on the Praises to the Twenty-one Taras |year=2007 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |page=13 |isbn=1-55939-287-8 }}</ref> She eventually came to be considered the \"Mother of all Buddhas,\" which usually refers to the enlightened wisdom of the Buddhas, while simultaneously echoing the ancient concept of the [[Mother Goddess]] in India.\n\nIndependent of whether she is classified as a deity, a Buddha, or a bodhisattva, T\u0101r\u0101 remains very popular in [[Tibet]] (and Tibetan communities in exile in Northern India), [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], Sikkim and is worshiped in a majority of Buddhist communities throughout the world (see also [[Guanyin]], the female aspect of Avalokitesvara in Chinese Buddhism).\n\nToday, Green Tara and White Tara are probably the most popular representations of Tara. Green Tara (''Khadiravani'') is usually associated with protection from fear and the following eight obscurations: lions (= pride), wild elephants (= delusion/ignorance), fires (= hatred and anger), snakes (= jealousy), bandits and thieves (= wrong views, including fanatical views), bondage (= avarice and miserliness), floods (= desire and attachment), and evil spirits and demons (= deluded doubts). As one of the three deities of long life, White Tara (''Saraswati'') is associated with longevity. White Tara counteracts illness and thereby helps to bring about a long life. She embodies the motivation that is compassion and is said to be as white and radiant as the moon.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:The Buddhist Goddess Shyama Tara (Green Tara) Attended by Sita Tara (White Tara) and Bhrikuti LACMA M.84.32.1a-d.jpg|Shyama Tara (Green Tara) Attended by Sita Tara (White Tara) and [[Bhrikuti]] (Yellow Tara). ca. 8th century.\nFile:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|''The Buddhist Goddess Tara'', gold and silver, Central Java, Indonesia, ca. 9th century.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]|url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/35047|title= The Buddhist Goddess Tara}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.\nFile:Green Tara.

Her name is Jnanachanrda or Yeshe Dawa, which means \"Moon of [[:wikt:primordial|Primordial]] Awareness\". For quite a number of [[aeon]]s she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning [[bodhicitta]] - the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further. At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only \"weak minded worldlings\" who see gender as a barrier to attaining [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until [[samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]] is no more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/samhita-arni-points-out-how-caste-and-gender-prejudice-are-inextricably-linked/article17433634.ece|title=Gender doesn\u2019t come in the way of Nirvana|last=Arni|first=Samhita|date=2017-03-09|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-12-14|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> She then stays in a palace in a state of [[meditation]] for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme [[bodhi]] as the Goddess T\u0101r\u0101 in many world systems to come.\n\nWith this story in mind, it is interesting to juxtapose this with a quotation from the [[14th Dalai Lama]] about T\u0101r\u0101, spoken at a conference on Compassionate Action in Newport Beach, CA in 1989:\n\n<blockquote>There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess T\u0101r\u0101. Following her cultivation of [[bodhicitta]], the bodhisattva's motivation, she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and she felt that there were too few people who attained [[Buddhahood]] as women. So she vowed, \"I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all my lifetimes along the path I vow to be born as a woman, and in my final lifetime when I attain Buddhahood, then, too, I will be a woman.\"</blockquote>\n\nT\u0101r\u0101, then, embodies certain ideals which make her attractive to women practitioners, and her emergence as a Bodhisattva can be seen as a part of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism's reaching out to women, and becoming more inclusive even in 6th-century CE [[India]].\n\n==Symbols and associations==\n[[File:Green tara 1947 wk.jpg|upright|thumb|Painting of Buddhist goddess Green Tara by Prithvi Man Chitrakari done in 1947.]]\nT\u0101r\u0101's name literally means \"star\" or \"planet\", and therefore she is associated with navigation and travel both literally and metaphorically as spiritual crossing to the 'other side' of the ocean of existence (enlightenment).<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 310</ref> Hence she is known literally as \"she who saves\" in Tibetan.<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref> In the ''108 Names of the Holy Tara'', Tara is 'Leader of the caravans ..... who showeth the way to those who have lost it' and she is named as ''Dhruva'', the Sanskrit name for the [[North Star]].<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref>\n\nAccording to Miranda Shaw, \"[[Motherhood]] is central to the conception of Tara\".<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316</ref> Her titles include \"loving mother\", \"supreme mother\", \"mother of the world\",  \"universal mother\" and \"mother of all Buddhas\".<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316-317</ref>\n\nShe is most often shown with the blue lotus or night lotus (''utpala''), which releases its fragrance with the appearance of the moon and therefore T\u0101r\u0101 is also associated with the moon and night.<ref>Beer, Robert; The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols, page 170</ref><ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref> \n\nT\u0101r\u0101 is also a forest goddess, particularly in her form as ''Khadiravani'', \"dweller in the Khadira forest\" and is generally associated with plant life, flowers, acacia (khadira) trees and the wind. Because of her association with nature and plants, T\u0101r\u0101 is also known as a healing goddess (especially as White T\u0101r\u0101) and as a goddess of nurturing quality and fertility.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 324</ref> Her pure land in Mount Potala is described as \"Covered with manifold trees and creepers, resounding with the sound of many birds, And with murmur of waterfalls, thronged with wild beasts of many kinds; Many species of flowers grow everywhere.\"<ref>Edward Conze, Buddhist Texts Through the Ages, p.196.</ref> Her association with the wind element (vaayu) also means that she is swift in responding to calls for any aid.\n\n==T\u0101r\u0101 as a saviouress==\n[[File:GreenTara150.jpg|upright|thumb|Green Tara, [[Nepal]], 14th century.

She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children. As Green T\u0101r\u0101 she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter within the samsaric world. As White T\u0101r\u0101 she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. As Red T\u0101r\u0101 she teaches discriminating awareness about created phenomena, and how to turn raw desire into compassion and love. As Blue T\u0101r\u0101 ([[Ekajati]]) she becomes a protector in the [[Nyingma]] lineage, who expresses a ferocious, wrathful, female energy whose invocation destroys all Dharmic obstacles and engenders good luck and swift spiritual awakening.<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nWithin [[Tibetan Buddhism]], she has 21 major forms in all, each tied to a certain color and energy. And each offers some feminine attribute, of ultimate benefit to the spiritual aspirant who asks for her assistance.\n\nAnother quality of feminine principle which she shares with the [[dakini]]s is playfulness. As [[John Blofeld]] expands upon in ''Bodhisattva of Compassion'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=Bodhisattva of Compassion: The Mystical Tradition of Kuan Yin |year=2009 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |quote= |url=https://archive.org/details/bodhisattvaofcom00john |isbn=1-59030-735-6 |url-access=registration }}</ref> T\u0101r\u0101 is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of [[dharma]] practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In ''Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Thinley Norbu |title=Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis |year=1999 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |isbn=0-87773-885-8 }}</ref> Thinley Norbu explores this as \"Playmind\". Applied to T\u0101r\u0101 one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development.\n\nThese qualities of feminine principle then, found an expression in Indian [[Mahayana]] Buddhism and the emerging [[Vajrayana]] of Tibet, as the many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, as dakinis, as [[Prajnaparamita]], and as many other local and specialized feminine divinities. As the worship of T\u0101r\u0101 developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose and set down [[sadhana]]s, or tantric meditation practices. Two ways of approach to her began to emerge. In one common folk and lay practitioners would simply directly appeal to her to ease some of the travails of worldly life. In the second, she became a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity whose practice would be used by monks or tantric yogis in order to develop her qualities in themselves, ultimately leading through her to the source of her qualities, which are [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]], Enlightened Compassion, and Enlightened Mind.\n\n==T\u0101r\u0101 as a Tantric deity==\n[[File:Tara thangka.jpg|thumb|right|18th-century Eastern [[Tibet]]an [[thanka]], with the Green Tara (Samaya Tara Yogini) in the center and the Blue, Red, White and Yellow taras in the corners, [[Rubin Museum of Art]]]]\n\nT\u0101r\u0101 as a focus for tantric deity [[yoga]] can be traced back to the time period of [[Padmasambhava]]. There is a Red T\u0101r\u0101 practice which was given by Padmasambhava to [[Yeshe Tsogyal]]. He asked that she [[terton|hide it as a treasure]]. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as [[Sakya Trizin]], present head of the [[Sakyapa]] sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], who released it to his western students.\n\nMartin Willson in ''In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101'' traces many different lineages of T\u0101r\u0101 Tantras, that is T\u0101r\u0101 scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of T\u0101r\u0101: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}</ref> For example, a T\u0101r\u0101 sadhana was revealed to [[Tilopa]] (988\u20131069 CE), the human father of the [[Karma Kagyu]]. [[Atisa]], the great translator and founder of the [[Kadampa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of T\u0101r\u0101. He composed a praise to her, and three T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhanas. Martin Willson's work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that T\u0101r\u0101 as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day.\n\nThe practices themselves usually present T\u0101r\u0101 as a tutelary deity (thug dam, [[yidam]]) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one's mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from [[Jnana|Buddha Jnana]]. As John Blofeld puts it in ''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet'':\n\n{{quote|The function of the Yidam is one of the profound mysteries of the Vajrayana...Especially during the first years of practice the Yidam is of immense importance. Yidam is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit word \"I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva\"\u2014the in-dwelling deity; but, where the Hindus take the I\u1e63\u1e6dadeva for an actual deity who has been invited to dwell in the devotee's heart, the Yidams of Tantric Buddhism are in fact the emanations of the adepts own mind. Or are they? To some extent they seem to belong to that order of phenomena which in Jungian terms are called archetypes and are therefore the common property of the entire human race. Even among Tantric Buddhists, there may be a division of opinion as to how far the Yidams are the creations of individual minds. What is quite certain is that they are not independently existing gods and goddesses; and yet, paradoxically, there are many occasions when they must be so regarded.''<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: A Practical Guide to the Theory, Purpose, and Techniques of Tantric Meditation |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |page=176 |isbn=0-14-019336-7 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:Kurukulla (Red Tara) - AMNH - DSC06232.JPG|thumb|[[Kurukulla]] thangka, American Museum of Natural History, Manhattan, New York City]]\n[[File:Sarasvati thangka.jpg|thumb|[[Sarasvati]] thangka, Eastern Tibet, 18th century]]\nThere are many forms of T\u0101r\u0101, including various popular lists of 21 different emanations of T\u0101r\u0101. Green T\u0101r\u0101, (\u015by\u0101mat\u0101r\u0101) associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity is the most depicted and the central aspect of T\u0101r\u0101 from which others such as the 21 T\u0101r\u0101s emanate. In her Green form, she is often also known as Khadirava\u1e47i-T\u0101r\u0101 (T\u0101r\u0101 of the acacia forest), who appeared to [[Nagarjuna]] in the Khadiravani forest of [[South India]] and protects from the eight great fears. She is often accompanied by her two attendants M\u0101r\u012bc\u012b and Ekaja\u1e6d\u0101. Dharmachari Purna writes on the various forms of Tara:\n\n<blockquote>T\u0101r\u0101 is in fact the name of a whole class of deities. She appears in all the five colours of the Jinas. There are at least ten green forms, seven white, five yellow, two blue and one red. As Sarvaj\u00f1amitra says of her form: 'It is a universal form, varied like crystal, since it changes according to circumstance'.She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her figure is shown in virtually all postures from standing to sitting, full lotus, half lotus, one leg down, and both legs down. There is apparently also a reclining T\u0101r\u0101. She has two-armed forms, four arms, eight arms, twelve arms, and Getty even mentions a Tibetan painting showing a standing T\u0101r\u0101 with 'one thousand heads and arms'. Ghosh lists seventy-six distinct forms of T\u0101r\u0101, and tradition tells us there are one hundred and eight names for her.<ref>Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Sarvajnamitra she has a \u201cuniversal form\u201d (''visva-rupa''), that encompasses all living beings and deities, and which changes with the needs of each being.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 337</ref>\n\nOther forms of T\u0101r\u0101 include:\n\n*White T\u0101r\u0101, (Sitat\u0101r\u0101) with two arms seated on a white lotus and with eyes on her hand and feet, as well as a third eye on her forehead (thus she is also known as \"Seven eyed\").

Apart from her many emanations named T\u0101r\u0101 of varying colors, other Mahayana female divinities that became part of Tara's theology include [[Janguli]], [[Parnasabari]], Cunda, [[Kurukulla]], [[Mahamayuri]], [[Usnisavijaya]], and [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]]. Based on this principle of T\u0101r\u0101 as the central female divinity, [[Dakinis]] were also seen as emanations of her.<ref>Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 341</ref>\n\n==Sadhanas of T\u0101r\u0101==\n[[File:Tara, Gyantse Kumbum.JPG|thumb|Tara statue. [[Gyantse]] Kumbum. 1993]]\n[[Sadhana]]s in which T\u0101r\u0101 is the [[yidam]] (meditational deity) can be extensive or quite brief. Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her [[mantra]] is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the T\u0101r\u0101 sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism. Two examples are Zabtik Drolchok<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Zabtik_Drolchok</ref> and Chime Pakme Nyingtik.<ref>http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chim%C3%A9_Phakm%C3%A9_Nyingtik</ref>\n\nIn this case during the creation phase of T\u0101r\u0101 as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as T\u0101r\u0101. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the [[yidam]] and also the emptiness of one's ordinary self.\n\nThis occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the \"self\" is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one's self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of [[Emptiness]] and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking T\u0101r\u0101's energy through its [[Sanskrit]] [[seed syllable]]s and this purifies and activates certain psychic centers of the body ([[chakras]]). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization.\n\nTherefore, even in a simple T\u0101r\u0101 [[sadhana]] a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as ''Deity Yoga'', compiled by the present Dalai Lama,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] |title=Deity Yoga: In Action and Performance Tantra |year=1987 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |quote= | url= |isbn=0-937938-50-5 }}</ref> which explores all the ramifications of working with a [[yidam]] in Tantric practices.\n\nThe end results of doing such T\u0101r\u0101 practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]], and other obstacles and obscurations.\n\nThe mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels ([[nadis]]) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing T\u0101r\u0101's perfected form one acknowledges one's own perfected form, that is one's intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic [[phenomena]] as being inherently real and permanent.\n\nThe practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one's inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self.\n\nAs [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], in his ''Introduction to the Red T\u0101r\u0101 Sadhana'',<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] |title=Red Tara Commentary: Instructions for the Concise Practice Known as Red Tara\u2014An Open Door to Bliss |year=1998 |publisher=Padma Publishing |quote= | url= |isbn=1-881847-04-7 }}</ref> notes of his lineage: \"T\u0101r\u0101 is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, T\u0101r\u0101 [[meditation]] is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion\".\n\nThere are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as \"internal\" and \"external\". Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration.\n\n<blockquote>The preparations are of two types: external and internal. The external preparations consist of cleaning the meditation room, setting up a shrine with images of Buddha Shakyamuni and Green Tara, and setting out a beautiful arrangement of offerings.  We can use water to represent nectar for drinking, water for bathing the feet, and perfume. For the remaining offerings\u2014flowers, incense, light, and pure food\u2014if possible we should set out the actual substances. As for internal preparations, we should try to improve our compassion, bodhichitta, and correct view of emptiness through the practice of the stages of the path, and to receive a Tantric empowerment of Green Tara. It is possible to participate in group pujas if we have not yet received an empowerment, but to gain deep experience of this practice we need to receive an empowerment. The main internal preparation is to generate and strengthen our faith in Arya Tara, regarding her as the synthesis of all Gurus, Yidams, and Buddhas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905093605/http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-05 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tara statue near Kulu.jpg|Tara statue near [[Kullu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.\nFile:Ratnagiri ei3-40.jpg|Medititating Tara, [[Ratnagiri, Odisha]], India, 8th century\n</gallery>\n\n==Terma teachings related to T\u0101r\u0101==\n[[Terma (Buddhism)|Terma]] teachings are \"hidden teachings\" said to have been left by [[Padmasambhava]] (8th century) and others for the benefit of future generations.
