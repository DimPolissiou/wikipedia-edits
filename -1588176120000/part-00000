It was his second championship and the first he won after competing in all 36 races during the season, after his injury in [[2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2015]] sidelined him for the first 11 races of that season. Busch had won four of the first 14 races of the season, before enduring a 21-race winless streak. His early-season success did give him plenty of playoff points and carried him through the Round of 8 at the expense of 2018 champion Logano on points.\n\nThe other members of the Championship 4 all qualified through wins in the semifinal phase. Those were [[Martin Truex Jr.]], [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Denny Hamlin]], who finished in that order among the title contenders at Homestead. Truex and Harvick had finished second and third also in the 2018 title race. Reigning champion Logano ended up fifth in the overall standings. Hamlin, while missing out on the title, was the [[2019 Daytona 500|Daytona 500 winner]]. [[Joe Gibbs Racing]] and [[Toyota]] had three of the four title contenders and won 19 of the 36 races. [[Alex Bowman]] and [[Justin Haley (racing driver)|Justin Haley]] obtained their first career victories, whereas [[Daniel Hemric]] won Rookie of the Year honors.\n\nThe 2019 season would be the last full-time season for drivers [[David Ragan]] and [[Paul Menard]], each retiring after twelve years of racing full-time in the Cup Series. This was also the first season without [[Matt Kenseth]] since [[1997 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1997]], [[Kasey Kahne]] since [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003]], [[A. J. Allmendinger]] since [[2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2005]], [[Trevor Bayne]] since [[2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2009]], [[Cole Whitt]] since [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2010]], [[Regan Smith]] since [[2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2006]], and [[Danica Patrick]] since [[2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2011]].

The film takes its title from [[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones song)|the song of the same name]], featured on the band's 1972 album ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' A [[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|soundtrack album]] was released in April 2008 on the [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] label.

Although the units were mobilized for federal service, they never left the United States.

In response to the consolidation of so many state militias, the United States Army created a new division system, and needed to fit the various state militias into the system. Originally, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was organized as part of the [[19th Infantry Division (United States)|19th Division]], which consisted of various elements of state militias from [[Arizona]], California, [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]]. On 16 September 1917, the [[19th Infantry Division (United States)|19th Division]] was redesignated as the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] at [[Camp Kearny]] near San Diego, [[California]]. At that time, the division was referred to simply as the 40th Division because there were no armored or cavalry divisions.<ref name=184_WW1_1>{{cite web |title=California's Own: The History of California's 40th Infantry Division |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/division.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 September 1917, the 2d Infantry Regiment (less the 2d Battalion, Companies L and M, and the Sanitary Detachment) was consolidated with the 5th Infantry Regiment (California) and redesignated the [[159th Infantry Regiment (United States)|159th Infantry Regiment]], [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]].<ref name=184_Lineage1/><ref name=184_WW1_3>{{cite web |title=Woodland's National Guard Members in World War I, The War to End All Wars |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/WoodlandWWI.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref> On 25 September 1917, the 2d Infantry Regiment's 2d Battalion, companies L and M, and the Sanitary Detachment were consolidated with the 7th Infantry Regiment (California) and redesignated the [[160th Infantry Regiment (United States)|160th Infantry Regiment]], [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]].<ref name=184_Lineage1 />\n\nIn November 1917, the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] moved to continue training at either [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord|Camp Lewis]] near [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which had finished construction and opened for training purposes only two months earlier, or [[Fort Funston]] near San Francisco, [[California]]. Although the units had received an infusion of new soldiers and equipment and had begun training for war in earnest, almost immediately the soldiers and equipment were being siphoned off to form new units. This was the start of what the unit would experience for the rest of the war.<ref name=184_WW1_1 />\n\n=====Operations in theater=====\nIn August 1918, the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] arrived in France. At that moment, the Germans had just completed a series of offensives that started on 21 March and ended on 15 July. These offensives were designed to destroy the American Expeditionary Force before it could be fully constituted, and they almost succeeded. Upon the arrival of the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] in France, it was decided that the division would be used as a depot and it was redesignated as the 6th Depot Division, supplying fresh troops to the more experienced combat divisions. By the end of the war, the 40th Division provided more than 27,000 replacements to the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th]], [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32d]], [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]], [[80th Infantry Division (United States)|80th]], [[81st Infantry Division (United States)|81st]], [[82nd Airborne Division|82d]], and [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th]] Divisions. Of those soldiers provided from the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]], 2,587 members were killed in action and 11,596 were wounded.

The San Francisco area elements of the 2nd Infantry Regiment (California) were not included.

Most of the soldiers believed that they would be mobilized for a year and then sent home, which changed on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. Within 48 hours of the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the regiment moved to the San Diego area and took up defensive positions for the expected attack or invasion of the West Coast of the United States. The regiment was scattered throughout a number of areas including Del Mar, La Mesa, and Lindbergh Field, while Company A was sent to San Clemente Island. If the Japanese attack had occurred, this lone company of Sacramentans would have been decimated since there was no avenue of retreat or reinforcement. The regiment remained in the greater San Diego area until April, when (similar to the mobilization for World War I) they were stationed at [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord|Fort Lewis]] near [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and later to the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] near San Francisco, [[California]].<ref name=184_Lineage1 /><ref name=184_WW2>{{cite web |title=Let's Go! Northern California's 184th Infantry Regiment (2d California) During World War II |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/184th.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1942, while at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]], the regiment was relieved from the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]] and attached directly to the Western Defense Command. In November 1942, while still officially under the control of the Western Defense Command, the regiment was attached to the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] at [[Fort Ord]] and later Amphibious Training Force Nine. It was during this period that the regiment was reinforced and its title modified to \"184th Regimental Combat Team\".<ref name=184_Lineage1 /><ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n=====Operations in theater=====\n======Aleutian Islands Campaign======\nIn July 1943, the regiment left San Francisco bound for the Japanese-held [[Kiska]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Alaska]] during the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]]. The 184th arrived on Adak Island for training and was assigned again to the 7th Infantry Division. On 15 August 1943, the regiment participated in Operation Cottage, the retaking of the last Japanese-held island in the Aleutians. The regiment, augmented by the 1st Battalion, 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, and with the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade Group on its right, made its first of many assault landings at Long Beach on Kiska Island. When the regiment landed, its commander, Colonel Curtis D. O'Sullivan, ordered the regiment's band to play. They responded with \"California, Here I Come,\" and \"The Maple Leaf Forever.\" After an unopposed landing, the regiment found that the Japanese garrison had been evacuated by a large cruiser and destroyer force on 28 July. The enemy had left in such a hurry that they left mess tables still set with meals, and blankets soaked in fuel oil, but not lit. Nevertheless, the regiment did have the honor of being the only National Guard regiment to regain lost American soil from a foreign enemy in World War II, the first since the [[War of 1812]]. On 23 August 1943, the regiment was officially assigned to the 7th Infantry Division. In September 1943, when the island was declared secure, the regiment moved to [[Schofield Barracks]], [[Hawaii]]. This was a welcome change for the men who just spent over three months on the Alaskan islands, but it did not last long.<ref name=184_Lineage1 /><ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Battle of Kwajalein======\nOn 20 January 1944, the regiment left Hawaii bound for the Marshall Islands. Kwajalien Atoll had been Japanese territory for decades. As such, they had many opportunities to build a complex system of fortifications. On 1 February 1944, the regiment, along with the [[32nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|32d Infantry Regiment]] assaulted the heavily defended atoll. Two days later, Companies A, B and C were given the assignment to clear the highly fortified blockhouse sector. Approximately five days later, when the battle for Kwajalien was over, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers of the 61st Naval Guard Force were killed in action. General George C. Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later said that the operations on Kwajalien were the most efficient of the war. Once again, the regiment achieved another first, as they were the first National Guard unit to seize and hold territory that Japan held prior to the start of the war.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\nWith the island secure, the regiment re-embarked on to their transports and returned to Hawaii for rehabilitation and more training. On 15 September 1944, they departed Hawaii, bound for Eniwetok Island. Initially, this was to be a staging area for the invasion of Yap Island. When they arrived, however, they found that the operation had been canceled in favor of a larger landing, the liberation of the Philippines.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Battle of Leyte======\n[[File:U.S. infantrymen in action.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the 184th Infantry advance on an enemy position at Dagami, [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]]]\nOn the morning of 20 October 1944, the regiment landed on the beaches near Dulag on the east coast of the island of Leyte. With the beachhead secured, they moved inland. The island provided the Japanese with an ideal defensive terrain, as Leyte is a large island, covered with mountains, rain forests, and swamps. The Japanese were long accustomed to fighting in the jungle, and had over three years of occupation to learn the terrain and plan defenses. Additionally, it was easy for the Japanese to reinforce their garrison on Leyte from Luzon in the north and Mindanao in the south. The Japanese 34th Army, consisting of four divisions, including the infamous 16th Division that was credited for the \"Rape of Nanking\" and the \"Bataan Death March,\" was the primary opponent on Leyte. The 184th Infantry Regiment pushed through the Dulag Valley and experienced high casualties. When the Japanese counterattacked the [[32nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|32d Infantry Regiment]], which had spread out along the Palanas River, the 184th was sent to reinforce them. Several attacks were repulsed and the enemy was driven into the bamboo thickets. This action later became known as The Battle of Shoestring Ridge.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\nOn 28 November 1944, the 11th Airborne Division relieved the division, less the 17th Infantry Regiment. The division then moved to Baybay, and the 184th started a drive from Damulaan towards the port of Ormac. They then seized the town Albuere and had joined up with soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, which had landed near Ormac. The remainder of the 7th then moved to Ormac to regroup. From there, they spent several weeks landing on and securing several of the small islands that surround Leyte. On 10 February 1945, they were relieved by the Americal Division and started to prepare for the Ryukyus Campaign. When the division left, they were credited with inflicting more than 54,000 enemy deaths.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Battle of Okinawa======\nOn 1 April 1945, the division landed on [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]]. Initially, the 7th and 96th Infantry Divisions were to clear the southern end of the island. Fortunately for these thinly spread forces, an expected counterattack did not occur. If it had, there was a possibility that the Japanese could have driven the invasion force into the sea. On 5 April, the 184th Infantry Regiment encountered typically fierce Japanese opposition at a rocky pinnacle located about 1,000 yards southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed \"[[The Pinnacle, Battle of Okinawa|The Pinnacle]]\"). A few days after the landing, the 184th came into contact with elements of the Japanese 32d Army on the heavily fortified Kakazu Ridge. On 9 April, with the assistance of massed artillery fire, Tomb Hill was captured. By now, companies were losing 30 to 50 men per day. Rifle companies of 40 or 50 men became the rule. On 1 May, despite the presence of infiltrators, the 184th attacked and briefly held Gala Ridge before losing it to a counterattack. Both sides traded blow for blow until the Japanese fell back to their final defensive positions along the Naha-Shuri-Yanabarau Road. In keeping with their motto, \"Let's Go,\" the 184th, using a rainstorm to cover their movements, outflanked the Japanese positions and effectively cut off their forces on the Chenin Peninsula. All that was left to do was mop up the scattered pockets of resistance on the peninsula. When the campaign ended, the Japanese 32d Army had lost tens of thousand of its soldiers. The 184th had lost hundreds.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Surrender of Japan \u2013 Occupation of Korea======\nThe [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] began planning for an invasion that was to make [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] look easy \u2013 the invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the need for the landings. If they had taken place, some predicted that over a million deaths would have occurred on both sides.[http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/10/mike-in-tokyo-rogers/dying-for-the-emperor-nope/] Instead, the 7th was rushed to Korea to disarm the Japanese garrison there and to provide an occupation force. When the regiment arrived in Seoul, they had the honor of accepting the surrender of all Japanese forces in that region. While there, the regiment would lose many of its members to rotation, although there were few of the original members of regiment left by now. Those who didn't have enough points to be rotated home were used to help reform the 31st Infantry Regiment that had been destroyed on Bataan. It is ironic that the 184th, who helped destroy the Japanese 16th Division, would be rebuilding the regiment destroyed by the 16th. When the 31st Infantry Regiment was fully reconstituted, it replaced the 184th in the 7th Infantry Division's Order of Battle. On 20 January 1946, the 184th Infantry Regiment was inactivated in Korea.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n=====Demobilization=====\nOn 5 August 1946, the 184th Infantry Regiment was relieved from assignment to the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and was assigned to the [[49th Infantry Division (United States)|49th Infantry Division]] of the [[California National Guard]].\n\n=====Decorations=====\nThe 184th Infantry Regiment received four Asiatic Pacific Theater streamers with the following inscriptions: ALEUTIAN ISLANDS 1942\u20131943, EASTERN MANDATES 1944 (with arrowhead), LEYTE 1944\u20131945 (with arrowhead) and RYUKYUS 1945.

The battalion was initially mobilized to [[Camp Roberts, California|Camp Roberts]] near [[Paso Robles]], [[California]] for initial readiness processing. On 16 August 2004, the battalion was transferred to [[Fort Bliss]] near [[El Paso]], Texas for four months of pre-deployment training. In early January 2005, the battalion moved to [[Fort Polk]] in [[Louisiana]] for a readiness evaluation prior to movement into theater.\n\nIn late January 2005, the battalion arrived in Kuwait to acclimate and conduct final training and organization prior to moving into [[Iraq]].

The battalion's area of operations included the [[Karrada]] and [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]] neighborhoods of southern [[Baghdad]]. Several active duty units were attached to the 1st Battalion to form \"Task Force Nightstalker\" under the command of the battalion HQ, including one company of M1A1 Abrams tanks from the [[4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment]]. The battalion's Charlie company was temporarily assigned to provide security at the Convention Center in the [[Green Zone]] during the 16 March first meeting of the transitional [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|National Assembly]] that was elected on 30 January, assuming control of the Convention Center from a company of the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2d Battalion, 325th Infantry Regiment]] and relinquishing control less than two months later to the [[Georgia (country)#Military|13th \"Shavnabada\" Infantry Battalion]] from the Republic of Georgia. The battalion provided security during the constitutional referendum held on 15 October and the election of the Council of Representatives on 15 December. In January, the battalion was relieved by a company of the [[506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2d Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment]] as part of planned operations to increase the role of Iraqi Army and Police forces in the area as a substitute for United States forces.

The headquarters of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was in [[Sacramento]] and the unit was part of the [[California National Guard]]. The lineage of these two units is described below.<ref name=184_Lineage1 />\n:''1st Artillery Regiment (California).'' On 19 March 1880, the 1st Artillery Regiment (California) was formed from the consolidation of the Sacramento Light Artillery (California) and the 1st Infantry Battalion (California).

Although the units were mobilized for federal service, they never left the United States. From 28 January 1899 through 6 February 1899, the three companies were demobilized in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[California]] and returned to the 2d Infantry Regiment (California).<ref name=184_Lineage1/><ref name=184_spam>{{cite web |title=California's Volunteer Forces during the Spanish\u2013American War |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/spam.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1907, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was reduced and consolidated with the 6th Infantry Regiment (California) (which had originally been organized on 22 July 1885 as the 6th Infantry Battalion (California)) to form the 2d Infantry Regiment (California), with headquarters in Sacramento, as part of the [[California National Guard]].<ref name=184_Lineage1 />\n\n====1916 Mexican Border Crisis====\nOn 18 June 1916, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was mobilized for border security duty during the [[United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution|Mexican Border Crisis]].

In response to the consolidation of so many state militias, the United States Army created a new division system, and needed to fit the various state militias into the system. Originally, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was organized as part of the [[19th Infantry Division (United States)|19th Division]], which consisted of various elements of state militias from [[Arizona]], California, [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]]. On 16 September 1917, the [[19th Infantry Division (United States)|19th Division]] was redesignated as the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] at [[Camp Kearny]] near San Diego, [[California]]. At that time, the division was referred to simply as the 40th Division because there were no armored or cavalry divisions.<ref name=184_WW1_1>{{cite web |title=California's Own: The History of California's 40th Infantry Division |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/division.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 September 1917, the 2d Infantry Regiment (less the 2d Battalion, Companies L and M, and the Sanitary Detachment) was consolidated with the 5th Infantry Regiment (California) and redesignated the [[159th Infantry Regiment (United States)|159th Infantry Regiment]], [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]].<ref name=184_Lineage1/><ref name=184_WW1_3>{{cite web |title=Woodland's National Guard Members in World War I, The War to End All Wars |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/WoodlandWWI.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref> On 25 September 1917, the 2d Infantry Regiment's 2d Battalion, companies L and M, and the Sanitary Detachment were consolidated with the 7th Infantry Regiment (California) and redesignated the [[160th Infantry Regiment (United States)|160th Infantry Regiment]], [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]].<ref name=184_Lineage1 />\n\nIn November 1917, the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] moved to continue training at either [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord|Camp Lewis]] near [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which had finished construction and opened for training purposes only two months earlier, or [[Fort Funston]] near San Francisco, [[California]]. Although the units had received an infusion of new soldiers and equipment and had begun training for war in earnest, almost immediately the soldiers and equipment were being siphoned off to form new units. This was the start of what the unit would experience for the rest of the war.<ref name=184_WW1_1 />\n\n=====Operations in theater=====\nIn August 1918, the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] arrived in France. At that moment, the Germans had just completed a series of offensives that started on 21 March and ended on 15 July. These offensives were designed to destroy the American Expeditionary Force before it could be fully constituted, and they almost succeeded. Upon the arrival of the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] in France, it was decided that the division would be used as a depot and it was redesignated as the 6th Depot Division, supplying fresh troops to the more experienced combat divisions. By the end of the war, the 40th Division provided more than 27,000 replacements to the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th]], [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32d]], [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]], [[80th Infantry Division (United States)|80th]], [[81st Infantry Division (United States)|81st]], [[82nd Airborne Division|82d]], and [[89th Infantry Division (United States)|89th]] Divisions. Of those soldiers provided from the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]], 2,587 members were killed in action and 11,596 were wounded. An additional 103 were to die of their wounds at the Post Hospital in [[Camp Kearny]] near San Diego, [[California]].<ref name=184_WW1_1 />\n\n=====Demobilization and restructuring=====\nOn 20 April 1919, the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] was demobilized at [[Camp Kearny]] near San Diego, [[California]], where they had been formed just two years before.<ref name=184_WW1_1 /> On 1 May 1919, those elements of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) that were used to create the [[159th Infantry Regiment (United States)|159th Infantry Regiment]] were released from federal service at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] near San Francisco, [[California]]. On 7 May 1919, those elements of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) that were used to create the [[160th Infantry Regiment (United States)|160th Infantry Regiment]] were returned to the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) at [[Camp Kearny]] near San Diego, [[California]].<ref name=184_Lineage1 />\n\n====Decorations====\nThe 2d Infantry Regiment (California) received a [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|campaign streamer]] (without inscription) for service.

The San Francisco area elements of the 2nd Infantry Regiment (California) were not included. The headquarters of the 184th Infantry Regiment (California) was in [[Sacramento]] and the unit was once again a part of the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Division]] of the [[California National Guard]].<ref name=184_Lineage1 />\n\n====1927 Folsom State Prison riots====\nIn November 1927, elements of the 184th Infantry Regiment were mobilized to assist with quelling a riot at [[Folsom State Prison]].<ref name=Folsom>{{cite web |title=Folsom Prison Riot, 1927 |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/FolsomPrisonRiot1927.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrom 18 February 1929 through 1 April 1929, the [[185th Infantry Regiment (United States)|185th Infantry Regiment]] was formed as a result of the withdrawal, expansion, reorganization, and redesignation of the central California elements of the 184th Infantry Regiment.<ref name=184_Lineage1 />\n\n====1934 West coast waterfront strike====\nOn 9 May 1934, [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike|longshoremen and sailors throughout the West Coast]] of the United States began a strike that would last for 83 days.

Most of the soldiers believed that they would be mobilized for a year and then sent home, which changed on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. Within 48 hours of the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the regiment moved to the San Diego area and took up defensive positions for the expected attack or invasion of the West Coast of the United States. The regiment was scattered throughout a number of areas including Del Mar, La Mesa, and Lindbergh Field, while Company A was sent to San Clemente Island. If the Japanese attack had occurred, this lone company of Sacramentans would have been decimated since there was no avenue of retreat or reinforcement. The regiment remained in the greater San Diego area until April, when (similar to the mobilization for World War I) they were stationed at [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord|Fort Lewis]] near [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and later to the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] near San Francisco, [[California]].<ref name=184_Lineage1 /><ref name=184_WW2>{{cite web |title=Let's Go! Northern California's 184th Infantry Regiment (2d California) During World War II |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/184th.html |publisher=California Military Department |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1942, while at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]], the regiment was relieved from the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]] and attached directly to the Western Defense Command. In November 1942, while still officially under the control of the Western Defense Command, the regiment was attached to the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] at [[Fort Ord]] and later Amphibious Training Force Nine. It was during this period that the regiment was reinforced and its title modified to \"184th Regimental Combat Team\".<ref name=184_Lineage1 /><ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n=====Operations in theater=====\n======Aleutian Islands Campaign======\nIn July 1943, the regiment left San Francisco bound for the Japanese-held [[Kiska]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Alaska]] during the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]]. The 184th arrived on Adak Island for training and was assigned again to the 7th Infantry Division. On 15 August 1943, the regiment participated in Operation Cottage, the retaking of the last Japanese-held island in the Aleutians. The regiment, augmented by the 1st Battalion, 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, and with the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade Group on its right, made its first of many assault landings at Long Beach on Kiska Island. When the regiment landed, its commander, Colonel Curtis D. O'Sullivan, ordered the regiment's band to play. They responded with \"California, Here I Come,\" and \"The Maple Leaf Forever.\" After an unopposed landing, the regiment found that the Japanese garrison had been evacuated by a large cruiser and destroyer force on 28 July. The enemy had left in such a hurry that they left mess tables still set with meals, and blankets soaked in fuel oil, but not lit. Nevertheless, the regiment did have the honor of being the only National Guard regiment to regain lost American soil from a foreign enemy in World War II, the first since the [[War of 1812]]. On 23 August 1943, the regiment was officially assigned to the 7th Infantry Division. In September 1943, when the island was declared secure, the regiment moved to [[Schofield Barracks]], [[Hawaii]]. This was a welcome change for the men who just spent over three months on the Alaskan islands, but it did not last long.<ref name=184_Lineage1 /><ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Battle of Kwajalein======\nOn 20 January 1944, the regiment left Hawaii bound for the Marshall Islands. Kwajalien Atoll had been Japanese territory for decades. As such, they had many opportunities to build a complex system of fortifications. On 1 February 1944, the regiment, along with the [[32nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|32d Infantry Regiment]] assaulted the heavily defended atoll. Two days later, Companies A, B and C were given the assignment to clear the highly fortified blockhouse sector. Approximately five days later, when the battle for Kwajalien was over, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers of the 61st Naval Guard Force were killed in action. General George C. Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later said that the operations on Kwajalien were the most efficient of the war. Once again, the regiment achieved another first, as they were the first National Guard unit to seize and hold territory that Japan held prior to the start of the war.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\nWith the island secure, the regiment re-embarked on to their transports and returned to Hawaii for rehabilitation and more training. On 15 September 1944, they departed Hawaii, bound for Eniwetok Island. Initially, this was to be a staging area for the invasion of Yap Island. When they arrived, however, they found that the operation had been canceled in favor of a larger landing, the liberation of the Philippines.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Battle of Leyte======\n[[File:U.S. infantrymen in action.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the 184th Infantry advance on an enemy position at Dagami, [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]]]\nOn the morning of 20 October 1944, the regiment landed on the beaches near Dulag on the east coast of the island of Leyte. With the beachhead secured, they moved inland. The island provided the Japanese with an ideal defensive terrain, as Leyte is a large island, covered with mountains, rain forests, and swamps. The Japanese were long accustomed to fighting in the jungle, and had over three years of occupation to learn the terrain and plan defenses. Additionally, it was easy for the Japanese to reinforce their garrison on Leyte from Luzon in the north and Mindanao in the south. The Japanese 34th Army, consisting of four divisions, including the infamous 16th Division that was credited for the \"Rape of Nanking\" and the \"Bataan Death March,\" was the primary opponent on Leyte. The 184th Infantry Regiment pushed through the Dulag Valley and experienced high casualties. When the Japanese counterattacked the [[32nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|32d Infantry Regiment]], which had spread out along the Palanas River, the 184th was sent to reinforce them. Several attacks were repulsed and the enemy was driven into the bamboo thickets. This action later became known as The Battle of Shoestring Ridge.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\nOn 28 November 1944, the 11th Airborne Division relieved the division, less the 17th Infantry Regiment. The division then moved to Baybay, and the 184th started a drive from Damulaan towards the port of Ormac. They then seized the town Albuere and had joined up with soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, which had landed near Ormac. The remainder of the 7th then moved to Ormac to regroup. From there, they spent several weeks landing on and securing several of the small islands that surround Leyte. On 10 February 1945, they were relieved by the Americal Division and started to prepare for the Ryukyus Campaign. When the division left, they were credited with inflicting more than 54,000 enemy deaths.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Battle of Okinawa======\nOn 1 April 1945, the division landed on [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]]. Initially, the 7th and 96th Infantry Divisions were to clear the southern end of the island. Fortunately for these thinly spread forces, an expected counterattack did not occur. If it had, there was a possibility that the Japanese could have driven the invasion force into the sea. On 5 April, the 184th Infantry Regiment encountered typically fierce Japanese opposition at a rocky pinnacle located about 1,000 yards southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed \"[[The Pinnacle, Battle of Okinawa|The Pinnacle]]\"). A few days after the landing, the 184th came into contact with elements of the Japanese 32d Army on the heavily fortified Kakazu Ridge. On 9 April, with the assistance of massed artillery fire, Tomb Hill was captured. By now, companies were losing 30 to 50 men per day. Rifle companies of 40 or 50 men became the rule. On 1 May, despite the presence of infiltrators, the 184th attacked and briefly held Gala Ridge before losing it to a counterattack. Both sides traded blow for blow until the Japanese fell back to their final defensive positions along the Naha-Shuri-Yanabarau Road. In keeping with their motto, \"Let's Go,\" the 184th, using a rainstorm to cover their movements, outflanked the Japanese positions and effectively cut off their forces on the Chenin Peninsula. All that was left to do was mop up the scattered pockets of resistance on the peninsula. When the campaign ended, the Japanese 32d Army had lost tens of thousand of its soldiers. The 184th had lost hundreds.<ref name=184_WW2 />\n\n======Surrender of Japan \u2013 Occupation of Korea======\nThe [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] began planning for an invasion that was to make [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] look easy \u2013 the invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the need for the landings. If they had taken place, some predicted that over a million deaths would have occurred on both sides.[http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/10/mike-in-tokyo-rogers/dying-for-the-emperor-nope/] Instead, the 7th was rushed to Korea to disarm the Japanese garrison there and to provide an occupation force. When the regiment arrived in Seoul, they had the honor of accepting the surrender of all Japanese forces in that region. While there, the regiment would lose many of its members to rotation, although there were few of the original members of regiment left by now. Those who didn't have enough points to be rotated home were used to help reform the 31st Infantry Regiment that had been destroyed on Bataan. It is ironic that the 184th, who helped destroy the Japanese 16th Division, would be rebuilding the regiment destroyed by the 16th. When the 31st Infantry Regiment was fully reconstituted, it replaced the 184th in the 7th Infantry Division's Order of Battle.

Several active duty units were attached to the 1st Battalion to form \"Task Force Nightstalker\" under the command of the battalion HQ, including one company of M1A1 Abrams tanks from the [[4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment]].

It centers upon the children's relationships with their parents as the children learn that they themselves have inherited their parents' powers. Once The Pride realizes their offspring have disappeared, they begin to use their considerable influence to track down their sons and daughters.<ref name=\"peachaward\">{{cite news | title = Runaways nominated for a Peach Award! | publisher = Marvel | date = 2007-06-15 | url = http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.954 | accessdate = 2008-10-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018014138/http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.954 | archive-date = 2007-10-18 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"eisner\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=4873|title=2005 Eisner Nomination Announced|last=Weiland|first=Jonah|date=2005-04-14|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> \"Pride & Joy\" sets up the main concept of the series, which involves children versus their parents.<ref name=\"josstalks\">{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=83669 |title=Joss Whedon Talks Runaways |last=Brady |first=Matt |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2008-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516210810/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=83669 |archivedate=May 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\"Pride & Joy\" was launched in 2003 as a part of Marvel's Tsunami imprint, the goal of which was to attract new readers, particularly young readers and the [[manga]] audience.

It was written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and illustrated by [[Adrian Alphona]]. While it was initially intended to be a six-part miniseries, the popularity of \"Pride & Joy\" and new ideas from writer Vaughan allowed ''Runaways'' to grow into a regular monthly Marvel title. \"Pride & Joy\" has subsequently won several comics awards, including the 2006 [[Harvey Award]] for Best Continuing or Limited Series.\n\nAlthough the Tsunami imprint was unsuccessful, \"Pride & Joy\" (and the series ''Runaways'' that continued it) was one of the very few Tsunami series to do well in sales and to continue being published.

In order to create an everyday setting and tone, Vaughan included various references to current popular culture, including television series, films, events and celebrities.\n\nThe story arc's primary purpose was to introduce the main characters, six children who discover their parents are evil after seeing them murder a girl in a sacrificial ceremony. It centers upon the children's relationships with their parents as the children learn that they themselves have inherited their parents' powers. Once The Pride realizes their offspring have disappeared, they begin to use their considerable influence to track down their sons and daughters.<ref name=\"peachaward\">{{cite news | title = Runaways nominated for a Peach Award! | publisher = Marvel | date = 2007-06-15 | url = http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.954 | accessdate = 2008-10-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018014138/http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.954 | archive-date = 2007-10-18 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"eisner\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=4873|title=2005 Eisner Nomination Announced|last=Weiland|first=Jonah|date=2005-04-14|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> \"Pride & Joy\" sets up the main concept of the series, which involves children versus their parents.<ref name=\"josstalks\">{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=83669 |title=Joss Whedon Talks Runaways |last=Brady |first=Matt |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2008-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516210810/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=83669 |archivedate=May 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\"Pride & Joy\" was launched in 2003 as a part of Marvel's Tsunami imprint, the goal of which was to attract new readers, particularly young readers and the [[manga]] audience.
