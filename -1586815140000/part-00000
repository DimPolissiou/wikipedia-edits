{"title_page": "Tamil literature in the Chola Empire", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2007}}\n\n{{Chola history}}\n'''Chola literature''', written in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], is the literature created during the period of [[Chola]] reign in [[South India]] between the 9th and the 13th centuries CE. The age of the imperial Cholas was the most creative epoch of the history of South India and was the Golden Age of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] culture.\n\nWith the revival of Chola power in the middle of the 9th century, the avenues for the literature and art broadened. For the first time in history, an imperial state encompassed the entire South India bringing with it the safety and security to the people and provided the opportunity for the people to experience cultures beyond their own. Tamil became a language of the people.\n\nThe literature during this period may be classified into religious, secular and political.\n\n==Religious literature==\nDuring the imperial Chola period the ''Prabhanda'' became the dominant form of poetry. The religious canons of [[Shaivism|Saiva]] and [[Vaishnava]] sects were beginning to be systematically collected and categorised. The Cholas built numerous temples, mainly for their favourite god [[Shiva]], and these were celebrated in numerous hymns.\n\nNambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of [[Rajaraja Chola I]], collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called ''Tirumurais''. One of these include a short poem by [[Gandaraditya]], who was a Chola king during the early tenth century. The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in ''[[Periyapuranam]]'' (also known as ''Tiruttondar Puranam'') by [[Sekkizhar]], who lived during the reign of [[Kulothunga Chola II]] (1133 \u2013 1150 CE). Sekkilar opus became the twelfth book in the Saiva canon.\n\nReligious books on the Vaishnava sect were mostly composed in [[Sanskrit]] during this period. The great Vaishnava leader [[Ramanuja]] lived during this period. Perhaps due to the animosity of the later Cholas towards the Vaishavites, there was no much literary activity in Tamil from this sect.\n\nOne of the best known Tamil works of this period is the ''Ramavatharam'' by [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] who flourished during the reign of Kulottunga III. ''Ramavatharam'' is the greatest epic in Tamil Literature, and although the author states that he followed Valmiki, his work is not a mere translation or even an adaptation of the Sanskrit epic. Kamban imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time. His description of Kosala is an idealised account of the features of the Chola country.\n\nOf the books on the [[Buddhist]] and the [[Jain]] faiths, the most noteworthy is the [[Jivaka-chintamani]] by the Jain ascetic Thirutakkadevar composed in the tenth century. This is the story of Jivaka, who was equally distinguished in war and peace, and tells the story of his youth during which he indulges in excesses and at his prime realises the hollowness of his existence and renounces everything to become a Jain ascetic.\n\n==Secular literature==\nThere were a number of books written on Tamil grammar. ''Yapperungalam'' and ''Yapperungalakkarigai'' were two works on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] by the Jain ascetic Amirtasagara. Buddamitra wrote ''Virasoliyam'',  another work on Tamil grammar, during the reign of [[Virarajendra Chola]]. ''Virasoliyam'' attempts to find synthesis between Sanskrit and Tamil grammar. Other grammatical works of this period are ''Nannul'' by Pavanandi, ''Vaccanandi Malai'' by Neminatha, and the annotations on ''[[Purananuru]]'', ''Purapporun Venbamalai'' by Aiyanaridanar.\n\n==Political literature==\nOf the works of a political nature, we find the poetic works on various Chola kings. Jayamkondar wrote ''Kalingattupparani'', a semi-historical account on the two invasion of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] by [[Kulothunga Chola I]]. Jayamkondar was a poet-laureate in the Chola court and his work is a fine example of the balance between fact and fiction the poets had to tread.  [[Ottakoothar]], a close contemporary of Kambar, wrote three ''Ulas'' on [[Vikrama Chola]], Kulothunga Chola II and [[Rajaraja Chola II]]\n\n== Lost works==\nChola inscription mention the names of some of the literature which are currently not available to us. They were once considered worthy of public recognition, as the authors of these inscriptions assumed the readers would know them by the mere mention of their names. Of these are two works on Rajaraja Chola I, ''Rajararajesvara natakam'' and ''Rajararaja Vijayam''. The former of this was a play and was enacted at the great [[Brihadisvara Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]]. From the context in the inscriptions we learn that this was not a play on the life of the great king, but on the building of the temple.\n\nThere was a book on Kulothunga Chola I called ''Kulothunga Chola Charitai'' by Thirunarayana Bhatta. A certain Kamalalaya Bhatta wrote ''Kannivana Puranam'' and ''Pum Puliyur Natakam'', works of a popular nature. The poet was awarded some tax free gifts for his works.\n\nIt is indeed a tragedy that we are unable to trace these lost works. This is true of most of the extant literature in India, which have been preserved more by chance and accident than by deliberate act of preservation.\n\n== References ==\n* Nilakanta Sastri, K.A.

[[Petroleum|Oil]] is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]]. A few exposures of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s are found in the central and western parts of the state, and [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas, in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]]. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary.

These include:\n* Using Wikipedia's history functionality, which retains all prior versions of an article, restoring the article to the last version before the vandalism occurred; this is called ''reverting'' vandalism.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> The majority of vandalism on Wikipedia is reverted quickly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hicks|first=Jesse|title=This machine kills trolls|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|work=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=18 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> There are various ways in which the vandalism gets detected so it can be reverted:\n**'''Bots''': In many cases, the vandalism is automatically detected and reverted by a [[internet bot|bot]] (robot). The vandal is always warned with no human intervention.\n** '''Recent changes patrol''': Wikipedia has a special page that lists all the most recent changes. Some editors will monitor these changes for possible vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA122#v=onepage|title=Wikipedia: the missing manual|last=Broughton|first=John|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=0-596-51516-2|location=|page=122|pages=}}</ref>\n** '''Watchlists''': Any registered user can watch a page that they have created or edited or that they otherwise have an interest in. This functionality also enables users to monitor a page for vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n** '''Incidental discovery''': Any reader who comes across vandalism by chance can revert it. In 2008, it was reported that the rarity of such incidental discovery indicated the efficacy of the other methods of vandalism removal.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n* Locking articles so only established users, or in some cases, only administrators can edit them.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> ''Semi-protected'' articles are those that can only be edited by those with an account that is considered to be ''autoconfirmed'' \u2013 an account that is at least 4 days old with at least 10 edits, for most accounts. ''Fully protected articles'' are those that can only be edited by administrators. Protection is generally instituted after one or more editors makes a request on a special page for that purpose, and an administrator familiar with the protection guidelines chooses whether or not to fulfill this request based on the guidelines.\n* Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> Vandals are not blocked as an act of punishment&nbsp;\u2013 the purpose of the block is simply to [[preventive action|prevent]] further damage.<ref name=\"Broughton134\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton|first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>\n* The \"abuse filter\" extension, which uses [[regular expressions]] to detect common vandalism terms.<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Edit filter]]</ref>\nEditors are generally warned prior to being blocked.

This occurred after inaccurate information was added to Wikipedia in which a journalist was accused of taking part in Kennedy's assassination.<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |title=Wikipedia tightens editorial rules after complaint&nbsp;\u2013 06 December 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074757/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWikipedia has experimented with systems in which edits to some articles, especially those of living people, are delayed until it can be reviewed and determined that they are not vandalism, and in some cases, that a source to verify accuracy is provided.

Titles on the blacklist can only be created by or moved to by administrators.  Pages that are also created repeatedly can be protected to prevent vandals from recreating bad pages.\n\nIn addition to the title blacklist, the spam blacklist prevents external link [[spamming]], a form of vandalism.  New/unregistered users who want to add external links are required to answer a [[CAPTCHA]].\n\nThe \"bad image list\" prevents images that could be used to vandalize pages from being inserted, such as images with sexual content. Images on the list can only be added to pages where the use of the image is explicitly allowed.\n\nThe entirety of the MediaWiki namespace, the main page, and high risk templates are protected to prevent high server load and sudden interface changes.\n\nThe edit filter can also prevent vandalism by disallowing the bad edit altogether.\n\n== Notable acts of vandalism ==\n\n=== Seigenthaler incident ===\n{{main|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident}}\n[[File:John Seigenthaler Sr. speaking.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired elderly gentleman in suit and tie speaks at a podium.|[[John Seigenthaler]], who in 2005 criticized Wikipedia]]\nIn May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article about [[John Seigenthaler, Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.<ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=29 November 2005|title=A false Wikipedia \"biography\"|first=John|last=Seigenthaler|authorlink=John Seigenthaler|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64PWOeCKO?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|archive-date=3 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The inaccurate claims went unnoticed between May and September 2005, when they were discovered by [[Victor S.

This was in response to a [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] hypothesis that mass editing of the [[Sarah Palin]] page the day before she was announced as [[John McCain]]'s running mate could help predict who would be chosen as [[Mitt Romney]]'s running mate in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]].

The vandal is always warned with no human intervention.\n** '''Recent changes patrol''': Wikipedia has a special page that lists all the most recent changes. Some editors will monitor these changes for possible vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA122#v=onepage|title=Wikipedia: the missing manual|last=Broughton|first=John|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=0-596-51516-2|location=|page=122|pages=}}</ref>\n** '''Watchlists''': Any registered user can watch a page that they have created or edited or that they otherwise have an interest in. This functionality also enables users to monitor a page for vandalism.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n** '''Incidental discovery''': Any reader who comes across vandalism by chance can revert it. In 2008, it was reported that the rarity of such incidental discovery indicated the efficacy of the other methods of vandalism removal.<ref name=\"Broughton122\" />\n* Locking articles so only established users, or in some cases, only administrators can edit them.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> ''Semi-protected'' articles are those that can only be edited by those with an account that is considered to be ''autoconfirmed'' \u2013 an account that is at least 4 days old with at least 10 edits, for most accounts. ''Fully protected articles'' are those that can only be edited by administrators. Protection is generally instituted after one or more editors makes a request on a special page for that purpose, and an administrator familiar with the protection guidelines chooses whether or not to fulfill this request based on the guidelines.\n* Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely.<ref name=\"Newzealand\" /> Vandals are not blocked as an act of punishment&nbsp;\u2013 the purpose of the block is simply to [[preventive action|prevent]] further damage.<ref name=\"Broughton134\">{{cite book |title=Wikipedia: the missing manual |last=Broughton|first=John |year=2008 |isbn=0-596-51516-2 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA182&dq=%22edit+war%22wikipedia#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20war%22wikipedia&f=false}}</ref>\n* The \"abuse filter\" extension, which uses [[regular expressions]] to detect common vandalism terms.<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Edit filter]]</ref>\nEditors are generally warned prior to being blocked.

This occurred after inaccurate information was added to Wikipedia in which a journalist was accused of taking part in Kennedy's assassination.<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |title=Wikipedia tightens editorial rules after complaint&nbsp;\u2013 06 December 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074757/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html |archive-date=15 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWikipedia has experimented with systems in which edits to some articles, especially those of living people, are delayed until it can be reviewed and determined that they are not vandalism, and in some cases, that a source to verify accuracy is provided.

Titles on the blacklist can only be created by or moved to by administrators.  Pages that are also created repeatedly can be protected to prevent vandals from recreating bad pages.\n\nIn addition to the title blacklist, the spam blacklist prevents external link [[spamming]], a form of vandalism.  New/unregistered users who want to add external links are required to answer a [[CAPTCHA]].\n\nThe \"bad image list\" prevents images that could be used to vandalize pages from being inserted, such as images with sexual content. Images on the list can only be added to pages where the use of the image is explicitly allowed.\n\nThe entirety of the MediaWiki namespace, the main page, and high risk templates are protected to prevent high server load and sudden interface changes.\n\nThe edit filter can also prevent vandalism by disallowing the bad edit altogether.\n\n== Notable acts of vandalism ==\n\n=== Seigenthaler incident ===\n{{main|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident}}\n[[File:John Seigenthaler Sr. speaking.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired elderly gentleman in suit and tie speaks at a podium.|[[John Seigenthaler]], who in 2005 criticized Wikipedia]]\nIn May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article about [[John Seigenthaler, Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.<ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=29 November 2005|title=A false Wikipedia \"biography\"|first=John|last=Seigenthaler|authorlink=John Seigenthaler|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64PWOeCKO?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|archive-date=3 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The inaccurate claims went unnoticed between May and September 2005, when they were discovered by [[Victor S.

This was in response to a [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] hypothesis that mass editing of the [[Sarah Palin]] page the day before she was announced as [[John McCain]]'s running mate could help predict who would be chosen as [[Mitt Romney]]'s running mate in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]].

It consists of three movements:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|Sehr m\u00e4\u00dfig (Very moderate)\n|Sehr schnell (Very fast)\n|Ruhig flie\u00dfend (Calmly flowing)\n}}\n\nWebern's only published work for solo piano, the Variations are one of his major instrumental works and a signal example of his late style.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\">Bailey 1998, 151.</ref> Webern dedicated the work to pianist [[Eduard Steuermann]].<ref>Webern 1937: \"Eduard Steuemann / gewidmet\" (on frontispiece).</ref> However, it was premiered (after months of coaching from Webern) by [[Peter Stadlen]] on 26 October 1937 in Vienna.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0eYMDtLL4X4C&pg=PA152&dq=Webern+26+October&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh2Jange_nAhVXTxUIHUjKCJgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Webern%2026%20October&f=false] Bailey 1998 p 152</ref> Much later Stadlen produced the definitive interpretive edition of Op.27, published by [[Universal Edition]] in 1979.<ref>''Notes''(2nd Series), Vol 27 No 2, December 190, p 405-406</ref>\n\n==History of composition==\nBy the early 1930s Webern was one of the composers and artists criticised by the [[Nazi Party]], which was rapidly gaining power. By 1934 Webern's [[Conductor (music)|conducting]] career, a major source of income for the composer, was practically over, and he earned his living by teaching composition to a few private pupils. Despite the considerable disadvantages this financial situation had, the lack of a stable job provided Webern with more time to compose.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\"/>\n\nOpus 27 took Webern about a year to complete. The three movements were not composed in the order they appear in the work:<ref>Dates from: Bailey 1991, 452.</ref>\n* Third movement: begun 14 October 1935, completed 8 July 1936\n* First movement: begun 22 July 1936, completed 19 August 1936\n* Second movement: begun 25 August 1936, completed 5 November 1936\nThe piece is the only work for piano solo that was published by the composer and assigned an opus number. It was also the last work by Webern to be published by [[Universal Edition]] during his lifetime.<ref>Bailey 1998, 152.</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n===Structure===\nAll three movements of the work are 12-tone pieces based on the following row (as found at the beginning of the second movement<ref name=\"Nolan\"/>):\n\n[[File:Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.png|thumb|center|550px|Principal forms of Webern's tone row from Variations for piano, op. 27, movement 2.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Nolan 1995, 49\u201350, though her 0 is G{{Music|sharp}}, and so she labels these two row forms P8 and I10.</ref> The first simultaneous pairing of row forms is P1 and R8, and as with the principal forms, each hexachord fills in a chromatic fourth, with B as the pivot (end of P1 and beginning of IR8), and thus linked by the prominent tritone in the center of the row {{audio|Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.mid|Play}}.<ref>Leeuw 2005, 158, for whom 0 = E{{Music|flat}}.</ref>]]\n\nThe work's title, ''Variations'', is ambiguous. In a letter dated 18 July, Webern wrote: \"The completed part is a variations movement; the whole will be a kind of 'Suite'\".<ref>Bailey 1991, 189.</ref> Only the third movement was completed at the time, and it is clearly [[Variation (music)|a set of variations]]. The form of the other two movements conforms to the \"[[Suite (music)|Suite]]\" plan: the first movement is a [[ternary form]], ABA, and the second is a [[binary form]]. However, to refer to an entire work by the form of its last movement is very unusual, and numerous attempts have been made to explain the title.<ref>Bailey 1991, 189&ndash;190.</ref>\n\nWebern scholar Kathryn Bailey outlined three possible views on the structure of the piece. Webern's Variations may be considered any of these:<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\">Bailey 1991, 190.</ref>\n# A three-movement sonata: [[sonata form]] &ndash; binary [[scherzo]] &ndash; variations\n# A three-movement suite: ternary movement &ndash; binary movement &ndash; variations\n# A set of variations, in which the first two movements have little connection to the third\n\nOne of the earliest explanations was offered by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], who in 1948 described the first movement as a theme and two variations, the second movement as a theme with a single variation, and the third movement as five variations of yet another theme.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\"/> Willi Reich, a member of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s circle, described the work as a sonatina which begins with a set of variations (first movement) and ends with a sonata form (third movement). Reich claimed his explanation was identical to Webern's and stemmed from the two men's conversations, however, the authenticity of this claim has been questioned.<ref>Bailey 1991, 191.</ref> \n\nYet another explanation was provided by Friedhelm D\u014dhl (who published Reich's analysis, but did not find it satisfactory), who viewed each of the fourteen phrases in the first movement as a variation of the prime/retrograde idea, and found the same structure in the second movement. Robert U. Nelson published a similar analysis in 1969.<ref>Nelson 1969.</ref> Finally, Kathryn Bailey's analysis suggests that the first movement is a sonata form, her ideas supported by Webern's own remarks in the original manuscript, published in 1979 by Peter Stadlen.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\">Bailey 1991, 192.</ref>\n\n===Symmetry===\nA particularly notable feature of Variations is [[symmetry]], which is featured throughout the work. Horizontal symmetry can be observed, for example, in successive phrases of the first movement: bars 1&ndash;18 comprise four phrases, each built from the normal row and its retrograde stated simultaneously, and the second half of the phrase is always a reverse of the first. Each phrase is therefore a [[palindrome]], though only the first pair of rows in the beginning of the movement is perfectly palindromic.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\"/> Vertical symmetry pervades the second movement, which is a [[Canon (music)|canon]]. The pitches are arranged around the pitch axis of A4. Each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction.<ref>Bailey 1991, 262&ndash;264.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bailey, Kathryn. 1998.

It consists of three movements:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|Sehr m\u00e4\u00dfig (Very moderate)\n|Sehr schnell (Very fast)\n|Ruhig flie\u00dfend (Calmly flowing)\n}}\n\nWebern's only published work for solo piano, the Variations are one of his major instrumental works and a signal example of his late style.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\">Bailey 1998, 151.</ref> Webern dedicated the work to pianist [[Eduard Steuermann]].<ref>Webern 1937: \"Eduard Steuemann / gewidmet\" (on frontispiece).</ref> However, it was premiered (after months of coaching from Webern) by [[Peter Stadlen]] on 26 October 1937 in Vienna.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0eYMDtLL4X4C&pg=PA152&dq=Webern+26+October&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh2Jange_nAhVXTxUIHUjKCJgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Webern%2026%20October&f=false] Bailey 1998 p 152</ref> Much later Stadlen produced the definitive interpretive edition of Op.27, published by [[Universal Edition]] in 1979.<ref>''Notes''(2nd Series), Vol 27 No 2, December 190, p 405-406</ref>\n\n==History of composition==\nBy the early 1930s Webern was one of the composers and artists criticised by the [[Nazi Party]], which was rapidly gaining power. By 1934 Webern's [[Conductor (music)|conducting]] career, a major source of income for the composer, was practically over, and he earned his living by teaching composition to a few private pupils. Despite the considerable disadvantages this financial situation had, the lack of a stable job provided Webern with more time to compose.<ref name=\"Bailey 1998, 151\"/>\n\nOpus 27 took Webern about a year to complete. The three movements were not composed in the order they appear in the work:<ref>Dates from: Bailey 1991, 452.</ref>\n* Third movement: begun 14 October 1935, completed 8 July 1936\n* First movement: begun 22 July 1936, completed 19 August 1936\n* Second movement: begun 25 August 1936, completed 5 November 1936\nThe piece is the only work for piano solo that was published by the composer and assigned an opus number. It was also the last work by Webern to be published by [[Universal Edition]] during his lifetime.<ref>Bailey 1998, 152.</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n===Structure===\nAll three movements of the work are 12-tone pieces based on the following row (as found at the beginning of the second movement<ref name=\"Nolan\"/>):\n\n[[File:Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.png|thumb|center|550px|Principal forms of Webern's tone row from Variations for piano, op. 27, movement 2.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Nolan 1995, 49\u201350, though her 0 is G{{Music|sharp}}, and so she labels these two row forms P8 and I10.</ref> The first simultaneous pairing of row forms is P1 and R8, and as with the principal forms, each hexachord fills in a chromatic fourth, with B as the pivot (end of P1 and beginning of IR8), and thus linked by the prominent tritone in the center of the row {{audio|Webern - Piano Variations op. 27 tone row.mid|Play}}.<ref>Leeuw 2005, 158, for whom 0 = E{{Music|flat}}.</ref>]]\n\nThe work's title, ''Variations'', is ambiguous. In a letter dated 18 July, Webern wrote: \"The completed part is a variations movement; the whole will be a kind of 'Suite'\".<ref>Bailey 1991, 189.</ref> Only the third movement was completed at the time, and it is clearly [[Variation (music)|a set of variations]]. The form of the other two movements conforms to the \"[[Suite (music)|Suite]]\" plan: the first movement is a [[ternary form]], ABA, and the second is a [[binary form]]. However, to refer to an entire work by the form of its last movement is very unusual, and numerous attempts have been made to explain the title.<ref>Bailey 1991, 189&ndash;190.</ref>\n\nWebern scholar Kathryn Bailey outlined three possible views on the structure of the piece. Webern's Variations may be considered any of these:<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\">Bailey 1991, 190.</ref>\n# A three-movement sonata: [[sonata form]] &ndash; binary [[scherzo]] &ndash; variations\n# A three-movement suite: ternary movement &ndash; binary movement &ndash; variations\n# A set of variations, in which the first two movements have little connection to the third\n\nOne of the earliest explanations was offered by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], who in 1948 described the first movement as a theme and two variations, the second movement as a theme with a single variation, and the third movement as five variations of yet another theme.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 190\"/> Willi Reich, a member of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s circle, described the work as a sonatina which begins with a set of variations (first movement) and ends with a sonata form (third movement). Reich claimed his explanation was identical to Webern's and stemmed from the two men's conversations, however, the authenticity of this claim has been questioned.<ref>Bailey 1991, 191.</ref> \n\nYet another explanation was provided by Friedhelm D\u014dhl (who published Reich's analysis, but did not find it satisfactory), who viewed each of the fourteen phrases in the first movement as a variation of the prime/retrograde idea, and found the same structure in the second movement. Robert U. Nelson published a similar analysis in 1969.<ref>Nelson 1969.</ref> Finally, Kathryn Bailey's analysis suggests that the first movement is a sonata form, her ideas supported by Webern's own remarks in the original manuscript, published in 1979 by Peter Stadlen.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\">Bailey 1991, 192.</ref>\n\n===Symmetry===\nA particularly notable feature of Variations is [[symmetry]], which is featured throughout the work. Horizontal symmetry can be observed, for example, in successive phrases of the first movement: bars 1&ndash;18 comprise four phrases, each built from the normal row and its retrograde stated simultaneously, and the second half of the phrase is always a reverse of the first. Each phrase is therefore a [[palindrome]], though only the first pair of rows in the beginning of the movement is perfectly palindromic.<ref name=\"Bailey 1991, 192\"/> Vertical symmetry pervades the second movement, which is a [[Canon (music)|canon]]. The pitches are arranged around the pitch axis of A4. Each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction.<ref>Bailey 1991, 262&ndash;264.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bailey, Kathryn. 1998.

The centers only have two possible orientations\u2014this becomes apparent by either scrambling a Skewb-alike puzzle where the center orientation is visible (such as the [[Skewb Diamond]] or [[Skewb Ultimate]]), or by disassembling the puzzle.\n\n== Records ==\nThe world record time for a Skewb is 0.93 seconds, set by Andrew Huang of Australia on 12 June 2019 at WCA World Championship 2019 in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>\n\nThe world record average of 5 (excluding fastest and slowest) is 2.03 seconds, set by \u0141ukasz Burliga of Poland on 17 December 2017 at CFL Santa Claus Cube Race 2017 in [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], with the times of 2.48 1.91 1.71 1.39, and 4.98 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>\n\n=== Top 7 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=skewb&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official Skewb Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
