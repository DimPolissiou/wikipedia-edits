The species is threatened by habitat destruction and disturbance in some countries, notably Spain. Flood control schemes are particularly harmful, as seed dispersion is reliant on floods, while [[water abstraction|abstraction]] from [[aquifers]] lowering ground water levels has compromised the development of the trees.\n\nAlthough not possessed of an innate genetic resistance to Dutch elm disease, the species is rarely infected in western Europe.<ref name=Collin,2/>\n\n==Description==\n''Ulmus laevis'' is similar in stature to the [[wych elm]], if rather less symmetric, with a looser, untidy, branch structure and less neatly rounded crown. The tree typically reaches a height and breadth of > 30&nbsp;m, with a trunk < 2&nbsp;m [[diameter at breast height|d.b.h]]. The extensive shallow root system ultimately forms distinctive high buttresses around the base of the trunk. The bark is smooth at first, then in early maturity breaks into thin grey scales, which separate with age into a network of grey-brown scales and reddish-brown underbark, and finally is deeply fissured in old age like other elms.<ref>Elwes & Henry (1913), Mitchell (1974), Phillips (1978), Bean (1981).</ref> The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[deciduous]], alternate, simple [[leaf shape|ovate]] with a markedly asymmetric base, < 10&nbsp;cm long and < 7&nbsp;cm broad, comparatively thin, often almost papery in texture and very translucent, smooth above with a downy underside. Significantly, the leaf veins do not divide from the central vein to the leaf margin. The leaves are shed earlier in autumn than other species of European elm. \n\nThe tree is most reliably distinguished from other European elms by its long flower stems, averaging 20&nbsp;mm. Moreover, the [[apetalous]] wind-pollinated [[flower]]s are distinctively cream-coloured,<ref name=Harris,a>{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=E. |date=1996 |title=The European White Elm in Britain |journal=Quarterly Journal of Forestry |publisher=Royal Forestry Society |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=122\u2013123}}</ref> appearing before the leaves in early spring in clusters of 15-30; they are 3\u20134&nbsp;mm across. The [[fruit]] is a winged [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] < 15&nbsp;mm long by 10&nbsp;mm broad with a [[ciliate]] margin, the single round 5&nbsp;mm [[seed]] maturing in late spring.

The species is threatened by habitat destruction and disturbance in some countries, notably Spain. Flood control schemes are particularly harmful, as seed dispersion is reliant on floods, while [[water abstraction|abstraction]] from [[aquifers]] lowering ground water levels has compromised the development of the trees.\n\nAlthough not possessed of an innate genetic resistance to Dutch elm disease, the species is rarely infected in western Europe.<ref name=Collin,2/>\n\n==Description==\n''Ulmus laevis'' is similar in stature to the [[wych elm]], if rather less symmetric, with a looser, untidy, branch structure and less neatly rounded crown. The tree typically reaches a height and breadth of > 30&nbsp;m, with a trunk < 2&nbsp;m [[diameter at breast height|d.b.h]]. The extensive shallow root system ultimately forms distinctive high buttresses around the base of the trunk. The bark is smooth at first, then in early maturity breaks into thin grey scales, which separate with age into a network of grey-brown scales and reddish-brown underbark, and finally is deeply fissured in old age like other elms.<ref>Elwes & Henry (1913), Mitchell (1974), Phillips (1978), Bean (1981).</ref> The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[deciduous]], alternate, simple [[leaf shape|ovate]] with a markedly asymmetric base, < 10&nbsp;cm long and < 7&nbsp;cm broad, comparatively thin, often almost papery in texture and very translucent, smooth above with a downy underside. Significantly, the leaf veins do not divide from the central vein to the leaf margin. The leaves are shed earlier in autumn than other species of European elm. \n\nThe tree is most reliably distinguished from other European elms by its long flower stems, averaging 20&nbsp;mm. Moreover, the [[apetalous]] wind-pollinated [[flower]]s are distinctively cream-coloured,<ref name=Harris,a>{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=E. |date=1996 |title=The European White Elm in Britain |journal=Quarterly Journal of Forestry |publisher=Royal Forestry Society |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=122\u2013123}}</ref> appearing before the leaves in early spring in clusters of 15-30; they are 3\u20134&nbsp;mm across. The [[fruit]] is a winged [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] < 15&nbsp;mm long by 10&nbsp;mm broad with a [[ciliate]] margin, the single round 5&nbsp;mm [[seed]] maturing in late spring. The seeds have a generally high rate of germination, 45\u201360% for Serbian trees examined by Stilinovi\u0107.<ref name=\"Stilinovi\u0107\">Stilinovi\u0107, S.

The density of the timber is significantly lower than that of other European [[elms]]. However, owing to its rapid growth, tolerance of [[soil compaction]], [[air pollution]] and de-icing salts, the tree has long been used for [[amenity]] planting in towns and along roadsides.<ref name=Collin,2>Collin, E.

However,  viability can vary greatly from year to year, while the seed is remarkably short-lived.

The internal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the family and the number of genera varies greatly between sources leading to considerable discrepancy across the literature.  This is currently in the process of reorganization on the basis of phylogenetic studies but knowledge is still incomplete, especially in light of recent studies of larval characters suggesting relationships which don't correspond with the phylogeny based solely on adult characters. \n\nThe current classification is therefore still based on the morphology of adults and basically refers to the taxonomic scheme adopted by Thompson & Rotheray in the Manual of Palaearctic [[Diptera]] (1998), which divides the family into three [[subfamily|subfamilies]] and fourteen [[tribe (taxonomy)|tribes]]. \n\nThe nomenclature given here is derived partly from the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera (BDWD), and a working classification created by a group of molecular biologists which no doubt will alter greatly in the future.<ref>Lifedesks: Classification of Syrphidae http://syrphidae.lifedesks.org/node/1476 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124001337/http://syrphidae.lifedesks.org/node/1476 |date=2015-01-24 }}</ref> \n\nThe distribution of genera in traditional [[ecozones]] is derived from the [[biosystematics]] BDWD.\n\n==Legend==\n*AF: [[Afrotropic ecozone]]\n*AU: [[Australasian ecozone]]\n*NE: [[Nearctic ecozone]]\n*NT: [[Neotropical ecozone]]\n*OR: [[Oriental ecozone]]\n*PA: [[Palearctic ecozone]]\n----\n\n==[[Eristalinae]]==\nThe subfamily Eristalinae (=Milesiinae) is subdivided into 9 tribes.\n\n===Tribe: [[Brachyopini]]===\n(=Chrysogasterini <small>Shannon, 1922</small>)\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Subtribe: [[Brachyopina]]====\n*''[[Brachyopa]]'' (=''Eugeniamyia''): NE OR PA\n** Subgenera:\n***''B.

The internal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the family and the number of genera varies greatly between sources leading to considerable discrepancy across the literature.  This is currently in the process of reorganization on the basis of phylogenetic studies but knowledge is still incomplete, especially in light of recent studies of larval characters suggesting relationships which don't correspond with the phylogeny based solely on adult characters. \n\nThe current classification is therefore still based on the morphology of adults and basically refers to the taxonomic scheme adopted by Thompson & Rotheray in the Manual of Palaearctic [[Diptera]] (1998), which divides the family into three [[subfamily|subfamilies]] and fourteen [[tribe (taxonomy)|tribes]]. \n\nThe nomenclature given here is derived partly from the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera (BDWD), and a working classification created by a group of molecular biologists which no doubt will alter greatly in the future.<ref>Lifedesks: Classification of Syrphidae http://syrphidae.lifedesks.org/node/1476 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124001337/http://syrphidae.lifedesks.org/node/1476 |date=2015-01-24 }}</ref> \n\nThe distribution of genera in traditional [[ecozones]] is derived from the [[biosystematics]] BDWD.\n\n==Legend==\n*AF: [[Afrotropic ecozone]]\n*AU: [[Australasian ecozone]]\n*NE: [[Nearctic ecozone]]\n*NT: [[Neotropical ecozone]]\n*OR: [[Oriental ecozone]]\n*PA: [[Palearctic ecozone]]\n----\n\n==[[Eristalinae]]==\nThe subfamily Eristalinae (=Milesiinae) is subdivided into 9 tribes.\n\n===Tribe: [[Brachyopini]]===\n(=Chrysogasterini <small>Shannon, 1922</small>)\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Subtribe: [[Brachyopina]]====\n*''[[Brachyopa]]'' (=''Eugeniamyia''): NE OR PA\n** Subgenera:\n***''B.

There are various levels of the judiciary in Bangladesh \u2013 different types of courts form a strict hierarchy of importance \u2013 District Courts, City Criminal Courts, Specialized Courts and Tribunals are all inferior to the Supreme Court. The [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh]] is the head of the judiciary and the Supreme Court. The present and the 22nd Chief Justice of Bangladesh is [[Syed Mahmud Hossain]]. He succeeded Justice Md. Abdul Wahhab Miah on 2 February 2018.\n\n==Head of state==\nThe [[President of Bangladesh|President]] is the [[Head of State]], a largely ceremonial post. The real power is held by the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]]. The president is elected by the legislature every five years and has normally limited powers that are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], mainly in controlling the transition to a new government. Bangladesh has instituted a unique system of transfer of power; at the end of the tenure of the government, power is handed over to members of a civil society for three months, who run the general elections and transfer the power to elected representatives. This system was first practiced in 1991 and adopted to the constitution in 1996.<ref name=\"amend13\">''14th Amendment'', Constitution of Bangladesh, 1996.</ref>\n\nAs head of the state, the president can grant pardon to a man sentenced to death penalty or lessen the punishment. In some cases, it also performs some legislative and judicial functions.\n\n==Executive branch==\n===Prime Minister===\nThe [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|prime minister]] is ceremonially appointed by the president, commanding the confidence of the majority of the MPs. The cabinet is composed of selected [[Government minister|ministers]].\nPrime minister exercise supreme power in Bangladesh.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Bangladesh}}\nThe executive administrates the country and executes the laws, passed by the legislature. It maintains the internal law and order in the country. It also maintains relationship with foreign countries. It works for defence, liberty and sovereignty of the country.\n\n===Agencies===\n{{main|Government agencies in Bangladesh}}\nThe executive calculates the income and expenditure of the government. It also performs various public welfare services such as; education, agriculture, establishment of industry, trade & commerce, land reform, tax and revenue collection. Beside this, it also accepts and implements various development projects.\n\n===Local Government===\n{{main|Local government in Bangladesh}}\nAt the local government level, the country is divided into [[Divisions of Bangladesh|divisions]], [[Districts of Bangladesh|districts]], subdistricts ([[Upazila]]), [[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]], and villages. The lowest level of local government representative are Local officials of union council those who are elected at the union level election. All larger administrative units are run by members of the civil service.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Jatiya Sangsad}}\n[[File:National Assembly of Bangladesh (07).jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of Bangladesh]]]]\nThe legislature of Bangladesh is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]]. The 300 members are elected by [[universal suffrage]] at least every 5 years.  It consists of 350 members at present. There is universal suffrage for all citizens at the age of 18.\n\n\"On 16 May 2004, the [[Jatiya Sangsad]] (the National Parliament) passed the 14th constitutional amendment to reintroduce quotas for women (article 65). The number of seats in parliament is to be raised to 345, 45 (15%) of which will be reserved for women in the next parliament. The seats will be allocated to parties in proportion to their overall share of the vote. This quota system replaces the previous quota law which expired in 2001. Until 2001 a system of reserved seats for women was used, where 30 seats out of 330 were reserved to women (chosen by indirect election by the 300 directly elected MPs). This provision of guaranteeing women reserved seats expired in April 2001. This quota system was first introduced by the 1972 Constitution (originally providing for 15 reserved seats for women, out of 315 seats, for a period of 10 years). In 1978 a presidential proclamation enlarged the number of reserved seats to 30 and extended the period of reservation to 15 years from the date of promulgation of the constitution of the Republic in December 1972. The constitutional provision lapsed in 1987 and was re-incorporated in the constitution by an amendment in 1990 to be effective for 10 years from the first meeting of the legislature next elected. This provision also lapsed in 2001. The Parliament elected in October 2001 does not have reserved seats for women. Women's groups are lobbying for these seats to become directly elected positions and for the number of reserved seats to be increased.\"\n\nThe 10th Parliament had its first sitting on 25 January 2009 . Currently there are 350 members of the house of which 50 memberships are reserved for women.<ref>Bangladesh and Global Studies (NCTB)</ref>\n\n== Judicial branch ==\n{{main|Judiciary of Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Bangladesh Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]]]]\n\n===Supreme Court===\nThe highest [[judiciary]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]]. Until recently, Chief Justice and judges were recommended by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the President. Since 1991, political parties during their tenure in government have initiated the separation of the judiciary from control by the executive branch brought about by amendment of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] in 1975. The separation by presidential promulgation acts have signed and passed. Acts on the separation of Judiciary Administration, Remuneration, Pay and Leave, etc. have all been completed. The Supreme Court have now judiciary and administrative authority over all lower courts in the country.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Politics of Bangladesh]]\n\n==References==\n\n* [https://bdgovtjobs.com/ Bangladesh Government MPO institute New List www.bangladesh.gov.bd]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bangladesh topics}}\n{{Asia topic|Government of}}\n{{Ministries of Bangladesh}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Bangladesh| ]]\n[[Category:Asian governments]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|National government of Bangladesh}}\n{{About|governing body|political system in [[Bangladesh]] |Politics of Bangladesh}}\n{{EngvarB|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox executive government\n| government_name  = The People's Republic of Bangladesh\n| nativename       = {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09a3\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u099c\u09be\u09a4\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}\n| border           = <!-- for clarification, options are \"devolved\" (for UK use), \"federal\", \"central\" -->\n| image            = Government Seal of Bangladesh.svg\n| caption          = [[Government Seal of Bangladesh|Official Seal of The Government of Bangladesh]]\n| date_established = {{Start date|1971|04|17|df=y}} ([[Provisional Government of Bangladesh|1st Government]])\n| date_dissolved   =\n| state            = <!-- polity governed -->\n| polity           = <!-- if polity governed is not a state (e.g. subdivision of a state) -->\n| country          = [[Bangladesh]]\n| address          = [[Bangladesh Secretariat]]\n| leader_title     = [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]]\n| appointed        = [[President of Bangladesh]]\n| budget           = <!-- annual budget of the government -->\n| main_organ       = [[Cabinet of Bangladesh]] \n| ministries       =\n| responsible      = <!-- responsible to parliament/president/monarch? -->\n| url              = {{URL|http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/}}\n\n}}\n{{Politics of Bangladesh}}\nThe '''Government of Bangladesh''' ({{lang-bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}) has three branches.

Bangladesh Awami League led by her, and its Grand Alliance (a total of 14 parties) won two-thirds majority in the elections. Numerically, the party controls 230 seats out of 299.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7803785.stm \"Hasina wins Bangladesh landslide\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216215840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7803785.stm |date=16 February 2009 }}, BBC</ref>\n\nThe judicial branch systematically contains an apex [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]], which is composed of the [[Bangladesh Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]] and the [[High Court Division]]. There are various levels of the judiciary in Bangladesh \u2013 different types of courts form a strict hierarchy of importance \u2013 District Courts, City Criminal Courts, Specialized Courts and Tribunals are all inferior to the Supreme Court. The [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh]] is the head of the judiciary and the Supreme Court. The present and the 22nd Chief Justice of Bangladesh is [[Syed Mahmud Hossain]]. He succeeded Justice Md. Abdul Wahhab Miah on 2 February 2018.\n\n==Head of state==\nThe [[President of Bangladesh|President]] is the [[Head of State]], a largely ceremonial post. The real power is held by the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]]. The president is elected by the legislature every five years and has normally limited powers that are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], mainly in controlling the transition to a new government. Bangladesh has instituted a unique system of transfer of power; at the end of the tenure of the government, power is handed over to members of a civil society for three months, who run the general elections and transfer the power to elected representatives. This system was first practiced in 1991 and adopted to the constitution in 1996.<ref name=\"amend13\">''14th Amendment'', Constitution of Bangladesh, 1996.</ref>\n\nAs head of the state, the president can grant pardon to a man sentenced to death penalty or lessen the punishment. In some cases, it also performs some legislative and judicial functions.\n\n==Executive branch==\n===Prime Minister===\nThe [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|prime minister]] is ceremonially appointed by the president, commanding the confidence of the majority of the MPs. The cabinet is composed of selected [[Government minister|ministers]].\nPrime minister exercise supreme power in Bangladesh.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Bangladesh}}\nThe executive administrates the country and executes the laws, passed by the legislature. It maintains the internal law and order in the country. It also maintains relationship with foreign countries. It works for defence, liberty and sovereignty of the country.\n\n===Agencies===\n{{main|Government agencies in Bangladesh}}\nThe executive calculates the income and expenditure of the government. It also performs various public welfare services such as; education, agriculture, establishment of industry, trade & commerce, land reform, tax and revenue collection. Beside this, it also accepts and implements various development projects.\n\n===Local Government===\n{{main|Local government in Bangladesh}}\nAt the local government level, the country is divided into [[Divisions of Bangladesh|divisions]], [[Districts of Bangladesh|districts]], subdistricts ([[Upazila]]), [[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]], and villages. The lowest level of local government representative are Local officials of union council those who are elected at the union level election. All larger administrative units are run by members of the civil service.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Jatiya Sangsad}}\n[[File:National Assembly of Bangladesh (07).jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of Bangladesh]]]]\nThe legislature of Bangladesh is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]]. The 300 members are elected by [[universal suffrage]] at least every 5 years.  It consists of 350 members at present. There is universal suffrage for all citizens at the age of 18.\n\n\"On 16 May 2004, the [[Jatiya Sangsad]] (the National Parliament) passed the 14th constitutional amendment to reintroduce quotas for women (article 65). The number of seats in parliament is to be raised to 345, 45 (15%) of which will be reserved for women in the next parliament. The seats will be allocated to parties in proportion to their overall share of the vote. This quota system replaces the previous quota law which expired in 2001. Until 2001 a system of reserved seats for women was used, where 30 seats out of 330 were reserved to women (chosen by indirect election by the 300 directly elected MPs). This provision of guaranteeing women reserved seats expired in April 2001. This quota system was first introduced by the 1972 Constitution (originally providing for 15 reserved seats for women, out of 315 seats, for a period of 10 years). In 1978 a presidential proclamation enlarged the number of reserved seats to 30 and extended the period of reservation to 15 years from the date of promulgation of the constitution of the Republic in December 1972. The constitutional provision lapsed in 1987 and was re-incorporated in the constitution by an amendment in 1990 to be effective for 10 years from the first meeting of the legislature next elected. This provision also lapsed in 2001. The Parliament elected in October 2001 does not have reserved seats for women. Women's groups are lobbying for these seats to become directly elected positions and for the number of reserved seats to be increased.\"\n\nThe 10th Parliament had its first sitting on 25 January 2009 . Currently there are 350 members of the house of which 50 memberships are reserved for women.<ref>Bangladesh and Global Studies (NCTB)</ref>\n\n== Judicial branch ==\n{{main|Judiciary of Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Bangladesh Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]]]]\n\n===Supreme Court===\nThe highest [[judiciary]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]]. Until recently, Chief Justice and judges were recommended by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the President. Since 1991, political parties during their tenure in government have initiated the separation of the judiciary from control by the executive branch brought about by amendment of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] in 1975. The separation by presidential promulgation acts have signed and passed. Acts on the separation of Judiciary Administration, Remuneration, Pay and Leave, etc. have all been completed. The Supreme Court have now judiciary and administrative authority over all lower courts in the country.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Politics of Bangladesh]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Bangladesh topics}}\n{{Asia topic|Government of}}\n{{Ministries of Bangladesh}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Bangladesh| ]]\n[[Category:Asian governments]]\n", "name_user": "Nunoticebd", "label": "safe", "comment": "a Few days ago has been publish new mpo institute list 2020 by the government of Bangladesh. its very important news for Bangladeshi Educated people.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh"}

It was a small [[bipedal]] [[omnivore]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThis dinosaur was originally named ''Walkeria maleriensis'' by [[Sankar Chatterjee]] in 1987, in honor of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[paleontologist]] [[Alick Walker]]. However, since the original generic name was found to be [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|preoccupied]] by a [[bryozoa]]n, the name ''Alwalkeria'' was created in 1994 by Chatterjee and Ben Creisler. The species name ''maleriensis'' is a reference to the [[Maleri Formation]], in southern India, where its [[fossil]]s were found.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Alwalkeria maleriensis.jpg|thumb|left|Life restoration]]\nThe only known specimen, [[holotype]] '''ISI R306''' is incomplete and consists of parts of the front ends of the upper and lower jaws, 28 incomplete [[vertebra]]e from all parts of the [[spinal column]], most of a [[femur]], and an [[talus bone|astragalus]] (ankle bone). The partial [[skull]] is about 4&nbsp;centimeters long (1.5&nbsp;in). Although material of ''Alwalkeria'' is limited, the spacing and shape of the teeth strongly resemble those of ''[[Eoraptor]]''. As in ''Eoraptor'', a gap separates the teeth of the [[premaxilla]]ry and the [[maxilla]]ry bones of the upper jaw. Other similarities in the skull of the two animals also link them on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] grounds.<ref>Langer, M.C. 2004. Basal Saurischia.

Similarly to ''Eoraptor'' and basal [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]], the front teeth are slender and straight, while the teeth in the sides of the jaw are curved backwards like those of [[predator]]y [[Theropoda|theropods]], although none of these teeth are serrated. This arrangement of teeth is neither clearly [[herbivore|herbivorous]] nor clearly [[carnivore|carnivorous]], which suggests that this dinosaur was an [[omnivore]] with a varied diet, including [[insect]]s, small [[vertebrate]]s, and plant material.\n\nRauhut and Remes (2005)<ref>Remes and Rauhut, 2005.

However, the position of ''Eoraptor'' is disputed, with one analysis finding it within the order [[Saurischia]], but basal to the [[Theropoda]]-[[Sauropodomorpha]] split (Langer 2004). [[Paul Sereno]] insisted that ''Eoraptor'' was a basal theropod.<ref>Sereno, P.C. 1999. The evolution of dinosaurs.

Since it is difficult to induce game developers to make games for a console that has not yet been widely adopted, most game console producers must produce games themselves (or subsidize their production) to ensure that high quality games are available when the console launches. On the other hand, end users want more games than just those produced by the console producer, so console producers like [[Microsoft]], [[Sony]] and [[Nintendo]] also license third-party developers to produce games for their consoles.
