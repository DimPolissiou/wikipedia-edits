After the war, [[Clara Barton|Barton]] expanded the efforts of the Red Cross into general disaster relief, helping U.S. communities from California in the west to the Carolinas in the east that were struck by events like earthquakes, droughts, and hurricanes.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nWhile Williams applauded Barton's success in securing the support of the U.S. president and Congress for ratification of the [[Geneva Convention (1864)|Geneva Convention]], and while she  praised Barton's efforts to secure large donations to sustain the work of the Red Cross in the United States, Williams criticized Barton's total domination of the society. In her words, \u201cMiss Clara Barton has been the National Red Cross Society\u201d (p.&nbsp;314).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Sophia Wells Royce|date=1894|title=Miss Clara Barton and the Red Cross|url=|journal=The Review of Reviews|volume=|pages=312\u2013316|via=}}</ref>  Williams also criticized Barton's lack of organization, record-keeping, and transparency in management of funds.  Williams concluded that the ideal Red Cross would be governed by a board of men, including male surgeons, doctors, military officials, and business leaders like \u201cPierrepont Morgan\u201d (by which she seemed to mean [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]]).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Photography and Friendship with Eakins and Whitman ==\nIn Philadelphia, Sophia Wells Royce Williams and her husband Talcott Williams were close friends of the artist [[Thomas Eakins]], who painted both of them. [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|The Philadelphia Museum of Art]] preserves the oil painting called ''The Black Fan: Portrait of Mrs. Talcott Williams''. Eakins displayed the painting to acclaim but never finished it; according to the art historian Carolyn Kinder Carr, Sophia Williams refused to continue sitting for him \u201cafter a male visitor to the studio had departed [and\u2026] Eakins poked her in the stomach and told her she could relax.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Williamses were also close friends with the poet [[Walt Whitman]], whom they knew from as early as 1882.  They visited Whitman often during the last years of his life, when he was living in [[Camden, New Jersey]].  Talcott Williams introduced [[Thomas Eakins]] to Whitman, and Eakins went on to paint Whitman's portrait.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nPossibly because of Eakins's fame and known acquaintance with Whitman, many scholars used to ascribe a portrait photograph of Whitman to Eakins.  The discovery of a new copy of this photograph in 1986, however, confirmed the claims of descendants of Talcott Williams's sister, Cornelia Williams Chambers, that Sophia Wells Royce Williams, and not Eakins, had been the photographer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a study of this photograph, published in 1989, Carolyn Kinder Carr, a curator in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], assembled archival and material evidence (including signatures on copies of the portraits) to confirm that Sophia Wells Royce Williams had indeed taken Walt Whitman's portrait, several copies of which survive in archives, museums, and private collections.  Among the significant pieces of evidence are records in the [[Library of Congress]], from an exhibit that it held in 1955, showing that Sophia Wells Royce Williams had registered copyright for this image in 1896.  Carr notes, however, that this famous image of Whitman, which shows the aged poet seated near a window, \u201ccannot be considered a great photograph from an aesthetic point of view.\u201d  And yet, it is significant as one of the only images of Walt Whitman from the final years of his life.  Among the institutions that preserve copies of Sophia Wells Royce Williams's famous photograph of Walt Whitman, are the Library of Congress, the Yale [[Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library|Beinecke Library]], the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarr also found archival evidence, including correspondence from Talcott and Sophia to each other, showing that Sophia Wells Royce Williams was a proficient photographer, interested in camera equipment, and aware of their technical requirements and artistic capacities.  Carr suggested that the Williams's may have developed some awareness of this medium through their long friendship with the photographer and fellow Philadelphia transplant, [[Eadweard Muybridge|Eadward Muybridge]], who pioneered studies of animal locomotion and who was also affiliated with the museum at the University of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Gordon|first=Sarah Anne|title=Indecent Exposures: Eadweard Muybridge's Animal Locomotion Nudes|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0300209488|location=New Haven|pages=94}}</ref>  Sophia Williams took many photographs during the couple's trips to Morocco; together she and her husband donated many photographs to the Smithsonian Institution, which preserves seventy-five of them.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:People from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:1850 births]]\n[[Category:1928 deaths]]\n[[Category:University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]\n[[Category:Activists from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:American photographers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American philanthropist}}\n[[File:The_Black_Fan_-_Portrait_of_Mrs_Talcott_Williams_G259.jpg|thumb|The Black Fan: Portrait of Mrs. Talcott Williams (Sophia Wells Royce Williams), by Thomas Eakins (1891), Philadelphia Museum of Art]]\n'''Sophia Wells Royce Williams''' (1850{{spnd}}1928) was a civic activist, philanthropist, and photographer, who with her husband, [[Talcott Williams]], donated a substantial collection of Moroccan ceramics and other materials to the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Penn Museum.]]  She became a friend of the artist [[Thomas Eakins]], who captured her portrait in an oil painting entitled, ''The Black Fan''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/42511.html|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Collections Object : The Black Fan (Portrait of Mrs. Talcott Williams)|last=Eakins|first=Thomas|date=|website=www.philamuseum.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>  She photographed another friend, the poet [[Walt Whitman]], near the end of his life; copies of this portrait survive in the [[Library of Congress]] and other prominent collections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emuseum.cornell.edu/start;jsessionid=98092C0F1BFFF1E3C62A146A379B3F71?t:state:flow=2803d62b-d05e-4dfd-9571-028853f9f1fe|title=\"Walt Whitman in Camden, New Jersey\", Collections {{!}} Johnson Museum of Art|last=Williams|first=Sophia Wells Royce|date=186|website=emuseum.cornell.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Williams played an active role in a women's-led civic group in Philadelphia and, in 1895, ran for an elected position on the school board of Philadelphia's Seventh Ward (an area roughly corresponding to today's Society Hill neighborhood).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=Sophia Wells Royce|title=The Story of a Woman\u2019s Municipal Campaign by the Civic Club for School Reform in the Seventh Ward of Philadelphia, introduction by Talcott Williams, preface by Sara Y.

The Civic Club organized a campaign committee which promoted the two nominated women; the committee then organized a widespread canvass of eligible voters. In spite of their involvement, neither was elected.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Philadelphia|first=Civic Club of|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Story_of_a_Woman_s_Municipal_Campaig.html?id=Ujo4AAAAMAAJ|title=The Story of a Woman's Municipal Campaign by the Civic Club for School Reform in the Seventh Ward of Philadelphia|date=1895|publisher=American academy of political and social Science|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Donations to the Penn Museum and the Smithsonian ==\nSophia Wells Royce Williams and her husband Talcott Williams traveled to [[Morocco]] from 1897 to 1898 and collected hundreds of objects which they donated to the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Penn Museum]]. The online catalogue of the Penn Museum attributes 680 artifacts to the couple.<ref>{{cite web |title=My Finds list |url=https://www.penn.museum/collections/list.php?id=9245 |website=Penn Museum |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>  In 2020, fifteen of these objects were on public display.  Some of the objects are pottery created in the 1890s that feature ornate, blue patterning and a shiny glaze. However, the vast collection also includes musical instruments, wooden carvings, clothing, food containers, Arabic manuscripts, woven baskets, and more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pezzati|first=Alex|date=2012|title=Moroccan Pottery in the African Collection|url=|journal=Expedition|volume=54:3|pages=27|via=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same expeditions, Sophia Wells Royce Williams and Talcott took photographs and collected objects which they donated to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C. Currently, the Smithsonian Institution's onine catalogue attributes 280 objects in its collections to Talcott Williams. The Smithsonian does not cite Sophia Wells Royce Williams who also collected and donated the objects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Carolyn Kinder|title=A Friendship and a Photograph: Sophia Williams, Talcott Williams, and Walt Whitman|publisher=The American Art Journal|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=2\u201312}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism of Clara Barton and the American Red Cross ==\nIn The [[Review of Reviews]], a progressive reformist journal that flourished in the 1890s in British and American editions, Sophia Wells Royce Williams published an article in 1894 on \u201cMiss [[Clara Barton]] and the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]].\u201d  Williams traced the history of what became the [[American Red Cross]] by discussing Barton's efforts, during the U.S. Civil War, to collect and distribute money and stores for wounded soldiers, including her own brother.  After the war, [[Clara Barton|Barton]] expanded the efforts of the Red Cross into general disaster relief, helping U.S. communities from California in the west to the Carolinas in the east that were struck by events like earthquakes, droughts, and hurricanes.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nWhile Williams applauded Barton's success in securing the support of the U.S. president and Congress for ratification of the [[Geneva Convention (1864)|Geneva Convention]], and while she  praised Barton's efforts to secure large donations to sustain the work of the Red Cross in the United States, Williams criticized Barton's total domination of the society. In her words, \u201cMiss Clara Barton has been the National Red Cross Society\u201d (p.&nbsp;314).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Sophia Wells Royce|date=1894|title=Miss Clara Barton and the Red Cross|url=|journal=The Review of Reviews|volume=|pages=312\u2013316|via=}}</ref>  Williams also criticized Barton's lack of organization, record-keeping, and transparency in management of funds.  Williams concluded that the ideal Red Cross would be governed by a board of men, including male surgeons, doctors, military officials, and business leaders like \u201cPierrepont Morgan\u201d (by which she seemed to mean [[J. P. Morgan|John Pierpont Morgan]]).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Photography and Friendship with Eakins and Whitman ==\nIn Philadelphia, Sophia Wells Royce Williams and her husband Talcott Williams were close friends of the artist [[Thomas Eakins]], who painted both of them. [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|The Philadelphia Museum of Art]] preserves the oil painting called ''The Black Fan: Portrait of Mrs. Talcott Williams''. Eakins displayed the painting to acclaim but never finished it; according to the art historian Carolyn Kinder Carr, Sophia Williams refused to continue sitting for him \u201cafter a male visitor to the studio had departed [and\u2026] Eakins poked her in the stomach and told her she could relax.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Williamses were also close friends with the poet [[Walt Whitman]], whom they knew from as early as 1882.  They visited Whitman often during the last years of his life, when he was living in [[Camden, New Jersey]].  Talcott Williams introduced [[Thomas Eakins]] to Whitman, and Eakins went on to paint Whitman's portrait.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nPossibly because of Eakins's fame and known acquaintance with Whitman, many scholars used to ascribe a portrait photograph of Whitman to Eakins.  The discovery of a new copy of this photograph in 1986, however, confirmed the claims of descendants of Talcott Williams's sister, Cornelia Williams Chambers, that Sophia Wells Royce Williams, and not Eakins, had been the photographer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a study of this photograph, published in 1989, Carolyn Kinder Carr, a curator in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], assembled archival and material evidence (including signatures on copies of the portraits) to confirm that Sophia Wells Royce Williams had indeed taken Walt Whitman's portrait, several copies of which survive in archives, museums, and private collections.  Among the significant pieces of evidence are records in the [[Library of Congress]], from an exhibit that it held in 1955, showing that Sophia Wells Royce Williams had registered copyright for this image in 1896.  Carr notes, however, that this famous image of Whitman, which shows the aged poet seated near a window, \u201ccannot be considered a great photograph from an aesthetic point of view.\u201d  And yet, it is significant as one of the only images of Walt Whitman from the final years of his life.  Among the institutions that preserve copies of Sophia Wells Royce Williams's famous photograph of Walt Whitman, are the Library of Congress, the Yale [[Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library|Beinecke Library]], the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarr also found archival evidence, including correspondence from Talcott and Sophia to each other, showing that Sophia Wells Royce Williams was a proficient photographer, interested in camera equipment, and aware of their technical requirements and artistic capacities.  Carr suggested that the Williams's may have developed some awareness of this medium through their long friendship with the photographer and fellow Philadelphia transplant, [[Eadweard Muybridge|Eadward Muybridge]], who pioneered studies of animal locomotion and who was also affiliated with the museum at the University of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Gordon|first=Sarah Anne|title=Indecent Exposures: Eadweard Muybridge's Animal Locomotion Nudes|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0300209488|location=New Haven|pages=94}}</ref>  Sophia Williams took many photographs during the couple's trips to Morocco; together she and her husband donated many photographs to the Smithsonian Institution, which preserves seventy-five of them.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:People from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:1850 births]]\n[[Category:1928 deaths]]\n[[Category:University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]\n[[Category:Activists from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:American photographers]]\n", "name_user": "Kbabej", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor punctuation edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Wells_Royce_Williams"}

This heating step also inactivates the DNA polymerase that was in use before the discovery of ''Taq'' polymerase, the [[Klenow fragment]] (sourced from ''[[E. coli]]''). ''Taq'' polymerase is well-suited for this application because it is able to withstand the temperature of 95\u00b0C which is required for DNA strand separation without denaturing or losing function.\n\nUse of the thermostable ''Taq'' enables running the PCR at high temperature (~60&nbsp;\u00b0C and above), which facilitates high specificity of the primers and reduces the production of nonspecific products, such as [[primer dimer]].  Also, use of a thermostable polymerase eliminates the need to add new enzyme to each round of thermocycling.  A single closed tube in a relatively simple [[Thermal cycler|machine]] can be used to carry out the entire process.

This heating step also inactivates the DNA polymerase that was in use before the discovery of ''Taq'' polymerase, the [[Klenow fragment]] (sourced from ''[[E. coli]]''). ''Taq'' polymerase is well-suited for this application because it is able to withstand the temperature of 95\u00b0C which is required for DNA strand separation without denaturing or losing function.\n\nUse of the thermostable ''Taq'' enables running the PCR at high temperature (~60&nbsp;\u00b0C and above), which facilitates high specificity of the primers and reduces the production of nonspecific products, such as [[primer dimer]].  Also, use of a thermostable polymerase eliminates the need to add new enzyme to each round of thermocycling.  A single closed tube in a relatively simple [[Thermal cycler|machine]] can be used to carry out the entire process.

Questions may be asked for the purpose of testing someone's knowledge, as in a [[quiz]] or [[Test (assessment)|examination]]. These are termed [[Display question|display questions]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Searle |first1=J |title=Speech acts |date=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=69}}</ref> Raising a question may guide the questioner along an avenue of [[research]] (see [[Socratic method]]).\n\nA [[research question]] is an interrogative statement that manifests the objective or line of scholarly or scientific inquiry designed to address a specific gap in knowledge. Research questions are expressed in a language that is appropriate for the academic community that has the greatest interest in answers that would address said gap. These interrogative statements serve as launching points for the academic pursuit of new knowledge by directing and delimiting an investigation of a topic, a set of studies, or an entire program of research.\n\nA [[rhetorical question]] is asked to make a point, and doesn't expect an answer (often the answer is implied or obvious). As such, it isn't a true question. Similarly, requests for things other than information, as with \"Would you pass the salt?\" are interrogative in form, but aren't true questions.\n\nPre-suppositional or [[loaded question]]s, such as \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" may be used as a joke or to embarrass an audience, because any answer a person could give would imply more information than he was willing to affirm.\n\nQuestions can also be used as titles of works of literature, art and scholarship. Examples include [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s short story ''[[How Much Land Does a Man Need?]]'', the painting ''[[And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)|And When Did You Last See Your Father?]]'', the movie ''[[What About Bob?]]'', and the academic work ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]''\n\n===By purpose===\nVarious categorizations of questions have been proposed.{{by whom|date=January 2014}} With regard to research projects, one system distinguishes:<ref>\n{{cite web|url = http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/resques.php\n| title=Research Methods Knowledge Base |publisher=Socialresearchmethods.net\n| date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}\n</ref>\n\n* ''descriptive questions'', used primarily with the aim of describing the existence of some thing or process\n* ''relational questions'', designed to look at the relationships between two or more variables\n* ''causal questions'', designed to determine whether certain variables affect one or more outcome variables\n\nFor the purpose of surveys, one type of question asked is the [[closed-ended question|closed-ended]] (also ''closed'' or ''dichotomous'') question, usually requiring a yes/no answer or the choice of an option(s) from a list (see also [[multiple choice]]). There are also ''nominal questions'', designed to inquire about a level of quantitative measure, usually making connections between a number and a concept (as in \"1 = Moderate; 2 = Severe; 3 = ...\").<ref>Research Methods Knowledge Base. Types of Questions. [http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/questype.php Socialresearchmethods.net]</ref> [[Open-ended question|Open-ended]] or ''open'' questions give the respondent greater freedom to provide information or opinions on a topic. (The distinction between closed and open questions is applied in a variety of other contexts too, such as [[job interview]]ing.) Surveys also often contain ''qualifying questions'' (also called ''filter questions'' or ''contingency questions''), which serve to determine whether the respondent needs to continue on to answer subsequent questions.\n\nSome types of questions that may be used in an educational context are listed in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]] of educational objectives. These include questions designed to test and promote:\n\n* Knowledge: [[Five Ws|Who, what, when, where, why, how]]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Describe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?\n* Comprehension: Retell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;\n* Application: How is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an example of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?; How is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;related to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?; Why is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;significant?\n* Analysis: What are the parts or features of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?

What criteria would you use to assess&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? <ref>Types of Questions Based on Bloom's Taxonomy. (Bloom, et al., 1956).{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMcKenzie's \"Questioning Toolkit\"<ref>[http://questioning.org/Q7/toolkit.html Questioning Toolkit]</ref> lists 17 types of questions, and suggests that thinkers need to orchestrate and combine these types.<ref>[http://questioning.org/oct07/punchy.html \"Punchy Question Combinations\"]</ref> Examples of these question types include the ''irreverent question'', the ''apparently irrelevant question'', the ''hypothetical question'' and the ''unanswerable question''. Questions can also be [[:wikt:felicitous|infelicitous]], being based on incorrect and illogical premises (e.g. \"Why do cats have green wings?\") or ill-placed premises (e.g. \"When did you start beating your wife?\").\n\nStrategic studies also took into consideration the questioning process. In Humint (Human Intelligence), a taxonomy of questions includes:\n* Direct questions: basic questions normally beginning with an interrogative (who, what, where, when, how, or why) and requiring a narrative answer. They are brief, precise, and simply worded to avoid confusion.\n* Initial questions: directed toward obtaining the basic information on the topic. In other words, they are the \"who, what, where, when, how, and why\" of each topic.\n* Follow-up questions: used to expand on and complete the information obtained from the initial questions.\n* Nonpertinent questions: questions that do not pertain to the collection objectives. They are used to conceal the collection objectives or to strengthen rapport with the source.\n* Repeat questions: ask the source for the same information obtained in response to earlier questions.\n* Control questions: developed from recently confirmed information from other sources that is not likely to have changed.\n* Prepared questions developed by the HUMINT collector, normally in writing, prior to the questioning.\n* Prepared questions: used primarily when dealing with information of a technical nature or specific topic.\n* Negative questions: questions that contain a negative word in the question itself such as, \"Didn't you go to the pick-up point?\"\n* Compound questions: consist of two questions asked at the same time; for example, \"Where were you going after work and who were you to meet there?\"\n* Vague questions: do not have enough information for the source to understand exactly what the HUMINT collector is asking. They may be incomplete, general, or otherwise nonspecific.\n* Elicitation: is the gaining of information through direct interaction with a human source where the source is not aware of the specific purpose for the conversation.<ref>Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). Human Intelligence Collector Operations. FM 2-22.3, Washington, DC, 6 September 2006. p. 167. Publication available at army knowledge online (www.us.army.mil). </ref>\n* Softball question: question on easy, not serious or not important topic\n* Hardball question: confronting question, pressing the answerer to explain e.g. inconsistencies or discrepancies with their previous stances\n* [[Gotcha question]]\n\n===By grammatical form <span id=\"wh\"></span>===\nQuestions that ask whether or not some statement is true are called [[yes\u2013no question]]s (or ''polar questions'', or ''general questions''<ref name=\"Chisholm\">William Chisholm, Louis T. Milic, John A.C. Greppin. Interrogativity. \u2013 John Benjamins Publishing, 1982. </ref>), since they can in principle be answered by a [[yes and no|\"yes\" or \"no\"]] (or similar words or expressions in other languages). Examples include \"Do you take sugar?\", \"Should they be believed?\" and \"Am I the loneliest person in the world?\"\n\nA type of question that is similar in form to a yes\u2013no question, but is not intended to be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\", is the ''[[alternative question]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnAlternativeQuestion.htm |title=What is an alternative question?|publisher=SIL International |work=Glossary of linguistic terms |editor1-last=Loos |editor1-first=Eugene E. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Susan |editor3-last=Day |editor3-first=Dwight H., Jr. |editor4-last=Jordan |editor4-first=Paul C. |editor5-last=Wingate |editor5-first=J. Douglas }}</ref> (or ''choice question''). This presents two or more alternative answers, as in \"Do you want fish or lamb?\", or \"Are you supporting England, Ireland or Wales?\" The expected response is one of the alternatives, or some other indication such as \"both\" or \"neither\" (questionnaire forms sometimes contain an option \"none of the above\" or similar for such questions). Because of their similarity in form to yes\u2013no questions, they may sometimes be answered \"yes\" or \"no\", possibly humorously or as a result of misunderstanding.\n\nThe other main type of question (other than yes\u2013no questions) is those called '''''wh''-questions''' (or ''non-polar questions'', or ''special questions''<ref name=\"Chisholm\" />). These use [[interrogative word]]s (''wh''-words) such as ''when'', ''which'', ''who'', ''how'', etc. to specify the information that is desired. (In some languages the formation of such questions may involve [[wh-movement|''wh''-movement]] \u2013 see the section below for grammatical description.) The name derives from the fact that most of the English interrogative words (with the exception of ''how'') begin with the letters ''wh''. These are the types of question sometimes referred to in journalism and other investigative contexts as the [[Five Ws]].\n\n[[Tag question]]s are a grammatical structure in which a declarative statement or an imperative is turned into a question by adding an interrogative fragment (the \"tag\"), such as ''right'' in \"You remembered the eggs, right?\", or ''isn't it'' in \"It's cold today, isn't it?\" Tag questions may or may not be answerable with a yes or no.\n\nAs well as direct questions (such as ''Where are my keys?''), there also exist [[indirect question]]s (also called ''interrogative content clauses''), such as ''where my keys are''. These are used as [[subordinate clause]]s in sentences such as \"I wonder where my keys are\" and \"Ask him where my keys are.\" Indirect questions do not necessarily follow the same rules of grammar as direct questions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lessons-indirect-questions/|title=Indirect Questions - English Grammar Lesson - ELC|date=2017-11-27|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}</ref> For example, in English and some other languages, indirect questions are formed without inversion of subject and verb (compare the word order in \"where are they?\" and \"(I wonder) where they are\"). Indirect questions may also be subject to the changes of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and other changes that apply generally to [[indirect speech]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{main article|Interrogative}}\nLanguages may use both [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] to distinguish interrogative sentences (which pose questions) from [[declarative sentence]]s (which state propositions). Syntax refers to grammatical changes, such as moving words around or adding question words; prosody refers here to changes in [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] while speaking.\n\nIn [[English grammar|English]], [[German grammar|German]], [[French grammar|French]] and various other languages, questions are marked by a distinct [[word order]] featuring [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] \u2013 the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is placed after the [[verb]] rather than before it: \"You are cold\" becomes \"Are you cold?\" However, English allows such inversion only with a particular class of verbs (called auxiliary or [[special verb]]s), and thus sometimes requires the addition of an auxiliary ''do'', ''does'' or ''did'' before inversion can take place (\"He sings\" \u2192 \"Does he sing?\") \u2013 for details see [[do-support|''do''-support]].\n\nIn some languages, yes\u2013no questions are marked by an [[interrogative particle]], such as the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{lang|ja|\u304b}} ''ka'', [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] {{lang|zh|\u5417}} ''ma'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''czy''. Also, in languages generally, ''wh''-questions are marked by an [[interrogative word]] (''wh''-word) such as ''what'', ''where'' or ''how''. In languages such as English this word generally moves to the front of the sentence ([[wh-fronting|''wh''-fronting]]), and subject\u2013verb inversion occurs as in yes\u2013no questions, but in some other languages these changes in word order are not necessary (e.g. Mandarin {{lang|zh|\u4f60\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f}} ''n\u01d0 y\u00e0o sh\u00e9nme'', meaning \"what do you want?\" is literally \"you want what?\").\n\nIntonation patterns characteristic of questions often involve a raised pitch near the end of the sentence. In English this occurs especially for yes\u2013no questions; it may also be used for sentences that do not have the grammatical form of questions, but are nonetheless intended to elicit information ([[declarative question]]s), as in \"You're not using this?\"\n\nIn languages written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] or certain other scripts, a [[question mark]] at the end of a sentence identifies questions in writing. (In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] an additional [[\u00bf|inverted mark]] is placed at the beginning: ''\u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1 usted?'' \"How are you?\") As with intonation, this feature is not restricted to sentences having the grammatical form of questions \u2013 it may also indicate a sentence's [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] function.\n\n==Responses==\nThe most typical response to a question is an answer that provides the information indicated as being sought by the questioner. This may range from a simple [[yes and no|''yes'' or ''no'']] (in the case of yes\u2013no questions) to a more complex or detailed answer. (An answer may be ''correct'' or ''incorrect'', depending on whether the information it presents is true or [[False (logic)|false]].) An indication of inability or unwillingness to provide an answer is the other response to a question.\n\n\"Negative questions\" are interrogative sentences which contain negation in their phrasing, such as \"Shouldn't you be working?\" These can have different ways of expressing affirmation and denial from the standard form of question, and they can be confusing, since it is sometimes unclear whether the answer should be the opposite of the answer to the non-negated question. For example, if one does not have a passport, both \"Do you have a passport?\" and \"Don't you have a passport?\" are properly answered with \"No\", despite apparently asking opposite questions. The Japanese and Korean languages avoid this ambiguity. Answering \"No\" to the second of these in Japanese or Korean would mean, \"I ''do'' have a passport\".\n\nA similar ambiguous question in English is \"Do you mind if...?\" The responder may reply unambiguously \"Yes, I do mind,\" if they do mind, or \"No, I don't mind,\" if they don't, but a simple \"No\" or \"Yes\" answer can lead to confusion, as a single \"No\" can seem like a \"Yes, I do mind\" (as in \"No, please don't do that\"), and a \"Yes\" can seem like a \"No, I don't mind\" (as in \"Yes, go ahead\"). An easy way to bypass this confusion would be to ask a non-negative question, such as \"Is it all right with you if...?\"\n\nSome languages have different particles (for example the [[French language|French]] \"''si''\", the [[German language|German]] \"''doch''\" or the [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] \"''jo''\") to answer negative questions (or negative statements) in an affirmative way; they provide a means to express contradiction.\n\nIn the interest of precise language, a '''direct answer''' has been defined:<ref>[[Nuel Belnap]] & T.B. Steel Jr. (1976) ''The Logic of Questions and Answers'', pages 3, 12 & 13, [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-01962-9}}</ref>\n\n\"A direct answer to a given question is a piece of language that completely, but just completely, answers the question...What is crucial is that it be effectively decidable whether a piece of language is a direct answer to a specific question.\" and \"To each clear question there corresponds a set of statements which are ''directly'' responsive. ... A direct answer must provide an unarguably final resolution of the question.\"\n\nMore information on these issues can be found in the articles [[yes\u2013no question]], [[yes and no]], and [[answer ellipsis]].\n\n== Learning  ==\nQuestions are used from the most elementary stage of learning to original research.  In the [[scientific method]], a question often forms the basis of the investigation and can be considered a transition between the observation and hypothesis stages.  Students of all ages use questions in their learning of topics, and the skill of having learners creating \"investigatable\" questions is a central part of [[inquiry education]].  The [[Socratic method]] of questioning student responses may be used by a teacher to lead the student towards the truth without direct instruction, and also helps students to form logical conclusions.\n\nA widespread and accepted use of questions in an educational context is the assessment of students' knowledge through [[exam]]s.\n\n== Philosophy  ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n[[philosophy|Philosophical]] questions are [[concept]]ual, not factual questions. There are questions that are not fully answered by any other. Philosophy deals with questions that arise when people reflect on their lives and their world. Some philosophical questions are practical: for example, \"Is [[euthanasia]] justifiable?\", \"Does the state have the right to censor pornography or restrict tobacco advertising?\", \"To what extent are [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] today responsible for decisions made by their ancestors?\"\n\nOther philosophical questions are more [[theory|theoretical]], although they often arise through thinking about practical issues. The questions just listed, for example, may prompt more general philosophical questions about the circumstances under which it may be morally justifiable to take a life, or about the extent to which the state may restrict the liberty of the individual. Some \"classic\" questions of philosophy are speculative and theoretical and concern the nature of knowledge, reality and human existence: for example, \"What, if anything, can be known with certainty?\", \"Is the mind essentially non-physical?\", \"Are values absolute or relative?\", \"Does the universe need explanation in terms of a Supreme Intelligence?\", \"What, if anything, is the meaning or purpose of human existence?\" Finally, the philosophical questions are typically about conceptual issues; they are often questions about our concepts and the relation between our concepts and the world they represent. Every question implies a statement and every statement implies a question.<ref>Paul, Richard and Elder, Linda.

For example, [[David Premack|David and Anne Premack]] wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions \u2014 unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\".<ref>{{cite book | title =  The mind of an ape | first1= David | last1=Premack |first2=Ann J. |last2= Premack |year = 1983 | publisher =  [[W.

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of [[illocutionary act]] in the field of [[pragmatics]] or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]] such as [[alternative semantics]] or [[inquisitive semantics]]. Questions are often conflated with [[Interrogative|interrogatives]], which are the [[grammar|grammatical]] forms typically used to achieve them. [[Rhetorical question]]s, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they aren't expected to be answered. Conversely, non-interrogative grammatical structures may be considered questions as in the case of the [[imperative mood|imperative]] sentence \"tell me your name\".\n\n== Uses==\n[[File:BBC World Questions - Hungary.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Dimbleby]] questioning \u2013 [[BBC World Service]]]]\nThe principal use of questions is to elicit information from the person being addressed by indicating the information which the speaker (or writer) desires.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Searle |first1=J |title=Speech acts |date=1969 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge}}</ref> However, questions can also be used for a number of other purposes. Questions may be asked for the purpose of testing someone's knowledge, as in a [[quiz]] or [[Test (assessment)|examination]]. These are termed [[Display question|display questions]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Searle |first1=J |title=Speech acts |date=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=69}}</ref> Raising a question may guide the questioner along an avenue of [[research]] (see [[Socratic method]]).\n\nA [[research question]] is an interrogative statement that manifests the objective or line of scholarly or scientific inquiry designed to address a specific gap in knowledge. Research questions are expressed in a language that is appropriate for the academic community that has the greatest interest in answers that would address said gap. These interrogative statements serve as launching points for the academic pursuit of new knowledge by directing and delimiting an investigation of a topic, a set of studies, or an entire program of research.\n\nA [[rhetorical question]] is asked to make a point, and doesn't expect an answer (often the answer is implied or obvious). As such, it isn't a true question. Similarly, requests for things other than information, as with \"Would you pass the salt?\" are interrogative in form, but aren't true questions.\n\nPre-suppositional or [[loaded question]]s, such as \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" may be used as a joke or to embarrass an audience, because any answer a person could give would imply more information than he was willing to affirm.\n\nQuestions can also be used as titles of works of literature, art and scholarship. Examples include [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s short story ''[[How Much Land Does a Man Need?]]'', the painting ''[[And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)|And When Did You Last See Your Father?]]'', the movie ''[[What About Bob?]]'', and the academic work ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]''\n\n===By purpose===\nVarious categorizations of questions have been proposed.{{by whom|date=January 2014}} With regard to research projects, one system distinguishes:<ref>\n{{cite web|url = http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/resques.php\n| title=Research Methods Knowledge Base |publisher=Socialresearchmethods.net\n| date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}\n</ref>\n\n* ''descriptive questions'', used primarily with the aim of describing the existence of some thing or process\n* ''relational questions'', designed to look at the relationships between two or more variables\n* ''causal questions'', designed to determine whether certain variables affect one or more outcome variables\n\nFor the purpose of surveys, one type of question asked is the [[closed-ended question|closed-ended]] (also ''closed'' or ''dichotomous'') question, usually requiring a yes/no answer or the choice of an option(s) from a list (see also [[multiple choice]]). There are also ''nominal questions'', designed to inquire about a level of quantitative measure, usually making connections between a number and a concept (as in \"1 = Moderate; 2 = Severe; 3 = ...\").<ref>Research Methods Knowledge Base. Types of Questions. [http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/questype.php Socialresearchmethods.net]</ref> [[Open-ended question|Open-ended]] or ''open'' questions give the respondent greater freedom to provide information or opinions on a topic. (The distinction between closed and open questions is applied in a variety of other contexts too, such as [[job interview]]ing.) Surveys also often contain ''qualifying questions'' (also called ''filter questions'' or ''contingency questions''), which serve to determine whether the respondent needs to continue on to answer subsequent questions.\n\nSome types of questions that may be used in an educational context are listed in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]] of educational objectives. These include questions designed to test and promote:\n\n* Knowledge: [[Five Ws|Who, what, when, where, why, how]]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Describe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?\n* Comprehension: Retell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;\n* Application: How is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an example of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?; How is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;related to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?; Why is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;significant?\n* Analysis: What are the parts or features of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Classify&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;according to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;;\n* Synthesis: What would you infer from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What ideas can you add to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? How would you design a new&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What would happen if you combined&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What solutions would you suggest for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?\n* Evaluation: Do you agree that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What do you think about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What is the most important&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Place the following in order of priority&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? How would you decide about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? What criteria would you use to assess&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? <ref>Types of Questions Based on Bloom's Taxonomy. (Bloom, et al., 1956).{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMcKenzie's \"Questioning Toolkit\"<ref>[http://questioning.org/Q7/toolkit.html Questioning Toolkit]</ref> lists 17 types of questions, and suggests that thinkers need to orchestrate and combine these types.<ref>[http://questioning.org/oct07/punchy.html \"Punchy Question Combinations\"]</ref> Examples of these question types include the ''irreverent question'', the ''apparently irrelevant question'', the ''hypothetical question'' and the ''unanswerable question''. Questions can also be [[:wikt:felicitous|infelicitous]], being based on incorrect and illogical premises (e.g. \"Why do cats have green wings?\") or ill-placed premises (e.g. \"When did you start beating your wife?\").\n\nStrategic studies also took into consideration the questioning process. In Humint (Human Intelligence), a taxonomy of questions includes:\n* Direct questions: basic questions normally beginning with an interrogative (who, what, where, when, how, or why) and requiring a narrative answer. They are brief, precise, and simply worded to avoid confusion.\n* Initial questions: directed toward obtaining the basic information on the topic. In other words, they are the \"who, what, where, when, how, and why\" of each topic.\n* Follow-up questions: used to expand on and complete the information obtained from the initial questions.\n* Nonpertinent questions: questions that do not pertain to the collection objectives. They are used to conceal the collection objectives or to strengthen rapport with the source.\n* Repeat questions: ask the source for the same information obtained in response to earlier questions.\n* Control questions: developed from recently confirmed information from other sources that is not likely to have changed.\n* Prepared questions developed by the HUMINT collector, normally in writing, prior to the questioning.\n* Prepared questions: used primarily when dealing with information of a technical nature or specific topic.\n* Negative questions: questions that contain a negative word in the question itself such as, \"Didn't you go to the pick-up point?\"\n* Compound questions: consist of two questions asked at the same time; for example, \"Where were you going after work and who were you to meet there?\"\n* Vague questions: do not have enough information for the source to understand exactly what the HUMINT collector is asking. They may be incomplete, general, or otherwise nonspecific.\n* Elicitation: is the gaining of information through direct interaction with a human source where the source is not aware of the specific purpose for the conversation.<ref>Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). Human Intelligence Collector Operations. FM 2-22.3, Washington, DC, 6 September 2006. p. 167. Publication available at army knowledge online (www.us.army.mil). </ref>\n* Softball question: question on easy, not serious or not important topic\n* Hardball question: confronting question, pressing the answerer to explain e.g. inconsistencies or discrepancies with their previous stances\n* [[Gotcha question]]\n\n===By grammatical form <span id=\"wh\"></span>===\nQuestions that ask whether or not some statement is true are called [[yes\u2013no question]]s (or ''polar questions'', or ''general questions''<ref name=\"Chisholm\">William Chisholm, Louis T. Milic, John A.C. Greppin. Interrogativity. \u2013 John Benjamins Publishing, 1982. </ref>), since they can in principle be answered by a [[yes and no|\"yes\" or \"no\"]] (or similar words or expressions in other languages). Examples include \"Do you take sugar?\", \"Should they be believed?\" and \"Am I the loneliest person in the world?\"\n\nA type of question that is similar in form to a yes\u2013no question, but is not intended to be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\", is the ''[[alternative question]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnAlternativeQuestion.htm |title=What is an alternative question?|publisher=SIL International |work=Glossary of linguistic terms |editor1-last=Loos |editor1-first=Eugene E. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Susan |editor3-last=Day |editor3-first=Dwight H., Jr. |editor4-last=Jordan |editor4-first=Paul C. |editor5-last=Wingate |editor5-first=J. Douglas }}</ref> (or ''choice question''). This presents two or more alternative answers, as in \"Do you want fish or lamb?\", or \"Are you supporting England, Ireland or Wales?\" The expected response is one of the alternatives, or some other indication such as \"both\" or \"neither\" (questionnaire forms sometimes contain an option \"none of the above\" or similar for such questions). Because of their similarity in form to yes\u2013no questions, they may sometimes be answered \"yes\" or \"no\", possibly humorously or as a result of misunderstanding.\n\nThe other main type of question (other than yes\u2013no questions) is those called '''''wh''-questions''' (or ''non-polar questions'', or ''special questions''<ref name=\"Chisholm\" />). These use [[interrogative word]]s (''wh''-words) such as ''when'', ''which'', ''who'', ''how'', etc. to specify the information that is desired. (In some languages the formation of such questions may involve [[wh-movement|''wh''-movement]] \u2013 see the section below for grammatical description.) The name derives from the fact that most of the English interrogative words (with the exception of ''how'') begin with the letters ''wh''. These are the types of question sometimes referred to in journalism and other investigative contexts as the [[Five Ws]].\n\n[[Tag question]]s are a grammatical structure in which a declarative statement or an imperative is turned into a question by adding an interrogative fragment (the \"tag\"), such as ''right'' in \"You remembered the eggs, right?\", or ''isn't it'' in \"It's cold today, isn't it?\" Tag questions may or may not be answerable with a yes or no.\n\nAs well as direct questions (such as ''Where are my keys?''), there also exist [[indirect question]]s (also called ''interrogative content clauses''), such as ''where my keys are''. These are used as [[subordinate clause]]s in sentences such as \"I wonder where my keys are\" and \"Ask him where my keys are.\" Indirect questions do not necessarily follow the same rules of grammar as direct questions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lessons-indirect-questions/|title=Indirect Questions - English Grammar Lesson - ELC|date=2017-11-27|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}</ref> For example, in English and some other languages, indirect questions are formed without inversion of subject and verb (compare the word order in \"where are they?\" and \"(I wonder) where they are\"). Indirect questions may also be subject to the changes of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and other changes that apply generally to [[indirect speech]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{main article|Interrogative}}\nLanguages may use both [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] to distinguish interrogative sentences (which pose questions) from [[declarative sentence]]s (which state propositions). Syntax refers to grammatical changes, such as moving words around or adding question words; prosody refers here to changes in [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] while speaking.\n\nIn [[English grammar|English]], [[German grammar|German]], [[French grammar|French]] and various other languages, questions are marked by a distinct [[word order]] featuring [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] \u2013 the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is placed after the [[verb]] rather than before it: \"You are cold\" becomes \"Are you cold?\" However, English allows such inversion only with a particular class of verbs (called auxiliary or [[special verb]]s), and thus sometimes requires the addition of an auxiliary ''do'', ''does'' or ''did'' before inversion can take place (\"He sings\" \u2192 \"Does he sing?\") \u2013 for details see [[do-support|''do''-support]].\n\nIn some languages, yes\u2013no questions are marked by an [[interrogative particle]], such as the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{lang|ja|\u304b}} ''ka'', [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] {{lang|zh|\u5417}} ''ma'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''czy''. Also, in languages generally, ''wh''-questions are marked by an [[interrogative word]] (''wh''-word) such as ''what'', ''where'' or ''how''. In languages such as English this word generally moves to the front of the sentence ([[wh-fronting|''wh''-fronting]]), and subject\u2013verb inversion occurs as in yes\u2013no questions, but in some other languages these changes in word order are not necessary (e.g. Mandarin {{lang|zh|\u4f60\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f}} ''n\u01d0 y\u00e0o sh\u00e9nme'', meaning \"what do you want?\" is literally \"you want what?\").\n\nIntonation patterns characteristic of questions often involve a raised pitch near the end of the sentence. In English this occurs especially for yes\u2013no questions; it may also be used for sentences that do not have the grammatical form of questions, but are nonetheless intended to elicit information ([[declarative question]]s), as in \"You're not using this?\"\n\nIn languages written in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] or certain other scripts, a [[question mark]] at the end of a sentence identifies questions in writing. (In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] an additional [[\u00bf|inverted mark]] is placed at the beginning: ''\u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1 usted?'' \"How are you?\") As with intonation, this feature is not restricted to sentences having the grammatical form of questions \u2013 it may also indicate a sentence's [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] function.\n\n==Responses==\nThe most typical response to a question is an answer that provides the information indicated as being sought by the questioner. This may range from a simple [[yes and no|''yes'' or ''no'']] (in the case of yes\u2013no questions) to a more complex or detailed answer. (An answer may be ''correct'' or ''incorrect'', depending on whether the information it presents is true or [[False (logic)|false]].) An indication of inability or unwillingness to provide an answer is the other response to a question.\n\n\"Negative questions\" are interrogative sentences which contain negation in their phrasing, such as \"Shouldn't you be working?\" These can have different ways of expressing affirmation and denial from the standard form of question, and they can be confusing, since it is sometimes unclear whether the answer should be the opposite of the answer to the non-negated question. For example, if one does not have a passport, both \"Do you have a passport?\" and \"Don't you have a passport?\" are properly answered with \"No\", despite apparently asking opposite questions. The Japanese and Korean languages avoid this ambiguity. Answering \"No\" to the second of these in Japanese or Korean would mean, \"I ''do'' have a passport\".\n\nA similar ambiguous question in English is \"Do you mind if...?\" The responder may reply unambiguously \"Yes, I do mind,\" if they do mind, or \"No, I don't mind,\" if they don't, but a simple \"No\" or \"Yes\" answer can lead to confusion, as a single \"No\" can seem like a \"Yes, I do mind\" (as in \"No, please don't do that\"), and a \"Yes\" can seem like a \"No, I don't mind\" (as in \"Yes, go ahead\"). An easy way to bypass this confusion would be to ask a non-negative question, such as \"Is it all right with you if...?\"\n\nSome languages have different particles (for example the [[French language|French]] \"''si''\", the [[German language|German]] \"''doch''\" or the [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] \"''jo''\") to answer negative questions (or negative statements) in an affirmative way; they provide a means to express contradiction.\n\nIn the interest of precise language, a '''direct answer''' has been defined:<ref>[[Nuel Belnap]] & T.B. Steel Jr. (1976) ''The Logic of Questions and Answers'', pages 3, 12 & 13, [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-01962-9}}</ref>\n\n\"A direct answer to a given question is a piece of language that completely, but just completely, answers the question...What is crucial is that it be effectively decidable whether a piece of language is a direct answer to a specific question.\" and \"To each clear question there corresponds a set of statements which are ''directly'' responsive. ... A direct answer must provide an unarguably final resolution of the question.\"\n\nMore information on these issues can be found in the articles [[yes\u2013no question]], [[yes and no]], and [[answer ellipsis]].\n\n== Learning  ==\nQuestions are used from the most elementary stage of learning to original research.  In the [[scientific method]], a question often forms the basis of the investigation and can be considered a transition between the observation and hypothesis stages.  Students of all ages use questions in their learning of topics, and the skill of having learners creating \"investigatable\" questions is a central part of [[inquiry education]].  The [[Socratic method]] of questioning student responses may be used by a teacher to lead the student towards the truth without direct instruction, and also helps students to form logical conclusions.\n\nA widespread and accepted use of questions in an educational context is the assessment of students' knowledge through [[exam]]s.\n\n== Philosophy  ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n[[philosophy|Philosophical]] questions are [[concept]]ual, not factual questions. There are questions that are not fully answered by any other. Philosophy deals with questions that arise when people reflect on their lives and their world. Some philosophical questions are practical: for example, \"Is [[euthanasia]] justifiable?\", \"Does the state have the right to censor pornography or restrict tobacco advertising?\", \"To what extent are [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] today responsible for decisions made by their ancestors?\"\n\nOther philosophical questions are more [[theory|theoretical]], although they often arise through thinking about practical issues. The questions just listed, for example, may prompt more general philosophical questions about the circumstances under which it may be morally justifiable to take a life, or about the extent to which the state may restrict the liberty of the individual. Some \"classic\" questions of philosophy are speculative and theoretical and concern the nature of knowledge, reality and human existence: for example, \"What, if anything, can be known with certainty?\", \"Is the mind essentially non-physical?\", \"Are values absolute or relative?\", \"Does the universe need explanation in terms of a Supreme Intelligence?\", \"What, if anything, is the meaning or purpose of human existence?\" Finally, the philosophical questions are typically about conceptual issues; they are often questions about our concepts and the relation between our concepts and the world they represent. Every question implies a statement and every statement implies a question.<ref>Paul, Richard and Elder, Linda. (2005) Critical Thinking Tools for Taking Charge of Your Learning and Your Life, New Jersey: Prentice Hall Publishing. {{ISBN|0-13-114962-8}}</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n\nEnculturated apes [[Kanzi]], [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]], [[Sarah (chimpanzee)|Sarah]] and a few others who underwent extensive language training programs (with the use of gestures and other visual forms of communications) successfully learned to ''answer'' quite complex questions and requests (including question words \"who\" what\", \"where\"), although so far they have failed to learn how to ''ask questions themselves''. For example, [[David Premack|David and Anne Premack]] wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions \u2014 unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\".<ref>{{cite book | title =  The mind of an ape | first1= David | last1=Premack |first2=Ann J. |last2= Premack |year = 1983 | publisher =  [[W. W. Norton & Company]] | location = New York, London |page=29}}</ref> The ability to ask questions is often assessed in relation to comprehension of [[syntactic structure]]s. It is widely accepted that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy, at the pre-syntactic, one word stage of [[language development]], with the use of question [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].<ref>{{cite book | title =  The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | last1 = Crystal | first1=David | year = 1987 | publisher = Cambridge University | location = Cambridge.
