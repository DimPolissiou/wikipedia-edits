''40oz. to Freedom'' received mixed critical reviews upon its first release but has earned an improved public perception since. Sublime would not achieve any mainstream success until the release of [[Sublime (album)|their eponymous album]] in 1996, two months after the death of their lead singer and guitarist, [[Bradley Nowell]]. As of 2011, the album has certified sales of two million copies in the US and is Sublime's second best-selling studio album there (the self-titled album leads with six million). Along with [[The Offspring]]'s 1994 album ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'', ''40oz. to Freedom'' is one of the highest-selling independently released albums of all time.\n\n''40oz. to Freedom'''s sound blended various forms of [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican music]], including [[ska]] ([[Date Rape (song)|\"Date Rape\"]]), [[rocksteady]] (\"[[54-46 That's My Number]]\"), [[roots reggae]] (\"[[Smoke Two Joints]]\"), and [[dub music|dub]] (\"Let's Go Get Stoned\", \"D.J.s\") along with British and American [[hardcore punk]] (\"New Thrash\", \"Hope\") and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] (as in \"Live at E's\").\n\n== Background ==\nAt the age of sixteen, [[Bradley Nowell]] began playing guitar and started his first band, Hogan's Heroes, with  Michael Yates and [[Eric Wilson (bassist)|Eric Wilson]], who would later become Sublime's bassist.<ref name=\"Drug Bust\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGB0iIRXtJEC&lpg=PA64&dq=Sublime%20Bradley%20Nowell&lr&as_pt=MAGAZINES&rview=1&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Drug Bust: When Brad Nowell Died of a Heroin Overdose|date=1997-01-06|accessdate=2011-02-04|work=Spin|last=Smith|first=RJ}}</ref>  At first, Wilson did not share Nowell's interest in reggae music.  Nowell recalled the experience: \"I was trying to get them to do ([[UB40]]'s version of) 'Cherry Oh Baby', and it didn't work. They tried, but it just sounded like such garbage.  We were horrible.\"<ref name=\"Most\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-04/entertainment/ca-62206_1_sublime-songs|title=Sublime Making the Most of '40oz.' of Success|last=Boehm|first=Mike|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Eddy Hartenstein|date=May 4, 1995|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, music student [[Michael Happoldt|Michael \"Miguel\" Happoldt]] approached the band, offering to let the band record in the studio at the school where Happoldt was studying.  The band enthusiastically agreed and broke into the school at night, where they recorded from midnight to seven in the morning.<ref name=VH1behindthemusic>{{cite episode | title = Sublime|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/behind_the_music/episode.jhtml?episodeID=55758 | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = May 30, 2001 | accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref>  The recording session resulted in the popular cassette tape called ''[[Jah Won't Pay the Bills]]'', which was released in 1991. The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout Southern California.  Using the same tactics implemented for the recording of ''Jah Won't Pay the Bills'', the band recorded ''40oz. to Freedom'' in secrecy at the studios in [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]].<ref name=\"Limit\">{{cite news|title=Ska's the Limit for Controversial Band Sublime|last=Freedom du Lac|first=J.|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|publisher=Cheryl Dell|date=November 5, 1995}}</ref>  Nowell recalled \"You weren't supposed to be in there after 9 p.m., but we'd go in at 9:30 and stay until 5 in the morning. We'd just hide from the security guards. They never knew we were there. We managed to get $30,000 worth of studio time for free.\"<ref name=\"Limit\"/>\n\n== Influences ==\nSublime themselves credit a number of local reggae and rap bands from California for inspiration in their Thanx Dub.

''40oz. to Freedom'' received mixed critical reviews upon its first release but has earned an improved public perception since. Sublime would not achieve any mainstream success until the release of [[Sublime (album)|their eponymous album]] in 1996, two months after the death of their lead singer and guitarist, [[Bradley Nowell]]. As of 2011, the album has certified sales of two million copies in the US and is Sublime's second best-selling studio album there (the self-titled album leads with six million). Along with [[The Offspring]]'s 1994 album ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'', ''40oz. to Freedom'' is one of the highest-selling independently released albums of all time.\n\n''40oz. to Freedom'''s sound blended various forms of [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican music]], including [[ska]] ([[Date Rape (song)|\"Date Rape\"]]), [[rocksteady]] (\"[[54-46 That's My Number]]\"), [[roots reggae]] (\"[[Smoke Two Joints]]\"), and [[dub music|dub]] (\"Let's Go Get Stoned\", \"D.J.s\") along with British and American [[hardcore punk]] (\"New Thrash\", \"Hope\") and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] (as in \"Live at E's\").\n\n== Background ==\nAt the age of sixteen, [[Bradley Nowell]] began playing guitar and started his first band, Hogan's Heroes, with  Michael Yates and [[Eric Wilson (bassist)|Eric Wilson]], who would later become Sublime's bassist.<ref name=\"Drug Bust\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGB0iIRXtJEC&lpg=PA64&dq=Sublime%20Bradley%20Nowell&lr&as_pt=MAGAZINES&rview=1&pg=PA63#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Drug Bust: When Brad Nowell Died of a Heroin Overdose|date=1997-01-06|accessdate=2011-02-04|work=Spin|last=Smith|first=RJ}}</ref>  At first, Wilson did not share Nowell's interest in reggae music.  Nowell recalled the experience: \"I was trying to get them to do ([[UB40]]'s version of) 'Cherry Oh Baby', and it didn't work. They tried, but it just sounded like such garbage.

The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout Southern California.  Using the same tactics implemented for the recording of ''Jah Won't Pay the Bills'', the band recorded ''40oz. to Freedom'' in secrecy at the studios in [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]].<ref name=\"Limit\">{{cite news|title=Ska's the Limit for Controversial Band Sublime|last=Freedom du Lac|first=J.|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|publisher=Cheryl Dell|date=November 5, 1995}}</ref>  Nowell recalled \"You weren't supposed to be in there after 9 p.m., but we'd go in at 9:30 and stay until 5 in the morning.

{"title_page": "New England theology", "text_new": "'''New England theology''' (or '''Edwardsianism''') designates a school of theology which grew up among the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] of [[New England]], originating in the year 1732, when [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] began his constructive theological work, culminating a little before the [[American Civil War]], declining afterwards, and rapidly disappearing after the year 1880.{{Sfn|Jackson|1910}}\n\nDuring this period it became the dominant school among Congregationalists, led to division among [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterians]] into two strains:  the [[Old School\u2013New School Controversy|New School Presbyterians]] (who leaned towards New England teachings) and the [[Old School\u2013New School Controversy|Old School Presbyterians]] (who repudiated dilution of the Westminster Standards). This theology was the basis of all the [[seminary|seminaries]] of the Congregationalists and several of the Presbyterians, and furnished the impetus for social change which birthed the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], established a series of colleges from [[Amherst College|Amherst]] in the East to [[Pacific University]] in the West, and led in a great variety of practical efforts to extend the Christian religion.{{Sfn|Jackson|1910}}\n\nIt can be described as the [[Calvinism]] of the [[Westminster Confession]] and the [[Synod of Dort]], modified by a conception of God taken by its advocates to be more ethical; by a new emphasis upon the liberty, ability, and responsibility of man; by the restriction of moral quality to action in distinction from nature (cf. [[original sin]] and [[total depravity]]); and by the theory that the constitutive principle of [[virtue]] is benevolence.{{Sfn|Jackson|1910}} The New England theology went through several stages, including the '''New Divinity''' espoused by [[Samuel Hopkins (1721-1803)|Samuel Hopkins]] and the '''New Haven theology''' espoused by [[Nathaniel W. Taylor]].\n\n==Edwards's theology==\n[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] (1703\u20131758) was a New England [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalist]] minister, part of a [[Calvinist]] tradition with a strong [[Puritan]] heritage. By the time Edwards had been [[Ordination|ordained]] in 1727, there were already signs of a growing division among New England's Congregationalists between the more traditional, \"Old-Style Calvinism\" and those of a more \"free and [[Catholic (term)|catholick]]\" outlook who were increasingly influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism and [[Congregationalism in the United States#Liberals, Old Calvinists and the New Divinity|liberal Arminianism]].{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|pp=296\u2013297,300}}\n\nIn these debates, Edwards took the side of traditional Calvinism. Yet, through his theological writings, he defended it using the philosophical language of the 18th century, producing a \"monumental reconstruction of strict Reformed orthodoxy\".{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=298}}{{Sfn|Noll|2002|p=23}} A spiritual and intellectual leader in the [[First Great Awakening]], most of his publications between 1737 and 1746 addressed the Awakening. As a supporter of moderate [[revivalism]], Edwards became, in the words of historian [[Sydney Ahlstrom]], \"one of the most important interpreters of religious experience and experiential religion in post-[[Reformation]] history.\"{{Sfn|Ahlstrom|2004|p=301}}\n\n===Original sin===\nAccording to traditional Reformed views on [[original sin]] and [[imputation of sin]], [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], the first man, was the \"federal\" or [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] head of all humanity. When Adam committed the first [[sin]], God imputed his sin to all humans, who thereafter share in a corrupt nature, leading to individuals committing their own actual sins and incurring their own individual guilt.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|pp=59\u201360}} Therefore, God imputes sin to Adam's descendants prior to actual transgression on their part.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=62}} \n\nIn the 18th century, theologians began questioning these traditional views, particularly the idea that humans are condemned at birth for Adam's sin, in which they had no active role. English Presbyterian minister [[John Taylor (dissenting preacher)|John Taylor]] wrote in ''The Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin'' (1750) that \"a Representative, the Guilt of whose Conduct shall be imputed to us, and whose Sins shall corrupt and debauch our Nature, is one of the greatest Absurdities in all the System of corrupt Religion. ... [Anyone] who dares use his Understanding, must clearly see this is unreasonable, and altogether inconsistent with the Truth, and Goodness of God.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=60}}\n\nIn 1758, Edwards published ''The Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended'' to defend the Reformed view against the attacks of Taylor and others by showing that all of mankind was complicit in [[Fall of man|the fall]]. Edwards found a harmony of the will between Adam (as the head) and the rest of humanity. As church historian Robert Caldwell explains,\"as soon as human beings come into existence, their initial moral acts, united to Adam's, immediately concur with Adam's transgression, and on that basis they become guilty of Adam's sin.&nbsp;... In short, our first sins are the extended act of Adam's original transgression.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=61}} Therefore, in Edwards's theology, there is no imputation of a completely alien guilt because all human beings share in Adam's actual transgression. This distinguishes Edwards from the traditional Reformed teaching that imputation of sin to Adam's descendants occurred prior to any actual transgression. On this point, Edwards writes, \"The apostasy is not theirs, merely because God imputes it to them; but it is truly and properly theirs, and on that ground, God imputes it to them.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=62}}\n\n===Freedom of the will===\nAnother traditional Reformed teaching under attack in the 18th century was the doctrine of [[total depravity]], that sinful humans are by nature unable to love or submit to God. Inspired by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of freedom and liberty, some theologians were replacing Calvinism with an [[Arminian]] view on [[Free will in theology|free will]]. In ''[[The Freedom of the Will|Freedom of the Will]]'' (1754), Edwards attempted to show that human freedom was consistent with human depravity.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nAccording to Edwards, \"the will is as the greatest apparent good is.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=64}} Once the mind discerns what action results in the greatest benefit to the self, the will is activated and a choice is made. The will is free, and freedom is, for Edwards, the power of the individual to do as he or she pleases.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=64}} What pleases a person is determined by the character or orientation of their soul (the combination of tastes, biases and values). Edwards called this the soul's \"disposition\", and he believed this was what determined a person's perception of the greatest apparent good. Individuals cannot change the dispositions of their souls, nor would they want to.  Therefore, for Edwards, \"Because sinful human beings by nature have no disposition to submit to God, they will never see Christ as their greatest good and consequently will never choose to follow him.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=65}}\n\nEdwards went beyond traditional Calvinism, however, by making a distinction between the ''natural ability'' and the ''moral inability'' to follow Christ. Because sin does not annihilate the will, Edwards believed that all humans theoretically could choose to follow Christ, what he termed \"natural ability\".{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=65}} Nevertheless, sinful dispositions prevent the [[Regeneration (theology)|unregenerate]] individual from ever perceiving Christ as the greatest good, what Edwards termed \"moral inability\". Though unregenerate people can follow Christ, they never will because of their sinful dispositions.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=66}} Edwards believed this explanation affirmed  free will, human responsibility and human depravity. He also believed it left intact [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|God's sovereignty]] in [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] because only God could grant a person's soul a new disposition capable of seeing God as the greatest good.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=67}}\n\n===Disinterested love===\n{{See|First Great Awakening#Revival theology}}\nAnother major element of Edwards's theology is the concept of disinterested love. Edwards believed that true Christians are disinterested in themselves and completely preoccupied with the beauty of God and his desires, ways and purposes. Their lives are God-centered rather than self-centered.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=68}} Attainment of this disinterested spirituality was only possible through regeneration and [[New birth|conversion]], when the Holy Spirit allowed the individual to see and understand the inherent beauty and excellency of God.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=69}}\n\nSuch disinterested spirituality was an important part of Edwards's own [[Assurance (theology)|doctrine of assurance]]. If one's religious feelings or, in Edwards's language, affections (such as love and desire) are driven by self-interest (such as \"God loves me\" or \"I am saved\"), then they are not marks of true religion. In his view, authentic religious affections arise from the soul that is completely preoccupied with God's worth and excellency. In fact, Edwards notes that the truly converted will be so disinterested in themselves that their own salvation will not be their primary concern:\n\n{{quote|It has more frequently been so amongst us, that when persons have first had the Gospel ground of relief for lost sinners discovered to them, and have been entertaining their minds with the sweet prospect, they have thought nothing at that time of their being converted. ... There is wrought in them a holy repose of soul in God through Christ, and a secret disposition to fear and love him, and to hope for blessing from him in this way. And yet they have no imagination that they are now converted, it don't so much as come in their minds.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=71}}}}\n\nFor Edwards, then, gaining assurance of one's salvation should not be the primary concern of a new convert. He believed assurance would develop as a convert grew in [[sanctification]]. The concept of disinterested love also led to an ethic of self-denial. The spread of [[the gospel]] and the salvation of people should be a Christian's primary concerns.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=72}}\n\n==New Divinity==\n{{Further|Congregationalism in the United States#Liberals, Old Calvinists and the New Divinity}}\nIn the aftermath of the Great Awakening, New England Congregationalism was divided into competing factions, including the followers of Edwards who were known as Edwardsians or New Divinity men. The other two factions included the liberal [[Old and New Light|Old Lights]] and the traditional Old Calvinists. The liberals, led by [[Charles Chauncy (1705\u20131787)|Charles Chauncy]] (1705\u20131787), opposed the irrational enthusiasm of the revivals; this faction advocated [[universalism]] and their successors would become [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. The traditional Old Calvinists, led by men such as [[Moses Mather]] (1719\u20131806) and [[Ezra Stiles]] (1727\u20131795), disagreed with what they considered deviations from orthodox Reformed theology, but this group ceased to exist during the [[Second Great Awakening]].{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=58\u201359}} New Divinity men such as [[Joseph Bellamy]] (1719\u20131790), [[Samuel Hopkins (theologian)|Samuel Hopkins]] (1721\u20131803) and [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]] (1752\u20131817) were revivalists who tried to steer a moderate course between Old Lights who opposed revival and radical [[Old and New Light|New Lights]] who separated from the established Congregational churches. By the end of the 18th century, most Congregational churches were Edwardsian in orientation.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=59\u201360}} \n\nEdwards' distinction between natural ability and moral ability had implications for New Divinity preaching and [[evangelism]] that were departures from traditional Puritan beliefs. For the Puritans, conversion was a gradual process involving spiritual crises, humiliation, and sorrow for sin. Only after these struggles and utilizing the [[means of grace]] (prayer, seeking God, reading the Bible, and attending church) would the individual discern within himself faith and [[Love of God|love for Christ]] and be encouraged to repent. New Divinity ministers, however, called all sinners to repent and believe the gospel immediately because everyone had the natural ability to do so. There was no reason, they said, to wait for any period of conviction and spiritual struggle. While immediate repentance was criticized by Old Calvinists, there was practically little difference between the two approaches. When asked how to repent, Old Calvinists and New Divinity ministers had the same advice: seek God through the means of grace and in time God might give the seeker new affections and inclinations to believe in Christ.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nEdwardsians also worked to return Congregational churches to stricter rules regarding who could be admitted to the [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|Lord's Supper]], reversing a trend allowing the non-converted to participate (see [[Half-Way Covenant]] for more information).{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=59\u201360}} \n\nThe New Divinity's theology of religious experience was influenced by Edwards's works ''[[Religious Affections|Treatise Concerning Religious Affections]]'' and ''[[The Nature of True Virtue]]''. The New Divinity argued that the true Christian seeks the good of all things, including God and other people, above themselves. This was called \"disinterested benevolence\" because Christian benevolence is never self-serving, unlike the benevolence of the unconverted.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=47}}\n\nDisinterested benevolence was the basis for piety, according to the New Divinity. It originates at conversion when the Holy Spirit was believed to renew the heart so that the convert desires [[union with Christ]] through faith and embraces the way of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]], which is self-sacrifice. In this, self-love is eliminated and the convert seeks happiness in God and his creation.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=47}} For Edwards, a disinterest in one's self and a preoccupation with God's moral excellence was an indication that such a person had been regenerated. Such persons no longer worried over the status of their own souls because their love for God and the contemplation of his [[Glory (religion)|glory]] made [[Assurance (theology)|assurance of one's salvation]] virtually an afterthought.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=48}}\n\nThe theology of disinterested benevolence led [[Samuel Hopkins (theologian)|Samuel Hopkins]], pastor of [[United Congregational Church (Newport, Rhode Island)|First Congregational Church]] in Newport, Rhode Island, to oppose [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] for the good of the enslaved. He wrote several treatises on the subject in the 1770s decades before the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement gained strength in America.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=49}} Disinterested benevolence also inspired much of the [[missionary]] activity of the period, such as the creation of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. Many New Divinity ministers and missionaries were inspired by ''[[The Life of David Brainerd]]'' published by Edwards as an account of the ministry of [[David Brainerd]], a missionary to the [[Lenape|Delaware Indians]] of New Jersey. Brainerd's life was held up as the ideal of disinterested benevolence.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=49\u201351}}\n\n===Principles===\n[[Image:SamuelHopkinsClergyman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Samuel Hopkins, proponent of New Divinity]]\nThe main principles of it are either taught or implied in the writings of [[Samuel Hopkins (1721-1803)|Samuel Hopkins]]. Those principles that are merely implied in the system of Hopkins were unfolded and somewhat modified by his three friends Stephen West, [[Nathanael Emmons]], and Samuel Spring. As logically connected with each other, and as understood by the majority of its advocates, the system contains the following principles:{{Sfn|Jackson|1909}}\n\n# Every [[moral agent]] choosing right has the natural power to choose wrong, and choosing wrong has the natural power to choose right.\n# He is under no obligation to perform an act, unless he has the natural ability to perform it.\n# Although in the act of choosing, every man is as free as any moral agent can be, yet he is acted upon while he acts freely, and the [[divine providence]], as well as decree, extends to all his wrong as really as to his right volitions.\n# All [[sin]] is so overruled by God as to become the occasion of good to the universe.\n# The holiness and the sinfulness of every moral agent belong to him personally and exclusively, and cannot be [[imputed righteousness|imputed]] in a literal sense to any other agent.\n# As the holiness and the sin of man are exercises of his will, there is neither holiness nor sin in his nature viewed as distinct from these exercises (cf. [[original sin]]).\n# As all his moral acts before [[regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] are certain to be entirely sinful, no promise of regenerating grace is made to any of them.\n# The impenitent sinner is obligated, and should be exhorted, to cease from all impenitent acts, and to begin a holy life at once. His moral inability to obey this exhortation is not a literal inability (cf. [[total depravity]]), but is a mere certainty that while left to himself, he will sin; and this certainty is no reason for his not being required and urged to abstain immediately from all sin.\n# Every impenitent sinner should be willing to suffer the punishment that God wills to inflict upon him. In whatever sense he should submit to the divine justice punishing other sinners, in that sense he should submit to the divine justice punishing himself. In whatever sense the punishment of the finally obdurate promotes the highest good of the universe, in that sense he should be submissive to the divine will in punishing himself, if finally obdurate. This principle is founded mainly on the two following.\n# All holiness consists in the elective preference of the greater above the smaller, and all sin consists in the elective preference of the smaller above the greater, good of sentient beings.\n# All the moral attributes of God are comprehended in general benevolence, that is essentially the same with general justice, and includes simple, complacential, and composite benevolence; legislative, retributive, and public justice.\n# The atonement of Christ consists not in his enduring the punishment threatened by the law (see the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of the atonement]]), nor in his performing the duties required by the law, but in his manifesting and honoring by his pains, and especially by his death, all the divine attributes which would have been manifested in the same and no higher degree by the punishment of the redeemed. (See the [[Atonement (governmental view)|governmental view of the atonement]].)\n# The atonement was made for all men, the non-elect as really as the elect.

English Presbyterian minister [[John Taylor (dissenting preacher)|John Taylor]] wrote in ''The Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin'' (1750) that \"a Representative, the Guilt of whose Conduct shall be imputed to us, and whose Sins shall corrupt and debauch our Nature, is one of the greatest Absurdities in all the System of corrupt Religion. ... [Anyone] who dares use his Understanding, must clearly see this is unreasonable, and altogether inconsistent with the Truth, and Goodness of God.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=60}}\n\nIn 1758, Edwards published ''The Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended'' to defend the Reformed view against the attacks of Taylor and others by showing that all of mankind was complicit in [[Fall of man|the fall]]. Edwards found a harmony of the will between Adam (as the head) and the rest of humanity. As church historian Robert Caldwell explains,\"as soon as human beings come into existence, their initial moral acts, united to Adam's, immediately concur with Adam's transgression, and on that basis they become guilty of Adam's sin.&nbsp;... In short, our first sins are the extended act of Adam's original transgression.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=61}} Therefore, in Edwards's theology, there is no imputation of a completely alien guilt because all human beings share in Adam's actual transgression. This distinguishes Edwards from the traditional Reformed teaching that imputation of sin to Adam's descendants occurred prior to any actual transgression. On this point, Edwards writes, \"The apostasy is not theirs, merely because God imputes it to them; but it is truly and properly theirs, and on that ground, God imputes it to them.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=62}}\n\n===Freedom of the will===\nAnother traditional Reformed teaching under attack in the 18th century was the doctrine of [[total depravity]], that sinful humans are by nature unable to love or submit to God. Inspired by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of freedom and liberty, some theologians were replacing Calvinism with an [[Arminian]] view on [[Free will in theology|free will]]. In ''[[The Freedom of the Will|Freedom of the Will]]'' (1754), Edwards attempted to show that human freedom was consistent with human depravity.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nAccording to Edwards, \"the will is as the greatest apparent good is.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=64}} Once the mind discerns what action results in the greatest benefit to the self, the will is activated and a choice is made. The will is free, and freedom is, for Edwards, the power of the individual to do as he or she pleases.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=64}} What pleases a person is determined by the character or orientation of their soul (the combination of tastes, biases and values). Edwards called this the soul's \"disposition\", and he believed this was what determined a person's perception of the greatest apparent good. Individuals cannot change the dispositions of their souls, nor would they want to.  Therefore, for Edwards, \"Because sinful human beings by nature have no disposition to submit to God, they will never see Christ as their greatest good and consequently will never choose to follow him.\"{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=65}}\n\nEdwards went beyond traditional Calvinism, however, by making a distinction between the ''natural ability'' and the ''moral inability'' to follow Christ. Because sin does not annihilate the will, Edwards believed that all humans theoretically could choose to follow Christ, what he termed \"natural ability\".{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=65}} Nevertheless, sinful dispositions prevent the [[Regeneration (theology)|unregenerate]] individual from ever perceiving Christ as the greatest good, what Edwards termed \"moral inability\". Though unregenerate people can follow Christ, they never will because of their sinful dispositions.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=66}} Edwards believed this explanation affirmed  free will, human responsibility and human depravity. He also believed it left intact [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|God's sovereignty]] in [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] because only God could grant a person's soul a new disposition capable of seeing God as the greatest good.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=67}}\n\n===Disinterested love===\n{{See|First Great Awakening#Revival theology}}\nAnother major element of Edwards's theology is the concept of disinterested love. Edwards believed that true Christians are disinterested in themselves and completely preoccupied with the beauty of God and his desires, ways and purposes. Their lives are God-centered rather than self-centered.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=68}} Attainment of this disinterested spirituality was only possible through regeneration and [[New birth|conversion]], when the Holy Spirit allowed the individual to see and understand the inherent beauty and excellency of God.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=69}}\n\nSuch disinterested spirituality was an important part of Edwards's own [[Assurance (theology)|doctrine of assurance]]. If one's religious feelings or, in Edwards's language, affections (such as love and desire) are driven by self-interest (such as \"God loves me\" or \"I am saved\"), then they are not marks of true religion. In his view, authentic religious affections arise from the soul that is completely preoccupied with God's worth and excellency. In fact, Edwards notes that the truly converted will be so disinterested in themselves that their own salvation will not be their primary concern:\n\n{{quote|It has more frequently been so amongst us, that when persons have first had the Gospel ground of relief for lost sinners discovered to them, and have been entertaining their minds with the sweet prospect, they have thought nothing at that time of their being converted. ... There is wrought in them a holy repose of soul in God through Christ, and a secret disposition to fear and love him, and to hope for blessing from him in this way. And yet they have no imagination that they are now converted, it don't so much as come in their minds.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=71}}}}\n\nFor Edwards, then, gaining assurance of one's salvation should not be the primary concern of a new convert. He believed assurance would develop as a convert grew in [[sanctification]]. The concept of disinterested love also led to an ethic of self-denial. The spread of [[the gospel]] and the salvation of people should be a Christian's primary concerns.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2017|p=72}}\n\n==New Divinity==\n{{Further|Congregationalism in the United States#Liberals, Old Calvinists and the New Divinity}}\nIn the aftermath of the Great Awakening, New England Congregationalism was divided into competing factions, including the followers of Edwards who were known as Edwardsians or New Divinity men. The other two factions included the liberal [[Old and New Light|Old Lights]] and the traditional Old Calvinists. The liberals, led by [[Charles Chauncy (1705\u20131787)|Charles Chauncy]] (1705\u20131787), opposed the irrational enthusiasm of the revivals; this faction advocated [[universalism]] and their successors would become [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. The traditional Old Calvinists, led by men such as [[Moses Mather]] (1719\u20131806) and [[Ezra Stiles]] (1727\u20131795), disagreed with what they considered deviations from orthodox Reformed theology, but this group ceased to exist during the [[Second Great Awakening]].{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=58\u201359}} New Divinity men such as [[Joseph Bellamy]] (1719\u20131790), [[Samuel Hopkins (theologian)|Samuel Hopkins]] (1721\u20131803) and [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]] (1752\u20131817) were revivalists who tried to steer a moderate course between Old Lights who opposed revival and radical [[Old and New Light|New Lights]] who separated from the established Congregational churches. By the end of the 18th century, most Congregational churches were Edwardsian in orientation.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=59\u201360}} \n\nEdwards' distinction between natural ability and moral ability had implications for New Divinity preaching and [[evangelism]] that were departures from traditional Puritan beliefs. For the Puritans, conversion was a gradual process involving spiritual crises, humiliation, and sorrow for sin. Only after these struggles and utilizing the [[means of grace]] (prayer, seeking God, reading the Bible, and attending church) would the individual discern within himself faith and [[Love of God|love for Christ]] and be encouraged to repent. New Divinity ministers, however, called all sinners to repent and believe the gospel immediately because everyone had the natural ability to do so. There was no reason, they said, to wait for any period of conviction and spiritual struggle. While immediate repentance was criticized by Old Calvinists, there was practically little difference between the two approaches. When asked how to repent, Old Calvinists and New Divinity ministers had the same advice: seek God through the means of grace and in time God might give the seeker new affections and inclinations to believe in Christ.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nEdwardsians also worked to return Congregational churches to stricter rules regarding who could be admitted to the [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|Lord's Supper]], reversing a trend allowing the non-converted to participate (see [[Half-Way Covenant]] for more information).{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=59\u201360}} \n\nThe New Divinity's theology of religious experience was influenced by Edwards's works ''[[Religious Affections|Treatise Concerning Religious Affections]]'' and ''[[The Nature of True Virtue]]''. The New Divinity argued that the true Christian seeks the good of all things, including God and other people, above themselves. This was called \"disinterested benevolence\" because Christian benevolence is never self-serving, unlike the benevolence of the unconverted.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=47}}\n\nDisinterested benevolence was the basis for piety, according to the New Divinity. It originates at conversion when the Holy Spirit was believed to renew the heart so that the convert desires [[union with Christ]] through faith and embraces the way of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]], which is self-sacrifice. In this, self-love is eliminated and the convert seeks happiness in God and his creation.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=47}} For Edwards, a disinterest in one's self and a preoccupation with God's moral excellence was an indication that such a person had been regenerated. Such persons no longer worried over the status of their own souls because their love for God and the contemplation of his [[Glory (religion)|glory]] made [[Assurance (theology)|assurance of one's salvation]] virtually an afterthought.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=48}}\n\nThe theology of disinterested benevolence led [[Samuel Hopkins (theologian)|Samuel Hopkins]], pastor of [[United Congregational Church (Newport, Rhode Island)|First Congregational Church]] in Newport, Rhode Island, to oppose [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] for the good of the enslaved. He wrote several treatises on the subject in the 1770s decades before the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement gained strength in America.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=49}} Disinterested benevolence also inspired much of the [[missionary]] activity of the period, such as the creation of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. Many New Divinity ministers and missionaries were inspired by ''[[The Life of David Brainerd]]'' published by Edwards as an account of the ministry of [[David Brainerd]], a missionary to the [[Lenape|Delaware Indians]] of New Jersey. Brainerd's life was held up as the ideal of disinterested benevolence.{{Sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=49\u201351}}\n\n===Principles===\n[[Image:SamuelHopkinsClergyman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Samuel Hopkins, proponent of New Divinity]]\nThe main principles of it are either taught or implied in the writings of [[Samuel Hopkins (1721-1803)|Samuel Hopkins]]. Those principles that are merely implied in the system of Hopkins were unfolded and somewhat modified by his three friends Stephen West, [[Nathanael Emmons]], and Samuel Spring. As logically connected with each other, and as understood by the majority of its advocates, the system contains the following principles:{{Sfn|Jackson|1909}}\n\n# Every [[moral agent]] choosing right has the natural power to choose wrong, and choosing wrong has the natural power to choose right.\n# He is under no obligation to perform an act, unless he has the natural ability to perform it.\n# Although in the act of choosing, every man is as free as any moral agent can be, yet he is acted upon while he acts freely, and the [[divine providence]], as well as decree, extends to all his wrong as really as to his right volitions.\n# All [[sin]] is so overruled by God as to become the occasion of good to the universe.\n# The holiness and the sinfulness of every moral agent belong to him personally and exclusively, and cannot be [[imputed righteousness|imputed]] in a literal sense to any other agent.\n# As the holiness and the sin of man are exercises of his will, there is neither holiness nor sin in his nature viewed as distinct from these exercises (cf. [[original sin]]).\n# As all his moral acts before [[regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] are certain to be entirely sinful, no promise of regenerating grace is made to any of them.\n# The impenitent sinner is obligated, and should be exhorted, to cease from all impenitent acts, and to begin a holy life at once. His moral inability to obey this exhortation is not a literal inability (cf. [[total depravity]]), but is a mere certainty that while left to himself, he will sin; and this certainty is no reason for his not being required and urged to abstain immediately from all sin.\n# Every impenitent sinner should be willing to suffer the punishment that God wills to inflict upon him. In whatever sense he should submit to the divine justice punishing other sinners, in that sense he should submit to the divine justice punishing himself. In whatever sense the punishment of the finally obdurate promotes the highest good of the universe, in that sense he should be submissive to the divine will in punishing himself, if finally obdurate. This principle is founded mainly on the two following.\n# All holiness consists in the elective preference of the greater above the smaller, and all sin consists in the elective preference of the smaller above the greater, good of sentient beings.\n# All the moral attributes of God are comprehended in general benevolence, that is essentially the same with general justice, and includes simple, complacential, and composite benevolence; legislative, retributive, and public justice.\n# The atonement of Christ consists not in his enduring the punishment threatened by the law (see the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of the atonement]]), nor in his performing the duties required by the law, but in his manifesting and honoring by his pains, and especially by his death, all the divine attributes which would have been manifested in the same and no higher degree by the punishment of the redeemed. (See the [[Atonement (governmental view)|governmental view of the atonement]].)\n# The atonement was made for all men, the non-elect as really as the elect.

In June 1973, AVX became the parent company when assets of Aerovox were sold. That same year, Marshall D. Butler, who played a major role in the company's growth, became chairman and [[CEO]].\n\nButler cofounded Alloys Unlimited Inc. in 1957, which was sold to London-based [[Plessey|Plessey Co.]] in 1970; Butler stayed for several years as president of the Plessey subsidiary. With his experience in the [[semiconductor]] field, Butler decided AVX should emphasize multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), used in the rapidly expanding [[integrated circuit]] field. Butler sold two other divisions and started a five-year plan. The company's $20 million investment and careful analysis of the market resulted in 1979 sales of $95 million and dominance of the market; the goal, based on 30 percent annual growth, had been $83 million.\n\nAVX added operations in Europe, but moving into Japan proved more difficult because of Japan's protected home market. The company's license would not let it sell in Japan, but Kyocera Corporation could sell its products in the United States. Kyocera CEO Kazuo Inamori agreed with Butler that the situation needed to be changed, and Kyocera ended the unfair provision. In 1979 AVX started a Japanese subsidiary.\n\nDuring the 1980s, growth continued, with 1984 sales reaching $234 million. But that year, it became clear that [[computer]] manufacturers had bought more capacitors than needed, and a slowdown began in the industry. AVX continued to grow through new product research and buying other companies. By the end of the decade sales reached $450 million.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the European operations of AVX represented one-fourth of sales. AVX wanted to manufacture parts for Kyocera, which had only 2 percent of its sales in Europe and hoped to increase that before the [[European Community]] made that more difficult. Inamori wanted to buy AVX rather than partner with the company. After a $267 million [[stock]] purchase, AVX has operated as part of Kyocera Corp. since January 18, 1990.\n\nButler retired as CEO in 1993 but remained on the [[board of directors]]. Benedict P. Rosen, an employee since the company's start, became the new CEO. By 1995, sales reached almost $1 billion after significant growth for [[personal computer]]s and cell phones. At the same time, the automotive, [[home appliance]] and medical industries needed electronic components, and advanced electronic systems needed capacitors as well. AVX also sold Kyocera products worldwide and helped the company start operations in Mexico and [[Indonesia]]. Kyocera helped AVX start manufacturing connectors.\n\nIn 1995, Kyocera sold one-fourth of AVX for $557 million, which more than returned the company's investment in AVX, even though Kyocera still owned three-fourths of the company. AVX used the money to enter the connector business and increase its manufacturing of ceramic and tantalum capacitors.\n\nThe boom in the capacitor industry once again proved temporary, after customers bought more products than they needed. But in 1998, personal computers and cell phones contributed to more growth, as did newer electronics in cars.

In June 1973, AVX became the parent company when assets of Aerovox were sold. That same year, Marshall D. Butler, who played a major role in the company's growth, became chairman and [[CEO]].\n\nButler cofounded Alloys Unlimited Inc. in 1957, which was sold to London-based [[Plessey|Plessey Co.]] in 1970; Butler stayed for several years as president of the Plessey subsidiary. With his experience in the [[semiconductor]] field, Butler decided AVX should emphasize multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), used in the rapidly expanding [[integrated circuit]] field. Butler sold two other divisions and started a five-year plan. The company's $20 million investment and careful analysis of the market resulted in 1979 sales of $95 million and dominance of the market; the goal, based on 30 percent annual growth, had been $83 million.\n\nAVX added operations in Europe, but moving into Japan proved more difficult because of Japan's protected home market. The company's license would not let it sell in Japan, but Kyocera Corporation could sell its products in the United States. Kyocera CEO Kazuo Inamori agreed with Butler that the situation needed to be changed, and Kyocera ended the unfair provision. In 1979 AVX started a Japanese subsidiary.\n\nDuring the 1980s, growth continued, with 1984 sales reaching $234 million. But that year, it became clear that [[computer]] manufacturers had bought more capacitors than needed, and a slowdown began in the industry. AVX continued to grow through new product research and buying other companies. By the end of the decade sales reached $450 million.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the European operations of AVX represented one-fourth of sales. AVX wanted to manufacture parts for Kyocera, which had only 2 percent of its sales in Europe and hoped to increase that before the [[European Community]] made that more difficult. Inamori wanted to buy AVX rather than partner with the company. After a $267 million [[stock]] purchase, AVX has operated as part of Kyocera Corp. since January 18, 1990.\n\nButler retired as CEO in 1993 but remained on the [[board of directors]]. Benedict P. Rosen, an employee since the company's start, became the new CEO. By 1995, sales reached almost $1 billion after significant growth for [[personal computer]]s and cell phones. At the same time, the automotive, [[home appliance]] and medical industries needed electronic components, and advanced electronic systems needed capacitors as well. AVX also sold Kyocera products worldwide and helped the company start operations in Mexico and [[Indonesia]]. Kyocera helped AVX start manufacturing connectors.\n\nIn 1995, Kyocera sold one-fourth of AVX for $557 million, which more than returned the company's investment in AVX, even though Kyocera still owned three-fourths of the company. AVX used the money to enter the connector business and increase its manufacturing of ceramic and tantalum capacitors.\n\nThe boom in the capacitor industry once again proved temporary, after customers bought more products than they needed. But in 1998, personal computers and cell phones contributed to more growth, as did newer electronics in cars. At the same time, material prices went up, and an [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian currency crisis]] added to AVX's troubles. Layoffs resulted, but by 2000 the company was doing well again, adding operations in [[El Salvador]] and the [[Czech Republic]] (Lan\u0161kroun).\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2001, AVX had 26 plants in 12 countries, 21,000 employees, and sales of $2.6 billion.

Starting as the brainchild of 16-year-old entrepreneur Amy Fleisher Madden in 1996, the label became well known for its early releases from marquee artists [[Dashboard Confessional]] and [[New Found Glory]].  Over the course of 10 years, Fiddler Records developed a steady roster of successful artists such as [[The Bled]], [[The Higher]], [[Recover (band)|Recover]], [[Juliette & The Licks]], [[Name Taken]] and [[Classic Case]].\n\nCurrently, the Fiddler Records catalog is managed by Animal Manufacturing Co. Animal Manufacturing has released vinyl for both Recover and Name Taken and has helped keep the spirit of Fiddler alive.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Origin===\nFiddler Records started in 1996 by Amy Fleisher Madden at age 16.  What started as Amy passing out photocopies of her fanzine, Fiddler Jones, in the parking lot of Miami punk venue Cheers, became one of the most historic [[pop-punk]] labels of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAfter saving $600 from promoting several shows over the course of several months at Cheers, Amy invested the money in a 7\u201d by the band Vacant Andys (led by then unknown [[Chris Carrabba]] of [[Dashboard Confessional]]).  The gold vinyl release was titled ''Anodyne'', and marked the first release from both an artist and label showing signs of much bigger things on the horizon.\n\n===Getting Off The Ground===\nFiddler began building a roster with several records, including the label's forth release, [[New Found Glory]]'s ''[[It's All About the Girls]]'' (1997), which assisted the band in breaking nationwide. It eventually sold more than 80,000 copies, as New Found Glory went on to [[pop-punk]] stardom earning multiple gold records for major labels.  Fiddler began climbing the music industry ladder by signing to the Toledo, Ohio-based small distribution outfit Lumberjack Distribution, helping to develop some of the roster\u2019s core releases from such artists as [[Recover (band)|Recover]], The Agency, and The Gray AM.\n\nIn March 2000, Fiddler released ''[[The Swiss Army Romance]]'', a solo record from [[Chris Carrabba]]\u2019s solo project titled [[Dashboard Confessional]].  The record quickly garnered critical national acclaim, and within a few months the first pressing of CDs had sold out and Carrabba left his band [[Further Seems Forever]] to pursue Dashboard Confessional full-time. In order to meet the swelling demand, ''The Swiss Army Romance'' was sold from Fiddler to the [[MCA Records]] subsidiary [[Drive-Thru Records]].\n\n===15 Seconds===\nIn November 2002, Fiddler signed a label/distribution deal with [[MCA Records]].  In March 2003, MCA folded into [[Geffen Records]], which inherited Fiddler's contract.  While Fiddler\u2019s agreement with MCA kept them bound to Geffen, during the three years under this arrangement, the now fully staffed label released records from [[The Bled]] (who later went to [[Vagrant Records]]), [[The Higher]], Poulain, and Salem.\n\nIn 2005, Fiddler parted ways with Geffen and signed a distribution agreement with [[RED Distribution]], where they released records from [[Name Taken]], The Higher, [[Juliette & The Licks]] and a release from At All Cost under Fiddler\u2019s sub-label \u201cThe Imprint.\u201d\n\n===Winding Down===\nAfter many staff changes and band break-ups, Fiddler was dismantled in 2006.  Once again solely operated by Amy, Fiddler closed and left the label website with only the words \u201c''Gone fission' Fiddler no longer exists in the physical nor the metaphysical world.
