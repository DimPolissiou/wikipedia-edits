The childlike Steve immediately agrees to join the Yankees when Al asks him, but when Al calls the team's general manager to report his find, he is fired and told not to return. Al defies the order and brings Steve back to the States anyway.  The first indication that all may not be right with Steve occurs when he panics at [[Newark International Airport]] when he and Al are momentarily separated. Later, at Al's apartment, Steve thrashes in his sleep, screaming at an unseen assailant.\n\nAl arranges an open audition at Yankee Stadium in front of representatives from every [[Major League Baseball]] team. After Steve strikes out [[Keith Hern\u00e1ndez]] and homers off [[Bret Saberhagen]], a bidding war breaks out. The Yankees win the bid war, signing Steve to a $55&nbsp;million contract, but after Steve violently snaps at press photographers, team management demands that he be [[Psychiatry|psychiatrically]] evaluated and cleared before he plays his first game.\n\nAl picks the first listed psychiatrist in the phone book, a Doctor H. Aaron, and hopes that the evaluation will be swift, so that he and Steve can get on with life.  After examining Steve, however, Dr. Aaron finds him to be deeply troubled and so severely abused as a child that he has blocked almost every memory of his early life. Desperate for Steve to play so that both can get paid, Al begs Dr. Aaron to clear Steve for play, on the condition that she sees Steve everyday before making his MLB debut.\n\nLife with Steve proves difficult for Al; Steve throws plates at reporters outside the apartment, upstages [[Tony Bennett]] at his own show, and argues with Al over what he does with his free time.  At a press conference, Al lies about Steve's past.  Dr. Aaron is livid when she finds out, but Al points out that Steve's behavior stems from her helping him acknowledge and deal with his past. Al pleads with Dr. Aaron to continue the good work she is doing for Steve.  When the Yankees reach the [[World Series]], however, Steve is suddenly depressed.  Worse yet, he is contractually obligated to pitch in Game 1.\n\nA sold-out Yankee Stadium waits for Steve's debut in Game 1 of the World Series.  When Steve is spotted on the roof of the stadium, Al sends for a helicopter to fetch him, then climbs up to plead with him to come down.  Steve adamantly refuses, and Al, risking his own career, tells Steve that he can walk away from it all, no strings attached.  Touched by Al's selflessness, Steve relents.  His spirits greatly lifted, he boards the copter to make his grand entrance.\n\nSteve pitches a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]], striking out 27 [[St. Louis Cardinals]] batters on 81 consecutive strikes, and hits two solo home runs in a 2-0 Yankees victory.

Returning to Russia, he was drafted into the [[Red Army]] and served as a junior commander during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Akhmanov held a variety of command and staff positions during the interwar period and from the early 1930s served in mechanized units. At the outbreak of [[Operation Barbarossa]] he commanded a tank division in Belarus that was destroyed, but managed to escape encirclement with the remnants of his unit. Akhmanov served in staff positions coordinating army and front-level armored troops for the next several years of the war and in early 1944 was given command of the [[23rd Tank Corps]], which he led for the rest of the war. Made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership of the corps in the repulse of German attempts to relieve the [[Siege of Budapest]] in early 1945, Akhmanov continued in command of the corps after the end of the war.

Appointed commander of the separate tank battalion of the 8th Mechanized Brigade in 1933, Akhmanov studied at the academic courses for technical improvement of commanders and staff at the [[Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy|Academy of Mechanization and Motorization]] between January and June 1935. In April 1936 he became commander of the 100th Separate Tank Battalion at [[Berdichev]], then studied as part of a special group at the Red Army Chemical Defense Academy from January 1937. Upon graduation in February 1938 he became commander of the 1st Motorized Regiment of the [[1st Chemical Motorized Division]] of the [[Moscow Military District]], and in April became division commander.

It was not until 28 June that he was able to gather the headquarters of the division and between 300 and 400 troops, the remnants of the 27th. With this force Akhmanov escaped encirclement alongside the 36th Tank Division in the area of Rudniki, continuing to collect the remnants of his unit that came in piecemeal. He ultimately managed to round up between 1,300 and 1, 500 men of the division before being ordered to lead the division to the Katkovo area on 1 July.  While en route in the Yachenka area, the division came under attack from German tanks and aircraft and suffered heavy losses. Continuing east with a remaining group of between 30 and 60 officers and enlisted men, Akhmanov crossed the [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svisloch river]] but ran into a German screening force near Zabichany. In the ensuing battle, he was concussed and his group scattered. For two days Akhmanov continued to move towards [[Mogilev]], collecting scattered troops along the way. Near Mogilev he joined the group led by Major General [[Pyotr Akhlyustin]], numbering between 1,000 and 1,400 men, and with it broke out of the encirclement on the night of 27 to 28 July, crossing the [[Sozh River]] in the sector of the [[137th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|137th Rifle Division]].{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2011|p=|pp=561\u2013563}}\n\nAkhmanov took simultaneous command of the 105th and 102nd Tank Divisions that were later reorganized into tank brigades during August and in September became chief of the Armored and Mechanized Forces of the [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th Army]].

Returning to Russia, he was drafted into the [[Red Army]] and served as a junior commander during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Akhmanov held a variety of command and staff positions during the interwar period and from the early 1930s served in mechanized units. At the outbreak of [[Operation Barbarossa]] he commanded a tank division in Belarus that was destroyed, but managed to escape encirclement with the remnants of his unit. Akhmanov served in staff positions coordinating army and front-level armored troops for the next several years of the war and in early 1944 was given command of the [[23rd Tank Corps]], which he led for the rest of the war. Made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership of the corps in the repulse of German attempts to relieve the [[Siege of Budapest]] in early 1945, Akhmanov continued in command of the corps after the end of the war. He became commander of the armored and mechanized forces of the [[Belorussian Military District]], but his career was cut short by suicide in 1949. \n\n== Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War ==\nAkhmanov was born to a peasant family on {{OldStyleDate|9 March|1897|25 February}} in the village of Alat, Alatsky volost, Kazansky Uyezd, [[Kazan Governorate]] (now [[Vysokogorsky District]] of [[Tatarstan]]).{{Sfn|Vozhakin|2006|p=|pp=100\u2013101}} He graduated from secondary school{{Sfn|Shkadov|1987|p=91}} and worked in a bootmaker's workshop in [[Kazan]] before being conscripted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]] during [[World War I]] in August 1915.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.mil.ru/encyclopedia/heroes/USSR/more.htm?id=11909207@morfHeroes|title=\u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041e\u0441\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|last=|first=|date=|website=encyclopedia.mil.ru|language=Russian|trans-title=Akhmanov, Alexey Osipovich|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Serving with the 4th Siberian Rifle Regiment of the [[1st Siberian Rifle Division (Russian Empire)|1st Siberian Rifle Division]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gwar.mil.ru/heroes/chelovek_plen31183952/|title=\u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041e\u0441\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 :: \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 :: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430|website=gwar.mil.ru|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Akhmanov began as a [[Ryadovoy|private]] and was promoted to junior ''[[Ranks and insignia of the Russian armed forces until 1917|unter-ofitser]]'' after graduating from the regimental training detachment. With the regiment, he saw action on the [[Western Front (Russian Empire)|Western Front]] before he was captured by German troops in July 1916.

Appointed commander of the separate tank battalion of the 8th Mechanized Brigade in 1933, Akhmanov studied at the academic courses for technical improvement of commanders and staff at the [[Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy|Academy of Mechanization and Motorization]] between January and June 1935. In April 1936 he became commander of the 100th Separate Tank Battalion at [[Berdichev]], then studied as part of a special group at the Red Army Chemical Defense Academy from January 1937. Upon graduation in February 1938 he became commander of the 1st Motorized Regiment of the [[1st Chemical Motorized Division]] of the [[Moscow Military District]], and in April became division commander.

About ten to twelve kilometers from [[Baranovichi]], Akhmanov found the rear of the [[36th Tank Division (Soviet Union)|36th Tank Division]], and thence went to the area of [[Mir, Belarus|Mir]], but found that there were already German troops in the vicinity. It was not until 28 June that he was able to gather the headquarters of the division and between 300 and 400 troops, the remnants of the 27th. With this force Akhmanov escaped encirclement alongside the 36th Tank Division in the area of Rudniki, continuing to collect the remnants of his unit that came in piecemeal. He ultimately managed to round up between 1,300 and 1, 500 men of the division before being ordered to lead the division to the Katkovo area on 1 July.  While en route in the Yachenka area, the division came under attack from German tanks and aircraft and suffered heavy losses. Continuing east with a remaining group of between 30 and 60 officers and enlisted men, Akhmanov crossed the [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svisloch river]] but ran into a German screening force near Zabichany. In the ensuing battle, he was concussed and his group scattered. For two days Akhmanov continued to move towards [[Mogilev]], collecting scattered troops along the way. Near Mogilev he joined the group led by Major General [[Pyotr Akhlyustin]], numbering between 1,000 and 1,400 men, and with it broke out of the encirclement on the night of 27 to 28 July, crossing the [[Sozh River]] in the sector of the [[137th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|137th Rifle Division]].{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2011|p=|pp=561\u2013563}}\n\nAkhmanov took simultaneous command of the 105th and 102nd Tank Divisions that were later reorganized into tank brigades during August and in September became chief of the Armored and Mechanized Forces of the [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th Army]].

In late October, after the 1st Guards Army was disbanded, Akhmanov was appointed deputy chief for combat employment and use of tanks of the Armored and Mechanized Directorate of the [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] (the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] from October 1943). In this position, he participated in [[Operation Little Saturn]], the [[Ostrogozhsk\u2013Rossosh Offensive]], the [[Donbass Strategic Offensive (August 1943)|Donbass Strategic Offensive]], and the [[Zaporizhia Offensive]].{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2011|p=|pp=561\u2013563}} For his \"skillful coordination of tank operations with those of other branches\" in these operations Akhmanov was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] and promoted to major general.{{Sfn|Vozhakin|2006|p=|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nFrom April 1944 to the end of the war, Akhmanov commanded the [[23rd Tank Corps]].

He served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|33rd Prime Minister of New Zealand]] for a little over a year, from August 1989 until September 1990, leading the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]]. As [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] from 1984 to 1989, Palmer was responsible for considerable reforms of the country's legal and constitutional framework, such as the creation of the [[Constitution Act 1986]], [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights]], [[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988|Imperial Laws Application Act]], and the [[State Sector Act 1988|State Sector Act]].

At [[Victoria University of Wellington]], he studied both [[political science]] and law. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 and a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1965. After working for a time in Wellington, he attended the [[University of Chicago]]'s law school, gaining a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1967.

He eventually became deputy [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] in 1983. When, in 1984, the Labour Party won the [[1984 New Zealand general election|general elections]], Palmer became [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]]. He also became Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. The new justice minister, who had promoted proportional representation as a law professor in his book ''Unbridled Power?'', also published in 1984, set up a Royal Commission to investigate the electoral system and propose modifications or alternatives. His Royal Commission reported in December 1986, recommending the Mixed Member Proportional system. After the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 elections]], when Labour was re-elected, he also became [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Minister of the Environment]], an area in which he took personal interest.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Leadership===\nThe most notable feature of New Zealand politics at the time was the economic change promoted by the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]], [[Roger Douglas]]. Douglas was advancing [[monetarism|monetarist]] policies involving extensive [[privatisation]] of state assets and the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]]\u2014these reforms were named \"[[Rogernomics]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Easton|first1=Brian|title=In Stormy Seas: The Post War New Zealand Economy|date=1997|publisher=University of Otago Press|location=Dunedin|isbn=9781877133084|pages=211\u2013231|edition=1st|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/press/books/otago067045.html|language=en-nz}}</ref> These policies, which contravened Labour's basic policy platform and campaign promises, were deeply unpopular with Labour's traditional support base, and resulted in a confrontation between Prime Minister [[David Lange]] and Roger Douglas. Lange also reneged from his promise to hold a binding referendum on the MMP system. Palmer conceded defeat on MMP at an April 1989 Labour regional conference, saying that the issue was \"effectively dead for the immediate future.\" Eventually, Douglas was removed from [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]], but the dispute had weakened Lange enough that he resigned a month later. Palmer, being deputy leader, took over as Prime Minister. Electoral reformers in the Labour Party kept up the pressure, and in September 1989, after Palmer had become prime minister, the full annual conference of the Labour Party passed a remit endorsing a referendum on the principle of proportional representation.\n\nPalmer, however, was perceived by the public as being too closely involved with Douglas's reforms and academically remote. Of particular concern to many people was his work on the legal aspects of state sector rearrangement, such as his preparation of the State Owned Enterprises Act. The presence of [[David Caygill]] (a Douglas ally) as Minister of Finance further compounded perception that Palmer was doing nothing to address public concerns. The only area in which Palmer won praise from traditional left-wing supporters was in his handling of the Environment portfolio, which he kept when he became Prime Minister \u2013 it was his work here in initiating the resource management law reform process that eventually led to the creation of the [[Resource Management Act 1991]].<ref>Palmer, G., (1991). ''\"Sustainability \u2013 New Zealand's resource management legislation.\"'' Resources: the Newsletter of the Canadian Institute of Resources Law No 34: 6 pp 3\u201310.</ref>\n\nTwo months before the 1990 elections, it was clear that Labour would not win. The perceived damage done by Roger Douglas's reforms, as well as Palmer's lack of general charisma, caused too many Labour supporters to abandon the party.

April 1942) is a New Zealand lawyer, legal academic, and past politician, who was a member of Parliament from 1979 to 1990. He served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|33rd Prime Minister of New Zealand]] for a little over a year, from August 1989 until September 1990, leading the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]]. As [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] from 1984 to 1989, Palmer was responsible for considerable reforms of the country's legal and constitutional framework, such as the creation of the [[Constitution Act 1986]], [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights]], [[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988|Imperial Laws Application Act]], and the [[State Sector Act 1988|State Sector Act]]. He served as president of the [[New Zealand Law Commission]], from 2005 to 2010.\n\n==Early life and education==\nPalmer was born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and attended Nelson Central School, Nelson Intermediate School and [[Nelson College]]. At [[Victoria University of Wellington]], he studied both [[political science]] and law. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 and a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1965. After working for a time in Wellington, he attended the [[University of Chicago]]'s law school, gaining a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1967. He moved from New Zealand to Iowa in August 1969 to become a professor at the [[University of Iowa College of Law]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Reform : a memoir|last=Palmer, G. W. R.

He eventually became deputy [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] in 1983. When, in 1984, the Labour Party won the [[1984 New Zealand general election|general elections]], Palmer became [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]]. He also became Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. The new justice minister, who had promoted proportional representation as a law professor in his book ''Unbridled Power?'', also published in 1984, set up a Royal Commission to investigate the electoral system and propose modifications or alternatives. His Royal Commission reported in December 1986, recommending the Mixed Member Proportional system. After the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 elections]], when Labour was re-elected, he also became [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Minister of the Environment]], an area in which he took personal interest.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Leadership===\nThe most notable feature of New Zealand politics at the time was the economic change promoted by the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]], [[Roger Douglas]]. Douglas was advancing [[monetarism|monetarist]] policies involving extensive [[privatisation]] of state assets and the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]]\u2014these reforms were named \"[[Rogernomics]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Easton|first1=Brian|title=In Stormy Seas: The Post War New Zealand Economy|date=1997|publisher=University of Otago Press|location=Dunedin|isbn=9781877133084|pages=211\u2013231|edition=1st|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/press/books/otago067045.html|language=en-nz}}</ref> These policies, which contravened Labour's basic policy platform and campaign promises, were deeply unpopular with Labour's traditional support base, and resulted in a confrontation between Prime Minister [[David Lange]] and Roger Douglas. Lange also reneged from his promise to hold a binding referendum on the MMP system. Palmer conceded defeat on MMP at an April 1989 Labour regional conference, saying that the issue was \"effectively dead for the immediate future.\" Eventually, Douglas was removed from [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]], but the dispute had weakened Lange enough that he resigned a month later. Palmer, being deputy leader, took over as Prime Minister. Electoral reformers in the Labour Party kept up the pressure, and in September 1989, after Palmer had become prime minister, the full annual conference of the Labour Party passed a remit endorsing a referendum on the principle of proportional representation.\n\nPalmer, however, was perceived by the public as being too closely involved with Douglas's reforms and academically remote. Of particular concern to many people was his work on the legal aspects of state sector rearrangement, such as his preparation of the State Owned Enterprises Act. The presence of [[David Caygill]] (a Douglas ally) as Minister of Finance further compounded perception that Palmer was doing nothing to address public concerns. The only area in which Palmer won praise from traditional left-wing supporters was in his handling of the Environment portfolio, which he kept when he became Prime Minister \u2013 it was his work here in initiating the resource management law reform process that eventually led to the creation of the [[Resource Management Act 1991]].<ref>Palmer, G., (1991). ''\"Sustainability \u2013 New Zealand's resource management legislation.\"'' Resources: the Newsletter of the Canadian Institute of Resources Law No 34: 6 pp 3\u201310.</ref>\n\nTwo months before the 1990 elections, it was clear that Labour would not win. The perceived damage done by Roger Douglas's reforms, as well as Palmer's lack of general charisma, caused too many Labour supporters to abandon the party. In addition, Palmer was perceived as being too academic and aloof, reminding people of the [[paternalism|paternalistic]] attitude that Douglas was accused of. Palmer was replaced by [[Mike Moore (New Zealand politician)|Mike Moore]], who Labour believed would give it a better chance of winning. Palmer chose to resign from parliament, and was replaced in his seat by [[Lianne Dalziel]]. The attempt failed, however, and the opposition [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] under [[Jim Bolger]] won a landslide victory.\n\nGeoffrey Palmer became the second Labour leader to leave the party leadership without ever leading the party into an election after [[Alfred Hindmarsh]].\n\nOf the Labour Prime Ministers and notwithstanding Hugh Watt\u2019s tenure as interim prime minister following the death of Norman Kirk, Palmer is the only one who had not also served as Leader of the Opposition before and/or after his tenure as Prime Minister.\n\n==After Parliament==\nPalmer later went on to serve as Professor of Law at Victoria University again.

The Cross County Association of Ireland (CCAI) was established in 1886 and later became a subsidiary of the IAAA.  In 1923 the [[National Athletic and Cycling Association]] (NACA) was established merging the IAAA, the CCAI,  and the Athletics Council of the GAA, with the GAA thenceforth concentrating on [[Gaelic games]]. The NACA was then admitted to membership of the [[IAAF]]. In July 1924 the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletic, Cycling and Cross Country Association (NIAAA) was formed over a dispute concerning an Easter Monday athletics meeting in Belfast, breaking away from the NACA. The Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) accepted this breakaway group under its jurisdiction.\n\nThe IAAF adopted an amendment to its constitution in 1930 which defined member organisations as being contiguous with political entities. The NACA rejected this ruling and was suspended from the IAAF. In 1937 some clubs seceded from the NACA to set up the Irish Amateur Athletic Union (IAAU) and this body became a member of the IAAF the following year while the NACA's suspension was made permanent. NACA later changed their name to the National Athletic and Cultural Association of Ireland (NACAI).\n\nThe IAAU became the Amateur Athletic Union of Eire (AAUE) which represented Ireland at subsequent Olympic games.
