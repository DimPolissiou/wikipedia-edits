{"title_page": "Paradigm shift", "text_new": "{{short description|Fundamental change in concepts}}\n{{Other uses|Paradigm Shift (disambiguation)}}\n{{See also|epistemological break}}\n\nA '''paradigm shift''', a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], is a fundamental change in the basic [[concept]]s and [[experiment]]al practices of a [[:Category:Scientific disciplines|scientific discipline]]. Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962).\n\nKuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework or [[paradigm]]. Paradigm shifts arise when the dominant paradigm under which normal science operates is rendered incompatible with new phenomena, facilitating the adoption of a new theory or paradigm.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=54}}</ref>\n\nAs one commentator summarizes:\n\n{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term \"paradigm\" in two different meanings. In the first one, \"paradigm\" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton\u2019s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls \"normal science\". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term \"paradigm\", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nEven though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.\n\n== History ==\nThe nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase \"revolution of the way of thinking\" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.\n\n=== Original usage ===\n[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit\u2013duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 114</ref>]]\n\nIn his 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn explains the development of paradigm shifts in science into four stages:\n\n* '''Normal science''' \u2013 In this stage, which Kuhn sees as most prominent in science, a dominant paradigm is active. This paradigm is characterized by a set of theories and ideas that define what is possible and rational to do, giving scientists a clear set of tools to approach certain problems. Some examples of dominant paradigms that Kuhn gives are: Newtonian physics, caloric theory, and the theory of electromagnetism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}</ref> Insofar as paradigms are useful, they expand both the scope and the tools with which scientists do research. Kuhn stresses that, rather than being monolithic, the paradigms that define normal science can be particular to different people. A chemist and a physicist might operate with different paradigms of what a helium atom is.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}</ref> Under normal science, scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made.\n* '''Extraordinary research''' \u2013 When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of crisis. To address the crisis, scientists push the boundaries of normal science in what Kuhn calls \u201cextraordinary research\u201d, which is characterized by its exploratory nature.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}</ref> Without the structures of the dominant paradigm to depend on, scientists engaging in extraordinary research must produce new theories, thought experiments, and experiments to explain the anomalies. Kuhn sees the practice of this stage \u2013 \u201cthe proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals\u201d \u2013 as even more important to science than paradigm shifts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref>\n* '''Adoption of a new paradigm''' \u2013 Eventually a new paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers. For Kuhn, this stage entails both resistance to the new paradigm, and reasons for why individual scientists adopt it. According to [[Max Planck]], \"a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\"''<ref name=\":02\">Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.</ref>'' Because scientists are committed to the dominant paradigm, and paradigm shifts involve gestalt-like changes, Kuhn stresses that paradigms are difficult to change. However, paradigms can gain influence by explaining or predicting phenomena much better than before (i.e., Bohr's model of the atom) or by being more subjectively pleasing. During this phase, proponents for competing paradigms address what Kuhn considers the core of a paradigm debate: whether a given paradigm will be a good guide for ''future'' problems \u2013 things that neither the proposed paradigm nor the dominant paradigm are capable of solving currently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=157}}</ref>\n* '''Aftermath of the scientific revolution''' \u2013 In the long run, the new paradigm becomes institutionalized as the dominant one. Textbooks are written, obscuring the revolutionary process.\n\n== Features ==\n\n===Paradigm shifts and progress===\nA common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:<ref>Sankey, Howard (1997) \"Kuhn's ontological relativism,\" in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305\u201320. {{ISBN|0792344448}}</ref> the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal. Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation<ref>Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.</ref> and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.\n\n===Incommensurability===\nThese claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another\u2014that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes\u2014so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published the highly regarded essay \"On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme\" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973\u20131974), pp.&nbsp;5\u201320) in 1974 arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous, with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}).\n\n===Gradualism vs. sudden change===\nParadigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system.\n\nIn ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, \"Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science\" (p.&nbsp;12). Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a \"paradigm shift\" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.\n\nPhilosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Natural sciences ===\nSome of the \"classical cases\" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:\n\n* 1543 \u2013 The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim</ref>\n* 1543 \u2013 The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98\u2013112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}</ref>\n* 1687 \u2013 The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim</ref>\n* 1783 \u2013 The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].<ref>Paradigm Shifts: Technology & Culture</ref><ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 157</ref>\n* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 155</ref>\n* 1826 \u2013 The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/noneuclideanrevo0000trud|url-access=registration|date=1987|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}</ref>\n* 1859 \u2013 The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim</ref>\n* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].\n* 1905 \u2013 The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83\u201384, 151 and passim</ref>\n* 1887 to 1905 \u2013 The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].<ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 107</ref>\n* 1919 \u2013 The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and [[general relativity]].\n* 1964 - The [[discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation]] leads to the [[big bang theory]] being accepted over the [[steady state theory]] in [[cosmology]].\n* 1965 - The acceptance of [[plate tectonics]] as the explanation for large-scale geologic changes.\n* 1974 - The November Revolution, with the discovery of the [[J/psi meson]], and the acceptance of the existence of [[quarks]] and the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.\n*1960 to 1885 - The acceptance of the ubiquity of [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] [[dynamical systems]] as promoted by [[chaos theory]], instead of a [[Laplace|laplacian]] world-view of [[determinism|deterministic]] predictability. <ref>{{cite book |last=Gleick |first=James |author-link=James Gleick |date=1988 |title=Chaos:making a new science |url=https://books.google.de/books/about/Chaos.html?id=upcJCIH8M_oC&redir_esc=y |location=New York |publisher=Viking Penguin|page=35-56|chapter=Chapter 2:Revolution|isbn=0-670-81178-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Social sciences ===\nIn Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a \"tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last= Kuhn |first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= [https://archive.org/details/criticismgrowth00laka/page/6 6] |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/criticismgrowth00laka/page/6 }}</ref>  Others have applied Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift to the social sciences.\n\n* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.\n* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].<ref>[[David Laidler]].

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962).\n\nKuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework or [[paradigm]]. Paradigm shifts arise when the dominant paradigm under which normal science operates is rendered incompatible with new phenomena, facilitating the adoption of a new theory or paradigm.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=54}}</ref>\n\nAs one commentator summarizes:\n\n{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term \"paradigm\" in two different meanings. In the first one, \"paradigm\" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton\u2019s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls \"normal science\". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term \"paradigm\", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nEven though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.\n\n== History ==\nThe nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase \"revolution of the way of thinking\" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.\n\n=== Original usage ===\n[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit\u2013duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 114</ref>]]\n\nIn his 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn explains the development of paradigm shifts in science into four stages:\n\n* '''Normal science''' \u2013 In this stage, which Kuhn sees as most prominent in science, a dominant paradigm is active. This paradigm is characterized by a set of theories and ideas that define what is possible and rational to do, giving scientists a clear set of tools to approach certain problems. Some examples of dominant paradigms that Kuhn gives are: Newtonian physics, caloric theory, and the theory of electromagnetism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}</ref> Insofar as paradigms are useful, they expand both the scope and the tools with which scientists do research. Kuhn stresses that, rather than being monolithic, the paradigms that define normal science can be particular to different people. A chemist and a physicist might operate with different paradigms of what a helium atom is.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}</ref> Under normal science, scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made.\n* '''Extraordinary research''' \u2013 When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of crisis. To address the crisis, scientists push the boundaries of normal science in what Kuhn calls \u201cextraordinary research\u201d, which is characterized by its exploratory nature.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}</ref> Without the structures of the dominant paradigm to depend on, scientists engaging in extraordinary research must produce new theories, thought experiments, and experiments to explain the anomalies. Kuhn sees the practice of this stage \u2013 \u201cthe proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals\u201d \u2013 as even more important to science than paradigm shifts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref>\n* '''Adoption of a new paradigm''' \u2013 Eventually a new paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers. For Kuhn, this stage entails both resistance to the new paradigm, and reasons for why individual scientists adopt it. According to [[Max Planck]], \"a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\"''<ref name=\":02\">Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.</ref>'' Because scientists are committed to the dominant paradigm, and paradigm shifts involve gestalt-like changes, Kuhn stresses that paradigms are difficult to change. However, paradigms can gain influence by explaining or predicting phenomena much better than before (i.e., Bohr's model of the atom) or by being more subjectively pleasing. During this phase, proponents for competing paradigms address what Kuhn considers the core of a paradigm debate: whether a given paradigm will be a good guide for ''future'' problems \u2013 things that neither the proposed paradigm nor the dominant paradigm are capable of solving currently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=157}}</ref>\n* '''Aftermath of the scientific revolution''' \u2013 In the long run, the new paradigm becomes institutionalized as the dominant one. Textbooks are written, obscuring the revolutionary process.\n\n== Features ==\n\n===Paradigm shifts and progress===\nA common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:<ref>Sankey, Howard (1997) \"Kuhn's ontological relativism,\" in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305\u201320. {{ISBN|0792344448}}</ref> the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal. Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation<ref>Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.</ref> and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.\n\n===Incommensurability===\nThese claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another\u2014that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes\u2014so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published the highly regarded essay \"On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme\" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973\u20131974), pp.&nbsp;5\u201320) in 1974 arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous, with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}).\n\n===Gradualism vs. sudden change===\nParadigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system.\n\nIn ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, \"Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science\" (p.&nbsp;12). Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a \"paradigm shift\" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.\n\nPhilosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Natural sciences ===\nSome of the \"classical cases\" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:\n\n* 1543 \u2013 The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim</ref>\n* 1543 \u2013 The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98\u2013112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}</ref>\n* 1687 \u2013 The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim</ref>\n* 1783 \u2013 The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].<ref>Paradigm Shifts: Technology & Culture</ref><ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 157</ref>\n* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 155</ref>\n* 1826 \u2013 The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/noneuclideanrevo0000trud|url-access=registration|date=1987|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}</ref>\n* 1859 \u2013 The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim</ref>\n* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].\n* 1905 \u2013 The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.<ref>Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83\u201384, 151 and passim</ref>\n* 1887 to 1905 \u2013 The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].<ref>Kuhn, 1970, p. 107</ref>\n* 1919 \u2013 The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and [[general relativity]].\n* 1964 - The [[discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation]] leads to the [[big bang theory]] being accepted over the [[steady state theory]] in [[cosmology]].\n* 1965 - The acceptance of [[plate tectonics]] as the explanation for large-scale geologic changes.\n* 1974 - The November Revolution, with the discovery of the [[J/psi meson]], and the acceptance of the existence of [[quarks]] and the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.\n\n=== Social sciences ===\nIn Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a \"tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last= Kuhn |first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= [https://archive.org/details/criticismgrowth00laka/page/6 6] |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/criticismgrowth00laka/page/6 }}</ref>  Others have applied Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift to the social sciences.\n\n* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.\n* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].<ref>[[David Laidler]].

L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. [[University of Toronto]], Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by \"paradigm\" and introduces the idea of a \"social paradigm\". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as \"paradigm shift\". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances that precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n* The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy ([[Carlota Perez]]; earlier work only on technological paradigms by [[Giovanni Dosi]]). This concept is linked to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s idea of [[creative destruction]]. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.<ref>Perez, Carlota (2009). \"Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms\", ''Cambridge Journal of Economics'', Vol. 34, No.1, pp. 185\u2013202</ref>\n* Two photographs of the Earth from space, \"[[Earthrise]]\" (1968) and \"[[The Blue Marble]]\" (1972), are thought (by whom?) to have helped to usher in the [[environmentalist]] movement, which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images.<ref>Schroeder, Christopher H.
