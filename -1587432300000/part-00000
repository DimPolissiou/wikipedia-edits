Synod responsibilities include the promotion and encouragement of the church's mission, theological and ministerial education, and overseeing property matters.<ref name=\"2015-regulations\">{{cite web |url=https://assembly.uca.org.au/images/resources/Regulations_Policies/2015_Regulations-updatedSeptember2016.pdf |pages=75\u201378 |title=The Uniting Church in Australia Regulations |accessdate=7 November 2016 }}</ref> There are six synods:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uca.org.au|title=Uniting Church in Australia Assembly - Home|website=uca.org.au}}</ref>\n* [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of New South Wales and the ACT|Synod of New South Wales and the ACT]] (formerly the NSW Synod)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nswact.uca.org.au/ |title=Uniting for the common good. |publisher=Synod of NSW and the ACT}}</ref>\n* [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of Queensland|Synod of Queensland]]<!--this seems to be the formal name, but [[Queensland Synod]] is also common--><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucaqld.com.au/ |title=The Uniting Church in Australia Queensland Synod}}</ref>\n* [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of South Australia|Presbytery and Synod of South Australia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sa.uca.org.au/ |title=Uniting Church SA - Uniting Church.

Western Australia has a unitary presbytery-synod model. South Australia also had a single presbytery and synod for 15 years, until 2019. These large presbyteries enable groups of congregations to work together, based on geographic location or similar interests or characteristics. Selection of ministerial candidates and the placement of ministers are decided at the presbytery level.\n\n===Congregations===\nThere are about 2,000 UCA congregations, with 243,000 members and adherents. Congregations range in size from a dozen to hundreds of members.<ref name=UCASubmission/> They are the local church, the setting for regular worship (generally on Sundays). Many churches also conduct [[service of worship|worship services]] at other times, such as a monthly weekday service, a late-night service for day-shift workers, a \"cafe church\", or Friday- or Saturday-evening services.\n\nA Meeting of the Congregation must be held at least twice each year. The meetings typically consider and approve the budget, local policy matters, property matters (ratified by the presbytery and synod) and the \"call\" (employment) of a new minister or other staff.\n\nCongregations manage themselves through a council. All elders are members, as are ministers with pastoral responsibility for the congregation; there may also be other members. The council meets regularly, and is responsible for approving worship times and other matters.\n\n[[File:NaroomaUnitingChurch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=White clapboard church behind a white picket fence|[[Narooma, New South Wales|Narooma]] Uniting Church, a 1914 example of [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Federation Carpenter Gothic|Federation Carpenter Gothic]] architecture]]\nSome united congregations exist. The UCA has joined with other churches, such as the [[Australia Baptist Ministries|Baptist Union]] and the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], in some locations. There are also cooperative arrangements where supplying ministry to congregations is impossible, particularly in remote areas. This includes arrangements with the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican Church]], where ministry and (sometimes) property resources are shared.\n\nFaith communities are less structured than congregations. They are groups of people who gather together for worship, witness or service and choose to be recognised by the presbytery. Local churches are sometimes also used by congregations of other denominations; for example, a [[Tonga]]n [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] congregation may make arrangements to meet in the building on a Saturday. The UCA is committed to inclusivity, and there are a number of multicultural ministry (MCM) arrangements in which [[Korea]]n, [[Tonga]]n and other groups form congregations of the church.\n\n====Co-operating congregations====\nCo-operating congregations, typically in rural areas, have several denominations worshiping as one congregation and rotate the denomination appointing its next minister. They are known as union churches in some places, with several denominations using the building at different times.\n\n====Frontier Services====\nA Frontier Services ministry is available to residents of the [[outback]], with ministers and pastors visiting families by air or [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles. Visits are normally arranged in advance so adjacent families can travel for significant events, such as [[baptism]]s. These \"padres\" are based in a major town or city, and the local synod is normally their organisational and funding body.\n\n==Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress==\nThe Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress (UAICC, sometimes known simply as the Congress), is constitutionally recognised  as having responsibility for oversight of church ministry to the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people]]:\n\n<blockquote>A Synod may at the request of a Regional Committee of the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress prescribe that the Regional Committee may have and exercise all or specific rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of a Presbytery under this Constitution and the Regulations (including ordination and other rights, powers and responsibilities relating to Ministers) for the purpose of fulfilling any responsibility of the Regional Committee for Uniting Church work with Aboriginal and Islander people\nwithin the bounds of the Synod.<ref name=\"ministries\">[http://assembly.uca.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/26939/Constitution.pdf \"Constitution of the Uniting Church in Australia (2004)\"] ''Uniting Church Assembly Website''</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Agencies==\n[[File:WaysideChapel.JPG|thumb|alt=City house, converted into a small church|upright=1.3|Wayside Chapel, [[Potts Point]]]]\n[[UnitingCare Australia]], the country's largest provider of social care,{{cn|date=January 2020}} is its largest operator of aged-care facilities. Other activities include shelters and emergency housing for men, women and children; family-relationships support; disability services, and food kitchens.\n\n===Education===\nThe UCA provides theological training through a number of theological colleges:\n*New South Wales: United Theological College, Parramatta a member of the School of Theology at [[Charles Sturt University]].\n*Queensland: Trinity College (with [[Australian Catholic University]]){{cn|date=January 2020}}\n*South Australia: [[Uniting College for Leadership and Theology]], [[Adelaide College of Divinity]] \n*Victoria and Tasmania: [[Pilgrim Theological College]], part of the [[University of Divinity]]\n*Western Australia: Perth Theological Hall<ref>[https://unitingchurchwa-startdigital.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2.-Committee-CEDAL.pdf Commission for Education for Discipleship and Leadership, Annual Report 2018]</ref>\n\nTraining generally takes five years, and includes supervised practical experience.\n\n===<span id=\"Recent history\"></span>Youth===\nThe [[National Christian Youth Convention]] is a national UCA activity during school and university holidays, every two or three years in a different city.

However, \"specified ministries\" are defined.<ref name=\"ministries\"/> Of these, the roles of [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] and [[pastor]] are open to [[laity|lay members]]. The church has two [[Holy orders|orders]] of [[Minister (Christianity)|ordained ministry]]: minister and [[deacon]].\n\nWhen it is not possible (or desirable) to have an ordained minister, a [[lay preacher]] or lay ministry team may act in their place (similar to a [[Methodist local preacher]]). Lay preachers are required to participate in training and examinations conducted by each synod, and must be approved by the presbytery.<ref name=\"2015-regulations\" />\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Uniting church mundijong gnangarra.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Simple country church|1905 church in [[Mundijong, Western Australia|Mundijong]]]]\nThe UCA was one of the first Australian churches to grant self-determination to its indigenous members through the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress. Partnerships exist with South Pacific and Asian churches, especially those which share a Congregational, Presbyterian or Methodist heritage. An increasing number of ethnic churches worship in their own languages as well as in English. Five to seven per cent of the membership worship in languages other than English, including [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wesleymission.org.au/about-us/history/christian-foundations/the-uniting-church/|title=Wesley Mission - The Uniting Church|website=www.wesleymission.org.au|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>\n\nThe UCA advocates for [[social justice]]. It has taken stances on issues such as [[native title]] for indigenous people; the environment; [[apartheid]]; refugee status, and safe injection facilities for drug users. The church is similar to other [[united and uniting churches]], which maintain a cultural identity in their own country and practise [[ecumenical]] fellowship with other [[Christian denomination]]s worldwide.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crossing borders : shaping faith, ministry and identity in multicultural Australia|last=edited by Helen Richmond and Myong Duk Yang|date=2006|publisher=Openbook Australia|isbn=1864072474|location=Sydney|pages=138\u2013146|oclc=224450283}}</ref> Between 1991 and 2013, UCA attendance declined by 41 per cent.

Practices range from experimental liturgies, informal worship reminiscent of the [[Jesus movement]] to conventional [[Calvinism|Reformed]] services. Music also varies from traditional and contemporary hymns in the ''[[Australian Hymn Book]]'' and ''[[Together in Song]]'', through [[Hillsong Music (label)|Hillsong]] and [[contemporary Christian music]] to hard [[Christian alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Christian metal|metal]].\n\nLiturgical dress in the UCA is generally lenient, and is optional for ministers and other leaders of worship.<ref name=\"lit-dress\">{{cite web |title=Liturgical Dress in the Uniting Church |last1=Gribben |first1=Robert |url=https://www.assembly.uca.org.au/images/stories/Theology_Discipleship/pdf/Liturgical_Dress_in_the_Uniting_Church-2.pdf}}</ref> When liturgical dress is worn, it most commonly consists of a white [[alb]] and a [[stole (vestment)|stole]] (for ministers and deacons) or scarf (for lay preachers). The colour of the scarf or stole is often related to the liturgical calendar, such as purple for [[Lent]] or red for [[Pentecost]].\n\n===<span id=\"Decision making\"></span><span id=\"Commitment to ecumenism\"></span>Decision-making===\n[[File:Haberfield St Davids Uniting Church.JPG|thumb|alt=Larger stone church against a blue sky|St David's Uniting Church, [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]] ]]\nSince 1997, most councils and agencies have used the [[consensus decision-making]] procedures outlined in the church's ''[[#External links|Manual for Meetings]]''. The procedures may use orange (\"support\") and blue (\"do not support\") cards, which may also be displayed times other than voting.\n\n==Theology==\nThe UCA's theological range is broad, reflecting its [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Congregational church|Congregational]] origins and its commitment to ecumenism. Its theology may be described as [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestantism]], with a commitment to [[social justice]]. The church's perspectives are [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]], [[Christian left|left]] (or [[progressive Christianity|progressive]]), and [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]]. Morality, faith, and (in particular) sexuality have been debated. Concerns focus on biblical understanding and accommodation to the broad culture.\n\nUniting Network Australia is \"the national network for lesbian, gay, bisexual, intersex and transgender people, their families, friends and supporters within the Uniting Church in Australia.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unitingnetworkaustralia.org.au/ |title=Uniting Network Australia |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref> The establishment of Evangelical Members within the Uniting Church in Australia (EMU), the Reforming Alliance and their merger with the [[Assembly of Confessing Congregations (Uniting Church in Australia)|Assembly of Confessing Congregations]] (ACC) illustrate conservative opposition to the ordination of gay and lesbian candidates and the influence of the [[Confessing Movement]] (not to be confused with the anti-[[Religion in Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Confessing Church]]). \n\n===<span id=\"Homosexuality issues\"></span><span id=\"Development\"></span><span id=\"Current situation\"></span>Homosexuality=== \n{{Christianity and LGBT topics}}\nIssues debated since early in UCA history are the role of gay and lesbian people in the church, their possibility of being ordained and the blessing of same-sex unions. The church permits local presbyteries to ordain gay and lesbian ministers,<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Trend: World's oldest Protestant churches now ordain gays and lesbians|url=http://www.ucc.org/global-trend-worlds-oldest|website=ucc.org|publisher=United Church of Christ|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref> and extends the local option to marriage; a minister may bless a same-sex marriage.\n\nThe fairly broad consensus has been that a person's [[sexual orientation]] should not be a bar to attendance, membership or participation in the church. More controversial has been the issue of sexual activity by gay and lesbian people and the sexual behaviour of ordination candidates. In 2003, the church voted to allow local presbyteries to decide whether to ordain gay and lesbian people as ministers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'brien|first1=Kerry|title=Nile quits church over gay ordination decision|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s906981.htm|website=abc.net.au|publisher=ABC|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref> Ministers were permitted to bless same-sex couples entering civil unions even before same-sex marriage was legalized in Australia in late 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hiatt|first1=Bethany|title=Uniting Church may overhaul rules of marriage|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/28769619/uniting-church-may-overhaul-rules-of-marriage/|website=au.news.yahoo.com|publisher=AU News|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref> In July 2018, the national assembly approved the creation of marriage rites for same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandeman |first=John |date=13 July 2018 |title=Uniting Church to hold same sex marriages |url=https://www.eternitynews.com.au/australia/uniting-church-to-hold-same-sex-marriage/ |work=Eternity |location=Australia |access-date=13 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1997, some ministers living in same-sex relationships have [[Coming out|come out]] without their ordination (or ministry) being challenged.

Its service network consists of over 400 agencies, institutions, and parish missions, with its areas of service including aged care, hospitals, children, youth and family, disability, employment, emergency relief, drug and alcohol abuse, youth homelessness and suicide.<ref name=UCASubmission/> Affiliated agencies include UCA's community and health-service provider network, affiliated schools, the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress, [[Frontier Services]], and [[UnitingWorld]].\n\n==Organisation==\n[[File:St-Michael's-at-Night.jpg|thumb|alt=Downtown church at night|[[St Michael's Uniting Church, Melbourne]] ''(pictured)'' was formerly the Congregational Union Australia Church.]]\n[[File:Port Adelaide Uniting Church-2005.jpg|thumb|alt=Landscaped, Gothic-style church|[[Port Adelaide Uniting Church]]]]\n[[File:Scots Uniting Church.jpg|thumb|alt=Another Gothic-style church|Scots Uniting Church in [[Albany, Western Australia]]]]\nThe UCA is a national, unincorporated association of councils, each of which has responsibility for functions in the church. The councils are [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]] (local), [[Presbytery (church polity)|presbyteries]] (regional), [[synod]]s (state) and an\nassembly (national).<ref>{{cite web |title=Uniting Church in Australia Assembly |url=https://assembly.uca.org.au/ |accessdate=18 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe membership of each council is established by the constitution. Each council includes women and men, [[Laity|lay]] and ordained. The offices of president of assembly, moderator of synod (who chair these councils) and other offices are open to all UCA members.\n\nThe UCA is a non-[[episcopal polity|episcopal]] church, with no [[bishop]]s. Leadership and [[pastoral care|pastoral]] roles are nominally performed by presbyteries, but in reality by individuals.\n\n===Assembly===\nThe UCA assembly meets every three years, and is chaired by the president.<ref name=UCASubmission/> The 14th Assembly met in [[Perth]] from 12 to 18 July 2015. The 15th Assembly, hosted by the [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of Victoria and Tasmania|Synod of Victoria and Tasmania]] in [[Box Hill, Victoria|Box Hill]], met in July 2018. Assembly business between meetings is conducted by the Assembly Standing Committee, which meets three times per year (usually in March, July and November). Membership is drawn from throughout Australia, with 18 members elected at each assembly.\n\n===President===\n[[File:Deidre Palmer UCA 2020-02-23.png|thumb|Deidre Palmer, UCA President, 2020-02-23]]\nThe current president is [[Deidre Palmer]] PhD, who succeeded [[Stuart McMillan (pastor)|Stuart McMillan]] at the start of the 15th Assembly on 8 July 2018.<ref name=\"president\">{{cite news |url=https://www.insights.uca.org.au/news/dr-deidre-palmer-gods-abundant-grace-shapes-and-reshapes-us |title=Dr Deidre Palmer: God's abundant grace shapes and reshapes us |newspaper=Insights Magazine |date=9 July 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref> Palmer is the second woman in the role, following [[Jill Tabart]] (1994-1997).<ref name=\"p-e_2015\">[http://assembly2015.uca.org.au/president-elect-announced/ President-Elect announced], Uniting Church in Australia, 16 July 2015</ref> Palmer was the moderator of the [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of South Australia|Presbytery and Synod of South Australia]] from November 2013 to November 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assembly2015.uca.org.au/president-elect-announced/ |title=President-Elect announced |date=16 July 2015 |accessdate=18 July 2015 |publisher=Uniting Church in Australia}}</ref> [[Sharon Hollis]], moderator of the [[Synod of Victoria and Tasmania]] at the time of her election in 2018, is the president-elect; Hollis will become president at the beginning of the sixteenth assembly, which will be held in Queensland in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uniting.church/sharon-hollis-named-as-uca-president-elect/ |title=Sharon Hollis named as UCA President-elect |publisher=Uniting Church in Australia |accessdate=12 July 2018 |date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Synods===\nSynods are UCA councils which roughly correspond to state boundaries. Each synod meets about once per year, with a standing committee to represent it between sessions. Synod responsibilities include the promotion and encouragement of the church's mission, theological and ministerial education, and overseeing property matters.<ref name=\"2015-regulations\">{{cite web |url=https://assembly.uca.org.au/images/resources/Regulations_Policies/2015_Regulations-updatedSeptember2016.pdf |pages=75\u201378 |title=The Uniting Church in Australia Regulations |accessdate=7 November 2016 }}</ref> There are six synods:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uca.org.au|title=Uniting Church in Australia Assembly - Home|website=uca.org.au}}</ref>\n* [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of New South Wales and the ACT|Synod of New South Wales and the ACT]] (formerly the NSW Synod)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nswact.uca.org.au/ |title=Uniting for the common good. |publisher=Synod of NSW and the ACT}}</ref>\n* [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of Queensland|Synod of Queensland]]<!--this seems to be the formal name, but [[Queensland Synod]] is also common--><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucaqld.com.au/ |title=The Uniting Church in Australia Queensland Synod}}</ref>\n* [[Uniting Church in Australia, Synod of South Australia|Presbytery and Synod of South Australia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sa.uca.org.au/ |title=Uniting Church SA - Uniting Church.

Western Australia has a unitary presbytery-synod model. South Australia also had a single presbytery and synod for 15 years, until 2019. These large presbyteries enable groups of congregations to work together, based on geographic location or similar interests or characteristics. Selection of ministerial candidates and the placement of ministers are decided at the presbytery level.\n\n===Congregations===\nThere are about 2,000 UCA congregations, with 243,000 members and adherents. Congregations range in size from a dozen to hundreds of members.<ref name=UCASubmission/> They are the local church, the setting for regular worship (generally on Sundays). Many churches also conduct [[service of worship|worship services]] at other times, such as a monthly weekday service, a late-night service for day-shift workers, a \"cafe church\", or Friday- or Saturday-evening services.\n\nA Meeting of the Congregation must be held at least twice each year. The meetings typically consider and approve the budget, local policy matters, property matters (ratified by the presbytery and synod) and the \"call\" (employment) of a new minister or other staff.\n\nCongregations manage themselves through a council. All elders are members, as are ministers with pastoral responsibility for the congregation; there may also be other members. The council meets regularly, and is responsible for approving worship times and other matters.\n\n[[File:NaroomaUnitingChurch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=White clapboard church behind a white picket fence|[[Narooma, New South Wales|Narooma]] Uniting Church, a 1914 example of [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Federation Carpenter Gothic|Federation Carpenter Gothic]] architecture]]\nSome united congregations exist. The UCA has joined with other churches, such as the [[Australia Baptist Ministries|Baptist Union]] and the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], in some locations. There are also cooperative arrangements where supplying ministry to congregations is impossible, particularly in remote areas. This includes arrangements with the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican Church]], where ministry and (sometimes) property resources are shared.\n\nFaith communities are less structured than congregations. They are groups of people who gather together for worship, witness or service and choose to be recognised by the presbytery. Local churches are sometimes also used by congregations of other denominations; for example, a [[Tonga]]n [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] congregation may make arrangements to meet in the building on a Saturday. The UCA is committed to inclusivity, and there are a number of multicultural ministry (MCM) arrangements in which [[Korea]]n, [[Tonga]]n and other groups form congregations of the church.\n\n====Co-operating congregations====\nCo-operating congregations, typically in rural areas, have several denominations worshiping as one congregation and rotate the denomination appointing its next minister. They are known as union churches in some places, with several denominations using the building at different times.\n\n====Frontier Services====\nA Frontier Services ministry is available to residents of the [[outback]], with ministers and pastors visiting families by air or [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles. Visits are normally arranged in advance so adjacent families can travel for significant events, such as [[baptism]]s. These \"padres\" are based in a major town or city, and the local synod is normally their organisational and funding body.\n\n==Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress==\nThe Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress (UAICC, sometimes known simply as the Congress), is constitutionally recognised  as having responsibility for oversight of church ministry to the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people]]:\n\n<blockquote>A Synod may at the request of a Regional Committee of the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress prescribe that the Regional Committee may have and exercise all or specific rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of a Presbytery under this Constitution and the Regulations (including ordination and other rights, powers and responsibilities relating to Ministers) for the purpose of fulfilling any responsibility of the Regional Committee for Uniting Church work with Aboriginal and Islander people\nwithin the bounds of the Synod.<ref name=\"ministries\">[http://assembly.uca.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/26939/Constitution.pdf \"Constitution of the Uniting Church in Australia (2004)\"] ''Uniting Church Assembly Website''</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Agencies==\n[[File:WaysideChapel.JPG|thumb|alt=City house, converted into a small church|upright=1.3|Wayside Chapel, [[Potts Point]]]]\n[[UnitingCare Australia]], the country's largest provider of social care,{{cn|date=January 2020}} is its largest operator of aged-care facilities. Other activities include shelters and emergency housing for men, women and children; family-relationships support; disability services, and food kitchens.\n\n===Education===\nThe UCA provides theological training through a number of theological colleges:\n*New South Wales: United Theological College, Parramatta a member of the School of Theology at [[Charles Sturt University]].\n*Queensland: Trinity College (with [[Australian Catholic University]]){{cn|date=January 2020}}\n*South Australia: [[Uniting College for Leadership and Theology]], [[Adelaide College of Divinity]] \n*Victoria and Tasmania: [[Pilgrim Theological College]], part of the [[University of Divinity]]\n*Western Australia: Perth Theological Hall<ref>[https://unitingchurchwa-startdigital.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2.-Committee-CEDAL.pdf Commission for Education for Discipleship and Leadership, Annual Report 2018]</ref>\n\nTraining generally takes five years, and includes supervised practical experience.\n\n===<span id=\"Recent history\"></span>Youth===\nThe [[National Christian Youth Convention]] is a national UCA activity during school and university holidays, every two or three years in a different city.

However, \"specified ministries\" are defined.<ref name=\"ministries\"/> Of these, the roles of [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] and [[pastor]] are open to [[laity|lay members]]. The church has two [[Holy orders|orders]] of [[Minister (Christianity)|ordained ministry]]: minister and [[deacon]].\n\nWhen it is not possible (or desirable) to have an ordained minister, a [[lay preacher]] or lay ministry team may act in their place (similar to a [[Methodist local preacher]]). Lay preachers are required to participate in training and examinations conducted by each synod, and must be approved by the presbytery.<ref name=\"2015-regulations\" />\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Uniting church mundijong gnangarra.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Simple country church|1905 church in [[Mundijong, Western Australia|Mundijong]]]]\nThe UCA was one of the first Australian churches to grant self-determination to its indigenous members through the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress. Partnerships exist with South Pacific and Asian churches, especially those which share a Congregational, Presbyterian or Methodist heritage. An increasing number of ethnic churches worship in their own languages as well as in English. Five to seven per cent of the membership worship in languages other than English, including [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wesleymission.org.au/about-us/history/christian-foundations/the-uniting-church/|title=Wesley Mission - The Uniting Church|website=www.wesleymission.org.au|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>\n\nThe UCA advocates for [[social justice]]. It has taken stances on issues such as [[native title]] for indigenous people; the environment; [[apartheid]]; refugee status, and safe injection facilities for drug users. The church is similar to other [[united and uniting churches]], which maintain a cultural identity in their own country and practise [[ecumenical]] fellowship with other [[Christian denomination]]s worldwide.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crossing borders : shaping faith, ministry and identity in multicultural Australia|last=edited by Helen Richmond and Myong Duk Yang|date=2006|publisher=Openbook Australia|isbn=1864072474|location=Sydney|pages=138\u2013146|oclc=224450283}}</ref> Between 1991 and 2013, UCA attendance declined by 41 per cent. In 2013, about 97,200 people attended weekly worship services throughout Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://assembly.uca.org.au/images/13C003_UCA_Census_Headline_Summary_FINAL.pdf|title=2013 Uniting Church Census of congregations and ministers - Headline Report|publisher=National Church Life Survey Research|page=4|accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Liturgy===\nThe church is [[Liturgy|liturgically]] varied. Practices range from experimental liturgies, informal worship reminiscent of the [[Jesus movement]] to conventional [[Calvinism|Reformed]] services. Music also varies from traditional and contemporary hymns in the ''[[Australian Hymn Book]]'' and ''[[Together in Song]]'', through [[Hillsong Music (label)|Hillsong]] and [[contemporary Christian music]] to hard [[Christian alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Christian metal|metal]].\n\nLiturgical dress in the UCA is generally lenient, and is optional for ministers and other leaders of worship.<ref name=\"lit-dress\">{{cite web |title=Liturgical Dress in the Uniting Church |last1=Gribben |first1=Robert |url=https://www.assembly.uca.org.au/images/stories/Theology_Discipleship/pdf/Liturgical_Dress_in_the_Uniting_Church-2.pdf}}</ref> When liturgical dress is worn, it most commonly consists of a white [[alb]] and a [[stole (vestment)|stole]] (for ministers and deacons) or scarf (for lay preachers). The colour of the scarf or stole is often related to the liturgical calendar, such as purple for [[Lent]] or red for [[Pentecost]].\n\n===<span id=\"Decision making\"></span><span id=\"Commitment to ecumenism\"></span>Decision-making===\n[[File:Haberfield St Davids Uniting Church.JPG|thumb|alt=Larger stone church against a blue sky|St David's Uniting Church, [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]] ]]\nSince 1997, most councils and agencies have used the [[consensus decision-making]] procedures outlined in the church's ''[[#External links|Manual for Meetings]]''. The procedures may use orange (\"support\") and blue (\"do not support\") cards, which may also be displayed times other than voting.\n\n==Theology==\nThe UCA's theological range is broad, reflecting its [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Congregational church|Congregational]] origins and its commitment to ecumenism. Its theology may be described as [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestantism]], with a commitment to [[social justice]]. The church's perspectives are [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]], [[Christian left|left]] (or [[progressive Christianity|progressive]]), and [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]]. Morality, faith, and (in particular) sexuality have been debated. Concerns focus on biblical understanding and accommodation to the broad culture.\n\nUniting Network Australia is \"the national network for lesbian, gay, bisexual, intersex and transgender people, their families, friends and supporters within the Uniting Church in Australia.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unitingnetworkaustralia.org.au/ |title=Uniting Network Australia |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref> The establishment of Evangelical Members within the Uniting Church in Australia (EMU), the Reforming Alliance and their merger with the [[Assembly of Confessing Congregations (Uniting Church in Australia)|Assembly of Confessing Congregations]] (ACC) illustrate conservative opposition to the ordination of gay and lesbian candidates and the influence of the [[Confessing Movement]] (not to be confused with the anti-[[Religion in Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Confessing Church]]). \n\n===<span id=\"Homosexuality issues\"></span><span id=\"Development\"></span><span id=\"Current situation\"></span>Homosexuality=== \n{{Christianity and LGBT topics}}\nIssues debated since early in UCA history are the role of gay and lesbian people in the church, their possibility of being ordained and the blessing of same-sex unions. The church permits local presbyteries to ordain gay and lesbian ministers,<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Trend: World's oldest Protestant churches now ordain gays and lesbians|url=http://www.ucc.org/global-trend-worlds-oldest|website=ucc.org|publisher=United Church of Christ|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref> and extends the local option to marriage; a minister may bless a same-sex marriage.\n\nThe fairly broad consensus has been that a person's [[sexual orientation]] should not be a bar to attendance, membership or participation in the church. More controversial has been the issue of sexual activity by gay and lesbian people and the sexual behaviour of ordination candidates. In 2003, the church voted to allow local presbyteries to decide whether to ordain gay and lesbian people as ministers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'brien|first1=Kerry|title=Nile quits church over gay ordination decision|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s906981.htm|website=abc.net.au|publisher=ABC|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref> Ministers were permitted to bless same-sex couples entering civil unions even before same-sex marriage was legalized in Australia in late 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hiatt|first1=Bethany|title=Uniting Church may overhaul rules of marriage|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/28769619/uniting-church-may-overhaul-rules-of-marriage/|website=au.news.yahoo.com|publisher=AU News|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref> In July 2018, the national assembly approved the creation of marriage rites for same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandeman |first=John |date=13 July 2018 |title=Uniting Church to hold same sex marriages |url=https://www.eternitynews.com.au/australia/uniting-church-to-hold-same-sex-marriage/ |work=Eternity |location=Australia |access-date=13 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1997, some ministers living in same-sex relationships have [[Coming out|come out]] without their ordination (or ministry) being challenged.

FF2 Media covered a Q&A with Labaki in 2018 about her movie ''Capernaum'', which received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year (as well as 34 other wins and 46 other nominations).

I have a problem with seeing the wrong things around me and just not saying anything about them\". She likes to address relevant issues and portray them through her art, be it acting, directing, or even dance.

In 2006, she directed and played one of the leading roles in ''Caramel'', which showcases a Beirut that most people are not familiar with. Rather than tackle political issues that have plagued Lebanon, she presents a comedy that deals with five Lebanese women in Beirut who gather at a beauty salon and deal with issues related to love, sexuality, tradition, disappointment, and everyday ups and downs. The film premiered at the Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007, which was a commercial success in the summer of that same year. It sold worldwide and collected important prizes at many festivals around the world, garnering Labaki much acclaim both as a director and actress. It also put her on Variety's 10 Directors to Watch list at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

FF2 Media covered a Q&A with Labaki in 2018 about her movie ''Capernaum'', which received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year (as well as 34 other wins and 46 other nominations). She stated that while trying to brainstorm concepts for the script, her team came up with ideas that she wanted to include, such as \"child labor, migrant labor rights, children\u2019s rights, the absurdity of having to have the papers to prove that you exist, the absurdity of borders, and early marriage\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ff2media.com/blog/2018/12/19/capernaum-film-forum-hosts-qa-with-filmmaker-nadine-labaki/|title=Film Forum hosts Q&A with \u2018Capernaum\u2019 filmmaker Nadine Labaki {{!}} Interviews|website=ff2media.com|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> She believes that \u201cCinema can be a way to [create] change.\u201d She has stated that she believes that politics and art are intertwined and that her films are her own \u201cway of revolt\u201d.<ref name=\":25\"/> According to Labaki, \"sometimes, a line in a film, or a scene can make you think about yourself, about your decisions.

I have a problem with seeing the wrong things around me and just not saying anything about them\". She likes to address relevant issues and portray them through her art, be it acting, directing, or even dance. Her movie ''Where Do We Go Now?''  heavily incorporates dance, and in the same interview with FF2 Media, she mentioned that she has a background of being a dancer.<ref>https://ff2media.com</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nLabaki is multilingual, fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].
