The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.\n[[File:WS1359-10-N-Downtown-HanfordCA-1877-1.png|thumb|Hanford in 1877. Resident J.T.

Since the underlying body biochemistry is slightly different in individuals with FH, their high cholesterol levels are less responsive to the kinds of cholesterol control methods which are usually more effective in people without FH (such as dietary modification and [[statin]] tablets). Nevertheless, treatment (including higher statin doses) is usually effective.\n\nFH is classified as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.\n\nAbout 1 in 100 to 200 people have mutations in the ''LDLR'' gene that encodes the [[LDL receptor]] [[protein]], which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or [[apolipoprotein B]] (ApoB), which is the part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=AC|last2=Hopkins|first2=PN|last3=Toth|first3=PP|last4=Ballantyne|first4=CM|last5=Rader|first5=DJ|last6=Robinson|first6=JG|last7=Daniels|first7=SR|last8=Gidding|first8=SS|last9=de Ferranti|first9=SD|last10=Ito|first10=MK|last11=McGowan|first11=MP|last12=Moriarty|first12=PM|last13=Cromwell|first13=WC|last14=Ross|first14=JL|last15=Ziajka|first15=PE|last16=National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial|first16=Hypercholesterolemia.|title=Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis and management of pediatric and adult patients: clinical guidance from the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia.|journal=Journal of Clinical Lipidology|date=June 2011|volume=5|issue=3 Suppl|pages=S1\u20138|doi=10.1016/j.jacl.2011.04.003|pmid=21600525}}</ref> People who have one abnormal copy (are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]]) of the ''LDLR'' gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being ''homozygous'') may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million people.<ref name=\"Rader2003\"/>\n\nHeterozygous FH is normally treated with statins, [[bile acid sequestrant]]s, or other [[hypolipidemic agent|lipid-lowering agents]] that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered [[genetic counseling]]. Homozygous FH often does not respond to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including [[LDL apheresis]] (removal of LDL in a method similar to [[dialysis]]) and occasionally [[liver transplantation]].<ref name=\"Rader2003\"/>\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\n===Physical signs===\nHigh cholesterol levels normally do not cause any symptoms. Yellow deposits of cholesterol-rich fat may be seen in various places on the body such as around the eyelids (known as [[Xanthelasma|xanthelasma palpebrarum]]), the outer margin of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] (known as [[Arcus senilis|arcus senilis corneae]]), and in the [[tendon]]s of the hands, elbows, knees and feet, particularly the [[Achilles tendon]] (known as a [[xanthoma|tendon xanthoma]]).<ref name=\"Rader2003\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rader DJ, Cohen J, Hobbs HH |title=Monogenic hypercholesterolemia: new insights in pathogenesis and treatment |journal=J.

Its gene is located on the [[chromosome 2 (human)|second chromosome]] (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12&nbsp;[[megabase|Mb]] long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of [[arginine]] by [[glutamine]] at position 3500.

In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as [[bile acid sequestrant]]s ([[cholestyramine]] or [[colestipol]]), [[nicotinic acid]] preparations or fibrates.<ref name=\"Rader2003\"/> Control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend that the decision to treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the [[Framingham Heart Study]]), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk.<ref name=NICE>{{NICE|71|Familial hypercholesterolaemia|2008}}</ref> Prior to the introduction of the statins, [[clofibrate]] (an older fibrate that often caused [[gallstone]]s), [[probucol]] (especially in large xanthomas) and [[thyroxine]] were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nMore controversial is the addition of [[ezetimibe]], which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While it reduces LDL cholesterol, it does not appear to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the [[intima-media thickness]]. Whether this means that ezetimibe is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kastelein JJ |title=Simvastatin with or without ezetimibe in familial hypercholesterolemia |journal=N.

Rather, evidence of benefit is derived from a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Scientific Steering Committee on behalf of the Simon Broome Register Group | title=Mortality in treated heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: implications for clinical management | journal=Atherosclerosis | year=1999 | volume=142 | issue=1 | pages=105\u201312 | doi=10.1016/S0021-9150(98)00200-7 | pmid=9920511}}</ref>\n\nA [[cohort study]] suggested that treatment of FH with statins leads to a 48% reduction in death from coronary heart disease to a point where people are no more likely to die of coronary heart disease than the general population.

Since the underlying body biochemistry is slightly different in individuals with FH, their high cholesterol levels are less responsive to the kinds of cholesterol control methods which are usually more effective in people without FH (such as dietary modification and [[statin]] tablets). Nevertheless, treatment (including higher statin doses) is usually effective.\n\nFH is classified as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.\n\nAbout 1 in 100 to 200 people have mutations in the ''LDLR'' gene that encodes the [[LDL receptor]] [[protein]], which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or [[apolipoprotein B]] (ApoB), which is the part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=AC|last2=Hopkins|first2=PN|last3=Toth|first3=PP|last4=Ballantyne|first4=CM|last5=Rader|first5=DJ|last6=Robinson|first6=JG|last7=Daniels|first7=SR|last8=Gidding|first8=SS|last9=de Ferranti|first9=SD|last10=Ito|first10=MK|last11=McGowan|first11=MP|last12=Moriarty|first12=PM|last13=Cromwell|first13=WC|last14=Ross|first14=JL|last15=Ziajka|first15=PE|last16=National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial|first16=Hypercholesterolemia.|title=Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis and management of pediatric and adult patients: clinical guidance from the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia.|journal=Journal of Clinical Lipidology|date=June 2011|volume=5|issue=3 Suppl|pages=S1\u20138|doi=10.1016/j.jacl.2011.04.003|pmid=21600525}}</ref> People who have one abnormal copy (are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]]) of the ''LDLR'' gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40.

In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as [[bile acid sequestrant]]s ([[cholestyramine]] or [[colestipol]]), [[nicotinic acid]] preparations or fibrates.<ref name=\"Rader2003\"/> Control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend that the decision to treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the [[Framingham Heart Study]]), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk.<ref name=NICE>{{NICE|71|Familial hypercholesterolaemia|2008}}</ref> Prior to the introduction of the statins, [[clofibrate]] (an older fibrate that often caused [[gallstone]]s), [[probucol]] (especially in large xanthomas) and [[thyroxine]] were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nMore controversial is the addition of [[ezetimibe]], which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While it reduces LDL cholesterol, it does not appear to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the [[intima-media thickness]]. Whether this means that ezetimibe is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kastelein JJ |title=Simvastatin with or without ezetimibe in familial hypercholesterolemia |journal=N.

Rather, evidence of benefit is derived from a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Scientific Steering Committee on behalf of the Simon Broome Register Group | title=Mortality in treated heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: implications for clinical management | journal=Atherosclerosis | year=1999 | volume=142 | issue=1 | pages=105\u201312 | doi=10.1016/S0021-9150(98)00200-7 | pmid=9920511}}</ref>\n\nA [[cohort study]] suggested that treatment of FH with statins leads to a 48% reduction in death from coronary heart disease to a point where people are no more likely to die of coronary heart disease than the general population. However, if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%.

Not only ''Idols'', but also new singing shows such as ''[[The Voice (franchise)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[All Together Now (franchise)|All Together Now]]'' have become rivals and popular in recent years.\n\nDuring the show you may have to sign contracts that are very controlling over you.\n\n==''The X Factor'' around the world==\n[[File:The X Factor world map.png|thumb|center|400px|Location of

It [[The X Factor (UK TV series)|originated in the United Kingdom]], where it was devised as a replacement for ''[[Pop Idol]]'' (2001\u20132003), and has been adapted in various countries. The \"X Factor\" of the title refers to the undefinable \"something\" that makes for star quality.<ref>Described as \"something you can't quite put your finger on\" by [[Cheryl Pole]], a judge on the UK version of ''The X Factor'', ''The Xtra Factor'', 23 November 2009</ref>\n\nThe prize is usually a recording contract, in addition to the publicity that appearance in the later stages of the show itself generates, not only for the winner but also for other highly ranked contestants.\n\nUnlike ''Idols'', where the judges only critique the contestants' performances, on ''The X Factor'' each judge \"mentors\" the finalists in a particular category, aiding them with song selection and styling, while also participating together in judging the contestants in the other categories. Not only ''Idols'', but also new singing shows such as ''[[The Voice (franchise)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[All Together Now (franchise)|All Together Now]]'' have become rivals and popular in recent years.\n\n==''The X Factor'' around the world==\n[[File:The X Factor world map.png|thumb|center|400px|Location of different franchises of ''The X Factor''<br />{{legend|#0075FF|Own

The Angora rabbit became a popular pet of the French royalty in the mid-18th century, and Angoras spread to other parts of Europe by the end of that century.  <ref name=\"Whitman\" /> In the United States garments made of Angora rabbit wool has been popular ever since they first arrived in the early 20th century. But only during World War II did domestic production expand to meet the demand of more than 120,000 pounds a year. This valuable, soft silky fiber aroused much interest, and quickly people became enamored with the production process. <ref>Hardy, T. M. P., & Dolnick, E. H. (1948). Angora rabbit wool production. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.</ref>\n\nThe author of Domestic Rabbits & Their Histories: Breeds of the World, Bob D. Whitman, suggests that the Angora breed could date back ten centuries: \"it has been written that the indigenous Trelicians, which were small and frail people, first bred the Angora rabbit in the southern Carpathian mountains around the 6th century.\" This information has not been substantiated and Whitman himself acknowledges that \"we will never know for sure\".<ref name=\"Whitman\" />\n\n==Angora rabbit wool==\n{{Anchor|Appearance|reason=\"Appearance\" is the old section name that was changed to \"Angora rabbit wool\" on 22 February 2018}}\n[[File:Beatrix Potter, Benjamin Bunny, Mrs Rabbits shop.jpg|thumb|left|<center><span style=\"font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light; font-size: 9pt\">\"[S]he earned her living by knitting<br>rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees\".</span><br><small>Original text with this illustration from<br>''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]''<br>by Beatrix Potter (1904)</small></center>|290px]]\n[[File:Satin Angora Rabbit plucked from the back.JPG|thumb|right|<center><small>A plucked Satin Angora rabbit</small></center>|210px]]\n[[File:Angora rabbit post hair cut.jpg|thumb|right|<center><small>A shorn Angora rabbit</small></center>|210px]]\nAngoras are bred mainly for their [[Angora wool|wool]], which is silky and soft.

A full harvesting is done by shearing the coat with clippers or small scissors, often while the rabbit sits atop a groomer's turntable. Shearing typically starts at the head, moving across the shoulders shoulders to the tail. The rabbit is then flipped, and the underside sheared from tail to chin.

All rabbits ingest some of their wool when they groom themselves, but their digestive system is not able to pass that foreign matter. The length of Angora hairs compounds the risk of impaction, which can lead to death.

This \"Angora gene\" is present in all Angora breeds.

In 1939 ARBA reclassified \"Angora Wooler\" into \"English Type\" and \"French Type\". In 1944 ARBA officially separated Angora rabbits into two breeds: English Angora and French Angora.\n\nRabbits of the Angora breed are adorned with \"fur\", growths of wool on the ears and the entire face except above the nose, and front feet, along with their thick body, and wool. They are gentle in nature, but they are not recommended for those who do not groom their animals. Their wool is very dense and needs to be groomed twice a week.\n\nThis is the smallest Angora rabbit of the four ARBA-recognized breeds. This breed is more common as a pet because of the facial features that give it a puppy dog or teddy bear look. If the texture of the wool is correct, the maintenance is relatively easy; if the texture of the rabbit is [[cotton]]y, it requires a great deal of maintenance. Beginning spinners may find the wool challenging.\n\nThe English Angora can be bred to have broken colors\u2014i.e., white with black spots\u2014but this is not accepted by ARBA standards, and would lead to a disqualification when showing the rabbit. When showing an English Angora rabbit, the toenails should also be only one color, the ears could be folded over at the tips, and the furnishings on the face may cover their eyes. The English Angora is the only one of the Angora breeds that has hair covering its eyes.\n\n===French Angora===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n[[File:FrenchAngora.jpg|thumb|<center><small>French Angora<br>''Chocolate Pearl''</small></center>|150px]]\n* '''Weight:''' {{convert|3.5|-|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n* '''ARBA-recognized varieties:''' Agouti, Broken, Pointed White, Self, Shaded, Ticked, and Wide Band\nThis breed has a dense undercoat. If the texture is correct, it requires less maintenance than other Angora breeds. Small ear tufts are allowed, but not usually preferred by breeders. ARBA recognizes the same colors as with English Angora, plus broken. They are shown at ARBA shows using the types \"white\" and \"colored\" (broken being a colored). As with other ARBA shown rabbits, toenails should also be only one color.\n\nThe French Angora is one of the large Angora breeds at 7.5 to 10&nbsp;lbs, with a commercial body type. It differs from the English, Giant and German Angora in that it possesses a clean (hairless) face and front feet, with only minor tufting on the rear legs. The color of a French Angora is determined by the color of its head, feet and tail (all the same color). This variety of angora fibre has smooth silky texture. Beginning spinners may find  Angora wool a challenge.\nDesirable characteristics of the fibre include its texture, warmth, light weight, and pure white color. It is used for sweaters, mittens, baby clothes and millinery.\n\n===German Angora===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n[[File:Angora-Kaninchen (Jean Bungartz, Kaninchenrassen, 1902, p059).jpg|thumb|right|<center>Angora Rabbit<br><small>''Angora-Kaninchen''<br>''(Jean Bungartz 1902)''</small></center>|300px]]\n* '''Weight:''' {{convert|2.5|-|5.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n* '''IAGARB-accepted varieties:''' Albino or Colored (but not bi-colored)<ref name=\"IAGARB Colors\">{{cite web|title=IAGARB Color Description Guide|url=http://iagarb.com/iagarb-color-guide/|website=International Association of German Angora Rabbit Breeders (IAGARB)|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{sc1|Albino Color Group}}\n**Albino\n*{{sc1|Self Group}}\n**Black\n**Dilute Black<sup>a/k/a Blue</sup>\n**Brown<sup>a/k/a Chocolate</sup>\n**Dilute Brown<sup>a/k/a Lilac</sup>\n*{{sc1|Tortoiseshell Group}}\n**Tortoiseshell\n**Dilute Black Tortoiseshell<sup>a/k/a Blue Tortoiseshell</sup>\n**Brown Tortoiseshell<sup>a/k/a Chocolate Tortoiseshell</sup>\n**Dilute Brown Tortoiseshell<sup>a/k/a Lilac Tortoiseshell</sup>\n*{{sc1|Agouti Group}}\n**Agouti<sup>a/k/a Black Agouti, Chestnut Agouti, Wild Agouti</sup>\n**Dilute Black Agouti<sup>a/k/a Blue Agouti or Opal</sup>\n**Brown Agouti<sup>a/k/a Chocolate Agouti</sup>\n**Dilute Brown Agouti<sup>a/k/a Lilac Agouti or Lynx</sup>\n*{{sc1|Wide Band Color Group}}\n**Yellow<sup>a/k/a Red or Fawn</sup>\n*{{sc1|Chinchilla Color Group}}\n**Chinchilla\n**Dilute Black Chinchilla<sup>a/k/a Blue Chinchilla or Squirrel</sup>\n**Brown Chinchilla<sup>a/k/a Chocolate Chinchilla</sup>\n**Dilute Brown Chinchilla<sup>a/k/a Lilac Chinchilla</sup>\n{{div col end}}\nThough common, the German Angora is not currently recognized by ARBA.

It was originally developed to be an efficient commercial producer that could be sustained on 16\u201318% protein pellets plus hay, and live in the standard sized, all-wire cages. \n\nBecause ARBA wouldn't allow German Angoras to be shown (their body type was considered too similar to other Angora breeds), Louise Walsh of Taunton, Massachusetts created a new breed. She used German Angoras, French Lops, and Flemish Giants to develop a completely different \"commercial\" body type. ARBA officially recognized the Giant Angora in 1988.<ref name=\"Whitman\"/> Its coat includes three types of wool: soft under wool, awn fluff, and awn hair.\n\nThe awn type wool exists only in the Giant and German Angora breeds. The Giant Angora has furnishings on the face and ears. Many people confuse the German with the Giant Angora, but it is their body type that differs.\n\nThe only color variety ARBA currently recognizes for the Giant Angora is the Ruby-eyed White (REW), a color that indicates the genetic absence of pigment (''[[albino]]''). The Giant Angora produces more wool than the French, Satin or English Angoras. The Giant Angora is the only 6-class animal in the Angora breed. It is to have a commercial-type body with a very dense coat of wool. The head will be oval in appearance that is broad across the forehead and slightly narrower at the muzzle. The Giant Angora will have forehead tufts (head trimmings) and cheek furnishings. The head trimmings are to be noticeable, however, does are not as heavy in trimmings as the bucks. The ears should be lightly fringed and well tasseled. The Giant Angora is also the only breed of angora that is only shown as a ruby-eyed white. A Black color variety of the Giant Angora is in development, but has not been sanctioned by ARBA.<ref>Summary on the description of a Giant Angora, American Rabbit Breeders Association, Standards, spring 2012.</ref>\n\nThe Giant Angora coat contains three fiber types for its texture. The underwool is to be the most dominant over the other two types of hair. It should be medium fine, soft, delicately waved and have a gentle shine. Beginning spinners may find  Angora wool a challenge.\n\nThe Awn Fluff has a guard hair tip and is a stronger, wavy wool. The Awn Fluff is found between the Underwool and Awn Hair. The Awn Hair, also known as guard hair, is the third type of fiber. The Awn Hair is a straight, strong hair that protrudes above the wool and must be present and evident.\n\nThe classification of the Giant Angora is different than the other three breeds due to the fact it is a 6-class animal. The junior buck and junior doe must be under 6 months of age and have a minimum weight of 4 \u00be pounds. The intermediate buck and intermediate doe are 6\u20138 months of age. The senior buck and senior\ndoe are 8 months of age or over. The senior buck must weigh at least 9 \u00bd pounds. The senior doe must weigh at least 10 pounds.\n\nIn judging the Giant Angoras the majority of the points are based on the wool, which includes density, texture, and length. The points for \"general type\" include the body type, head, ears, eyes, feet, legs, and tail.\n\nLike many other \"giant\" breeds of rabbits, the Giant Angora grows slowly. A doe usually takes more than a year to reach full maturity (size and weight). A buck can take up to 1.5 years to fully mature (size and weight).\n\n===Satin Angora===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n* '''Weight:''' {{convert|3.0|-|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n* '''ARBA-recognized varieties:''' [Includes eight color groups.

In addition to the sheen (for which the Satin is known), true red and copper pigments emerged in the new rabbits. In all \"satinized\" coats, the hair shaft has a semi-transparent outer shell that reflects light, resulting in deep color, high luster, and an extremely soft and silky texture to the hairs.\n\nThe Satin Angora (like the French Angora) has no furnishings on the face, ears, or feet. The Satin does not produce as much wool as other Angora breeds, but this trait is being improved upon through [[selective breeding]]. While more difficult to keep groomed than the Giant or French Angora, the Satin is less difficult than the English Angora. Because of the soft texture of the wool and the lower guard-hair count in the coat, matting occurs more readily. Daily combing therefore could be recommended.\n\nSatin Angora wool is said to be stronger for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] than other Angora varieties, but because of its slipperiness, it can be more difficult to spin.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Other Angora rabbit breeds===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n*Chinese Angora\n*Finnish Angora\n*Japanese Angora\n*Korean Angora\n*Russian Angora\n*St. Lucian Angora\n*Swiss Angora\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"220px\">\nFile:Nihonangora.jpg|<center>Japanese Angora<br><small>(August 2009)</small></center>\nFile:Russisches Angora-Kaninchen (Jean Bungartz, Kaninchenrassen, 1902, p065).jpg|<center>Russian Angora<br><small>''Russisches Angora-Kaninchen''<br>(Jean Bungartz 1902)</small></center>\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Angora wool]]\n* [[Angora project]]\n* [[List of rabbit breeds]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angora Rabbit}}\n[[Category:Rabbit breeds]]\n[[Category:Rabbit breeds originating in Turkey]]\n[[Category:History of Ankara]]\n[[Category:Animal breeds on the GEH Red List]]\n[[Category:Rabbits as pets]]\n[[Category:Wool animals]]\n<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardy |first1=thora |title=Angora Rabbit Wool Production |url=https://archive.org/details/angorarabbitwool785hard |date=1948 |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture}}</ref>\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animal breed\n|name                  = Angora rabbit\n|image                 = Fluffy_white_bunny_rabbit.jpg\n|image_size            = \n|alt                   = Ankara\n|caption               = <center>Giant Angora<br>''in full coat''</center>\n|status                = \n|alt_name              = \n|nickname              = \n|country               = {{flagicon|TUR}} [[Turkey]]\n|distribution          = Worldwide\n|standard              = \n|type                  = English, French, German, Giant, Satin, Chinese, Finnish, Japanese, Korean, Russian, St.&nbsp;Lucian, Swiss\n|use                   = Angora wool production, pet\n|weight                = {{convert|2.0|\u2013|5.5|kg|abbr=on}}\n|coat                  = Long, Fine\n|wool_color            = White or Colored<br>Natural or Dyed\n|color                 = Albino (\"Ruby-eyed White\") or Colored\n|litter_size           = 2\u201312\n|life_span             = 7\u201312 years\n|features              = \n|trait_label           = \n|trait_data            = \n|trait1_label          = \n|trait1_data           = <!-- etc, up to trait4_label / trait4_data -->\n|classification_label  = \n|classification_data   = \n|classification1_label = \n|classification1_data  = <!-- etc, up to classification8_label / classification8_data -->\n|notes                 = ''Coat can require weekly-regular grooming''\n|vernacular_name       = \n|binominal_name        = \n|trinominal_name       = \n}}\nThe '''Angora rabbit''' ({{lang-tr|Ankara tav\u015fan\u0131}}), which is one of the oldest types<ref name=\"Whitman\">{{cite book|last1=Whitman|first1=Bob D.|title=Domestic Rabbits & Their Histories: Breeds of the World|date=October 2004|publisher=Leathers Publishing|location=Leawood KS|isbn=978-1585972753}}</ref> of [[domestic rabbit]], is bred for the long fibers of its coat, known as ''[[Angora wool]]'', that are gathered by [[sheep shearing|shearing]], combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|plucking]].

The Angora rabbit became a popular pet of the French royalty in the mid-18th century, and Angoras spread to other parts of Europe by the end of that century.  <ref name=\"Whitman\" /> In the United States garments made of Angora rabbit wool has been popular ever since they first arrived in the early 20th century. But only during World War II did domestic production expand to meet the demand of more than 120,000 pounds a year. This valuable, soft silky fiber aroused much interest, and quickly people became enamored with the production process. <ref>Hardy, T. M. P., & Dolnick, E. H. (1948). Angora rabbit wool production. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture.</ref>\n\nThe author of Domestic Rabbits & Their Histories: Breeds of the World, Bob D. Whitman, suggests that the Angora breed could date back ten centuries: \"it has been written that the indigenous Trelicians, which were small and frail people, first bred the Angora rabbit in the southern Carpathian mountains around the 6th century.\" This information has not been substantiated and Whitman himself acknowledges that \"we will never know for sure\".<ref name=\"Whitman\" />\n\n==Angora rabbit wool==\n{{Anchor|Appearance|reason=\"Appearance\" is the old section name that was changed to \"Angora rabbit wool\" on 22 February 2018}}\n[[File:Beatrix Potter, Benjamin Bunny, Mrs Rabbits shop.jpg|thumb|left|<center><span style=\"font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light; font-size: 9pt\">\"[S]he earned her living by knitting<br>rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees\".</span><br><small>Original text with this illustration from<br>''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]''<br>by Beatrix Potter (1904)</small></center>|290px]]\n[[File:Satin Angora Rabbit plucked from the back.JPG|thumb|right|<center><small>A plucked Satin Angora rabbit</small></center>|210px]]\n[[File:Angora rabbit post hair cut.jpg|thumb|right|<center><small>A shorn Angora rabbit</small></center>|210px]]\nAngoras are bred mainly for their [[Angora wool|wool]], which is silky and soft.

A full harvesting is done by shearing the coat with clippers or small scissors, often while the rabbit sits atop a groomer's turntable. Shearing typically starts at the head, moving across the shoulders shoulders to the tail. The rabbit is then flipped, and the underside sheared from tail to chin.

The length of Angora hairs compounds the risk of impaction, which can lead to death.

In 1939 ARBA reclassified \"Angora Wooler\" into \"English Type\" and \"French Type\". In 1944 ARBA officially separated Angora rabbits into two breeds: English Angora and French Angora.\n\nRabbits of the Angora breed are adorned with \"fur\", growths of wool on the ears and the entire face except above the nose, and front feet, along with their thick body, and wool. They are gentle in nature, but they are not recommended for those who do not groom their animals. Their wool is very dense and needs to be groomed twice a week.\n\nThis is the smallest Angora rabbit of the four ARBA-recognized breeds. This breed is more common as a pet because of the facial features that give it a puppy dog or teddy bear look. If the texture of the wool is correct, the maintenance is relatively easy; if the texture of the rabbit is [[cotton]]y, it requires a great deal of maintenance. Beginning spinners may find the wool challenging.\n\nThe English Angora can be bred to have broken colors\u2014i.e., white with black spots\u2014but this is not accepted by ARBA standards, and would lead to a disqualification when showing the rabbit. When showing an English Angora rabbit, the toenails should also be only one color, the ears could be folded over at the tips, and the furnishings on the face may cover their eyes. The English Angora is the only one of the Angora breeds that has hair covering its eyes.\n\n===French Angora===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n[[File:FrenchAngora.jpg|thumb|<center><small>French Angora<br>''Chocolate Pearl''</small></center>|150px]]\n* '''Weight:''' {{convert|3.5|-|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n* '''ARBA-recognized varieties:''' Agouti, Broken, Pointed White, Self, Shaded, Ticked, and Wide Band\nThis breed has a dense undercoat. If the texture is correct, it requires less maintenance than other Angora breeds. Small ear tufts are allowed, but not usually preferred by breeders. ARBA recognizes the same colors as with English Angora, plus broken. They are shown at ARBA shows using the types \"white\" and \"colored\" (broken being a colored). As with other ARBA shown rabbits, toenails should also be only one color.\n\nThe French Angora is one of the large Angora breeds at 7.5 to 10&nbsp;lbs, with a commercial body type. It differs from the English, Giant and German Angora in that it possesses a clean (hairless) face and front feet, with only minor tufting on the rear legs. The color of a French Angora is determined by the color of its head, feet and tail (all the same color). This variety of angora fibre has smooth silky texture. Beginning spinners may find  Angora wool a challenge.\nDesirable characteristics of the fibre include its texture, warmth, light weight, and pure white color. It is used for sweaters, mittens, baby clothes and millinery.\n\n===German Angora===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n[[File:Angora-Kaninchen (Jean Bungartz, Kaninchenrassen, 1902, p059).jpg|thumb|right|<center>Angora Rabbit<br><small>''Angora-Kaninchen''<br>''(Jean Bungartz 1902)''</small></center>|300px]]\n* '''Weight:''' {{convert|2.5|-|5.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n* '''IAGARB-accepted varieties:''' Albino or Colored (but not bi-colored)<ref name=\"IAGARB Colors\">{{cite web|title=IAGARB Color Description Guide|url=http://iagarb.com/iagarb-color-guide/|website=International Association of German Angora Rabbit Breeders (IAGARB)|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{sc1|Albino Color Group}}\n**Albino\n*{{sc1|Self Group}}\n**Black\n**Dilute Black<sup>a/k/a Blue</sup>\n**Brown<sup>a/k/a Chocolate</sup>\n**Dilute Brown<sup>a/k/a Lilac</sup>\n*{{sc1|Tortoiseshell Group}}\n**Tortoiseshell\n**Dilute Black Tortoiseshell<sup>a/k/a Blue Tortoiseshell</sup>\n**Brown Tortoiseshell<sup>a/k/a Chocolate Tortoiseshell</sup>\n**Dilute Brown Tortoiseshell<sup>a/k/a Lilac Tortoiseshell</sup>\n*{{sc1|Agouti Group}}\n**Agouti<sup>a/k/a Black Agouti, Chestnut Agouti, Wild Agouti</sup>\n**Dilute Black Agouti<sup>a/k/a Blue Agouti or Opal</sup>\n**Brown Agouti<sup>a/k/a Chocolate Agouti</sup>\n**Dilute Brown Agouti<sup>a/k/a Lilac Agouti or Lynx</sup>\n*{{sc1|Wide Band Color Group}}\n**Yellow<sup>a/k/a Red or Fawn</sup>\n*{{sc1|Chinchilla Color Group}}\n**Chinchilla\n**Dilute Black Chinchilla<sup>a/k/a Blue Chinchilla or Squirrel</sup>\n**Brown Chinchilla<sup>a/k/a Chocolate Chinchilla</sup>\n**Dilute Brown Chinchilla<sup>a/k/a Lilac Chinchilla</sup>\n{{div col end}}\nThough common, the German Angora is not currently recognized by ARBA.

It was originally developed to be an efficient commercial producer that could be sustained on 16\u201318% protein pellets plus hay, and live in the standard sized, all-wire cages. \n\nBecause ARBA wouldn't allow German Angoras to be shown (their body type was considered too similar to other Angora breeds), Louise Walsh of Taunton, Massachusetts created a new breed. She used German Angoras, French Lops, and Flemish Giants to develop a completely different \"commercial\" body type. ARBA officially recognized the Giant Angora in 1988.<ref name=\"Whitman\"/> Its coat includes three types of wool: soft under wool, awn fluff, and awn hair.\n\nThe awn type wool exists only in the Giant and German Angora breeds. The Giant Angora has furnishings on the face and ears. Many people confuse the German with the Giant Angora, but it is their body type that differs.\n\nThe only color variety ARBA currently recognizes for the Giant Angora is the Ruby-eyed White (REW), a color that indicates the genetic absence of pigment (''[[albino]]''). The Giant Angora produces more wool than the French, Satin or English Angoras. The Giant Angora is the only 6-class animal in the Angora breed. It is to have a commercial-type body with a very dense coat of wool. The head will be oval in appearance that is broad across the forehead and slightly narrower at the muzzle. The Giant Angora will have forehead tufts (head trimmings) and cheek furnishings. The head trimmings are to be noticeable, however, does are not as heavy in trimmings as the bucks. The ears should be lightly fringed and well tasseled. The Giant Angora is also the only breed of angora that is only shown as a ruby-eyed white. A Black color variety of the Giant Angora is in development, but has not been sanctioned by ARBA.<ref>Summary on the description of a Giant Angora, American Rabbit Breeders Association, Standards, spring 2012.</ref>\n\nThe Giant Angora coat contains three fiber types for its texture. The underwool is to be the most dominant over the other two types of hair. It should be medium fine, soft, delicately waved and have a gentle shine. Beginning spinners may find  Angora wool a challenge.\n\nThe Awn Fluff has a guard hair tip and is a stronger, wavy wool. The Awn Fluff is found between the Underwool and Awn Hair. The Awn Hair, also known as guard hair, is the third type of fiber. The Awn Hair is a straight, strong hair that protrudes above the wool and must be present and evident.\n\nThe classification of the Giant Angora is different than the other three breeds due to the fact it is a 6-class animal. The junior buck and junior doe must be under 6 months of age and have a minimum weight of 4 \u00be pounds. The intermediate buck and intermediate doe are 6\u20138 months of age. The senior buck and senior\ndoe are 8 months of age or over. The senior buck must weigh at least 9 \u00bd pounds. The senior doe must weigh at least 10 pounds.\n\nIn judging the Giant Angoras the majority of the points are based on the wool, which includes density, texture, and length. The points for \"general type\" include the body type, head, ears, eyes, feet, legs, and tail.\n\nLike many other \"giant\" breeds of rabbits, the Giant Angora grows slowly. A doe usually takes more than a year to reach full maturity (size and weight). A buck can take up to 1.5 years to fully mature (size and weight).\n\n===Satin Angora===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n* '''Weight:''' {{convert|3.0|-|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n* '''ARBA-recognized varieties:''' [Includes eight color groups.

In addition to the sheen (for which the Satin is known), true red and copper pigments emerged in the new rabbits. In all \"satinized\" coats, the hair shaft has a semi-transparent outer shell that reflects light, resulting in deep color, high luster, and an extremely soft and silky texture to the hairs.\n\nThe Satin Angora (like the French Angora) has no furnishings on the face, ears, or feet. The Satin does not produce as much wool as other Angora breeds, but this trait is being improved upon through [[selective breeding]]. While more difficult to keep groomed than the Giant or French Angora, the Satin is less difficult than the English Angora. Because of the soft texture of the wool and the lower guard-hair count in the coat, matting occurs more readily. Daily combing therefore could be recommended.\n\nSatin Angora wool is said to be stronger for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] than other Angora varieties, but because of its slipperiness, it can be more difficult to spin.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Other Angora rabbit breeds===\n<!--COMMENT Please do not change the above section name: [[List of rabbit breeds]] links here (February 2018)-->\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n*Chinese Angora\n*Finnish Angora\n*Japanese Angora\n*Korean Angora\n*Russian Angora\n*St. Lucian Angora\n*Swiss Angora\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"220px\">\nFile:Nihonangora.jpg|<center>Japanese Angora<br><small>(August 2009)</small></center>\nFile:Russisches Angora-Kaninchen (Jean Bungartz, Kaninchenrassen, 1902, p065).jpg|<center>Russian Angora<br><small>''Russisches Angora-Kaninchen''<br>(Jean Bungartz 1902)</small></center>\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Angora wool]]\n* [[Angora project]]\n* [[List of rabbit breeds]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angora Rabbit}}\n[[Category:Rabbit breeds]]\n[[Category:Rabbit breeds originating in Turkey]]\n[[Category:History of Ankara]]\n[[Category:Animal breeds on the GEH Red List]]\n[[Category:Rabbits as pets]]\n[[Category:Wool animals]]\n<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardy |first1=thora |title=Angora Rabbit Wool Production |url=https://archive.org/details/angorarabbitwool785hard |date=1948 |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture}}</ref>\n", "name_user": "65.25.109.84", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAngora rabbit wool)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angora_rabbit"}

Richard Eaton, the leading authority on the subject, puts the number of confirmed temple destructions during Aurangzeb's rule at just over a dozen, with fewer tied to the emperor's direct commands. Other scholars have pointed out additional temple demolitions not counted by Eaton, such as two orders to destroy the Somanatha Temple in 1659 and 1706 (the existence of a second order suggests that the first was never carried out). Aurangzeb also oversaw temple desecrations. For example, in 1645 he ordered mihrabs (prayer niches, typically located in mosques) erected in Ahmedabad's Chintamani Parshvanath Temple, built by the Jain merchant Shantidas. Even adding in such events, however, to quote Eaton, \"the evidence is almost always fragmentary, incomplete, or even contradictory\".

Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara back to health in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Other sources tell us that Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir.<ref>Ahmad, Fazl.

The area was under attack from [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes. While the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through the snow to [[Kabul]]. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=132\u20133}}</ref>\n\nFurther inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 to [[Three Sieges of Kandahar|dislodge]] the Safavids at [[Kandahar]], which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=134\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan again after he was replaced by Dara Shukoh in the attempt to recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two ''[[jagir]]s'' (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from [[Malwa]] and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation.<ref name=\"Chandra2005p267\" /> Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan{{Citation needed|reason=Murshid Quli Khan was born at 1670|date=June 2016}} to extend to the Deccan the ''zabt'' revenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced.

Shuja was being chased through [[Bihar]] and the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at the [[Battle of Samugarh]] in late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb.

Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb.

In the first volume of his Pulitzer Prize winning book series, historian Will Durant<ref>Durant, Will 1935, p.475.</ref> stated the following:\n\n{{quote|Aurangzeb cared nothing for art, destroyed its \"heathen\" monuments with coarse bigotry, and fought, through a reign of half a century, to eradicate from India almost all religions but his own. He issued orders to the provincial governors, and to his other subordinates, 'to raze to the ground all the temples of either Hindus or Christians, to smash every idol, and to close every Hindu school. In one year (1679\u201380) sixty-six temples were broken to pieces in Amber alone, sixtythree at Chitor, one hundred and twenty-three at Udaipur; and over the site of a Benares temple especially sacred to the Hindus he built, in deliberate insult, a Mohammedan mosque. He forbade all public worship of the Hindu faiths, and laid upon every unconverted Hindu a heavy capitation tax.\n\nAs a result of his fanaticism, thousands of the temples which had represented or housed the art of India through a millennium were laid in ruins. We can never know, from looking at India today, what grandeur and beauty she once possessed. Aurangzeb converted a handful of timid Hindus to Islam, but he wrecked his dynasty and his country. A few Moslems worshiped him as a saint, but the mute and terrorized millions of India looked upon him as a monster, fled from his tax-gatherers, and prayed for his death. During his reign the Mogul empire in India reached its height, extending into the Deccan; but it was a power that had no foundation in the affection of the people, and was doomed to fall at the first hostile and vigorous touch. The Emperor himself, in his last years, began to realize that by the very narrowness of his piety he had destroyed the heritage of his fathers.}}\n\nAurangzeb changed the name of one of Hinduism's holiest cities, [[Varanasi|Benaras]], to ''Muhammadabad''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DDjCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT149&dq=aurangzeb+benaras#v=onepage&q=aurangzeb%20benaras&f=false|title=The Saffron Book|first=Prafull|last=Goradia|year=2016|isbn=9788128816628}}</ref> After the Jat rebellion in Mathura, Aurangzeb ordered the city's [[Kesava Deo temple]] demolished, and built an ''[[Eidgah]]'' in its place.

He and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda and fiercely protected the [[Kollur Mine]], which was then probably the world's most productive diamond mine, and an important economic asset. In 1687, Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi fortress during the [[Siege of Golconda]]. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a [[granite]] hill over 400&nbsp;ft high with an enormous eight-mile long wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda had the ability to repulse any war elephant attack. Although the Qutbshahis maintained the impregnability of their walls, at night Aurangzeb and his infantry erected complex [[scaffold]]ing that allowed them to scale the high walls. During the eight-month siege the Mughals faced many hardships including the death of their experienced commander [[Kilich Khan II|Kilich Khan Bahadur]].

He further writes how \"Artisans manufacture of silk, fine brocade, and other fine muslins, of which are made turbans, robes of gold flowers, and tunics worn by females, so delicately fine as to wear out in one night, and cost even more if they were well embroidered with fine needlework\".<ref name=\"saudiaramcoworld\">{{cite magazine |last=Werner |first=Louis |date=July\u2013August 2011 |title=Mughal Maal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |magazine=Saudi Aramco World |access-date=3 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222152801/http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |archive-date=22 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe also explains the different techniques employed to produce such complicated textiles such as ''Himru'' (whose name is Persian for \"brocade\"), ''Paithani'' (whose pattern is identical on both sides), ''Mushru'' (satin weave) and how ''Kalamkari'', in which fabrics are painted or block-printed, was a technique that originally came from Persia.

Aurangzeb prepared his armies in the Indus River Basin for a counteroffensive, but Abbas II's death in 1666 caused Aurangzeb to end all hostilities.

He launched a terrible scorched earth policy, sending thousands of soldiers into the valleys, burning, despoiling, smashing villages and killing as many tribesmen as possible. He also successfully used bribery to set the tribal chiefs against each other, thus fomenting so much mutual suspicion that they were too busy fighting each other to fight the Mughal Empire. This worked up to a point. But the resulting legacy of mistrust between the tribes destroyed any prospect that unified political institutions might slowly emerge or that the laws and government of the settled regions might be adopted.}}</ref>\n\nAfter that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority in the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important [[Attock]]-[[Kabul]] trade route along the [[Grand Trunk road]] was particularly disastrous. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebels and partially suppressed the revolt, although they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route.\n\n==Death==\n{{See also|Tomb of Aurangzeb}}\n[[File:Biwi ka Maqbara.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bibi Ka Maqbara]], the mausoleum of Aurangzeb's wife [[Dilras Banu Begum]], was commissioned by him]]\n[[File:TOMB aURANGAZEB.JPG|thumb|Aurangzeb's tomb in [[Khuldabad]], [[Aurangabad]], Maharashtra.]]\n\nBy 1689, the conquest of Golconda, Mughal victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4&nbsp;million square kilometres,<ref name=\"Taagepera\"/> with a population estimated to be over 158&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"borocz\"/> But this supremacy was short-lived.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|p=1}}</ref> Jos Gommans, Professor of Colonial and Global History at the [[University of Leiden]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.leiden.edu/history/staff/gommans.html |title=Prof.dr.

The top of his coffin was to be covered with a plain piece of canvas. To the poor he left three hundred rupees earned by copying the Koran. He died at the age of eighty-nine, having long outstayed his welcome on the earth. Within seventeen years of his death his empire was broken into fragments. The support of the people, so wisely won by Akbar, had been forfeited by the cruelty of Jehangir, the wastefulness of Jehan, and the intolerance of Aurangzeb. The Moslem minority, already enervated by India's heat, had lost the military ardor and physical vigor of their prime, and no fresh recruits were coming from the north to buttress their declining power.

Richard Eaton, the leading authority on the subject, puts the number of confirmed temple destructions during Aurangzeb's rule at just over a dozen, with fewer tied to the emperor's direct commands. Other scholars have pointed out additional temple demolitions not counted by Eaton, such as two orders to destroy the Somanatha Temple in 1659 and 1706 (the existence of a second order suggests that the first was never carried out). Aurangzeb also oversaw temple desecrations. For example, in 1645 he ordered mihrabs (prayer niches, typically located in mosques) erected in Ahmedabad's Chintamani Parshvanath Temple, built by the Jain merchant Shantidas. Even adding in such events, however, to quote Eaton, \"the evidence is almost always fragmentary, incomplete, or even contradictory\".

The area was under attack from [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes. While the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through the snow to [[Kabul]]. By the end of this two-year campaign, into which Aurangzeb had been plunged at a late stage, a vast sum of money had been expended for little gain.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=132\u20133}}</ref>\n\nFurther inauspicious military involvements followed, as Aurangzeb was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. His efforts in 1649 and 1652 to [[Three Sieges of Kandahar|dislodge]] the Safavids at [[Kandahar]], which they had recently retaken after a decade of Mughal control, both ended in failure as winter approached. The logistical problems of supplying an army at the extremity of the empire, combined with the poor quality of armaments and the intransigence of the opposition have been cited by John Richards as the reasons for failure, and a third attempt in 1653, led by Dara Shikoh, met with the same outcome.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|pp=134\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan again after he was replaced by Dara Shukoh in the attempt to recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two ''[[jagir]]s'' (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from [[Malwa]] and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that things could be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation.<ref name=\"Chandra2005p267\" /> Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan{{Citation needed|reason=Murshid Quli Khan was born at 1670|date=June 2016}} to extend to the Deccan the ''zabt'' revenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced.

Shuja was being chased through [[Bihar]] and the victory of Aurangzeb proved this to be a poor decision by Dara Shikoh, who now had a defeated force on one front and a successful force unnecessarily pre-occupied on another. Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at the [[Battle of Samugarh]] in late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb.

Aurangzeb offered Shah Shuja the governorship of Bengal. This move had the effect of isolating Dara Shikoh and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb.

In the first volume of his Pulitzer Prize winning book series, historian Will Durant<ref>Durant, Will 1935, p.475.</ref> stated the following:\n\n{{quote|Aurangzeb cared nothing for art, destroyed its \"heathen\" monuments with coarse bigotry, and fought, through a reign of half a century, to eradicate from India almost all religions but his own. He issued orders to the provincial governors, and to his other subordinates, 'to raze to the ground all the temples of either Hindus or Christians, to smash every idol, and to close every Hindu school. In one year (1679\u201380) sixty-six temples were broken to pieces in Amber alone, sixtythree at Chitor, one hundred and twenty-three at Udaipur; and over the site of a Benares temple especially sacred to the Hindus he built, in deliberate insult, a Mohammedan mosque. He forbade all public worship of the Hindu faiths, and laid upon every unconverted Hindu a heavy capitation tax.\n\nAs a result of his fanaticism, thousands of the temples which had represented or housed the art of India through a millennium were laid in ruins. We can never know, from looking at India today, what grandeur and beauty she once possessed. Aurangzeb converted a handful of timid Hindus to Islam, but he wrecked his dynasty and his country. A few Moslems worshiped him as a saint, but the mute and terrorized millions of India looked upon him as a monster, fled from his tax-gatherers, and prayed for his death. During his reign the Mogul empire in India reached its height, extending into the Deccan; but it was a power that had no foundation in the affection of the people, and was doomed to fall at the first hostile and vigorous touch. The Emperor himself, in his last years, began to realize that by the very narrowness of his piety he had destroyed the heritage of his fathers.}}\n\nAurangzeb changed the name of one of Hinduism's holiest cities, [[Varanasi|Benaras]], to ''Muhammadabad''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DDjCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT149&dq=aurangzeb+benaras#v=onepage&q=aurangzeb%20benaras&f=false|title=The Saffron Book|first=Prafull|last=Goradia|year=2016|isbn=9788128816628}}</ref> After the Jat rebellion in Mathura, Aurangzeb ordered the city's [[Kesava Deo temple]] demolished, and built an ''[[Eidgah]]'' in its place.

He and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda and fiercely protected the [[Kollur Mine]], which was then probably the world's most productive diamond mine, and an important economic asset. In 1687, Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi fortress during the [[Siege of Golconda]]. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a [[granite]] hill over 400&nbsp;ft high with an enormous eight-mile long wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda had the ability to repulse any war elephant attack.

Francois Bernier writes how ''Karkanahs'', or workshops for the artisans, particularly in textiles flourished by \"employing hundreds of embroiderers, who were superintended by a master\". He further writes how \"Artisans manufacture of silk, fine brocade, and other fine muslins, of which are made turbans, robes of gold flowers, and tunics worn by females, so delicately fine as to wear out in one night, and cost even more if they were well embroidered with fine needlework\".<ref name=\"saudiaramcoworld\">{{cite magazine |last=Werner |first=Louis |date=July\u2013August 2011 |title=Mughal Maal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |magazine=Saudi Aramco World |access-date=3 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222152801/http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm |archive-date=22 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe also explains the different techniques employed to produce such complicated textiles such as ''Himru'' (whose name is Persian for \"brocade\"), ''Paithani'' (whose pattern is identical on both sides), ''Mushru'' (satin weave) and how ''Kalamkari'', in which fabrics are painted or block-printed, was a technique that originally came from Persia.

Aurangzeb prepared his armies in the Indus River Basin for a counteroffensive, but Abbas II's death in 1666 caused Aurangzeb to end all hostilities.

He launched a terrible scorched earth policy, sending thousands of soldiers into the valleys, burning, despoiling, smashing villages and killing as many tribesmen as possible. He also successfully used bribery to set the tribal chiefs against each other, thus fomenting so much mutual suspicion that they were too busy fighting each other to fight the Mughal Empire. This worked up to a point. But the resulting legacy of mistrust between the tribes destroyed any prospect that unified political institutions might slowly emerge or that the laws and government of the settled regions might be adopted.}}</ref>\n\nAfter that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority in the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important [[Attock]]-[[Kabul]] trade route along the [[Grand Trunk road]] was particularly disastrous. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebels and partially suppressed the revolt, although they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route.\n\n==Death==\n{{See also|Tomb of Aurangzeb}}\n[[File:Biwi ka Maqbara.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bibi Ka Maqbara]], the mausoleum of Aurangzeb's wife [[Dilras Banu Begum]], was commissioned by him]]\n[[File:TOMB aURANGAZEB.JPG|thumb|Aurangzeb's tomb in [[Khuldabad]], [[Aurangabad]], Maharashtra.]]\n\nBy 1689, the conquest of Golconda, Mughal victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4&nbsp;million square kilometres,<ref name=\"Taagepera\"/> with a population estimated to be over 158&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"borocz\"/> But this supremacy was short-lived.<ref>{{harvtxt|Richards|1996|p=1}}</ref> Jos Gommans, Professor of Colonial and Global History at the [[University of Leiden]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.leiden.edu/history/staff/gommans.html |title=Prof.dr.

The top of his coffin was to be covered with a plain piece of canvas. To the poor he left three hundred rupees earned by copying the Koran. He died at the age of eighty-nine, having long outstayed his welcome on the earth. Within seventeen years of his death his empire was broken into fragments. The support of the people, so wisely won by Akbar, had been forfeited by the cruelty of Jehangir, the wastefulness of Jehan, and the intolerance of Aurangzeb. The Moslem minority, already enervated by India's heat, had lost the military ardor and physical vigor of their prime, and no fresh recruits were coming from the north to buttress their declining power.

Summaries should be about 100 to 200 words in length, per WP:TVPLOT, and those substantially less than 100 words are most likely to be scrutinized for possible copyright violation. -->\n| LineColor       = FF5F6C\n}}\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Elena and the Secret of Avalor]]'', a crossover television film with ''[[Sofia the First]]'', which premiered on November 20, 2016.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Copyright Office\">From the United States Copyright Office catalog: {{cite web|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First|title=Public Catalog - Copyright Catalog (1978 to present) - Basic Search [search: \"Disney Elena of Avalor\"]|publisher=United States Copyright Office}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wdtvpress.com/disneychannel/shows/11836/episodes/|title=Elena of Avalor Episodes|publisher=Walt Disney Television Press}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/elena-of-avalor/listings/|title=Elena of Avalor Episode Listings|publisher=The Futon Critic}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Zap2it\">{{cite web|url=https://tvlistings.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH02448885|title=Elena of Avalor|publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elena of Avalor episodes, List of}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of American children's animated television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Disney Channel television series episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Elena_of_Avalor_episodes"}
