He has been a [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) for the [[Wexford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Wexford]] constituency since 1987. He served as [[Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform]] from 2011 to 2016, [[Ceann Comhairle#Leas-Cheann Comhairle|Leas-Cheann Comhairle]] from 2007 to 2011, [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1997 to 2002, [[Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government|Minister for the Environment]] from 1994 to 1997 and [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] from 1993 to 1994.

Howlin's father was a trade union official who served as secretary of the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]], in Wexford, for 40 years. He also secured election as a Labour member of [[Wexford Corporation]], where he served for eighteen years, and was also election agent to Brendan Corish. Howlin's mother was also strongly involved in local Labour politics.<ref name=WexPeop18Dec03>{{cite news|url=http://www.wexfordpeople.ie/news/family-was-most-important-thing-in-life-of-molly-howlin-987909.html|title=Family was most important thing in life of Molly Howlin|work=[[Wexford People]]|date=18 December 2003|accessdate=12 June 2008}}</ref>\n \nHowlin grew up in Wexford town and was educated locally at Wexford [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|CBS]]. He later attended [[St Patrick's College, Dublin|St Patrick's College]], [[Drumcondra, Dublin]], and qualified as a primary school teacher.<ref name=LabProfile/> During his career as a teacher he was active in the [[Irish National Teachers' Organisation]], before embarking on a career in full-time politics.\n\n==Political career==\n===Early years (1982\u20131993)===\nHowlin contested his first general election at the [[November 1982 Irish general election|November 1982 election]]. He ran as a Labour candidate in the [[Wexford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Wexford]] constituency, but despite the existence of a large left-wing vote in the area, Howlin was not elected.<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3568|title=Brendan Howlin|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=9 January 2007}}</ref> In spite of this setback, a [[Fine Gael]]-Labour Party coalition government came to power and he was [[Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann|nominated by the Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] to serve in [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] as a Senator.<ref name=oireachtas_db/>\n\nHowlin secured election to [[Wexford County Council]] in 1985 and served as Mayor of Wexford in 1986.\n\nIn 1987, the Labour Party withdrew from the coalition government and a [[1987 Irish general election|general election]] was called. Howlin once again contested a seat in Wexford and was elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].<ref name=elecs_irl/> Labour were out of office as a [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] government took office. In spite of his recent entry to the D\u00e1il, Howlin was subsequently named [[Chief Whip]] of the Labour Party, a position he held until 1993.\n\n===Cabinet minister (1993\u20131997)===\nThe [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament|hung D\u00e1il]] once again; however, the Labour Party enjoyed their best result to date at the time. After negotiations, a Fianna F\u00e1il-Labour Party coalition government came to office. Howlin joined the cabinet of [[Taoiseach]] [[Albert Reynolds]], as [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]]. During his tenure the development of a four-year health strategy, the identifying of [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention as a priority and the securing of a \u00a335 million investment in childcare were advanced. Howlin, however, was also targeted by anti-abortion groups after introducing an act which would allow information regarding abortion.\n\nIn 1994, the Labour Party withdrew from government after a disagreement over the appointment of [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] [[Harry Whelehan]] as a Judge of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] and [[High Court (Ireland)|President of the High Court]]. However, no general election was called and, while it was hoped that the coalition could be revived under the new Fianna F\u00e1il leader [[Bertie Ahern]], the arithmetic of the D\u00e1il now allowed the Labour Party to open discussions with other opposition parties. After negotiations a [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]] came to power involving Fine Gael, Labour and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]]. In [[John Bruton]]'s cabinet, he became [[Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government|Minister for the Environment]].\n\n===Leadership contender (1997)===\nFollowing the [[1997 Irish general election|1997 general election]], a Fianna F\u00e1il-[[Progressive Democrats]] coalition government came to power and the Labour Party returned to the opposition benches. In the announcement of the party's new front bench, Howlin retained responsibility for the Environment.\n\nIn late 1997, [[Dick Spring]] resigned as leader of the Labour Party and Howlin immediately threw his hat into the ring in the subsequent leadership election. In a choice between Howlin and [[Ruairi Quinn]], the former gained some early support; however, the leadership eventually went to Quinn by a significant majority. As a show of unity Howlin was later named deputy leader of the party and retained his brief as Spokesperson for the Environment and Local Government.\n\n===Leadership contender (2002)===\nIn 2002, following Quinn's resignation as party leader after Labour's relatively unsuccessful [[2002 Irish general election|2002 general election campaign]], Howlin again stood for the party leadership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2002/09/11/story823047586.asp|title=Howlin throws hat into Labour leadership ring|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=11 September 2002|accessdate=9 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> For the second time in five years Howlin was defeated for the leadership of the party, this time by [[Pat Rabbitte]], who was formerly a leading figure in Democratic Left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/victorious-rabbitte-aims-to-increase-partys-appeal-290699.html|title=Victorious Rabbitte aims to increase party's appeal|author=Senan Molony|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=26 October 2002|accessdate=9 January 2007}}</ref> Howlin was succeeded as deputy leader by [[Liz McManus]].\n\nWhile having been publicly supportive of Rabbitte's leadership, he was perceived as being the leader of the wing of the party which was sceptical of Rabbitte's policy with regard to future coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il. Rabbitte explicitly ruled out any future coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il, instead forming a formal alliance with Fine Gael in the run-up to the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 general election]] (the so-called ''Mullingar Accord'').\n\n===Leas-Cheann Comhairle (2007\u20132011)===\nOn 26 June 2007, Howlin was appointed the [[Ceann Comhairle#Leas-Cheann Comhairle|Leas-Cheann Comhairle]] (Deputy chairman) of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.<ref name=oireachtas_db/>\n\n===Cabinet minister (2011\u20132016)===\n[[File:Irish Cabinet 2013.jpg|thumb|Howlin (front left) in 2013.]]\nAfter [[2011 Irish general election|the 2011 general election]], Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a government, Howlin was appointed to the new office of [[Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform]]. In May 2011, he said that over the next 20 years the number of people in Ireland over 65 is set to increase by almost half a million, a situation that could see the annual health budget soar \u2013 rising by \u20ac12.5 billion in the next decade alone. While reform was a major part of government attempts \"to regain full sovereignty over economic policy\", Howlin told a meeting of the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies they would in any event face key \"imperatives\" in coming years. He said a new public spending review, on which he had briefed the cabinet in recent days, would not be a simple assessment of where to make cuts, but would also consider the way public sector services were delivered. Howlin reiterated the government's commitment not to cut public sector pay, \"if the ''[[Croke Park Agreement]]'' works\". \"These are just some of the challenges that our society is facing in the coming decade \u2013 crisis or no crisis. In the good times, tackling them was going to be difficult. Today, in these difficult times, tackling them is going to be imperative.\" Howlin said Ireland was facing a profound and complex economic crisis \"where we are fighting a battle on three fronts \u2013 mass unemployment, a major failure in banking, and a fiscal crisis\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0414/breaking71.html|title=Public service reform necessary \u2013 Howlin|first=Tim|last=O'Brien|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Analysis of budgets====\nBudgets 2012 to 2016 - introduced in part by Brendan Howlin as Minister for Public Expenditure and supported by Labour<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/public-finances/noonan-howlin-defend-budget-cuts-1.888404\n |title=Noonan, Howlin defend budget cuts \n |date=7 December 2011\n |author=Mary Minihan \n |accessdate=14 December 2017 \n}}</ref> - were described by the [[Economic and Social Research Institute|Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI)]] as \"regressive\".\n\nIt found \"Budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes: reductions of about 2 to 2\u00bd per cent for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of about \u00be of a per cent for those on the highest incomes\".\n\nBy contrast, the ESRI found earlier budgets in 2008-2010 to be \"strongly progressive\" because before 2011 \"Losses imposed by policy changes in tax and welfare have been greatest for those on the highest incomes, and smaller for those on low incomes\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esri.ie/pubs/QEC2011Win_SA_Callan.pdf |title=Distributional Impact of Tax, Welfare and Public Sector Pay Policies: 2009\u20102012  |date=24 February 2012 |author=Tim Callan, Claire Keane, Michael Savage and John R.

Following the resignation of [[Joan Burton]], Howlin contested the [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (Ireland)|2016 Labour Party leadership election]] unopposed and was elected [[Leader of the Labour Party (Ireland)|Leader of the Labour Party]] on 20 May 2016.\n\n====Criticism of the Taoiseach for failing to invite Howlin to meet ambulance crews====\nIn March 2018, Howlin criticised [[Taoiseach]] [[Leo Varadkar]] for failing to personally invite him to accompany Varadkar as he met ambulance crews in Howlin's constituency of Wexford.

Howlin stated that Kelly's comments were a disappointing and unnecessary distraction. Howlin also said that there was not a single parliamentary party member that supported the challenge and that Kelly had the backing of a minority of councillors.

Howlin's father was a trade union official who served as secretary of the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]], in Wexford, for 40 years. He also secured election as a Labour member of [[Wexford Corporation]], where he served for eighteen years, and was also election agent to Brendan Corish.

He later attended [[St Patrick's College, Dublin|St Patrick's College]], [[Drumcondra, Dublin]], and qualified as a primary school teacher.<ref name=LabProfile/> During his career as a teacher he was active in the [[Irish National Teachers' Organisation]], before embarking on a career in full-time politics.\n\n==Political career==\n===Early years (1982\u20131993)===\nHowlin contested his first general election at the [[November 1982 Irish general election|November 1982 election]]. He ran as a Labour candidate in the [[Wexford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Wexford]] constituency, but despite the existence of a large left-wing vote in the area, Howlin was not elected.<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3568|title=Brendan Howlin|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=9 January 2007}}</ref> In spite of this setback, a [[Fine Gael]]-Labour Party coalition government came to power and he was [[Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann|nominated by the Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] to serve in [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] as a Senator.<ref name=oireachtas_db/>\n\nHowlin secured election to [[Wexford County Council]] in 1985 and served as Mayor of Wexford in 1986.\n\nIn 1987, the Labour Party withdrew from the coalition government and a [[1987 Irish general election|general election]] was called. Howlin once again contested a seat in Wexford and was elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].<ref name=elecs_irl/> Labour were out of office as a [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] government took office. In spite of his recent entry to the D\u00e1il, Howlin was subsequently named [[Chief Whip]] of the Labour Party, a position he held until 1993.\n\n===Cabinet minister (1993\u20131997)===\nThe [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament|hung D\u00e1il]] once again; however, the Labour Party enjoyed their best result to date at the time. After negotiations, a Fianna F\u00e1il-Labour Party coalition government came to office. Howlin joined the cabinet of [[Taoiseach]] [[Albert Reynolds]], as [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]]. During his tenure the development of a four-year health strategy, the identifying of [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention as a priority and the securing of a \u00a335 million investment in childcare were advanced. Howlin, however, was also targeted by anti-abortion groups after introducing an act which would allow information regarding abortion.\n\nIn 1994, the Labour Party withdrew from government after a disagreement over the appointment of [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] [[Harry Whelehan]] as a Judge of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] and [[High Court (Ireland)|President of the High Court]]. However, no general election was called and, while it was hoped that the coalition could be revived under the new Fianna F\u00e1il leader [[Bertie Ahern]], the arithmetic of the D\u00e1il now allowed the Labour Party to open discussions with other opposition parties. After negotiations a [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]] came to power involving Fine Gael, Labour and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]]. In [[John Bruton]]'s cabinet, he became [[Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government|Minister for the Environment]].\n\n===Leadership contender (1997)===\nFollowing the [[1997 Irish general election|1997 general election]], a Fianna F\u00e1il-[[Progressive Democrats]] coalition government came to power and the Labour Party returned to the opposition benches. In the announcement of the party's new front bench, Howlin retained responsibility for the Environment.\n\nIn late 1997, [[Dick Spring]] resigned as leader of the Labour Party and Howlin immediately threw his hat into the ring in the subsequent leadership election. In a choice between Howlin and [[Ruairi Quinn]], the former gained some early support; however, the leadership eventually went to Quinn by a significant majority. As a show of unity Howlin was later named deputy leader of the party and retained his brief as Spokesperson for the Environment and Local Government.\n\n===Leadership contender (2002)===\nIn 2002, following Quinn's resignation as party leader after Labour's relatively unsuccessful [[2002 Irish general election|2002 general election campaign]], Howlin again stood for the party leadership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2002/09/11/story823047586.asp|title=Howlin throws hat into Labour leadership ring|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=11 September 2002|accessdate=9 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> For the second time in five years Howlin was defeated for the leadership of the party, this time by [[Pat Rabbitte]], who was formerly a leading figure in Democratic Left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/victorious-rabbitte-aims-to-increase-partys-appeal-290699.html|title=Victorious Rabbitte aims to increase party's appeal|author=Senan Molony|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=26 October 2002|accessdate=9 January 2007}}</ref> Howlin was succeeded as deputy leader by [[Liz McManus]].\n\nWhile having been publicly supportive of Rabbitte's leadership, he was perceived as being the leader of the wing of the party which was sceptical of Rabbitte's policy with regard to future coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il. Rabbitte explicitly ruled out any future coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il, instead forming a formal alliance with Fine Gael in the run-up to the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 general election]] (the so-called ''Mullingar Accord'').\n\n===Leas-Cheann Comhairle (2007\u20132011)===\nOn 26 June 2007, Howlin was appointed the [[Ceann Comhairle#Leas-Cheann Comhairle|Leas-Cheann Comhairle]] (Deputy chairman) of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.<ref name=oireachtas_db/>\n\n===Cabinet minister (2011\u20132016)===\n[[File:Irish Cabinet 2013.jpg|thumb|Howlin (front left) in 2013.]]\nAfter [[2011 Irish general election|the 2011 general election]], Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a government, Howlin was appointed to the new office of [[Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform]]. In May 2011, he said that over the next 20 years the number of people in Ireland over 65 is set to increase by almost half a million, a situation that could see the annual health budget soar \u2013 rising by \u20ac12.5 billion in the next decade alone. While reform was a major part of government attempts \"to regain full sovereignty over economic policy\", Howlin told a meeting of the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies they would in any event face key \"imperatives\" in coming years. He said a new public spending review, on which he had briefed the cabinet in recent days, would not be a simple assessment of where to make cuts, but would also consider the way public sector services were delivered. Howlin reiterated the government's commitment not to cut public sector pay, \"if the ''[[Croke Park Agreement]]'' works\". \"These are just some of the challenges that our society is facing in the coming decade \u2013 crisis or no crisis. In the good times, tackling them was going to be difficult. Today, in these difficult times, tackling them is going to be imperative.\" Howlin said Ireland was facing a profound and complex economic crisis \"where we are fighting a battle on three fronts \u2013 mass unemployment, a major failure in banking, and a fiscal crisis\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0414/breaking71.html|title=Public service reform necessary \u2013 Howlin|first=Tim|last=O'Brien|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Analysis of budgets====\nBudgets 2012 to 2016 - introduced in part by Brendan Howlin as Minister for Public Expenditure and supported by Labour<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/public-finances/noonan-howlin-defend-budget-cuts-1.888404\n |title=Noonan, Howlin defend budget cuts \n |date=7 December 2011\n |author=Mary Minihan \n |accessdate=14 December 2017 \n}}</ref> - were described by the [[Economic and Social Research Institute|Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI)]] as \"regressive\".\n\nIt found \"Budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes: reductions of about 2 to 2\u00bd per cent for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of about \u00be of a per cent for those on the highest incomes\".\n\nBy contrast, the ESRI found earlier budgets in 2008-2010 to be \"strongly progressive\" because before 2011 \"Losses imposed by policy changes in tax and welfare have been greatest for those on the highest incomes, and smaller for those on low incomes\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esri.ie/pubs/QEC2011Win_SA_Callan.pdf |title=Distributional Impact of Tax, Welfare and Public Sector Pay Policies: 2009\u20102012  |date=24 February 2012 |author=Tim Callan, Claire Keane, Michael Savage and John R.

It was established in 2014, after it split from [[Doboj]] municipality. As of 2013, it has a population of 6,958 inhabitants, while the town of Stanari has a population of 1,015 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the basin of the [[Ukrina (river)|Ukrina river]] in the area of Krnjin and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with a minimum altitude of 138 m (Brestovo) and a maximum altitude of 343 m (Radnja Donja). The municipality of Stanari has three hilly peaks with an altitude of more than 300 m, located on three different sides of the territorial unit of the municipality of Stanari. \n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska on coordinates of eastern longitude 17\u00b049\u203246\u2033 and 44\u00b044\u203250\u2033 north latitude and borders the city of Doboj, and the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Tesli\u0107 and Te\u0161anj. The Municipality of Stanari is one of the smaller municipalities of Republika Srpska, with an area of 160.96 km2. The area of the territory of the Municipality of Stanari makes 0,643% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Stanari belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20130.7 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 30.9 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Stanari is 1.570 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The formation of the Stanari Municipality ===\nThe municipality of Stanari existed and functioned until 1959, when in one of the numerous reorganizations it was abolished and annexed to the municipality of Doboj. The population of this area quickly realized the wrongdoing, because already in 1965 the Municipality, becoming a unit of measure in the planning documents, resolved vital life problems much faster (for example, in 1965 the People's Loan solved the paving of roads at the headquarters of each municipality), and even then launched an activity to rebuild Stanari Municipality.\n\nDue to a lack of understanding, on the one hand, and political obstruction, the initiative for the renewal of the Stanari municipality was not implemented in a few subsequent attempts (1969, 1976 and 1984), and the Initiative Committee for the Restoration of the Municipality of Stanari in 1991 froze the initiative itself, not wanting to question the broader national interests. In 1996, the issue of redevelopment of Stanari Municipality was raised again. At a session held in late December, the will of the residents to become a municipal center was once again confirmed.\n\nAccording to 1996 data, the municipality of Stanari comprised 17 settlements, covering an area of about 213 square kilometers, and according to the census, about 15,000 inhabitants lived in the area. Representatives wishing to break away from Doboj municipality said in the debate that they support the idea of safeguarding the general interest of Serbs in the Doboj area and that they are ready to wait for the right time to establish the municipality, and they also believe that this job is most suitable after the upcoming elections. The members of the Main Board unanimously approved the content of the Request sent to the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, which is to be passed by the Law on the Establishment of the Municipality of Stanari.\n\nResidents got the status of the municipality again in 2014, when the Law on Formation of the Municipality of Stanari was adopted, much to the delight of the residents of this area. The first mayor of the newly formed municipality, elected in February 2015, was Du\u0161an Pani\u0107, of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats.<ref>[http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/69264/Osnovana+op%C5%A1tina+Stanari.html]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 1991 census, all 13 settlements that today make up the municipality of Stanari belonged to Doboj municipality, with 11,238 residents. \n\nIn the 2013 census in Bosnia and Herzegovina, all 13 settlements, of which the municipality of Stanari was formed a year later, were within the City of Doboj, and according to the final data for the Republika Srpska issued by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Srpska, had a population 6,958 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|8,494\n|9,682\n|11,148\n|11,898\n|12,457\n|11,238\n|6,958\n|-\n|1\n|Brestovo\n|1,271\n|1,384\n|1,426\n|1,513\n|1,417\n|1,254\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Dragalovci\n|896\n|996\n|1,110\n|1,204\n|1,312\n|1,031\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Jelanjska\n|656\n|749\n|874\n|827\n|843\n|701\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Ljeb\n|338\n|394\n|442\n|442\n|506\n|446\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|427\n|476\n|506\n|511\n|491\n|441\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Osredak\n|481\n|555\n|603\n|707\n|730\n|605\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|153\n|377\n|453\n|509\n|510\n|495\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|835\n|763\n|924\n|1,024\n|1,120\n|1,130\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Radnja Donja\n|441\n|498\n|578\n|673\n|710\n|572\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|572\n|592\n|700\n|694\n|714\n|666\n|\n|-\n|11\n|'''Stanari'''\n|641\n|777\n|1,141\n|1,224\n|1,301\n|1,299\n|1,123\n|-\n|12\n|Cvrtkovci\n|622\n|769\n|915\n|998\n|945\n|897\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Cerovica\n|1,161\n|1,352\n|1,476\n|1,572\n|1,858\n|1,701\n|\n|}\n\n=== Ethnic composition ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Etnic composition \u2013 Stanari town\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|1,123 (100,0%)\n|1,299 (100,0%)\n|1,301 (100,0%)\n|1,224 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|1,204 (92,69%)\n|1,143 (87,86%)\n|1,176 (96,08%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|45 (3,464%)\n|89 (6,841%)\n|7 (0,572%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|29 (2,232%)\n|39 (2,998%)\n|15 (1,225%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|20 (1,540%)\n|13 (0,999%)\n|17 (1,389%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|1 (0,077%)\n|2 (0,154%)\n|3 (0,245%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|13 (0,999%)\n|6 (0,490%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|2 (0,154%)\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Etnic composition \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|-\n|Total\n|6,958 (100,0%)\n|11,238 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|9,606 (85,48%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|1,162 (10,34%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|250 (2,225%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|212 (1,886%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|8 (0,071%)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"7\" |Ethnic composition (1991.) \u2013 Stanari municipality by settlements\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|Serbs\n|Croats\n|Bosniaks\n|Yugoslavs\n|Others\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|9,606 (85.48 %)\n|1,162 (10.34 %)\n|8 (0.07 %)\n|250 (2.22 %)\n|212 (1.89 %)\n|-\n|1\n|Brestovo\n|1,192\n|2\n|0\n|13\n|47\n|-\n|2\n|Dragalovci\n|32\n|858\n|3\n|86\n|52\n|-\n|3\n|Jelanjska\n|682\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|16\n|-\n|4\n|Ljeb\n|426\n|0\n|0\n|9\n|11\n|-\n|5\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|424\n|1\n|0\n|6\n|10\n|-\n|6\n|Osredak\n|408\n|152\n|0\n|42\n|3\n|-\n|7\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|491\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|11\n|-\n|8\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|1,090\n|3\n|2\n|17\n|18\n|-\n|9\n|Radnja Donja\n|557\n|0\n|0\n|11\n|4\n|-\n|10\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|530\n|117\n|1\n|10\n|8\n|-\n|11\n|'''Stanari'''\n|1,204\n|20\n|1\n|45\n|29\n|-\n|12\n|Cvrtkovci\n|888\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|-\n|13\n|Cerovica\n|1,682\n|6\n|1\n|6\n|6\n|}\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n=== Nature ===\n'''Cerovi\u010dka Cave''', the cave in Cerovica, also called the Vukovi\u0107 cave among the locals, is a cave located on one of the long hill lines that follows the terrain from east to west. The entrance to the cave was until the 1992-1995 war mostly buried, but the entrance was dug up for the purpose of hiding the population and the army. The cave consists of an entrance hall, which is partly covered with broken stones from the ceiling, while the other part is under cave sediments, mostly composed of clayey soil and small rocks formed by the calcification process. The cave is wet throughout its entire surface due to dripping of water from the ceilings and a temperature that never exceeds 15 \u00b0C.\n\n'''Rivers and streams''', the largest river that flows through the territory of the municipality of Stanari is Ukrina. Beside it, the water network is also composed of the rivers Ilova, Radnja and Ostru\u017enja and numerous streams, which all have places suitable for picnics and camping in pristine nature next to old watermills, cold drinking springs, grasslands and forests. Along the streams of the Ukrina, Ostru\u017enja, Radnja can be found remains of abandoned watermills, of which only two on the river Radnja are functioning.The river Ukrina is especially interesting because it is largest rivers whose source and mouth are in the territory of Republika Srpska. Another curiosity related to this river is a special phenomenon when in mid-August, around the Transfiguration of the Lord, the river Ukrina \"blossoms.\" This phenomenon lasts for several days, and it involves the covering of the river surface by whitish membranes, that are released by the immature male insects ''Palingenia longicauda,'' which remain on the surface of the water and create an image of water covered with petals flowers.\n\n=== Archaeological Findings ===\n'''Gradina (Brestovo) fortress,''' a medieval fortress on a steep low rock above the right bank of the river Ukrina.

It was established in 2014, after it split from [[Doboj]] municipality. As of 2013, it has a population of 6,958 inhabitants, while the town of Stanari has a population of 1,015 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the basin of the [[Ukrina (river)|Ukrina river]] in the area of Krnjin and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with a minimum altitude of 138 m (Brestovo) and a maximum altitude of 343 m (Radnja Donja). The municipality of Stanari has three hilly peaks with an altitude of more than 300 m, located on three different sides of the territorial unit of the municipality of Stanari. \n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska on coordinates of eastern longitude 17\u00b049\u203246\u2033 and 44\u00b044\u203250\u2033 north latitude and borders the city of Doboj, and the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Tesli\u0107 and Te\u0161anj. The Municipality of Stanari is one of the smaller municipalities of Republika Srpska, with an area of 160.96 km2. The area of the territory of the Municipality of Stanari makes 0,643% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Stanari belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20130.7 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 30.9 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Stanari is 1.570 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The formation of the Stanari Municipality ===\nThe municipality of Stanari existed and functioned until 1959, when in one of the numerous reorganizations it was abolished and annexed to the municipality of Doboj. The population of this area quickly realized the wrongdoing, because already in 1965 the Municipality, becoming a unit of measure in the planning documents, resolved vital life problems much faster (for example, in 1965 the People's Loan solved the paving of roads at the headquarters of each municipality), and even then launched an activity to rebuild Stanari Municipality.\n\nDue to a lack of understanding, on the one hand, and political obstruction, the initiative for the renewal of the Stanari municipality was not implemented in a few subsequent attempts (1969, 1976 and 1984), and the Initiative Committee for the Restoration of the Municipality of Stanari in 1991 froze the initiative itself, not wanting to question the broader national interests. In 1996, the issue of redevelopment of Stanari Municipality was raised again. At a session held in late December, the will of the residents to become a municipal center was once again confirmed.\n\nAccording to 1996 data, the municipality of Stanari comprised 17 settlements, covering an area of about 213 square kilometers, and according to the census, about 15,000 inhabitants lived in the area. Representatives wishing to break away from Doboj municipality said in the debate that they support the idea of safeguarding the general interest of Serbs in the Doboj area and that they are ready to wait for the right time to establish the municipality, and they also believe that this job is most suitable after the upcoming elections. The members of the Main Board unanimously approved the content of the Request sent to the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, which is to be passed by the Law on the Establishment of the Municipality of Stanari.\n\nResidents got the status of the municipality again in 2014, when the Law on Formation of the Municipality of Stanari was adopted, much to the delight of the residents of this area. The first mayor of the newly formed municipality, elected in February 2015, was Du\u0161an Pani\u0107, of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats.<ref>[http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/69264/Osnovana+op%C5%A1tina+Stanari.html]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 1991 census, all 13 settlements that today make up the municipality of Stanari belonged to Doboj municipality, with 11,238 residents. \n\nIn the 2013 census in Bosnia and Herzegovina, all 13 settlements, of which the municipality of Stanari was formed a year later, were within the City of Doboj, and according to the final data for the Republika Srpska issued by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Srpska, had a population 6,958 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|8,494\n|9,682\n|11,148\n|11,898\n|12,457\n|11,238\n|6,958\n|-\n|1\n|Brestovo\n|1,271\n|1,384\n|1,426\n|1,513\n|1,417\n|1,254\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Dragalovci\n|896\n|996\n|1,110\n|1,204\n|1,312\n|1,031\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Jelanjska\n|656\n|749\n|874\n|827\n|843\n|701\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Ljeb\n|338\n|394\n|442\n|442\n|506\n|446\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|427\n|476\n|506\n|511\n|491\n|441\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Osredak\n|481\n|555\n|603\n|707\n|730\n|605\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|153\n|377\n|453\n|509\n|510\n|495\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|835\n|763\n|924\n|1,024\n|1,120\n|1,130\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Radnja Donja\n|441\n|498\n|578\n|673\n|710\n|572\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|572\n|592\n|700\n|694\n|714\n|666\n|\n|-\n|11\n|'''Stanari'''\n|641\n|777\n|1,141\n|1,224\n|1,301\n|1,299\n|1,015\n|-\n|12\n|Cvrtkovci\n|622\n|769\n|915\n|998\n|945\n|897\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Cerovica\n|1,161\n|1,352\n|1,476\n|1,572\n|1,858\n|1,701\n|\n|}\n\n=== Ethnic composition ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"7\" |Ethnic composition 1991. \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|Serbs\n|Croats\n|Bosniaks\n|Yugoslavs\n|Others\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|9,606 (85.48 %)\n|1,162 (10.34 %)\n|8 (0.07 %)\n|250 (2.22 %)\n|212 (1.89 %)\n|-\n|1\n|Brestovo\n|1,192\n|2\n|0\n|13\n|47\n|-\n|2\n|Dragalovci\n|32\n|858\n|3\n|86\n|52\n|-\n|3\n|Jelanjska\n|682\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|16\n|-\n|4\n|Ljeb\n|426\n|0\n|0\n|9\n|11\n|-\n|5\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|424\n|1\n|0\n|6\n|10\n|-\n|6\n|Osredak\n|408\n|152\n|0\n|42\n|3\n|-\n|7\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|491\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|11\n|-\n|8\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|1,090\n|3\n|2\n|17\n|18\n|-\n|9\n|Radnja Donja\n|557\n|0\n|0\n|11\n|4\n|-\n|10\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|530\n|117\n|1\n|10\n|8\n|-\n|11\n|'''Stanari'''\n|1,204\n|20\n|1\n|45\n|29\n|-\n|12\n|Cvrtkovci\n|888\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|-\n|13\n|Cerovica\n|1,682\n|6\n|1\n|6\n|6\n|}\n== Tourism ==\n\n=== Nature ===\n'''Cerovi\u010dka Cave''', the cave in Cerovica, also called the Vukovi\u0107 cave among the locals, is a cave located on one of the long hill lines that follows the terrain from east to west. The entrance to the cave was until the 1992-1995 war mostly buried, but the entrance was dug up for the purpose of hiding the population and the army. The cave consists of an entrance hall, which is partly covered with broken stones from the ceiling, while the other part is under cave sediments, mostly composed of clayey soil and small rocks formed by the calcification process. The cave is wet throughout its entire surface due to dripping of water from the ceilings and a temperature that never exceeds 15 \u00b0C.\n\n'''Rivers and streams''', the largest river that flows through the territory of the municipality of Stanari is Ukrina. Beside it, the water network is also composed of the rivers Ilova, Radnja and Ostru\u017enja and numerous streams, which all have places suitable for picnics and camping in pristine nature next to old watermills, cold drinking springs, grasslands and forests. Along the streams of the Ukrina, Ostru\u017enja, Radnja can be found remains of abandoned watermills, of which only two on the river Radnja are functioning.The river Ukrina is especially interesting because it is largest rivers whose source and mouth are in the territory of Republika Srpska. Another curiosity related to this river is a special phenomenon when in mid-August, around the Transfiguration of the Lord, the river Ukrina \"blossoms.\" This phenomenon lasts for several days, and it involves the covering of the river surface by whitish membranes, that are released by the immature male insects ''Palingenia longicauda,'' which remain on the surface of the water and create an image of water covered with petals flowers.\n\n=== Archaeological Findings ===\n'''Gradina (Brestovo) fortress,''' a medieval fortress on a steep low rock above the right bank of the river Ukrina. This horseshoe-shaped structure is about 23m in length and 13m in width. It consists of a round tower and a square enclosure. The outer walls are 2 m thick. Inside the building is a preserved cultural layer rich in fragments of earthen vessels that can be, at least in the upper layer, dated back to the 15th century.\n\n'''Ste\u0107ci,''' in the area of Stanari there are many sites with ste\u0107aks dating back to the Middle Ages, the most famous of which are the Greek cemeteries in Brestovo and Osredak. In addition to this, the sites from the prehistory which stand out are: Gypsy village in Brestovo, a prehistoric settlement above the Ukrine valley, where there were found remains of pottery from the Late Bronze or Iron Age, and the Mati\u0107a Head, a Paleolithic station in Dragalovci.\n\n=== Museum \"Gojakovac\" Cerovica ===\nThe Local Museum in Cerovica was founded by the Cerovica Parish led by priest Miroslav \u017divkovi\u0107. Through years of effort, collecting material traces of cultural heritage of Cerovic region, and help and support from locals and expert associates, a permanent exhibition was made in the museum on May 2014.

The properties of Sudoku puzzles and their solutions can be investigated using [[mathematics]] and [[Sudoku solving algorithms|algorithms]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe analysis of Sudoku falls into two main areas: analyzing the properties of (1) completed grids and (2) puzzles. Also studied are [[Sudoku solving algorithms|computer algorithms]] to solve Sudokus, and to develop (or search for) new Sudokus. Analysis has largely focused on enumerating solutions, with results first appearing in 2004.<ref>{{citation|last=Lin|first=Keh Ying|title=Number of Sudokus|journal= Journal of Recreational Mathematics|volume=33|issue=2|year=2004|pages=120\u201324}}.</ref> There are many [[Sudokian|Sudoku variants]], partially characterized by size (''N''), and the shape of their ''regions''. Unless noted, discussion in this article assumes classic Sudoku, i.e. ''N''=9 (a 9\u00d79 grid and 3\u00d73 regions). A rectangular Sudoku uses rectangular regions of row-column dimension ''R''\u00d7''C''. Other variants include those with irregularly-shaped regions or with additional constraints ([[#Sudoku with additional constraints|hypercube]]) or different constraint types ([[#Sum number place (\"Killer Sudoku\")|Samunamupure]]).\n\nA ''puzzle'' is a partially completed ''grid'', and the initial values are ''givens'' or ''clues''. ''Regions'' are also called ''blocks'' or ''boxes''. Horizontally adjacent ''rows'' are a ''band'', and vertically adjacent ''columns'' are a ''stack''. A ''proper'' puzzle has a unique solution.

''A Guide to Graph Colouring: Algorithms and Applications''. Springer International Publishers, 2015.</ref> The aim is to construct a 9-coloring of a particular graph, given a partial 9-coloring. The [[Sudoku graph]] has 81 vertices, one vertex for each cell. The vertices are labeled with ordered pairs (''x'', ''y''), where ''x'' and ''y'' are integers between 1 and 9. In this case, two distinct vertices labeled by (''x'', ''y'') and (''x''\u2032, ''y''\u2032) are joined by an edge if and only if:\n* ''x'' = ''x''\u2032 (same column) or,\n* ''y'' = ''y''\u2032 (same row) or,\n* \u2308 ''x''/3 \u2309 = \u2308 ''x''\u2032/3 \u2309 and \u2308 ''y''/3 \u2309 = \u2308 ''y''\u2032/3 \u2309 (same 3\u00d73 cell)\nThe puzzle is then completed by assigning an integer between 1 and 9 to each vertex, in such a way that vertices that are joined by an edge do not have the same integer assigned to them.\n\nA Sudoku solution grid is also a [[Latin square]].<ref name=\"Lewis2015\" /> There are significantly fewer Sudoku grids than Latin squares because Sudoku imposes the additional regional constraint.  Nonetheless, the number of Sudoku grids was calculated by Bertram Felgenhauer and Frazer Jarvis in 2005 to be 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960<ref name=\"afj2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku|title=Sudoku enumeration problems |publisher=Afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> {{OEIS|id=A107739}}.

Namely, one has to take [[Subgroups|subgroup]]s and [[quotient group]]s into account:\n\nTake for example <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{n}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_{n}</math> the group of pairs, adding each component separately modulo some <math>n</math>.\nBy omitting one of the components, we suddenly find ourselves in <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{n}</math> (and this mapping is obviously compatible with the respective additions, i.e. it is a [[group homomorphism]]).\nOne also says that the latter is a [[quotient group]] of the former, because some once different elements become equal in the new group.\nHowever, it is also a [[subgroup]], because we can simply fill the missing component with <math>0</math> to get back to <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{n}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_{n}</math>.\n\nUnder this view, we write down the example, '''Grid 1''', for <math>n=3</math>.\n\nEach Sudoku region looks the same on the second component (namely like the subgroup <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>), because these are added regardless of the first one.\nOn the other hand, the first components are equal in each block, and if we imagine each block as one cell, these first components show the same pattern (namely the quotient group <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>). As outlined in the article of [[Latin square]]s, this is a Latin square of order <math>9</math>.\n\nNow, to yield a Sudoku, let us permute the rows (or equivalently the columns) in such a way, that each block is redistributed exactly once into each block \u2013 for example order them <math>1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9</math>.\nThis of course preserves the Latin square property. Furthermore, in each block the lines have distinct first component by construction\nand each line in a block has distinct entries via the second component, because the blocks' second components originally formed a Latin square of order <math>3</math> (from the subgroup <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>). Thus we arrive at a Sudoku (rename the pairs to numbers 1...9 if you wish). With the example and the row permutation above, we arrive at '''Grid 2'''.\n{| style=\"border-spacing: 10px;\n|-\n|{{Sudoku 9x9 grid|title='''Grid 1''' \u2013 The addition table in <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>|align=center|cellsize=24pt\n|s1=(0,0) |s2=(0,1) |s3=(0,2) |s4=(1,0) |s5=(1,1) |s6=(1,2) |s7=(2,0) |s8=(2,1) |s9=(2,2) \n|s10=(0,1)|s11=(0,2)|s12=(0,0)|s13=(1,1)|s14=(1,2)|s15=(1,0)|s16=(2,1)|s17=(2,2)|s18=(2,0)\n|s19=(0,2)|s20=(0,0)|s21=(0,1)|s22=(1,2)|s23=(1,0)|s24=(1,1)|s25=(2,2)|s26=(2,0)|s27=(2,1)\n|s28=(1,0)|s29=(1,1)|s30=(1,2)|s31=(2,0)|s32=(2,1)|s33=(2,2)|s34=(0,0)|s35=(0,1)|s36=(0,2)\n|s37=(1,1)|s38=(1,2)|s39=(1,0)|s40=(2,1)|s41=(2,2)|s42=(2,0)|s43=(0,1)|s44=(0,2)|s45=(0,0)\n|s46=(1,2)|s47=(1,0)|s48=(1,1)|s49=(2,2)|s50=(2,0)|s51=(2,1)|s52=(0,2)|s53=(0,0)|s54=(0,1)\n|s55=(2,0)|s56=(2,1)|s57=(2,2)|s58=(0,0)|s59=(0,1)|s60=(0,2)|s61=(1,0)|s62=(1,1)|s63=(1,2)\n|s64=(2,1)|s65=(2,2)|s66=(2,0)|s67=(0,1)|s68=(0,2)|s69=(0,0)|s70=(1,1)|s71=(1,2)|s72=(1,0)\n|s73=(2,2)|s74=(2,0)|s75=(2,1)|s76=(0,2)|s77=(0,0)|s78=(0,1)|s79=(1,2)|s80=(1,0)|s81=(1,1)\n|c55=yellow|c56=yellow|c57=yellow|c64=yellow|c65=yellow|c66=yellow\n|c73=yellow|c74=yellow|c75=yellow\n}}\n|{{Sudoku 9x9 grid|title='''Grid 2''' \u2013 Generating a Sudoku|align=center|cellsize=24pt\n|s1=(0,0) |s2=(0,1) |s3=(0,2) |s4=(1,0) |s5=(1,1) |s6=(1,2) |s7=(2,0) |s8=(2,1) |s9=(2,2) \n|s10=(1,0)|s11=(1,1)|s12=(1,2)|s13=(2,0)|s14=(2,1)|s15=(2,2)|s16=(0,0)|s17=(0,1)|s18=(0,2)\n|s19=(2,0)|s20=(2,1)|s21=(2,2)|s22=(0,0)|s23=(0,1)|s24=(0,2)|s25=(1,0)|s26=(1,1)|s27=(1,2)\n|s28=(0,1)|s29=(0,2)|s30=(0,0)|s31=(1,1)|s32=(1,2)|s33=(1,0)|s34=(2,1)|s35=(2,2)|s36=(2,0)\n|s37=(1,1)|s38=(1,2)|s39=(1,0)|s40=(2,1)|s41=(2,2)|s42=(2,0)|s43=(0,1)|s44=(0,2)|s45=(0,0)\n|s46=(2,1)|s47=(2,2)|s48=(2,0)|s49=(0,1)|s50=(0,2)|s51=(0,0)|s52=(1,1)|s53=(1,2)|s54=(1,0)\n|s55=(0,2)|s56=(0,0)|s57=(0,1)|s58=(1,2)|s59=(1,0) |s60=(1,1)|s61=(2,2)|s62=(2,0)|s63=(2,1)\n|s64=(1,2)|s65=(1,0)|s66=(1,1)|s67=(2,2)|s68=(2,0)|s69=(2,1)|s70=(0,2)|s71=(0,0)|s72=(0,1)\n|s73=(2,2)|s74=(2,0)|s75=(2,1)|s76=(0,2)|s77=(0,0)|s78=(0,1)|s79=(1,2)|s80=(1,0)|s81=(1,1)\n|c19=yellow|c20=yellow|c21=yellow|c46=yellow|c47=yellow|c48=yellow\n|c73=yellow|c74=yellow|c75=yellow\n}}\n|}\nFor this method to work, one generally does not need a product of two equally-sized groups. A so-called short [[exact sequence]] of finite groups\nof appropriate size already does the job. Try for example the group <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{4}</math> with quotient- and subgroup <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{2}</math>.\nIt seems clear (already from enumeration arguments), that not all Sudokus can be generated this way.\n\n==Enumerating Sudoku solutions==\nThe answer to the question 'How many Sudoku grids are there?' depends on the definition of when similar solutions are considered different.\n\n===Enumerating all possible Sudoku solutions===\nFor the enumeration of ''all'' possible solutions, two solutions are considered distinct if any of their corresponding (81) cell values differ. Symmetry relations between similar solutions are ignored., e.g. the rotations of a solution are considered distinct. Symmetries play a significant role in the enumeration strategy, but not in the count of ''all'' possible solutions.\n\nThe first known solution to complete enumeration was posted by QSCGZ [Guenter Stertenbrink] to the ''rec.puzzles'' [[newsgroup]] in 2003,<ref name=\"afj2\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.puzzles/A7pi7S12oFI |title=Google Discussiegroepen |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/6670903752021072936960-is-old-hat-t5871.html |title=6670903752021072936960 is old hat : General |publisher=Forum.enjoysudoku.com |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> obtaining 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 ({{val|6.67|e=21}}) distinct solutions.\n\nIn a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis<ref name=\"afjarvis\">{{citation|title=Enumerating possible Sudoku grids|first1=Bertram|last1=Felgenhauer|first2=Frazer|last2=Jarvis|date=20 June 2005|url=http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku/sudoku.pdf}}.</ref> analyzed the [[combinations and permutations|permutations]] of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] and [[equivalence class]]es for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each equivalence class. Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by class size, gives the total number of solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second enumeration technique based on band generation was later developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n\n==={{anchor|Transformations}}Enumerating essentially different Sudoku solutions===\n\nTwo valid grids are ''essentially'' the same if one can be derived from the other. The following operations are Sudoku preserving symmetries and always translate a valid grid into another valid grid:\n\n* Relabeling symbols (9!)\n* Band permutations (3!)\n* Row permutations within a band (3!<sup>3</sup>)\n* Stack permutations (3!)\n* Column permutations within a stack (3!<sup>3</sup>)\n* Reflection, transposition and rotation (2). (Given any transposition or quarter-turn rotation in conjunction with the above permutations, any combination of reflections, transpositions and rotations can be produced, so these operations only contribute a factor of 2.)\n\nThese operations define a symmetry relation between equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and with respect to the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a [[subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>81</sub>, of order 3!<sup>8</sup>\u00d72&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,359,232. Applying the above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!<sup>8</sup>\u00d72\u00d79! essentially equivalent grids. Exceptions are [[#Automorphic Sudokus|Automorphic Sudokus]] which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.\n\nThe number of distinct solutions can also be identified with [[Burnside's Lemma]]. For a solution, the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an [[Orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of the [[symmetric group]]. The number of essentially different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside ''fixed points'' are solutions that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell<ref name=\"sudgroup\" /> computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.\n\n==Enumeration results==\nEnumeration results for many Sudoku variants have been calculated: these are summarised below.\n\n===Sudoku with rectangular regions===\nIn the table, \"Dimensions\" are those of the regions (e.g. 3\u00d73 in normal Sudoku).

The usual constraints of no repeated value in any row, column or region apply. The clues are given as sums of values within regions (e.g. a 4-cell region with sum 10 must consist of values 1,2,3,4 in some order). The minimum number of clues for Samunampure is not known, nor even conjectured. A variant on Miyuki Misawa's web site<ref>[http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~sumnumberplace/79790008/] {{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> replaces sums with relations: the clues are symbols '''=''', '''<''' and '''>''' showing the relative values of (some but not all) adjacent region sums. She demonstrates an example with only eight relations. It is not known whether this is the best possible.\n\n==Maximum number of givens==\n[[File:The_first_discovered_minimal_9x9_Sudoku_puzzle_with_40_givens.png|thumb|200px|A minimal Sudoku with 40 clues.<ref name=\"maximum\">[http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/high-clue-tamagotchis-t30020-135.html http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/high-clue-tamagotchis] High clue tamagotchis (forum: pages 1\u201314; 40 clue minimal: page 10).</ref>]]\n\nThe most clues for a ''minimal'' Sudoku is believed to be 40, of which only two are known. If any clue is removed from either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). In the work to find these Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 minimal puzzles with 36 clues. About 2600 minimal Sudokus with 39 clues were also found.<ref name=\"maximum\"/>\n\nIf dropping the requirement for the uniqueness of the solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the ''uniqueness'' of the solution constraint still dominates over the ''minimality'' constraint.<ref>[http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/high-clue-tamagotchis-t30020.html http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/high-clue-tamagotchis] High clue tamagotchis (forum: p. 5).</ref>\n\nAs for the ''most'' clues possible in a Sudoku while still ''not'' rendering a unique solution, it is four short of a full grid (77). If two instances of two numbers each are missing and the cells they are to occupy are the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, there are two ways the last digits can be added (two solutions).\n\n==Constraints of clue geometry==\n{| style=\"border-spacing: 20px;\n|-\n|[[Image:Mask of non legal sudoku.svg|thumb|200px|none|A range of clue positions insufficient for a proper Sudoku.]]\n|[[Image:Sudoku Puzzle with large rectangular hole.svg|thumb|200px|none|Sudoku with a 30 cell (5 x 6) empty rectangle.

One example of a grid which is automorphic would be a grid which can be rotated 180 degrees resulting in a new grid where the new cell values are a permutation of the original grid.

Expressed another way, these Sudokus have the property that every 180-degree rotational pair of clues (a, b) follows the rule (a) + (b) = 10.\n\nSince these Sudokus are automorphic, so too their solutions grids are automorphic.  Furthermore, every cell which is solved has a symmetrical partner which is solved with the same technique (and the pair would take the form a + b = 10). Notice that in the second example, the Sudouku also exhibits [[Translational symmetry|translational]] (or repetition) symmetry; clues are clustered in groups, with the clues in each group ordered sequentially (i.e., n, n+1, n+2, and n+3).\n\nThe third image is the ''Most Canonical'' solution grid.<ref>[http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/Canonical_Form.html http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/Canonical_Form] \"Canonical Form\".</ref> This grid has 648 automorphisms and contributes to all ~{{val|6.67|e=21}} solution grids by factor of 1/648 compared to any non-automorphic grid.\n\nIn these examples the automorphisms are easy to identify, but in general automorphism is not always obvious.

The strategy begins by analyzing the [[combinations and permutations|permutations]] of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] and [[equivalence class]] for the partial solutions are identified, the completions of the lower two bands are constructed and counted for each equivalence class.\n\n===Counting the top band permutations===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n| style=\"width: 20px;\" | 1 \n| style=\"width: 20px;\" | 2 \n| style=\"width: 20px;\" | 3\n|-\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n|-\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|}\nThe Band1 algorithm proceeds as follows:\n* Choose a canonical labeling of the digits by assigning values for B1 (see grid), and compute the rest of the Band1 permutations relative B1.\n* Compute the permutations of B2 by [[Partition of a set|partitioning]] the B1 cell values over the B2 row [[#Definition of terms and labels|triplets]].

Counting the permutations for B2 is more complicated, because the choices for B2 depend on the values in B1. (This is a visual representation of the expression given above.) The conditional calculation needs a branch (sub-calculation) for each alternative. Fortunately, there are just 4 cases for the top B2 triplet (r21): it contains either 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the digits from the B1 middle row triplet(r12). Once this B2 top row choice is made, the rest of the B2 combinations are fixed. The Band1 row triplet labels are shown on the right.\n\n(Note: Conditional combinations becomes an increasingly difficult as the computation progresses through the grid.

Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill in the number of B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left.

However,\nsince some of the values were paired relative to their origin, using the raw option counts would overcount the number of permutations, due to interchangeability within the pairing. The option counts need to be divided by the permuted size of their grouping (2), here 2!.= 2 (See [[Combinations|n Choose k]]) The pair in each row cancels the 2s for the B2 option counts, leaving a B2 contribution of 3<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6<sup>3</sup>.

A [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetry]] is an operation that preserves a quality of an object. For a Sudoku grid, a symmetry is a transformation whose result is also a valid grid. The following symmetries apply independently for the top band:\n* Block B1 values may be relabeled, giving 9! permutations\n* Blocks B1..3 may be interchanged, with 3!=6 permutations\n* Rows 1..3 may be interchanged, with 3!=6 permutations\n* Within each block, the 3 columns may be interchanged, giving 3!<sup>3</sup> = 6<sup>3</sup> permutations.\nCombined, the symmetries give 9! \u00d7 6<sup>5</sup> = 362880 \u00d7 7776 equivalent permutations for each Band1 solution.\n\nA symmetry defines an [[equivalence relation]], here, between the solutions, and [[Partition of a set|partitions]] the solutions into a set of [[equivalence class]]es. The Band1 row, column and block symmetries divide the 56*6^6 permutations into (not less than) 336 (56\u00d76) equivalence classes with (up to) 6<sup>5</sup> permutations in each, and 9! relabeling permutations for each class. (''Min/Max'' caveats apply since some permutations may not yield distinct elements due to relabeling.)\n\nSince the solution for any member of an equivalence class can be generated from the solution of any other member, we only need to enumerate the solutions for a single member in order to enumerate all solutions over all classes. Let\n* sb : be a valid permutation of the top band\n* Sb = [sb] : be an equivalence class, relative to sb and some [[equivalence relation]]\n* Sb.z = |Sb| : the size of Sb, be the number of sb elements (permutations) in [sb]\n* Sb.n : be the number of Band2,3 completions for (any) sb in Sb\n* {Sb} : be the set of all Sb equivalence classes relative to the [[equivalence relation]]\n* {Sb}.z = |{Sb}| : be the number of equivalence classes\n\nThe total number of solutions ''N'' is then:\n:<math>N = \\sum_{\\{Sb\\}} \\mbox{Sb.z} \\times \\mbox{Sb.n}</math>\n\n====Solution and counting permutation symmetry====\nThe Band1 symmetries (above) are ''solution permutation symmetries'' defined so that a permuted solution is also a solution. For the purpose of enumerating solutions, a ''counting symmetry'' for grid completion can be used to define band equivalence classes that yield a minimal number of classes.\n\n''Counting symmetry'' partitions valid Band1 permutations into classes that place the same completion constraints on lower bands; all members of a band ''counting symmetry'' equivalence class must have the same number of grid completions since the completion constraints are equivalent. Counting symmetry constraints are identified by the Band1 column triplets (a column value set, no implied element order).

Begin with a valid band configuration (1). Build column triplets by ordering the column values within each column. This is not a valid Sudoku band, but does place the same constraints on the lower bands as the example (2). Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column and box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column and box ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID will have the same number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this process can be used to build the largest possible ''band counting symmetry'' equivalence classes (3).\n\nNote, while column triplets are used to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the ''One Rule'' solution requirements. ''Counting symmetry'' is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). ''Solution symmetry'' for preserving solutions can be applied to either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, ''counting symmetry'' is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same ''counting symmetry'' equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.\n\n====Band 1 reduction details====\nSymmetries group similar object into [[equivalence class]]es. Two numbers need to be distinguished for equivalence classes, and band symmetries as used here, a third:\n* the number of equivalence classes ({Sb}.n).\n* the [[cardinality]], size or number of elements in an equivalence class, which may vary by class (Sb.z)\n* the number of Band2,3 completions compatible with a member of a Band1 equivalence class (Sb.n)\n\nThe Band1 (6<sup>5</sup>) symmetries divide the (56\u00d76<sup>6</sup>) Band1 valid permutations into (not less than) 336 (56\u00d76) equivalence classes with (up to) 6^5 permutations each.\nThe ''not less than'' and ''up to'' caveats are necessary, since some combinations of the transformations may not produce distinct results, when relabeling is required (see below). Consequently, some equivalence classes may contain less than 6<sup>5</sup> distinct permutations and the theoretical minimum number of classes may not be achieved.\n\nEach of the valid Band1 permutations can be expanded (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By virtue of their similarity, each member of an equivalence class will have the same number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions by the size of the equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.\n\nFelgenhauer/Jarvis<ref name=\"afjarvis\" /> catalogued the Band1 permutations using [[lexicographical order]]ed IDs based on the ordered digits from blocks B2,3. Block 1 uses a canonical digit assignment and is not needed for a unique ID. Equivalence class identification and linkage uses the lowest ID within the class.\n\nApplication of the (2\u00d76<sup>2</sup>) B2,3 symmetry permutations produces 36288 (28\u00d76<sup>4</sup>) equivalence classes, each of size 72. Since the size is fixed, the computation only needs to find the 36288 equivalence class IDs. (Note: in this case,\nfor any Band1 permutation, applying these permutations to achieve the lowest ID provides an index to the associated equivalence class.)\n\nApplication of the rest of the block, column and row symmetries provided further reduction, i.e. allocation of the 36288 IDs into fewer, larger equivalence classes.\nWhen the B1 canonical labeling is lost through a transformation, the result is relabeled to the canonical B1 usage and then catalogued under this ID. This approach generated 416 equivalence classes, somewhat less effective than the theoretical 336 minimum limit for a full reduction. Application of ''counting symmetry'' patterns for ''duplicate paired'' digits achieved reduction to 174 and then to 71 equivalence classes. The introduction of equivalence classes based on ''band counting symmetry'' (subsequent to Felgenhauer/Jarvis by Russell<ref name=\"ed44\" />) reduced the equivalence classes to a minimum generating set of 44.\n\nThe diversity of the ~{{val|2.6|e=6}}, 56\u00d76<sup>6</sup> Band1 permutations can be reduced to a set of 44 Band1 equivalence classes. Each of the 44 equivalence classes can be expanded to millions of distinct full solutions, but the entire solution space has a common origin in these 44. The 44 equivalence classes play a central role in other enumeration approaches as well, and speculation will return to the characteristics of the 44 classes when puzzle properties are explored later.\n\n===Band 2\u20133 completion and results===\nEnumerating the Sudoku solutions breaks into an initial setup stage and then into two nested loops. Initially all the valid Band1 permutations are grouped into equivalence classes, who each impose a common constraint on the Band2,3 completions.\nFor each of the Band1 equivalence classes, all possible Band2,3 solutions need to be enumerated. An outer Band1 loop iterates over the 44 equivalence classes. In the inner loop, all lower band completions for each of the Band1 equivalence class are found and counted.\n\nThe computation required for the lower band solution search can be minimised by the same type of symmetry application used for Band1. There are 6! (720) permutations for the 6 values in column 1 of Band2,3. Applying the lower band (2) and row within band (6\u00d76) permutations creates 10 equivalence classes of size 72. At this point, completing 10 sets of solutions for the remaining 48 cells with a recursive descent, [[backtracking]] algorithm is feasible with 2&nbsp;GHz class PC so further simplification is not required to carry out the enumeration. Using this approach, the number of ways of filling in a blank Sudoku grid has been shown to be 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 ({{val|6.67|e=21}}).<ref name=\"afjarvis\"/>\n\nThe result, as confirmed by Russell,<ref name=\"ed44\" /> also contains the distribution of solution counts for the 44 equivalence classes. The listed values are before application of the 9! factor for labeling and the two 72 factors (72<sup>2</sup> = 5184) for each of Stack 2,3 and Band2,3 permutations. The number of completions for each class is consistently on the order of 100,000,000, while the number of Band1 permutations covered by each class however varies from 4 \u2013 3240. Within this wide size range, there are clearly two clusters. Ranked by size, the lower 33 classes average ~400 permutations/class, while the upper 11 average ~2100. The disparity in consistency between the distributions for size and number of completions or the separation into two clusters by size is yet to be examined.\n\n==Variants==\nSudoku regions are [[polyominoes]].  Although the classic 9\u00d79 Sudoku is made of square [[nonominoes]], it is possible to apply the rules of Sudoku to puzzles of other sizes \u2013 the 2\u00d72 and 4\u00d74 square puzzles, for example.  Only ''N''<sup>2</sup>\u00d7''N''<sup>2</sup> Sudoku puzzles can be tiled with square polyominoes. Another popular variant is made of rectangular regions \u2013 for example, 2\u00d73 [[hexominoes]] tiled in a 6\u00d76 grid.  The following notation is used for discussing this variant.\n* ''R''\u00d7''C'' denotes a rectangular region with ''R'' rows and ''C'' columns.\n* The implied grid configuration has:\n** ''C'' blocks per band,\n**  ''R'' blocks per stack,\n**  ''C''\u00d7''R'' bands\u00d7stacks,\n** an arrangement of ''C''\u00d7''R'' regions, and\n** grid dimensions ''N''\u00d7''N'', where ''N'' = ''R''\u00d7''C''.\n\nPuzzles of size ''N''\u00d7''N'', where ''N'' is prime can only be tiled with irregular ''N''-ominoes.  Each ''N''\u00d7''N'' grid can be tiled multiple ways with ''N''-ominoes.  Before enumerating the number of solutions to a Sudoku grid of size ''N''\u00d7''N'', it is necessary to determine how many ''N''-omino tilings exist for a given size (including the standard square tilings, as well as the rectangular tilings).\n\nThe size ordering of Sudoku puzzle can be used to define an integer series, e.g. for square Sudoku, the integer series of possible solutions {{OEIS|id=A107739}}. Sudoku with square ''N''\u00d7''N'' regions are more symmetrical than immediately obvious from the ''One Rule''. Each row and column intersects ''N'' regions and shares ''N'' cells with each. The number of bands and stacks also equals ''N''. Rectangular Sudoku do not have these properties. The \"3\u00d73\" Sudoku is additionally unique: ''N'' is also the number of row-column-region constraints from the ''One Rule'' (i.e. there are ''N''=3 types of ''units'').

The properties of Sudoku puzzles and their solutions can be investigated using [[mathematics]] and [[Sudoku solving algorithms|algorithms]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe analysis of Sudoku falls into two main areas: analyzing the properties of (1) completed grids and (2) puzzles. Also studied are [[Sudoku solving algorithms|computer algorithms]] to solve Sudokus, and to develop (or search for) new Sudokus. Analysis has largely focused on enumerating solutions, with results first appearing in 2004.<ref>{{citation|last=Lin|first=Keh Ying|title=Number of Sudokus|journal= Journal of Recreational Mathematics|volume=33|issue=2|year=2004|pages=120\u201324}}.</ref> There are many [[Sudokian|Sudoku variants]], partially characterized by size (''N''), and the shape of their ''regions''. Unless noted, discussion in this article assumes classic Sudoku, i.e. ''N''=9 (a 9\u00d79 grid and 3\u00d73 regions). A rectangular Sudoku uses rectangular regions of row-column dimension ''R''\u00d7''C''. Other variants include those with irregularly-shaped regions or with additional constraints ([[#Sudoku with additional constraints|hypercube]]) or different constraint types ([[#Sum number place (\"Killer Sudoku\")|Samunamupure]]).\n\nA ''puzzle'' is a partially completed ''grid'', and the initial values are ''givens'' or ''clues''. ''Regions'' are also called ''blocks'' or ''boxes''. Horizontally adjacent ''rows'' are a ''band'', and vertically adjacent ''columns'' are a ''stack''. A ''proper'' puzzle has a unique solution.

''A Guide to Graph Colouring: Algorithms and Applications''. Springer International Publishers, 2015.</ref> The aim is to construct a 9-coloring of a particular graph, given a partial 9-coloring. The [[Sudoku graph]] has 81 vertices, one vertex for each cell. The vertices are labeled with ordered pairs (''x'', ''y''), where ''x'' and ''y'' are integers between 1 and 9. In this case, two distinct vertices labeled by (''x'', ''y'') and (''x''\u2032, ''y''\u2032) are joined by an edge if and only if:\n* ''x'' = ''x''\u2032 (same column) or,\n* ''y'' = ''y''\u2032 (same row) or,\n* \u2308 ''x''/3 \u2309 = \u2308 ''x''\u2032/3 \u2309 and \u2308 ''y''/3 \u2309 = \u2308 ''y''\u2032/3 \u2309 (same 3\u00d73 cell)\nThe puzzle is then completed by assigning an integer between 1 and 9 to each vertex, in such a way that vertices that are joined by an edge do not have the same integer assigned to them.\n\nA Sudoku solution grid is also a [[Latin square]].<ref name=\"Lewis2015\" /> There are significantly fewer Sudoku grids than Latin squares because Sudoku imposes the additional regional constraint.  Nonetheless, the number of Sudoku grids was calculated by Bertram Felgenhauer and Frazer Jarvis in 2005 to be 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960<ref name=\"afj2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku|title=Sudoku enumeration problems |publisher=Afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> {{OEIS|id=A107739}}. The number computed by Felgenhauer and Jarvis confirmed a result first identified in a [[Usenet]] discussion forum post of September 2003 by someone using the nickname \"QSCGZ\".<ref name=\"afj2\"/> This number is equal to 9! \u00d7 72<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 2<sup>7</sup> \u00d7 27,704,267,971, the last factor of which is [[prime number|prime]].  The result was derived through logic and [[brute force search|brute force]] [[computation]].  Russell and Jarvis also showed that when symmetries were taken into account, there were 5,472,730,538 solutions<ref name=\"sudgroup\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku/sudgroup.html |title=Sudoku enumeration: the symmetry group |publisher=Afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk |date=7 September 2005|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> {{OEIS|id=A109741}}. The number of grids for 16\u00d716 Sudoku is not known.\n\nThe number of minimal Sudokus (Sudokus in which no clue can be deleted without losing uniqueness of the solution) is not precisely known.

Namely, one has to take [[Subgroups|subgroup]]s and [[quotient group]]s into account:\n\nTake for example <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{n}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_{n}</math> the group of pairs, adding each component separately modulo some <math>n</math>.\nBy omitting one of the components, we suddenly find ourselves in <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{n}</math> (and this mapping is obviously compatible with the respective additions, i.e. it is a [[group homomorphism]]).\nOne also says that the latter is a [[quotient group]] of the former, because some once different elements become equal in the new group.\nHowever, it is also a [[subgroup]], because we can simply fill the missing component with <math>0</math> to get back to <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{n}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_{n}</math>.\n\nUnder this view, we write down the example, '''Grid 1''', for <math>n=3</math>.\n\nEach Sudoku region looks the same on the second component (namely like the subgroup <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>), because these are added regardless of the first one.\nOn the other hand, the first components are equal in each block, and if we imagine each block as one cell, these first components show the same pattern (namely the quotient group <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>). As outlined in the article of [[Latin square]]s, this is a Latin square of order <math>9</math>.\n\nNow, to yield a Sudoku, let us permute the rows (or equivalently the columns) in such a way, that each block is redistributed exactly once into each block \u2013 for example order them <math>1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9</math>.\nThis of course preserves the Latin square property. Furthermore, in each block the lines have distinct first component by construction\nand each line in a block has distinct entries via the second component, because the blocks' second components originally formed a Latin square of order <math>3</math> (from the subgroup <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>). Thus we arrive at a Sudoku (rename the pairs to numbers 1...9 if you wish). With the example and the row permutation above, we arrive at '''Grid 2'''.\n{| style=\"border-spacing: 10px;\n|-\n|{{Sudoku 9x9 grid|title='''Grid 1''' \u2013 The addition table in <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{3}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_{3}</math>|align=center|cellsize=24pt\n|s1=(0,0) |s2=(0,1) |s3=(0,2) |s4=(1,0) |s5=(1,1) |s6=(1,2) |s7=(2,0) |s8=(2,1) |s9=(2,2) \n|s10=(0,1)|s11=(0,2)|s12=(0,0)|s13=(1,1)|s14=(1,2)|s15=(1,0)|s16=(2,1)|s17=(2,2)|s18=(2,0)\n|s19=(0,2)|s20=(0,0)|s21=(0,1)|s22=(1,2)|s23=(1,0)|s24=(1,1)|s25=(2,2)|s26=(2,0)|s27=(2,1)\n|s28=(1,0)|s29=(1,1)|s30=(1,2)|s31=(2,0)|s32=(2,1)|s33=(2,2)|s34=(0,0)|s35=(0,1)|s36=(0,2)\n|s37=(1,1)|s38=(1,2)|s39=(1,0)|s40=(2,1)|s41=(2,2)|s42=(2,0)|s43=(0,1)|s44=(0,2)|s45=(0,0)\n|s46=(1,2)|s47=(1,0)|s48=(1,1)|s49=(2,2)|s50=(2,0)|s51=(2,1)|s52=(0,2)|s53=(0,0)|s54=(0,1)\n|s55=(2,0)|s56=(2,1)|s57=(2,2)|s58=(0,0)|s59=(0,1)|s60=(0,2)|s61=(1,0)|s62=(1,1)|s63=(1,2)\n|s64=(2,1)|s65=(2,2)|s66=(2,0)|s67=(0,1)|s68=(0,2)|s69=(0,0)|s70=(1,1)|s71=(1,2)|s72=(1,0)\n|s73=(2,2)|s74=(2,0)|s75=(2,1)|s76=(0,2)|s77=(0,0)|s78=(0,1)|s79=(1,2)|s80=(1,0)|s81=(1,1)\n|c55=yellow|c56=yellow|c57=yellow|c64=yellow|c65=yellow|c66=yellow\n|c73=yellow|c74=yellow|c75=yellow\n}}\n|{{Sudoku 9x9 grid|title='''Grid 2''' \u2013 Generating a Sudoku|align=center|cellsize=24pt\n|s1=(0,0) |s2=(0,1) |s3=(0,2) |s4=(1,0) |s5=(1,1) |s6=(1,2) |s7=(2,0) |s8=(2,1) |s9=(2,2) \n|s10=(1,0)|s11=(1,1)|s12=(1,2)|s13=(2,0)|s14=(2,1)|s15=(2,2)|s16=(0,0)|s17=(0,1)|s18=(0,2)\n|s19=(2,0)|s20=(2,1)|s21=(2,2)|s22=(0,0)|s23=(0,1)|s24=(0,2)|s25=(1,0)|s26=(1,1)|s27=(1,2)\n|s28=(0,1)|s29=(0,2)|s30=(0,0)|s31=(1,1)|s32=(1,2)|s33=(1,0)|s34=(2,1)|s35=(2,2)|s36=(2,0)\n|s37=(1,1)|s38=(1,2)|s39=(1,0)|s40=(2,1)|s41=(2,2)|s42=(2,0)|s43=(0,1)|s44=(0,2)|s45=(0,0)\n|s46=(2,1)|s47=(2,2)|s48=(2,0)|s49=(0,1)|s50=(0,2)|s51=(0,0)|s52=(1,1)|s53=(1,2)|s54=(1,0)\n|s55=(0,2)|s56=(0,0)|s57=(0,1)|s58=(1,2)|s59=(1,0) |s60=(1,1)|s61=(2,2)|s62=(2,0)|s63=(2,1)\n|s64=(1,2)|s65=(1,0)|s66=(1,1)|s67=(2,2)|s68=(2,0)|s69=(2,1)|s70=(0,2)|s71=(0,0)|s72=(0,1)\n|s73=(2,2)|s74=(2,0)|s75=(2,1)|s76=(0,2)|s77=(0,0)|s78=(0,1)|s79=(1,2)|s80=(1,0)|s81=(1,1)\n|c19=yellow|c20=yellow|c21=yellow|c46=yellow|c47=yellow|c48=yellow\n|c73=yellow|c74=yellow|c75=yellow\n}}\n|}\nFor this method to work, one generally does not need a product of two equally-sized groups. A so-called short [[exact sequence]] of finite groups\nof appropriate size already does the job. Try for example the group <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{4}</math> with quotient- and subgroup <math>\\mathbb{Z}_{2}</math>.\nIt seems clear (already from enumeration arguments), that not all Sudokus can be generated this way.\n\n==Enumerating Sudoku solutions==\nThe answer to the question 'How many Sudoku grids are there?' depends on the definition of when similar solutions are considered different.\n\n===Enumerating all possible Sudoku solutions===\nFor the enumeration of ''all'' possible solutions, two solutions are considered distinct if any of their corresponding (81) cell values differ. Symmetry relations between similar solutions are ignored., e.g. the rotations of a solution are considered distinct. Symmetries play a significant role in the enumeration strategy, but not in the count of ''all'' possible solutions.\n\nThe first known solution to complete enumeration was posted by QSCGZ [Guenter Stertenbrink] to the ''rec.puzzles'' [[newsgroup]] in 2003,<ref name=\"afj2\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.puzzles/A7pi7S12oFI |title=Google Discussiegroepen |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/6670903752021072936960-is-old-hat-t5871.html |title=6670903752021072936960 is old hat : General |publisher=Forum.enjoysudoku.com |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> obtaining 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 ({{val|6.67|e=21}}) distinct solutions.\n\nIn a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis<ref name=\"afjarvis\">{{citation|title=Enumerating possible Sudoku grids|first1=Bertram|last1=Felgenhauer|first2=Frazer|last2=Jarvis|date=20 June 2005|url=http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku/sudoku.pdf}}.</ref> analyzed the [[combinations and permutations|permutations]] of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] and [[equivalence class]]es for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each equivalence class. Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by class size, gives the total number of solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second enumeration technique based on band generation was later developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n\n==={{anchor|Transformations}}Enumerating essentially different Sudoku solutions===\n\nTwo valid grids are ''essentially'' the same if one can be derived from the other. The following operations are Sudoku preserving symmetries and always translate a valid grid into another valid grid:\n\n* Relabeling symbols (9!)\n* Band permutations (3!)\n* Row permutations within a band (3!<sup>3</sup>)\n* Stack permutations (3!)\n* Column permutations within a stack (3!<sup>3</sup>)\n* Reflection, transposition and rotation (2). (Given any transposition or quarter-turn rotation in conjunction with the above permutations, any combination of reflections, transpositions and rotations can be produced, so these operations only contribute a factor of 2.)\n\nThese operations define a symmetry relation between equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and with respect to the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a [[subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>81</sub>, of order 3!<sup>8</sup>\u00d72&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,359,232. Applying the above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!<sup>8</sup>\u00d72\u00d79! essentially equivalent grids. Exceptions are [[#Automorphic Sudokus|Automorphic Sudokus]] which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.\n\nThe number of distinct solutions can also be identified with [[Burnside's Lemma]]. For a solution, the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an [[Orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of the [[symmetric group]]. The number of essentially different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside ''fixed points'' are solutions that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell<ref name=\"sudgroup\" /> computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.\n\n==Enumeration results==\nEnumeration results for many Sudoku variants have been calculated: these are summarised below.\n\n===Sudoku with rectangular regions===\nIn the table, \"Dimensions\" are those of the regions (e.g. 3\u00d73 in normal Sudoku).

The usual constraints of no repeated value in any row, column or region apply. The clues are given as sums of values within regions (e.g. a 4-cell region with sum 10 must consist of values 1,2,3,4 in some order). The minimum number of clues for Samunampure is not known, nor even conjectured. A variant on Miyuki Misawa's web site<ref>[http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~sumnumberplace/79790008/] {{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> replaces sums with relations: the clues are symbols '''=''', '''<''' and '''>''' showing the relative values of (some but not all) adjacent region sums. She demonstrates an example with only eight relations.

If any clue is removed from either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). In the work to find these Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 minimal puzzles with 36 clues. About 2600 minimal Sudokus with 39 clues were also found.<ref name=\"maximum\"/>\n\nIf dropping the requirement for the uniqueness of the solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the ''uniqueness'' of the solution constraint still dominates over the ''minimality'' constraint.<ref>[http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/high-clue-tamagotchis-t30020.html http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/high-clue-tamagotchis] High clue tamagotchis (forum: p. 5).</ref>\n\nAs for the ''most'' clues possible in a Sudoku while still ''not'' rendering a unique solution, it is four short of a full grid (77).

One example of a grid which is automorphic would be a grid which can be rotated 180 degrees resulting in a new grid where the new cell values are a permutation of the original grid. Automorphic Sudokus are Sudoku puzzles which solve to an automorphic grid.

Expressed another way, these Sudokus have the property that every 180-degree rotational pair of clues (a, b) follows the rule (a) + (b) = 10.\n\nSince these Sudokus are automorphic, so too their solutions grids are automorphic.  Furthermore, every cell which is solved has a symmetrical partner which is solved with the same technique (and the pair would take the form a + b = 10). Notice that in the second example, the Sudouku also exhibits [[Translational symmetry|translational]] (or repetition) symmetry; clues are clustered in groups, with the clues in each group ordered sequentially (i.e., n, n+1, n+2, and n+3).\n\nThe third image is the ''Most Canonical'' solution grid.<ref>[http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/Canonical_Form.html http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/Canonical_Form] \"Canonical Form\".</ref> This grid has 648 automorphisms and contributes to all ~{{val|6.67|e=21}} solution grids by factor of 1/648 compared to any non-automorphic grid.\n\nIn these examples the automorphisms are easy to identify, but in general automorphism is not always obvious. The table at right shows the number of the essentially different Sudoku solution grids for all existing automorphisms.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fowler|first1=Glenn|title=Number of automorphisms for any grid|url=http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/post41438.html#p41438|website=The New Sudoku Players' Forum|accessdate=29 April 2017|date=15 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Details of enumerating distinct grids (9\u00d79)==\nAn enumeration technique based on ''band generation'' was developed that is significantly less computationally intensive. The strategy begins by analyzing the [[combinations and permutations|permutations]] of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] and [[equivalence class]] for the partial solutions are identified, the completions of the lower two bands are constructed and counted for each equivalence class.\n\n===Counting the top band permutations===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n| style=\"width: 20px;\" | 1 \n| style=\"width: 20px;\" | 2 \n| style=\"width: 20px;\" | 3\n|-\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n|-\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|}\nThe Band1 algorithm proceeds as follows:\n* Choose a canonical labeling of the digits by assigning values for B1 (see grid), and compute the rest of the Band1 permutations relative B1.\n* Compute the permutations of B2 by [[Partition of a set|partitioning]] the B1 cell values over the B2 row [[#Definition of terms and labels|triplets]]. From the triplet combinations compute the B2 permutations. There are k=0..3 ways to choose the:\n:B1 r11 values for B2 r22, the rest must go to r16,\n:B1 r12 values for B2 r23, the rest must go to r16,\n:B1 r13 values for B2 r21, the rest must go to r16, i.e.\n::<math> \\mbox{N combinations for B2} = \\sum_{k=0..3}{{3 \\choose k}^3}</math>\n(This expression may be generalized to any ''R''\u00d73 box band variant. (Pettersen<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>). Thus B2 contributes 56 \u00d7 6<sup>3</sup> permutations.\n* The choices for B3 triplets are row-wise determined by the B1 B2 row triplets.

Counting the permutations for B2 is more complicated, because the choices for B2 depend on the values in B1. (This is a visual representation of the expression given above.) The conditional calculation needs a branch (sub-calculation) for each alternative. Fortunately, there are just 4 cases for the top B2 triplet (r21): it contains either 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the digits from the B1 middle row triplet(r12). Once this B2 top row choice is made, the rest of the B2 combinations are fixed. The Band1 row triplet labels are shown on the right.\n\n(Note: Conditional combinations becomes an increasingly difficult as the computation progresses through the grid. At this point the impact is minimal.)\n{{Sudoku 3x9 band|b1c=white\n|title=Case 0 Matching Cells Triplets|align=right\n|s1=1 |s2=2 |s3=3 |s4=7 |s5=8 |s6=9 |s7=4 |s8=5 |s9=6\n|s10=4|s11=5|s12=6|s13=1|s14=2|s15=3|s16=7|s17=8|s18=9\n|s19=7|s20=8|s21=9|s22=4|s23=5|s24=6|s25=1|s26=2|s27=3\n|b2c=pink|b3c=pink\n}}\nCase 0: No Overlap.

Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill in the number of B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 6<sup>3</sup> for the block.\n\nFor B2, the triplet values can appear in any position, so a 3! permutation factor still applies, for each triplet. However,\nsince some of the values were paired relative to their origin, using the raw option counts would overcount the number of permutations, due to interchangeability within the pairing. The option counts need to be divided by the permuted size of their grouping (2), here 2!.= 2 (See [[Combinations|n Choose k]]) The pair in each row cancels the 2s for the B2 option counts, leaving a B2 contribution of 3<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6<sup>3</sup>.

A [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetry]] is an operation that preserves a quality of an object. For a Sudoku grid, a symmetry is a transformation whose result is also a valid grid. The following symmetries apply independently for the top band:\n* Block B1 values may be relabeled, giving 9! permutations\n* Blocks B1..3 may be interchanged, with 3!=6 permutations\n* Rows 1..3 may be interchanged, with 3!=6 permutations\n* Within each block, the 3 columns may be interchanged, giving 3!<sup>3</sup> = 6<sup>3</sup> permutations.\nCombined, the symmetries give 9! \u00d7 6<sup>5</sup> = 362880 \u00d7 7776 equivalent permutations for each Band1 solution.\n\nA symmetry defines an [[equivalence relation]], here, between the solutions, and [[Partition of a set|partitions]] the solutions into a set of [[equivalence class]]es. The Band1 row, column and block symmetries divide the 56*6^6 permutations into (not less than) 336 (56\u00d76) equivalence classes with (up to) 6<sup>5</sup> permutations in each, and 9! relabeling permutations for each class. (''Min/Max'' caveats apply since some permutations may not yield distinct elements due to relabeling.)\n\nSince the solution for any member of an equivalence class can be generated from the solution of any other member, we only need to enumerate the solutions for a single member in order to enumerate all solutions over all classes. Let\n* sb : be a valid permutation of the top band\n* Sb = [sb] : be an equivalence class, relative to sb and some [[equivalence relation]]\n* Sb.z = |Sb| : the size of Sb, be the number of sb elements (permutations) in [sb]\n* Sb.n : be the number of Band2,3 completions for (any) sb in Sb\n* {Sb} : be the set of all Sb equivalence classes relative to the [[equivalence relation]]\n* {Sb}.z = |{Sb}| : be the number of equivalence classes\n\nThe total number of solutions ''N'' is then:\n:<math>N = \\sum_{\\{Sb\\}} \\mbox{Sb.z} \\times \\mbox{Sb.n}</math>\n\n====Solution and counting permutation symmetry====\nThe Band1 symmetries (above) are ''solution permutation symmetries'' defined so that a permuted solution is also a solution. For the purpose of enumerating solutions, a ''counting symmetry'' for grid completion can be used to define band equivalence classes that yield a minimal number of classes.\n\n''Counting symmetry'' partitions valid Band1 permutations into classes that place the same completion constraints on lower bands; all members of a band ''counting symmetry'' equivalence class must have the same number of grid completions since the completion constraints are equivalent. Counting symmetry constraints are identified by the Band1 column triplets (a column value set, no implied element order). Using band counting symmetry, a minimal generating set of 44 equivalence classes<ref name=\"ed44\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk/sudoku/ed44.html |title=Summary of method and results |publisher=Afjarvis.staff.shef.ac.uk |accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> was established.\n{| align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n |-valign=\"top\"\n |\n{{Sudoku 3x9 band|b1c=white|b2c=d8f0ff|align=right\n|title=(1) Band1 Example\n|s1=1 |s2=2 |s3=3 |s4=5 |s5=8 |s6=6 |s7=7 |s8=4 |s9=9\n|s10=4|s11=5|s12=6|s13=9|s14=1|s15=7|s16=8|s17=2|s18=3\n|s19=7|s20=8|s21=9|s22=4|s23=3|s24=2|s25=5|s26=1|s27=6\n}}\n |\n{{Sudoku 3x9 band|b1c=white|b2c=d8f0ff|align=right\n|title=(2) Column Triplets\n|s1=1 |s2=2 |s3=3 |s4=4 |s5=1 |s6=2 |s7=5 |s8=1 |s9=3\n|s10=4|s11=5|s12=6|s13=5|s14=3|s15=6|s16=7|s17=2|s18=6\n|s19=7|s20=8|s21=9|s22=9|s23=8|s24=7|s25=8|s26=4|s27=9\n|c5=pink|c14=pink|c23=pink\n|c8=pink|c17=pink|c26=pink\n}}\n |\n{{Sudoku 3x9 band|b1c=white|b3c=d8f0ff|align=right\n|title=(3) Ordered Col.

Begin with a valid band configuration (1). Build column triplets by ordering the column values within each column. This is not a valid Sudoku band, but does place the same constraints on the lower bands as the example (2). Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column and box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column and box ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID will have the same number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this process can be used to build the largest possible ''band counting symmetry'' equivalence classes (3).\n\nNote, while column triplets are used to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the ''One Rule'' solution requirements. ''Counting symmetry'' is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). ''Solution symmetry'' for preserving solutions can be applied to either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, ''counting symmetry'' is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same ''counting symmetry'' equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.\n\n====Band 1 reduction details====\nSymmetries group similar object into [[equivalence class]]es. Two numbers need to be distinguished for equivalence classes, and band symmetries as used here, a third:\n* the number of equivalence classes ({Sb}.n).\n* the [[cardinality]], size or number of elements in an equivalence class, which may vary by class (Sb.z)\n* the number of Band2,3 completions compatible with a member of a Band1 equivalence class (Sb.n)\n\nThe Band1 (6<sup>5</sup>) symmetries divide the (56\u00d76<sup>6</sup>) Band1 valid permutations into (not less than) 336 (56\u00d76) equivalence classes with (up to) 6^5 permutations each.\nThe ''not less than'' and ''up to'' caveats are necessary, since some combinations of the transformations may not produce distinct results, when relabeling is required (see below). Consequently, some equivalence classes may contain less than 6<sup>5</sup> distinct permutations and the theoretical minimum number of classes may not be achieved.\n\nEach of the valid Band1 permutations can be expanded (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By virtue of their similarity, each member of an equivalence class will have the same number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions by the size of the equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.\n\nFelgenhauer/Jarvis<ref name=\"afjarvis\" /> catalogued the Band1 permutations using [[lexicographical order]]ed IDs based on the ordered digits from blocks B2,3. Block 1 uses a canonical digit assignment and is not needed for a unique ID. Equivalence class identification and linkage uses the lowest ID within the class.\n\nApplication of the (2\u00d76<sup>2</sup>) B2,3 symmetry permutations produces 36288 (28\u00d76<sup>4</sup>) equivalence classes, each of size 72. Since the size is fixed, the computation only needs to find the 36288 equivalence class IDs. (Note: in this case,\nfor any Band1 permutation, applying these permutations to achieve the lowest ID provides an index to the associated equivalence class.)\n\nApplication of the rest of the block, column and row symmetries provided further reduction, i.e. allocation of the 36288 IDs into fewer, larger equivalence classes.\nWhen the B1 canonical labeling is lost through a transformation, the result is relabeled to the canonical B1 usage and then catalogued under this ID. This approach generated 416 equivalence classes, somewhat less effective than the theoretical 336 minimum limit for a full reduction. Application of ''counting symmetry'' patterns for ''duplicate paired'' digits achieved reduction to 174 and then to 71 equivalence classes. The introduction of equivalence classes based on ''band counting symmetry'' (subsequent to Felgenhauer/Jarvis by Russell<ref name=\"ed44\" />) reduced the equivalence classes to a minimum generating set of 44.\n\nThe diversity of the ~{{val|2.6|e=6}}, 56\u00d76<sup>6</sup> Band1 permutations can be reduced to a set of 44 Band1 equivalence classes. Each of the 44 equivalence classes can be expanded to millions of distinct full solutions, but the entire solution space has a common origin in these 44. The 44 equivalence classes play a central role in other enumeration approaches as well, and speculation will return to the characteristics of the 44 classes when puzzle properties are explored later.\n\n===Band 2\u20133 completion and results===\nEnumerating the Sudoku solutions breaks into an initial setup stage and then into two nested loops. Initially all the valid Band1 permutations are grouped into equivalence classes, who each impose a common constraint on the Band2,3 completions.\nFor each of the Band1 equivalence classes, all possible Band2,3 solutions need to be enumerated. An outer Band1 loop iterates over the 44 equivalence classes. In the inner loop, all lower band completions for each of the Band1 equivalence class are found and counted.\n\nThe computation required for the lower band solution search can be minimised by the same type of symmetry application used for Band1. There are 6! (720) permutations for the 6 values in column 1 of Band2,3. Applying the lower band (2) and row within band (6\u00d76) permutations creates 10 equivalence classes of size 72. At this point, completing 10 sets of solutions for the remaining 48 cells with a recursive descent, [[backtracking]] algorithm is feasible with 2&nbsp;GHz class PC so further simplification is not required to carry out the enumeration. Using this approach, the number of ways of filling in a blank Sudoku grid has been shown to be 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 ({{val|6.67|e=21}}).<ref name=\"afjarvis\"/>\n\nThe result, as confirmed by Russell,<ref name=\"ed44\" /> also contains the distribution of solution counts for the 44 equivalence classes. The listed values are before application of the 9! factor for labeling and the two 72 factors (72<sup>2</sup> = 5184) for each of Stack 2,3 and Band2,3 permutations. The number of completions for each class is consistently on the order of 100,000,000, while the number of Band1 permutations covered by each class however varies from 4 \u2013 3240. Within this wide size range, there are clearly two clusters. Ranked by size, the lower 33 classes average ~400 permutations/class, while the upper 11 average ~2100. The disparity in consistency between the distributions for size and number of completions or the separation into two clusters by size is yet to be examined.\n\n==Variants==\nSudoku regions are [[polyominoes]].  Although the classic 9\u00d79 Sudoku is made of square [[nonominoes]], it is possible to apply the rules of Sudoku to puzzles of other sizes \u2013 the 2\u00d72 and 4\u00d74 square puzzles, for example.  Only ''N''<sup>2</sup>\u00d7''N''<sup>2</sup> Sudoku puzzles can be tiled with square polyominoes. Another popular variant is made of rectangular regions \u2013 for example, 2\u00d73 [[hexominoes]] tiled in a 6\u00d76 grid.  The following notation is used for discussing this variant.\n* ''R''\u00d7''C'' denotes a rectangular region with ''R'' rows and ''C'' columns.\n* The implied grid configuration has:\n** ''C'' blocks per band,\n**  ''R'' blocks per stack,\n**  ''C''\u00d7''R'' bands\u00d7stacks,\n** an arrangement of ''C''\u00d7''R'' regions, and\n** grid dimensions ''N''\u00d7''N'', where ''N'' = ''R''\u00d7''C''.\n\nPuzzles of size ''N''\u00d7''N'', where ''N'' is prime can only be tiled with irregular ''N''-ominoes.  Each ''N''\u00d7''N'' grid can be tiled multiple ways with ''N''-ominoes.  Before enumerating the number of solutions to a Sudoku grid of size ''N''\u00d7''N'', it is necessary to determine how many ''N''-omino tilings exist for a given size (including the standard square tilings, as well as the rectangular tilings).\n\nThe size ordering of Sudoku puzzle can be used to define an integer series, e.g. for square Sudoku, the integer series of possible solutions {{OEIS|id=A107739}}. Sudoku with square ''N''\u00d7''N'' regions are more symmetrical than immediately obvious from the ''One Rule''. Each row and column intersects ''N'' regions and shares ''N'' cells with each. The number of bands and stacks also equals ''N''. Rectangular Sudoku do not have these properties. The \"3\u00d73\" Sudoku is additionally unique: ''N'' is also the number of row-column-region constraints from the ''One Rule'' (i.e. there are ''N''=3 types of ''units'').

The first event was held in [[Lucca]] in 2006. National teams are determined by local affiliates of the World Puzzle Federation. The competition typically consists of 100 or more puzzles solved by all competitors over multiple timed rounds, including classic [[sudoku]], variations and other puzzle types, normally followed by a playoff for the top qualifiers to determine a champion. Examples of rounds include the Relay round, where an answer from one puzzle contributes digits to the start of the next sudoku, and the \"World Record\" round, in which solvers competed to set a [[Guinness World Record]] for fastest sudoku solution.\n\nOf the 13 championships held so far, Kota Morinishi of [[Japan]] (2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018) has been the most successful winner with four individual titles, over [[Thomas Snyder]] of [[United States]] (2007, 2008 and 2011), Jan Mrozowski of [[Poland]] (2009, 2010 and 2012) who have each won three.\n\nFrom 2007 there has also been a team competition.

The first event was held in [[Lucca]] in 2006. National teams are determined by local affiliates of the World Puzzle Federation. The competition typically consists of 100 or more puzzles solved by all competitors over multiple timed rounds, including classic [[sudoku]], variations and other puzzle types, normally followed by a playoff for the top qualifiers to determine a champion. Examples of rounds include the Relay round, where an answer from one puzzle contributes digits to the start of the next sudoku, and the \"World Record\" round, in which solvers competed to set a [[Guinness World Record]] for fastest sudoku solution.\n\nOf the 13 championships held so far, Kota Morinishi of [[Japan]] (2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018) has been the most successful winner with four individual titles, over [[Thomas Snyder]] of [[United States]] (2007, 2008 and 2011), Jan Mrozowski of [[Poland]] (2009, 2010 and 2012) who have each won three.\n\nFrom 2007 there has also been a team competition.  [[Japan]] is the most successful team, having won the title in 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2018; [[Czech Republic]] (2008, 2016), [[Germany]] (2010 and 2011) and [[China]] (2013, 2017) have won this title twice; [[Slovakia]] (2009) also won a title.\n\nStarting from 2011, the event has been held alongside the [[World Puzzle Championship]].\n\n== Participants ==\nCurrently, 30 countries are official members of the World Puzzle Federation.

Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nPLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired [[relay logic]] systems. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.\n\nA PLC is an example of a \"hard\" [[Real-time computing|real-time]] system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.\n\n==Invention and early development==\nPLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the USA and were designed to replace relay logic systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of [[Relay|relays]], [[Cam timer|cam timers]], [[Drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencers]], and dedicated closed-loop controllers. \n\nThe hard-wired nature made it difficult for design engineers to alter the process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. If even one wire were out of place, or one relay failed, the whole system would become faulty. Often times technicians would spend hours troubleshooting by examining the schematics and comparing them to existing wiring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.controlsystemsandautomation.com/learn/plc/plc-programming-basics-i/|title=PLC Programming Basics Part I|date=2019-07-23|website=Control Systems & Automation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} These early computers required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe PLC was developed with several advantages over earlier designs. It tolerated the industrial environment better than computers and was more reliable, compact and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily extensible with additional I/O modules, while relay systems required complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. Comparing to a computer, PLC in a rack format can be more easily extended with additional I/O in the form of I/O cards. With simple programming language focused on logic and switching operations it was more user-friendly than computers using [[General-purpose programming language|general-purpose programming languages]]. It also permitted for its operation to be monitored.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Parr|first=E.

This program notation was chosen to reduce training demands for the existing technicians.

As programming terminals evolved, it became more common for ladder logic to be used, because it was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels. Newer formats, such as state logic and Function Block (which is similar to the way logic is depicted when using digital integrated logic circuits) exist, but they are still{{When|date=February 2020}} not as popular as ladder logic. A primary reason for this is that PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.{{Fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nUp to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming [[Computer terminal|terminals]], which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs.<ref name=\"EERef162\" /> Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain [[ASCII art|ASCII]] character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on [[Cassette tape cartridge|cassette tape cartridges]]. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used [[non-volatile]] [[magnetic core memory]].\n\n== Architecture ==\nRegular programmable logic controller consists of:\n\n* a processor unit (CPU) which interprets inputs, executes the control program stored in memory and sends output signals,\n* a power supply unit which converts AC voltage to DC,\n* a memory unit storing data from inputs and program to be executed by the processor,\n* an input and output interfaces, where the controller receives and sends data from/to external devices,\n* a communications interface to receive and transmit data on communication networks from/to remote PLCs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=7}}</ref>\n\nPLCs require programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nModern PLCs generally contain a [[real-time operating system]], such as [[OS-9]] or [[VxWorks]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Discrete (digital) and analog signals===\n[[Digital signal|Discrete (digital) signals]] behave as binary switches, yielding simply an On or Off signal (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, [[limit switch]]es, and [[photoelectric sensor]]s are examples of devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]], where a specific range is designated as ''On'' and another as ''Off''. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing ''On'', values below 2VDC representing ''Off'', and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only digital I/O.\n\nAnalog signals are like volume controls, with a range of values between zero and full-scale. These are typically interpreted as integer values (counts) by the PLC, with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. As PLCs typically use 16-bit signed binary processors, the integer values are limited between -32,768 and +32,767. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. Analog signals can use [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]] with a magnitude proportional to the value of the process signal. For example, an analog 0 to 10&nbsp;V or [[4-20 mA]] input would be [[analog-to-digital converter|converted]] into an integer value of 0 to 32767.  The programming inside the PLC will use a SCL or scaling function to take this 0-32767 value and transpose it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.  Proper integration will also include filter times to reduce noise as well as high and low limits to report faults.\n\n[[Current loop|Current inputs]] are less sensitive to electrical noise (e.g. from welders or electric motor starts) than voltage inputs.  Distance from the device and the controller is also a concern as the maximum travelling distance of a good quality 0-10V signal is very short compared to the 4-20mA signal.  The 4-20mA signal can also report if the wire is disconnected along the path as it would return a 0mA signal and a fault can be reported.\n\n===Timers and counters===\n\nThe main function of a timer is to keep an output on for a specific length of time.  A good example of this is a garage light, where you want power to be cut off after 2 minutes so as to give someone time to go into the house. The three different types of timers that are commonly used are a Delay-OFF, a Delay-ON, and a Delay-ON-Retentive. A Delay-OFF timer activates immediately when turned on, and will start counting down from a programmed time before cutting off once the enabling input is off. A Delay-ON timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, counts up to a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is turned off. A Delay-ON-Retentive timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, retains the accumulated value even if the (ladder-logic) rung goes false, and can be reset only by a RESET command.  Visible details for the rest of the program to use could include:\n\n*EN - ENable signal, indicated the timer has been enabled and can start timing, or if completed keep the DoNe status on.\n*PRE - PREset time, requested time value to be run before the timer is DoNe.  Could be in a TIME format (t#1h35m12s) or in seconds format (3500 = 3.5s)\n*ACC - ACCumulated time, how long the timer has been timing.  Same number formats as the PREset value.\n*DN - DoNe signal, indicates the timer has elapsed the preset value\n*TT - Timer Timing signal, indicates the timer is actively timing.  This is not on once the timer is done\n\nCounters are primarily used for counting items such as cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck.  There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset.  Down counters count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.<ref>Yanik, P. (2017, April 11). Timers and Counters. Cullowhee, NC, United States of America.</ref>\n\n===Redundancy===\nSome special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted down time. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system which is fault-tolerant and capable of handling the process with faulty modules. In such cases to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to hardware configuration for preventing total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure.  Other redundancy scenarios  could be related to safety critical processes, for example large hydraulic presses could require that both PLCs turn on an output before the press can come down in case one output does not turn off properly.\n\n==Programming==\n[[File:Automate industriel WAGO pour un syst\u00e8me de monitoring en industrie pharmaceutique.jpg|thumb|Industrial controller for a monitoring system in the pharmaceutical industry]]\nProgrammable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without programming background. For this reason, graphical programming language called [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LD, LAD) was first developed which resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays. It was adopted by many manufacturers and later standardized in the [[IEC 61131-3]] control systems programming standard. {{As of|2015|}}, it is still widely used, thanks to its simplicity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|}}, the majority of PLC systems adhere to the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that defines 2 textual programming languages: [[Structured text|Structured Text]] (ST; similar to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) and [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL); as well as 3 graphical languages: [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]], [[Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) and [[Sequential function chart|Sequential Function Chart]] (SFC).<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Keller, William L Jr. ''Grafcet, A Functional Chart for Sequential Processes'', 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1984, p. 71-96.</ref> [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL) was deprecated in the third edition of the standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plcopen.org/status-iec-61131-3-standard|title=Status IEC 61131-3 standard|last=|first=|date=2018-07-19|website=PLCopen|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nModern PLCs can be programmed in a variety of ways, from the relay-derived ladder logic to programming languages such as specially adapted dialects of [[BASIC]] and [[C (programming language)|C]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nWhile the fundamental concepts of PLC programming are common to all manufacturers, differences in I/O addressing, memory organization, and instruction sets mean that PLC programs are never perfectly interchangeable between different makers. Even within the same product line of a single manufacturer, different models may not be directly compatible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nPLC programs are typically written in a special software on a [[personal computer]], then downloaded to the PLC directly or over a network. The program is stored in the PLC either in non-volatile [[flash memory]] or battery-backed-up [[RAM]]. In some programmable controllers, the program is transferred from a personal computer to the PLC through a programming board which writes the program into a removable chip, such as [[EPROM]]. The software can upload the PLC program, for backup and restoration purposes.<!--Often, a single PLC can be programmed to replace thousands of [[Relay|relays]].<ref name=\"Bolton09\" />-->Generally, the software provides functions for debugging and troubleshooting the PLC software, for example, by highlighting portions of the logic to show current status during operation or via simulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Simulation===\nIn order to properly understand the operation of a PLC, it is necessary to spend considerable time [[Computer programming|programming]], testing and [[debugging]] PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software such as PLCLogix can save time in the design of automated control applications and can also increase the level of safety associated with equipment since many \"what if\" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=Sally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHYlTBxqrM8C&pg=PA553|title=Advances in Computer Science, Environment, Ecoinformatics, and Education, Part III: International Conference, CSEE 2011, Wuhan, China, August 21-22, 2011.

A ladder diagram is a method of drawing control circuits which pre-dates PLCs. The ladder diagram resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.\n\nAs an example, say a facility needs to store water in a tank. The water is drawn from the tank by another system, as needed, and our example system must manage the water level in the tank by controlling the valve that refills the tank. Shown are:\n\n*Two inputs (from the low and high level switches) represented by contacts of the float switches\n*An output to the fill valve, labelled as the fill valve which it controls\n*An \"internal\" contact, representing the output signal to the fill valve which is created in the program.\n*A logical control scheme created by the interconnection of these items in software\n\nIn ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a \"normally open\" contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic \"true\" signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the PLC program that \"read\" or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be \"opposite\" or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.\n\nIn the example, the physical state of the float switch contacts must be considered when choosing \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from [[float switch]]es (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (normally closed) open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above the physical location of the switch.\n\nWhen the water level is below both switches, the float switch physical contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal \"Fill Valve\" contact latches the circuit so that even when the \"Low Level\" contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as the water level remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the \"High Level\" switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; this is an example of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.\n<pre style=\"width: 95%;\">\n\n| (N.C. physical   (N.C. physical                             |\n|   Switch)          Switch)                                  |\n|   Low Level       High Level                Fill Valve      |\n|------[ ]------|------[ ]----------------------(OUT)---------|\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|   Fill Valve  |                                             |\n|------[ ]------|                                             |\n|                                                             |\n|                                                             |\n</pre>\n\nA complete program may contain thousands of rungs, evaluated in sequence. Typically the PLC processor will alternately scan all its inputs and update outputs, then evaluate the ladder logic; input changes during a program scan will not be effective until the next I/O update. A complete program scan may take only a few milliseconds, much faster than changes in the controlled process.\n\nProgrammable controllers vary in their capabilities for a \"rung\" of a ladder diagram. Some only allow a single output bit. There are typically limits to the number of series contacts in line, and the number of branches that can be used. Each element of the rung is evaluated sequentially. If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal (in multi-branched rungs) to affect the output.\n\n==Functionality==\n[[Image:PLC Control Panel.png|thumbnail|350|Control panel with PLC (grey elements in the center). The unit consists of separate elements, from left to right; [[power supply]], controller, [[relay]] units for in- and output]]\n[[File:Control-panel-plc.jpg|thumb|Control panel with a PLC user interface for [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] regulation.]]\nThe main difference from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive [[input/output]] (I/O) to connect the PLC to [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as [[limit switch]]es, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or [[machine vision]] systems.<ref>Harms, Toni M. & Kinner, Russell H. P.E., ''Enhancing PLC Performance with Vision Systems''. 18th Annual ESD/HMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 387-399.</ref> PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, [[electric motor]]s, [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] cylinders, magnetic [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, or [[analog signal|analog]] outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external [[I/O module]]s attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.\n\nThe functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, [[process control]], [[distributed control system]]s, and [[computer network|networking]]. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to [[desktop computer]]s. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Basic functions===\n\nThe most basic function of a programmable controller is to emulate the functions of electro-mechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of \"examine if on\" instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electro-mechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a \"rung\" of a \"ladder diagram \", and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic.  Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one \"rung\" of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an \"internal coil\" with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs.  Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.\n\nSome PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic.  This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which in a sufficiently complex circuit may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts.  The elimination of these \"sneak paths\" is either a bug or a feature, depending on programming style.\n\nMore advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variable internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.\n\n=== Communication ===\nPLCs use built-in ports, such as [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], or [[RS-422]] to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming software, [[SCADA]], [[User interface|HMI]]). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like [[Modbus]], or [[EtherNet/IP]]. Many of these protocols are vendor specific.\n\nPLCs used in larger I/O systems may have [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to co-ordinate over the communication link. These communication links are also often used for [[User interface|HMI]] devices such as keypads or [[Personal computer|PC]]-type workstations.\n\nFormerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.\n\n===User interface===\n{{See also|User interface|List of human-computer interaction topics}}\nPLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A [[SCADA#Human-machine interface|human-machine interface]] (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.\n\n===System scale===\nA small PLC will have a fixed number of connections built in for inputs and outputs. Typically, expansions are available if the base model has insufficient I/O.\n\nModular PLCs have a chassis (also called a rack) into which are placed modules with different functions. The processor and selection of I/O modules are customized for the particular application. Several racks can be administered by a single processor, and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants.  Options are also available to mount I/O points directly to the machine and utilize quick disconnecting cables to sensors and valves, saving time for wiring and replacing components.\n\n==Process of a scan cycle==\n\nThere are 5 main steps in a scan cycle:\n\n# Reading inputs\n# Executing the program\n# Processing communication requests\n# Executing CPU diagnostics\n# Writing outputs\n\nA PLC program generally loops i.e. executes repeatedly, as long as the controlled system is running. At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the \"I/O Image Table\", which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs.<ref>Maher, Michael J. ''Real-Time Control and Communications''. 18th Annual ESD/SMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 431-436.</ref> Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times (on the order of 100 ms) may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.\n\nAs PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.<ref>Kinner, Russell H., P.E. ''Designing Programmable Controller Application Programs Using More than One Designer''. 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1985, p. 97-110.</ref> This enhanced programming could be used to save scan time for high-speed processes; for example, parts of the program used only for setting up the machine could be segregated from those parts required to operate at higher speed. Newer PLCs now have the option to run the logic program synchronously with the IO scanning. This means that IO is updated in the background and the logic reads and writes values as required during the logic scanning.\n\nSpecial-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with [[rotary encoder|shaft encoder]]s, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution on the PLC.\n\n==Security==\nPrior to the discovery of the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]] in June 2010, security of PLCs received little attention. Modern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in similar way as desktop operating systems, like [[Microsoft Windows]]. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/plc-security-risk-controller-operating-systems |title=PLC Security Risk: Controller Operating Systems - Tofino Industrial Security Solution|website=www.tofinosecurity.com  |date=May 2011 |author=Byres}}</ref> {{As of|2011||since=y}}, this concerns grow as networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment connecting the previously separate plant floor networks and office networks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=15}}</ref>\n\n== Safety PLC ==\nIn recent years \"safety\" PLCs have started to become popular, either as standalone models or as functionality and safety-rated hardware added to existing controller architectures ([[Allen-Bradley]] Guardlogix, [[Siemens]] F-series etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types as being suitable for use in safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired [[Safety relay|safety relays]]. For example, a safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with [[Trapped key interlocking|trapped-key access]], or perhaps to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stops, light screens, and so forth. The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.\n\n==PLC compared with other control systems==\n[[File:BMA Automation Allen Bradley PLC 3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|PLC installed in a control panel]]\n[[File:Control-panel.jpg|thumb|Control center with a PLC for a [[Regenerative thermal oxidiser|RTO]].]]\nPLCs are well adapted to a range of [[automation]] tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a \"generic\" solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nProgrammable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that [[G-code]] (involving a [[CNC]] machine) can be used to instruct machine movements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vosough and Vosough|date=November 2011|title=PLC and its Applications|url=http://www.ijmse.org/Volume2/Issue8/paper9.pdf|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Engineering|volume=2|pages=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n=== Cam timers ===\nFor high volume or very simple fixed automation tasks, different techniques are used. For example, a cheap consumer [[dishwasher]] would be controlled by an electromechanical [[cam timer]] costing only a few dollars in production quantities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Microcontrollers ===\nA [[microcontroller]]-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units will be produced and so the development cost (design of power supplies, input/output hardware, and necessary testing and certification) can be spread over many sales, and where the end-user would not need to alter the control. Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.<ref name=\"McMillan992\">Gregory K. McMillan, Douglas M. Considine (ed), ''Process/Industrial Instruments and Controls Handbook Fifth Edition'', McGraw-Hill, 1999 {{ISBN|0-07-012582-1}} Section 3 ''Controllers''</ref>\n\n=== Single-board computers ===\nVery complex process control, such as used in the chemical industry, may require algorithms and performance beyond the capability of even high-performance PLCs. Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. [[Single-board computer|Single-board computers]] using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. \"Soft PLCs\" running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.<ref name=\"McMillan992\" />\n\nThe rising popularity of [[Single-board computer|single board computers]] has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally [[Closed platform|closed platforms]], but some newer PLCs (e.g. ctrlX from [[Bosch Rexroth]], PFC200 from [[WAGO Kontakttechnik|Wago]], PLCnext from [[Phoenix Contact]], and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an [[open platform]].\n\n=== PID Controllers ===\nPLCs may include logic for single-variable feedback analog control loop, a [[PID controller]]. A PID loop could be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process, for example. Historically PLCs were usually configured with only a few analog control loops; where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, a [[distributed control system]] (DCS) would instead be used. As PLCs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has been blurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Programmable logic relays (PLR)===\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}In more recent years,{{When|date=February 2020}} small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two [[orders of magnitude]] less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.\n\nA variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the [[remote terminal unit]] or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedised PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically [[SCADA]]) or in some modern systems, \"The Cloud\". Unlike factory automation using high speed [[Ethernet]], communications links to remote sites are often radio based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial control systems]]\n* [[Industrial safety systems]]\n* [[PLC technician]]\n* [[1-bit architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bolton|first=William|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=sDqnBQAAQBAJ|title=Programmable Logic Controllers|publisher=Newnes|year=2015|isbn=9780081003534|edition=6th, revised|location=|ref=harv|via=Google Books}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daniel Kandray, ''Programmable Automation Technologies'', Industrial Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-8311-3346-7}}, Chapter 8 ''Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers''\n* Tom Mejer Antonsen, 2018 \"PLC Controls with Structured Text (ST)\", {{ISBN|978-87-4300-241-3}},  {{ISBN|978-87-4300-242-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=2012-09-08 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-20}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://plccompare.com/embedded-plc-guide/ A simple guide to Embedded PLCs]\n\n{{Commons category|Programmable logic controller}}\n{{Wikiversity|Programmable logic controller (basics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Programmable Logic Controller}}\n[[Category:Industrial automation]]\n[[Category:Industrial computing]]\n[[Category:Programmable logic controllers]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Siemens Simatic S7-416-3.jpg|thumb|upright|PLC system in a rack, left-to-right: power supply unit (PSU), CPU, interface module (IM) and communication processor (CP).]]\n{{Manufacturing}}\n\nA '''programmable logic controller''' ('''PLC''') or '''programmable controller''' is an industrial [[digital computer]] which has been [[Rugged computer|ruggedized]] and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as [[Assembly line|assembly lines]], or [[robotic]] devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming and process fault diagnosis.\n\nPLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of [[Input/output|inputs and outputs (I/O)]], in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and [[SCADA]] systems.\n\nThey can be designed for many arrangements of digital and analog I/O, extended temperature ranges, immunity to [[Noise (electronics)|electrical noise]], and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nPLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired [[relay logic]] systems. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.\n\nA PLC is an example of a \"hard\" [[Real-time computing|real-time]] system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.\n\n==Invention and early development==\nPLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the USA and were designed to replace relay logic systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of [[Relay|relays]], [[Cam timer|cam timers]], [[Drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencers]], and dedicated closed-loop controllers. \n\nThe hard-wired nature made it difficult for design engineers to alter the process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. If even one wire were out of place, or one relay failed, the whole system would become faulty. Often times technicians would spend hours troubleshooting by examining the schematics and comparing them to existing wiring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.controlsystemsandautomation.com/learn/plc/plc-programming-basics-i/|title=PLC Programming Basics Part I|date=2019-07-23|website=Control Systems & Automation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} These early computers required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe PLC was developed with several advantages over earlier designs. It tolerated the industrial environment better than computers and was more reliable, compact and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily extensible with additional I/O modules, while relay systems required complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. Comparing to a computer, PLC in a rack format can be more easily extended with additional I/O in the form of I/O cards.

As programming terminals evolved, it became more common for ladder logic to be used, because it was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels. Newer formats, such as state logic and Function Block (which is similar to the way logic is depicted when using digital integrated logic circuits) exist, but they are still{{When|date=February 2020}} not as popular as ladder logic. A primary reason for this is that PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.{{Fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nUp to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming [[Computer terminal|terminals]], which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs.<ref name=\"EERef162\" /> Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain [[ASCII art|ASCII]] character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on [[Cassette tape cartridge|cassette tape cartridges]]. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used [[non-volatile]] [[magnetic core memory]].\n\n== Architecture ==\nRegular programmable logic controller consists of:\n\n* a processor unit (CPU) which interprets inputs, executes the control program stored in memory and sends output signals,\n* a power supply unit which converts AC voltage to DC,\n* a memory unit storing data from inputs and program to be executed by the processor,\n* an input and output interfaces, where the controller receives and sends data from/to external devices,\n* a communications interface to receive and transmit data on communication networks from/to remote PLCs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=7}}</ref>\n\nPLCs require programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nModern PLCs generally contain a [[real-time operating system]], such as [[OS-9]] or [[VxWorks]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Discrete (digital) and analog signals===\n[[Digital signal|Discrete (digital) signals]] behave as binary switches, yielding simply an On or Off signal (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, [[limit switch]]es, and [[photoelectric sensor]]s are examples of devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]], where a specific range is designated as ''On'' and another as ''Off''. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing ''On'', values below 2VDC representing ''Off'', and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only digital I/O.\n\nAnalog signals are like volume controls, with a range of values between zero and full-scale. These are typically interpreted as integer values (counts) by the PLC, with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. As PLCs typically use 16-bit signed binary processors, the integer values are limited between -32,768 and +32,767. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. Analog signals can use [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]] with a magnitude proportional to the value of the process signal. For example, an analog 0 to 10&nbsp;V or [[4-20 mA]] input would be [[analog-to-digital converter|converted]] into an integer value of 0 to 32767.  The programming inside the PLC will use a SCL or scaling function to take this 0-32767 value and transpose it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.  Proper integration will also include filter times to reduce noise as well as high and low limits to report faults.\n\n[[Current loop|Current inputs]] are less sensitive to electrical noise (e.g. from welders or electric motor starts) than voltage inputs.  Distance from the device and the controller is also a concern as the maximum travelling distance of a good quality 0-10V signal is very short compared to the 4-20mA signal.  The 4-20mA signal can also report if the wire is disconnected along the path as it would return a 0mA signal and a fault can be reported.\n\n===Timers and counters===\n\nThe main function of a timer is to keep an output on for a specific length of time.  A good example of this is a garage light, where you want power to be cut off after 2 minutes so as to give someone time to go into the house. The three different types of timers that are commonly used are a Delay-OFF, a Delay-ON, and a Delay-ON-Retentive. A Delay-OFF timer activates immediately when turned on, and will start counting down from a programmed time before cutting off once the enabling input is off. A Delay-ON timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, counts up to a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is turned off. A Delay-ON-Retentive timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, retains the accumulated value even if the (ladder-logic) rung goes false, and can be reset only by a RESET command.  Visible details for the rest of the program to use could include:\n\n*EN - ENable signal, indicated the timer has been enabled and can start timing, or if completed keep the DoNe status on.\n*PRE - PREset time, requested time value to be run before the timer is DoNe.  Could be in a TIME format (t#1h35m12s) or in seconds format (3500 = 3.5s)\n*ACC - ACCumulated time, how long the timer has been timing.  Same number formats as the PREset value.\n*DN - DoNe signal, indicates the timer has elapsed the preset value\n*TT - Timer Timing signal, indicates the timer is actively timing.  This is not on once the timer is done\n\nCounters are primarily used for counting items such as cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck.  There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset.  Down counters count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.<ref>Yanik, P. (2017, April 11). Timers and Counters. Cullowhee, NC, United States of America.</ref>\n\n===Redundancy===\nSome special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted down time. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system which is fault-tolerant and capable of handling the process with faulty modules. In such cases to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to hardware configuration for preventing total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure.  Other redundancy scenarios  could be related to safety critical processes, for example large hydraulic presses could require that both PLCs turn on an output before the press can come down in case one output does not turn off properly.\n\n==Programming==\n[[File:Automate industriel WAGO pour un syst\u00e8me de monitoring en industrie pharmaceutique.jpg|thumb|Industrial controller for a monitoring system in the pharmaceutical industry]]\nProgrammable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without programming background. For this reason, graphical programming language called [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LD, LAD) was first developed which resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.

Even within the same product line of a single manufacturer, different models may not be directly compatible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nPLC programs are typically written in a special software on a [[personal computer]], then downloaded to the PLC directly or over a network. The program is stored in the PLC either in non-volatile [[flash memory]] or battery-backed-up [[RAM]]. In some programmable controllers, the program is transferred from a personal computer to the PLC through a programming board which writes the program into a removable chip, such as [[EPROM]]. The software can upload the PLC program, for backup and restoration purposes.<!--Often, a single PLC can be programmed to replace thousands of [[Relay|relays]].<ref name=\"Bolton09\" />-->Generally, the software provides functions for debugging and troubleshooting the PLC software, for example, by highlighting portions of the logic to show current status during operation or via simulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Simulation===\nIn order to properly understand the operation of a PLC, it is necessary to spend considerable time [[Computer programming|programming]], testing and [[debugging]] PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software such as PLCLogix can save time in the design of automated control applications and can also increase the level of safety associated with equipment since many \"what if\" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=Sally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHYlTBxqrM8C&pg=PA553|title=Advances in Computer Science, Environment, Ecoinformatics, and Education, Part III: International Conference, CSEE 2011, Wuhan, China, August 21-22, 2011.

A ladder diagram is a method of drawing control circuits which pre-dates PLCs. The ladder diagram resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.\n\nAs an example, say a facility needs to store water in a tank. The water is drawn from the tank by another system, as needed, and our example system must manage the water level in the tank by controlling the valve that refills the tank. Shown are:\n\n*Two inputs (from the low and high level switches) represented by contacts of the float switches\n*An output to the fill valve, labelled as the fill valve which it controls\n*An \"internal\" contact, representing the output signal to the fill valve which is created in the program.\n*A logical control scheme created by the interconnection of these items in software\n\nIn ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a \"normally open\" contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic \"true\" signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the PLC program that \"read\" or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be \"opposite\" or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.\n\nIn the example, the physical state of the float switch contacts must be considered when choosing \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from [[float switch]]es (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (normally closed) open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above the physical location of the switch.\n\nWhen the water level is below both switches, the float switch physical contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal \"Fill Valve\" contact latches the circuit so that even when the \"Low Level\" contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as the water level remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the \"High Level\" switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; this is an example of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.\n<pre style=\"width: 95%;\">\n\n| (N.C. physical   (N.C. physical                             |\n|   Switch)          Switch)                                  |\n|   Low Level       High Level                Fill Valve      |\n|------[ ]------|------[ ]----------------------(OUT)---------|\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|   Fill Valve  |                                             |\n|------[ ]------|                                             |\n|                                                             |\n|                                                             |\n</pre>\n\nA complete program may contain thousands of rungs, evaluated in sequence. Typically the PLC processor will alternately scan all its inputs and update outputs, then evaluate the ladder logic; input changes during a program scan will not be effective until the next I/O update. A complete program scan may take only a few milliseconds, much faster than changes in the controlled process.\n\nProgrammable controllers vary in their capabilities for a \"rung\" of a ladder diagram. Some only allow a single output bit. There are typically limits to the number of series contacts in line, and the number of branches that can be used. Each element of the rung is evaluated sequentially. If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal (in multi-branched rungs) to affect the output.\n\n==Functionality==\n[[Image:PLC Control Panel.png|thumbnail|350|Control panel with PLC (grey elements in the center). The unit consists of separate elements, from left to right; [[power supply]], controller, [[relay]] units for in- and output]]\n[[File:Control-panel-plc.jpg|thumb|Control panel with a PLC user interface for [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] regulation.]]\nThe main difference from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive [[input/output]] (I/O) to connect the PLC to [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as [[limit switch]]es, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or [[machine vision]] systems.<ref>Harms, Toni M. & Kinner, Russell H. P.E., ''Enhancing PLC Performance with Vision Systems''. 18th Annual ESD/HMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 387-399.</ref> PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, [[electric motor]]s, [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] cylinders, magnetic [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, or [[analog signal|analog]] outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external [[I/O module]]s attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.\n\nThe functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, [[process control]], [[distributed control system]]s, and [[computer network|networking]]. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to [[desktop computer]]s. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Basic functions===\n\nThe most basic function of a programmable controller is to emulate the functions of electro-mechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of \"examine if on\" instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electro-mechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a \"rung\" of a \"ladder diagram \", and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic.  Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one \"rung\" of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an \"internal coil\" with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs.  Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.\n\nSome PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic.  This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which in a sufficiently complex circuit may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts.  The elimination of these \"sneak paths\" is either a bug or a feature, depending on programming style.\n\nMore advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variable internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.\n\n=== Communication ===\nPLCs use built-in ports, such as [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], or [[RS-422]] to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming software, [[SCADA]], [[User interface|HMI]]). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like [[Modbus]], or [[EtherNet/IP]]. Many of these protocols are vendor specific.\n\nPLCs used in larger I/O systems may have [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to co-ordinate over the communication link. These communication links are also often used for [[User interface|HMI]] devices such as keypads or [[Personal computer|PC]]-type workstations.\n\nFormerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.\n\n===User interface===\n{{See also|User interface|List of human-computer interaction topics}}\nPLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A [[SCADA#Human-machine interface|human-machine interface]] (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.\n\n===System scale===\nA small PLC will have a fixed number of connections built in for inputs and outputs. Typically, expansions are available if the base model has insufficient I/O.\n\nModular PLCs have a chassis (also called a rack) into which are placed modules with different functions. The processor and selection of I/O modules are customized for the particular application. Several racks can be administered by a single processor, and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants.  Options are also available to mount I/O points directly to the machine and utilize quick disconnecting cables to sensors and valves, saving time for wiring and replacing components.\n\n==Process of a scan cycle==\n\nThere are 5 main steps in a scan cycle:\n\n# Reading inputs\n# Executing the program\n# Processing communication requests\n# Executing CPU diagnostics\n# Writing outputs\n\nA PLC program generally loops i.e. executes repeatedly, as long as the controlled system is running. At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the \"I/O Image Table\", which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs.<ref>Maher, Michael J. ''Real-Time Control and Communications''. 18th Annual ESD/SMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 431-436.</ref> Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times (on the order of 100 ms) may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.\n\nAs PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.<ref>Kinner, Russell H., P.E. ''Designing Programmable Controller Application Programs Using More than One Designer''. 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1985, p. 97-110.</ref> This enhanced programming could be used to save scan time for high-speed processes; for example, parts of the program used only for setting up the machine could be segregated from those parts required to operate at higher speed. Newer PLCs now have the option to run the logic program synchronously with the IO scanning. This means that IO is updated in the background and the logic reads and writes values as required during the logic scanning.\n\nSpecial-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with [[rotary encoder|shaft encoder]]s, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution on the PLC.\n\n==Security==\nPrior to the discovery of the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]] in June 2010, security of PLCs received little attention. Modern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in similar way as desktop operating systems, like [[Microsoft Windows]]. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/plc-security-risk-controller-operating-systems |title=PLC Security Risk: Controller Operating Systems - Tofino Industrial Security Solution|website=www.tofinosecurity.com  |date=May 2011 |author=Byres}}</ref> {{As of|2011||since=y}}, this concerns grow as networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment connecting the previously separate plant floor networks and office networks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=15}}</ref>\n\n== Safety PLC ==\nIn recent years \"safety\" PLCs have started to become popular, either as standalone models or as functionality and safety-rated hardware added to existing controller architectures ([[Allen-Bradley]] Guardlogix, [[Siemens]] F-series etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types as being suitable for use in safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired [[Safety relay|safety relays]]. For example, a safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with [[Trapped key interlocking|trapped-key access]], or perhaps to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stops, light screens, and so forth. The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.\n\n==PLC compared with other control systems==\n[[File:BMA Automation Allen Bradley PLC 3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|PLC installed in a control panel]]\n[[File:Control-panel.jpg|thumb|Control center with a PLC for a [[Regenerative thermal oxidiser|RTO]].]]\nPLCs are well adapted to a range of [[automation]] tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a \"generic\" solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nProgrammable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that [[G-code]] (involving a [[CNC]] machine) can be used to instruct machine movements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vosough and Vosough|date=November 2011|title=PLC and its Applications|url=http://www.ijmse.org/Volume2/Issue8/paper9.pdf|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Engineering|volume=2|pages=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n=== Cam timers ===\nFor high volume or very simple fixed automation tasks, different techniques are used. For example, a cheap consumer [[dishwasher]] would be controlled by an electromechanical [[cam timer]] costing only a few dollars in production quantities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Microcontrollers ===\nA [[microcontroller]]-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units will be produced and so the development cost (design of power supplies, input/output hardware, and necessary testing and certification) can be spread over many sales, and where the end-user would not need to alter the control. Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.<ref name=\"McMillan992\">Gregory K. McMillan, Douglas M. Considine (ed), ''Process/Industrial Instruments and Controls Handbook Fifth Edition'', McGraw-Hill, 1999 {{ISBN|0-07-012582-1}} Section 3 ''Controllers''</ref>\n\n=== Single-board computers ===\nVery complex process control, such as used in the chemical industry, may require algorithms and performance beyond the capability of even high-performance PLCs. Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. [[Single-board computer|Single-board computers]] using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. \"Soft PLCs\" running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.<ref name=\"McMillan992\" />\n\nThe rising popularity of [[Single-board computer|single board computers]] has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally [[Closed platform|closed platforms]], but some newer PLCs (e.g. ctrlX from [[Bosch Rexroth]], PFC200 from [[WAGO Kontakttechnik|Wago]], PLCnext from [[Phoenix Contact]], and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an [[open platform]].\n\n=== PID Controllers ===\nPLCs may include logic for single-variable feedback analog control loop, a [[PID controller]]. A PID loop could be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process, for example. Historically PLCs were usually configured with only a few analog control loops; where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, a [[distributed control system]] (DCS) would instead be used. As PLCs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has been blurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Programmable logic relays (PLR)===\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}In more recent years,{{When|date=February 2020}} small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two [[orders of magnitude]] less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.\n\nA variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the [[remote terminal unit]] or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedised PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically [[SCADA]]) or in some modern systems, \"The Cloud\". Unlike factory automation using high speed [[Ethernet]], communications links to remote sites are often radio based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial control systems]]\n* [[Industrial safety systems]]\n* [[PLC technician]]\n* [[1-bit architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bolton|first=William|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=sDqnBQAAQBAJ|title=Programmable Logic Controllers|publisher=Newnes|year=2015|isbn=9780081003534|edition=6th, revised|location=|ref=harv|via=Google Books}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daniel Kandray, ''Programmable Automation Technologies'', Industrial Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-8311-3346-7}}, Chapter 8 ''Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers''\n* Tom Mejer Antonsen, 2018 \"PLC Controls with Structured Text (ST)\", {{ISBN|978-87-4300-241-3}},  {{ISBN|978-87-4300-242-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=2012-09-08 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-20}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://plccompare.com/embedded-plc-guide/ A simple guide to Embedded PLCs]\n\n{{Commons category|Programmable logic controller}}\n{{Wikiversity|Programmable logic controller (basics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Programmable Logic Controller}}\n[[Category:Industrial automation]]\n[[Category:Industrial computing]]\n[[Category:Programmable logic controllers]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4062:2397:a6bd:d80d:b7f7:4a4b:dd3d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller"}

The Bohemian ''natio'' included Bohemians, Moravians, southern Slavs, and Hungarians; the Bavarian included Austrians, [[Swabia]]ns, natives of [[Franconia]] and of the [[Rhine provinces]]; the Polish included [[Silesia]]ns, Poles, Ruthenians; the Saxon included inhabitants of the [[Margravate of Meissen]], [[Thuringia]], Upper and Lower Saxony, Denmark, and Sweden.<ref name = \"CE\">{{CathEncy|wstitle=University of Prague}}</ref> Ethnically Czech students made 16\u201320% of all students.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs-magazin.com/2005-03/view.php?article=articles/cs050334.htm | title = Sedmdes\u00e1tilet\u00e9 v\u00fdro\u010d\u00ed insigni\u00e1dy z jin\u00e9ho pohledu | work = CS Magazin | first = V\u00e1clav | last = Chysk\u00fd | date = March 2005 | language = Czech | accessdate = 21 June 2009}}</ref> Archbishop [[Arno\u0161t of Pardubice]] took an active part in the foundation by obliging the clergy to contribute and became a [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the university (i.e., director or manager).\n\nThe first graduate was promoted in 1359.

The dean of the philosophical faculty, [[Jan Hus]], translated ''Trialogus'' into the [[Czech language]]. In 1403 the university forbade its members to follow the teachings of Wycliffe, but his doctrine continued to gain in popularity.\n\nIn the [[Western Schism]], the Bohemian ''natio'' took the side of king [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] and supported the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409). The other ''nationes'' of the university declared their support for the side of [[Pope Gregory XII]], thus the vote was 1:3 against the Bohemians. Hus and other Bohemians, though, took advantage of Wenceslaus' opposition to Gregory. By the [[Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]] ({{lang-de|Kuttenberg}}) on 18 January 1409, the king subverted the university constitution by granting the Bohemian masters three votes. Only a single vote was left for all other three ''nationes'' combined, compared to one vote per each ''natio'' before. The result of this ''coup'' was the emigration of foreign (mostly German) professors and students, founding the [[University of Leipzig]] in May 1409. Before that, in 1408, the university had about 200 doctors and magisters, 500 bachelors, and 30,000 students; it now lost a large part of this number, accounts of the loss varying from 5000 to 20,000 including 46 professors.<ref name = \"CE\" /> In the autumn of 1409, Hus was elected rector of the now Czech-dominated rump university.\n\nThus, the Prague university lost the largest part of its students and faculty.

By 1622 the Jesuits had a predominant influence over the emperor. An Imperial decree of 19 September 1622 gave the Jesuits supreme control over the entire school system of Bohemia, [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]]. The last four professors at the Carolinum resigned and all of the Carolinum and nine colleges went to the Jesuits. The right of handing out degrees, of holding chancellorships and of appointing the secular professors was also granted to the Jesuits.\n\n===Charles-Ferdinand University (1622\u20131882)===\nCardinal [[Ernst Adalbert von Harrach]] actively opposed union of the university with another institution and the withdrawal of the archepiscopal right to the chancellorship and prevented the drawing up of the Golden Bull for the confirmation of the grant to Jesuits. Cardinal Ernst funded the ''Collegium Adalbertinum'' and in 1638 emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] limited the teaching monopoly enjoyed by the Jesuits. He took from them the rights, properties and archives of the Carolinum making the university once more independent under an imperial protector. During the last years of the [[Thirty Years' War]] the [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague was courageously defended by students of the Carolinum and [[Clementinum]]. Since 1650 those who received any degrees took an oath to maintain the ''[[Immaculate Conception]] of the Blessed Virgin'', renewed annually.\n\n[[File:Clementinum library.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Baroque library hall in Clementinum, which originally belonged to the university, today part of [[National Library of the Czech Republic|Czech National Library]]]]\nOn 23 February 1654 emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] merged ''Carolinum'' and ''Clementinum'' and created a single university with four faculties\u2014Charles-Ferdinand University.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t45.html | first = Franti\u0161ek | last = \u010capka | title = D\u011bjiny zem\u00ed Koruny \u010desk\u00e9 v datech | chapter = VII.

Due to the demographic changes of the 19th century, Prague ceased to have a German-language majority around 1860. By 1863, 22 lecture courses were held in Czech, the remainder (out of 187) in German. In 1864, Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected this because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.\n\n===Split into Czech and German universities===\n\nIt soon became clear that neither the Germans nor the Czechs were satisfied with the bilingual arrangement that the University arranged after the revolutions of 1848. The Czechs also refused to support the idea of the reinstitution of the 1349 [[Nation (university)|student nations]], instead declaring their support for the idea of keeping the university together, but dividing it into separate [[University college|colleges]], one German and one Czech. This would allow both Germans and Czechs to retain the collective traditions of the University. German-speakers, however, quickly vetoed this proposal, preferring a pure German university: they proposed to split Charles-Ferdinand University into two separate institutions.\n\n[[File:Hopfner Promotionsurkunde.jpg|thumb|Doctoral diploma of the astronomer [[Friedrich Hopfner]], issued 1905 by the [[German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague]]]]\nAfter long negotiations, Charles-Ferdinand was divided into a '''German Charles-Ferdinand University''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t}}) and a '''Czech Charles-Ferdinand University''' ({{lang-cs|\u010cesk\u00e1 universita Karlo-Ferdinandova}}) by an act of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]], which Emperor Franz Joseph sanctioned on 28 February 1882.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t73.html | first = Franti\u0161ek | last = \u010capka | title = D\u011bjiny zem\u00ed Koruny \u010desk\u00e9 v datech | chapter = X.

The university was sectioned into parts called ''[[Nation (university)|nations]]'': the [[Bohemia]]n, [[Bavaria]]n, Polish and [[Saxony|Saxon]]. The Bohemian ''natio'' included Bohemians, Moravians, southern Slavs, and Hungarians; the Bavarian included Austrians, [[Swabia]]ns, natives of [[Franconia]] and of the [[Rhine provinces]]; the Polish included [[Silesia]]ns, Poles, Ruthenians; the Saxon included inhabitants of the [[Margravate of Meissen]], [[Thuringia]], Upper and Lower Saxony, Denmark, and Sweden.<ref name = \"CE\">{{CathEncy|wstitle=University of Prague}}</ref> Ethnically Czech students made 16\u201320% of all students.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs-magazin.com/2005-03/view.php?article=articles/cs050334.htm | title = Sedmdes\u00e1tilet\u00e9 v\u00fdro\u010d\u00ed insigni\u00e1dy z jin\u00e9ho pohledu | work = CS Magazin | first = V\u00e1clav | last = Chysk\u00fd | date = March 2005 | language = Czech | accessdate = 21 June 2009}}</ref> Archbishop [[Arno\u0161t of Pardubice]] took an active part in the foundation by obliging the clergy to contribute and became a [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the university (i.e., director or manager).\n\nThe first graduate was promoted in 1359. The lectures were held in the colleges, of which the oldest was named for the king the ''Carolinum'', established in 1366.

The dean of the philosophical faculty, [[Jan Hus]], translated ''Trialogus'' into the [[Czech language]]. In 1403 the university forbade its members to follow the teachings of Wycliffe, but his doctrine continued to gain in popularity.\n\nIn the [[Western Schism]], the Bohemian ''natio'' took the side of king [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] and supported the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409). The other ''nationes'' of the university declared their support for the side of [[Pope Gregory XII]], thus the vote was 1:3 against the Bohemians. Hus and other Bohemians, though, took advantage of Wenceslaus' opposition to Gregory. By the [[Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]] ({{lang-de|Kuttenberg}}) on 18 January 1409, the king subverted the university constitution by granting the Bohemian masters three votes. Only a single vote was left for all other three ''nationes'' combined, compared to one vote per each ''natio'' before. The result of this ''coup'' was the emigration of foreign (mostly German) professors and students, founding the [[University of Leipzig]] in May 1409. Before that, in 1408, the university had about 200 doctors and magisters, 500 bachelors, and 30,000 students; it now lost a large part of this number, accounts of the loss varying from 5000 to 20,000 including 46 professors.<ref name = \"CE\" /> In the autumn of 1409, Hus was elected rector of the now Czech-dominated rump university.\n\nThus, the Prague university lost the largest part of its students and faculty.

By 1622 the Jesuits had a predominant influence over the emperor. An Imperial decree of 19 September 1622 gave the Jesuits supreme control over the entire school system of Bohemia, [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]]. The last four professors at the Carolinum resigned and all of the Carolinum and nine colleges went to the Jesuits. The right of handing out degrees, of holding chancellorships and of appointing the secular professors was also granted to the Jesuits.\n\n===Charles-Ferdinand University (1622\u20131882)===\nCardinal [[Ernst Adalbert von Harrach]] actively opposed union of the university with another institution and the withdrawal of the archepiscopal right to the chancellorship and prevented the drawing up of the Golden Bull for the confirmation of the grant to Jesuits. Cardinal Ernst funded the ''Collegium Adalbertinum'' and in 1638 emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] limited the teaching monopoly enjoyed by the Jesuits. He took from them the rights, properties and archives of the Carolinum making the university once more independent under an imperial protector. During the last years of the [[Thirty Years' War]] the [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague was courageously defended by students of the Carolinum and [[Clementinum]]. Since 1650 those who received any degrees took an oath to maintain the ''[[Immaculate Conception]] of the Blessed Virgin'', renewed annually.\n\n[[File:Clementinum library.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Baroque library hall in Clementinum, which originally belonged to the university, today part of [[National Library of the Czech Republic|Czech National Library]]]]\nOn 23 February 1654 emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] merged ''Carolinum'' and ''Clementinum'' and created a single university with four faculties\u2014Charles-Ferdinand University.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t45.html | first = Franti\u0161ek | last = \u010capka | title = D\u011bjiny zem\u00ed Koruny \u010desk\u00e9 v datech | chapter = VII.

The dilapidated Carolinum was rebuilt in 1718 at the expense of the state.\n\nThe rebuilding and the bureaucratic reforms of universities in the [[Habsburg monarchy]] in 1752 and 1754 deprived the university of many of its former privileges. In 1757 a Dominican and an Augustinian were appointed to give theological instruction. However, there was a gradual introduction of enlightened reforms, and this process culminated at the end of the century when even non-Catholics were granted the right to study.

Due to the demographic changes of the 19th century, Prague ceased to have a German-language majority around 1860. By 1863, 22 lecture courses were held in Czech, the remainder (out of 187) in German. In 1864, Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected this because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.\n\n===Split into Czech and German universities===\n\nIt soon became clear that neither the Germans nor the Czechs were satisfied with the bilingual arrangement that the University arranged after the revolutions of 1848. The Czechs also refused to support the idea of the reinstitution of the 1349 [[Nation (university)|student nations]], instead declaring their support for the idea of keeping the university together, but dividing it into separate [[University college|colleges]], one German and one Czech. This would allow both Germans and Czechs to retain the collective traditions of the University. German-speakers, however, quickly vetoed this proposal, preferring a pure German university: they proposed to split Charles-Ferdinand University into two separate institutions.\n\n[[File:Hopfner Promotionsurkunde.jpg|thumb|Doctoral diploma of the astronomer [[Friedrich Hopfner]], issued 1905 by the [[German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague]]]]\nAfter long negotiations, Charles-Ferdinand was divided into a '''German Charles-Ferdinand University''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t}}) and a '''Czech Charles-Ferdinand University''' ({{lang-cs|\u010cesk\u00e1 universita Karlo-Ferdinandova}}) by an act of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Cisleithanian Imperial Council]], which Emperor Franz Joseph sanctioned on 28 February 1882.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl = http://libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t73.html | first = Franti\u0161ek | last = \u010capka | title = D\u011bjiny zem\u00ed Koruny \u010desk\u00e9 v datech | chapter = X.
