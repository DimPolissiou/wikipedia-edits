In a letter to the Sultan of [[Muscat]] in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-oil Dubai===\nDubai's geographical proximity to [[Iran]] made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of [[Jumeirah]], a collection of some 45 ''areesh'' (palm leaf) huts.<ref name=\"Lorimer 1915 454\"/> Dubai was known for its [[pearl]] exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 [[Great Depression]] and the innovation of [[cultured pearls]].

This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce - a healthy markup.

The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built.

By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to [[The Guess Who]]. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates|Johnny Kidd's]] \"[[Shakin' All Over]]\", which also charted in the US at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and [[Burton Cummings]] became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada.

With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''.

[[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to tour, after Randy agreed to rights the band held to the name.\n\n===1979-1980===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other pars of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After Bachman-Turner Overdrive broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988 they reformed and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the band. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours.

During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]].

Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the \"ghetto scenes\" and \"war machines\" of the US, reflecting the Guess Who's experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members' lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members.<ref name=\"Bachman bio at CBC.ca\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html |title=Bachman bio at |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor's care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/american-woman-hitmaker-randy-bachman-recalls-1960s-winnipeg-rock-scene/504180862/ |title='American Woman' hitmaker Randy Bachman recalls 1960s Winnipeg rock scene |last=Bream |first=Jon |website=StarTribune.com |date=January 11, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brave Belt and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive===\nBefore his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for [[RCA Records]], ''Axe'', over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the [[country rock]] band [[Brave Belt]] with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled [[LP record|LP]] in 1971. [[Robbie Bachman]] was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles however. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to tour, after Randy agreed to rights the band held to the name.\n\n===1979-1980===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other pars of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After Bachman-Turner Overdrive broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988 they reformed and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the band. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive band-mates, [[C.F. Turner]] and [[Robin Bachman]]. Series creator [[Matt Groening]], whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a self-professed fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, [[Bachman Cummings]].\n\nIn 2004, Bachman helped [[Kalan Porter]] on his debut album, ''[[219 Days]]''. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]]. During this time he featured in a theater-styled show called \"Every Song Tells A Story\", where he performed live and unplugged with his band, often telling the stories behind writing his most famous from the 1960s and 1970s. Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] performed throughout Canada as [[Bachman & Cummings (band)|Bachman & Cummings]] in the summer of 2006, while on tour with [[The Carpet Frogs]]. Bachman and Fred Turner completed a new [[Bachman & Turner]] album that was released in September 2010. The album's single titled \"Rollin' Along\", was released in June 2010 on iTunes. The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010\u201311) under their Bachman & Turner moniker, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK, in July 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Later in March 2018, Randy Bachman released a tribute to George Harrison containing cover version of the latter's hits. The album featured one original song titled \"Between Two Mountains\", and also featured [[Walter Trout]] on  the album's version of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\n==Guitar style==\nBachman has stated that his guitar sound was influenced by his early violin studies, saying \"when I wanted to play a rock solo, I played like it was violin...

The JSSC soon began leading planning for a joint-military force after the end of [[World War II]]. They changed the terminology of the organization from an \"international police force\" to \"international military force\" and recommended creating [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] around the world, where the United States, United Kingdom, and the [[Soviet Union]] would maintain international forces. Under the plan, the United States was to have responsibility for the Americas, Great Britain and the Soviet Union would have joint responsibility the rest of the world; with the exception of the [[Far East]], which would be the responsibility of all three powers and China. The JSSC approached planning from a nationalistic angle, believing a multi-national force impractical.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=48-49}}\nAfter being modified by the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the plan was spread through the United States Department of State, where [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], favored an multi-national organization. Hull was dedicated to the project and formed a new drafting committee that discarded the spheres of influence plan.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=49-52}} After the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|Moscow Conference of 1943]], the [[Moscow Declarations]] were issued on 30 October 1943. The declarations favored establishing a multi-national organization.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/history-united-nations-charter/1943-moscow-and-teheran-conferences/index.html|title=1943: Moscow and Teheran Conferences|last=|first=|date=2015-08-26|website=The United Nations|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nAfter extensive planning, a draft charter was completed by 29 April 1944. The draft proposed having member nations maintain forces that could be called into action. If the forces were used, they would be led by a Security and Armaments Commission. Though written by Americans, some [[United States Senate|senators]] feared the nation's autonomy would be lost under the plan. Hull countered by saying that the troops would not be under United Nations control, and that details would be decided later and voted on by the Senate. At the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] in 1944, the Soviet Union and United Kingdom supported the plan over Soviet proposals for an international air force. The Soviet Union also proposed putting bases in smaller nations at the conference, but withdrew the proposal after American resistance.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=49-53}}\n\nIt was at the conference that the concept of a Security and Armaments Commission was replaced by a Military Staff Committee, a British proposal based on the US/UK [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] command structure used in World War II. Minor changes to the plan were made at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1945.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=49-53}} The UN was formally established 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council\u2014France, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], the Soviet Union, the UK and the US\u2014and by a majority of the other 46 signatories.<ref name=\"unmilestones1941to1950\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/milestones-1941-1950/index.html|title=UN Milestones 1941-1950|date=2015-08-04|website=www.un.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027013705/http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/milestones-1941-1950/index.html|archive-date=27 October 2017|access-date=1 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The MSC was established in Article 46 and 47 of the Charter, which defines the membership of the Committee as \"the Chiefs of Staff of the permanent members of the Security Council or their representatives\".<ref name=\"un.org2\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Law|first=Jonathan|title=Military Staff Committee|date=2018-06-21|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198802525.001.0001/acref-9780198802525-e-2464|work=A Dictionary of Law|volume=|pages=|editor-last=|editor-first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198802525.001.0001/acref-9780198802525-e-2464|isbn=978-0-19-880252-5|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> In the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1|first United Nations Security Council Resolution]], the Military Staff Committee was established and directed to meet in London on 1 February 1946.<ref>{{Cite wikisource|title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 1}}</ref>\n\nIn the UN Charter, the MSC is designated to advise and assist the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) on \"plans for the application of armed force\" and is made \"responsible under the Security Council for the strategic direction of any armed forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council\".<ref name=\"un.org2\" />\n\n=== Early discussion ===\n[[File:George_Kenney.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Kenney.jpg|thumb|George Kenney]]\nThough the charter had been approved, much of the MSC's function was still undecided. The British favored a \"high powered and effective body\" whereas the United States preferred a far more limited body. By mid-October 1945, the United States had proposed its view of the MSC and its function. Conflict over the organization's size continued: air force generals such as [[Henry H. Arnold]] wanted a large United Nations air force that would be flexible and able to display the organization's power. [[United States Army Chief of Staff]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent General [[Matthew Ridgway]] as his representative; Eisenhower supported the UN, saying \"we must make this organisation work\". General [[George Kenney]] represented the [[United States Air Force]], and Vice Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner]] the [[United States Navy]]. The MSC struggled to be organized; namely because no-one was willing to propose who the force would fight against.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=54-56}}\n\nAt the first meeting in February 1946, operational procedures were established. Further discussions began in March in [[New York City]].{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=176}} The US considered that the committee could oversee [[decolonization]] and border disputes, but was cautious that too much money was not spent and Congress retained war powers. The Soviet Union, fearing undue Western influence, was reluctant to participate in the MSC, and delegates had little negotiating power. Americans aimed to have the force active by June 1946, and proposed \"comparable strength\", where permanent members of the UNSC keep forces at [[combat readiness]], size would be based on the size of their armed forces.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}}\n\nThroughout 1946, American negotiators, particularly Kenney, attempted to compromise with the Soviets, but the Soviet Union would not negotiate, and the Americans (largely Turner and Ridgway) were inflexible on many points. Most other involved nations also expressed little interest; Turner stated that the \"US delegation has been the only delegation in the entire history of the Military Staff Committee to have made any specific proposals,\" besides one United Kingdom proposal.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}} The British similarly felt that \"Russian intransigence\u201d was the cause of slow progress.{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=176}}\n\nIn September, the Soviet Union published a letter outlining their main objections to the American plan. However, by then the United States had largely given up hope for compromise. Debate was moved to the UNSC,{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}} and in a report titled MS/264 issued on April 30, 1947{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=176}} by the MSC outlining proposals, differences were expressed between the Soviet Union and United States.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}} However, the MSC unanimously agreed to more than half of the 41 articles in the report. Nations agreed the force would not be a [[standing army]] and that use would only be a last resort. All UN members were encouraged to contribute forces, facilities, or other assistance, though the majority of initial troops would come from the [[Great power|great powers]]. However, there were numerous disagreements as well. The Soviet Union demanded forces only be based in their nations and favored a more limited authority.{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=|pp=177-178}} The United States favored a larger force and comparable strength, whereas the Soviets proposed a smaller force with equal contributions. Mediation attempts repeatedly failed.

The JSSC soon began leading planning for a joint-military force after the end of [[World War II]]. They changed the terminology of the organization from an \"international police force\" to \"international military force\" and recommended creating [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] around the world, where the United States, United Kingdom, and the [[Soviet Union]] would maintain international forces. Under the plan, the United States was to have responsibility for the Americas, Great Britain and the Soviet Union would have joint responsibility the rest of the world; with the exception of the [[Far East]], which would be the responsibility of all three powers and China. The JSSC approached planning from a nationalistic angle, believing a multi-national force impractical.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=48-49}}\nAfter being modified by the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the plan was spread through the United States Department of State, where [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], favored an multi-national organization. Hull was dedicated to the project and formed a new drafting committee that discarded the spheres of influence plan.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=49-52}} After the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|Moscow Conference of 1943]], the [[Moscow Declarations]] were issued on 30 October 1943.

The draft proposed having member nations maintain forces that could be called into action. If the forces were used, they would be led by a Security and Armaments Commission. Though written by Americans, some [[United States Senate|senators]] feared the nation's autonomy would be lost under the plan. Hull countered by saying that the troops would not be under United Nations control, and that details would be decided later and voted on by the Senate. At the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] in 1944, the Soviet Union and United Kingdom supported the plan over Soviet proposals for an international air force. The Soviet Union also proposed putting bases in smaller nations at the conference, but withdrew the proposal after American resistance.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=49-53}}\n\nIt was at the conference that the concept of a Security and Armaments Commission was replaced by a Military Staff Committee, a British proposal based on the US/UK [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] command structure used in World War II. Minor changes to the plan were made at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1945.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=49-53}} The UN was formally established 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council\u2014France, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], the Soviet Union, the UK and the US\u2014and by a majority of the other 46 signatories.<ref name=\"unmilestones1941to1950\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/milestones-1941-1950/index.html|title=UN Milestones 1941-1950|date=2015-08-04|website=www.un.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027013705/http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/milestones-1941-1950/index.html|archive-date=27 October 2017|access-date=1 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The MSC was established in Article 46 and 47 of the Charter, which defines the membership of the Committee as \"the Chiefs of Staff of the permanent members of the Security Council or their representatives\".<ref name=\"un.org2\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Law|first=Jonathan|title=Military Staff Committee|date=2018-06-21|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198802525.001.0001/acref-9780198802525-e-2464|work=A Dictionary of Law|volume=|pages=|editor-last=|editor-first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198802525.001.0001/acref-9780198802525-e-2464|isbn=978-0-19-880252-5|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> In the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1|first United Nations Security Council Resolution]], the Military Staff Committee was established and directed to meet in London on 1 February 1946.<ref>{{Cite wikisource|title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 1}}</ref>\n\nIn the UN Charter, the MSC is designated to advise and assist the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) on \"plans for the application of armed force\" and is made \"responsible under the Security Council for the strategic direction of any armed forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council\".<ref name=\"un.org2\" />\n\n=== Early discussion ===\n[[File:George_Kenney.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Kenney.jpg|thumb|George Kenney]]\nThough the charter had been approved, much of the MSC's function was still undecided. The British favored a \"high powered and effective body\" whereas the United States preferred a far more limited body. By mid-October 1945, the United States had proposed its view of the MSC and its function. Conflict over the organization's size continued: air force generals such as [[Henry H. Arnold]] wanted a large United Nations air force that would be flexible and able to display the organization's power. [[United States Army Chief of Staff]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent General [[Matthew Ridgway]] as his representative; Eisenhower supported the UN, saying \"we must make this organisation work\". General [[George Kenney]] represented the [[United States Air Force]], and Vice Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner]] the [[United States Navy]]. The MSC struggled to be organized; namely because no-one was willing to propose who the force would fight against.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=54-56}}\n\nAt the first meeting in February 1946, operational procedures were established. Further discussions began in March in [[New York City]].{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=176}} The US considered that the committee could oversee [[decolonization]] and border disputes, but was cautious that too much money was not spent and Congress retained war powers. The Soviet Union, fearing undue Western influence, was reluctant to participate in the MSC, and delegates had little negotiating power. Americans aimed to have the force active by June 1946, and proposed \"comparable strength\", where permanent members of the UNSC keep forces at [[combat readiness]], size would be based on the size of their armed forces.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}}\n\nThroughout 1946, American negotiators, particularly Kenney, attempted to compromise with the Soviets, but the Soviet Union would not negotiate, and the Americans (largely Turner and Ridgway) were inflexible on many points. Most other involved nations also expressed little interest; Turner stated that the \"US delegation has been the only delegation in the entire history of the Military Staff Committee to have made any specific proposals,\" besides one United Kingdom proposal.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}} The British similarly felt that \"Russian intransigence\u201d was the cause of slow progress.{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=176}}\n\nIn September, the Soviet Union published a letter outlining their main objections to the American plan. However, by then the United States had largely given up hope for compromise. Debate was moved to the UNSC,{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}} and in a report titled MS/264 issued on April 30, 1947{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=176}} by the MSC outlining proposals, differences were expressed between the Soviet Union and United States.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}} However, the MSC unanimously agreed to more than half of the 41 articles in the report. Nations agreed the force would not be a [[standing army]] and that use would only be a last resort. All UN members were encouraged to contribute forces, facilities, or other assistance, though the majority of initial troops would come from the [[Great power|great powers]]. However, there were numerous disagreements as well. The Soviet Union demanded forces only be based in their nations and favored a more limited authority.{{Sfn|Grove|1993|p=|pp=177-178}} The United States favored a larger force and comparable strength, whereas the Soviets proposed a smaller force with equal contributions. Mediation attempts repeatedly failed. The nations could not agree on leadership of the force, where bases would be located, and whether the MSC would be able to fight wars.{{Sfn|Soffer|1997|p=56-69}}\n\nThe British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] noted in December 1947 that \u201dan unusual feature of this part of the work of the MSC is that agreement appears to have been brought, by normal standards of United Nations progress, unusually close.

Ouyang is the most common two-character [[Chinese compound surname]], being the only two-character name of the 400-most common Chinese surnames, according to 2013 study, and is one of the twenty-odd two-character surnames that have survived into modern times.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Song Dynasty]] historian [[Ouyang Xiu]] traced the Ouyang surname to Ti ({{lang|zh|\u8e44}}, [[Pinyin]]: T\u00ed), a prince of [[Yue (state)|Yue]], the second son of King Wujiang ({{lang|zh|\u7121\u7586}}). After his state was extinguished by the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], Ti and his family was living in the south side of the Mount Ouyu ({{lang|zh|\u6b50\u4f59\u5c71}}, currently called Mount Sheng {{lang|zh|\u5347\u5c71}} in [[Huzhou]], [[Zhejiang]]). In [[Classical Chinese]], the south side of a mountain or the north bank of a river is called Yang ({{lang|zh|\u967d}}), thus the Ti family was called Ouyang. He was called Marquis of Ouyang Village ({{lang|zh|\u6b50\u967d\u4ead\u4faf}}). Traditionally, Ti's ancestry can be traced through his father Wujiang, the King of Yue, to the semi-legendary [[Yu the Great]] ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u79b9}}).\n\nAccording to a 2013 study, Ouyang was the 169th most common name in China, being shared by around 910000 people or 0.068% of the total population, with the province with the most people with the name being [[Hunan]].\n\n==Geographical origins==\nIn terms of distribution Ouyangs have mostly been confined to southern China, especially the areas of southern [[Jiangxi]], central [[Hubei]] and eastern [[Henan]], with smaller pockets in [[Guangdong]], [[Sichuan]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangxi]].\n\n[[Daling, Guangdong|Daling]] ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u5dba}}), near [[Zhongshan City]] in [[Guangdong]], China has been documented of having an extensive history of the Ouyangs.

Genealogical lineages and family trees have been established for a number of Ouyang clans around China, showing migration patterns from the Song to the [[Qing dynasty]].\n\n==Immigration outside of China==\nThere was a large immigration of Ouyangs in the late 19th century and early 20th century to the [[San Francisco Bay area]], [[Sacramento River Delta|Sacramento Delta Area]].

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 cars were produced in total.  The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.  A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and [[wholesaling|wholesale]] customers by mail order.  In 1997, DeLorean Motor Company of Texas acquired this inventory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delorean.com/q&a.asp#whereparts |title=DeLorean Motor Company FAQ |publisher=Delorean.com |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121215155/http://delorean.com/q%26a.asp |archivedate=November 21, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume.  October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel.

Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side.

Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery.

About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\n[[File:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|thumb|Early pull strap]]\n[[File:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|thumb|Later-style one-piece bolster]]\n[[File:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|thumb|Mid-1981 silver wheel]]\n\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n\n===Prototypes and pilot cars===\nOnly one of two DeLorean prototypes still exists.<ref>{{cite web |author=PJ Grady Europe |url=http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |publisher=DeLorean PJ Grady Europe |title=Delorean Repairs |accessdate=January 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421053458/http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |archivedate=April 21, 2014  }}</ref> Prototype 1 sold at the bankruptcy auction in 1984 for $37,000.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |title=DeLorean prototype cars sell at auction for total $58,000 |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602233213/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The car remained in a private collection until 2005 when it was sold to the owner of DeLorean Motor Company of Florida (DMCFL) where it received a complete restoration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |title=1587: 1976 DeLorean DMC-12 Original Prototype |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602234250/https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proto 1 is now on display at DMCFL.

S. Anderson]].<ref name=\"Worldwide\"/> The film stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Eric Mabius]], [[James Purefoy]], [[Martin Crewes]], and [[Colin Salmon]]. It is the first installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is loosely based on the [[Resident Evil|video game series of the same name]].\n\nBorrowing elements from the video games ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', the film follows [[amnesia]]c heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and a band of [[Umbrella Corporation]] commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-virus at a secret underground facility. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing more than $100 million worldwide.\n\nThe film received five sequels: ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' (2004), ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' (2007), ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'' (2010), ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'' (2012), and ''[[Resident Evil: The Final Chapter]]'' (2016).\n\n==Plot==\nUnderneath [[Resident Evil#The%20Arklay%20Mountain%20and%20Raccoon%20City%20incidents|Raccoon City]] exists a [[genetic research]] facility called the Hive, owned by the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility's [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]], seals the Hive and kills everyone inside.\n\n[[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] awakens in the bathroom of a deserted mansion with temporary amnesia. She dresses, checks the mansion, and is tackled by an unknown person as a group of commandos led by James Shade breaks in. Alice's attacker is cuffed and then released when he claims to be Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. Alice and Matt are ordered to go down to the Hive with the group, where they find another amnesiac, Spence, hidden in their train. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence were assigned to guard the Hive's secret entrance under the mansion.\n\nAt the Red Queen's chamber, a laser defense system kills Shade and three more commandos. Despite the Red Queen's urgent pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables it, causing the power to fail and all of the doors in the Hive to open. This releases the zombified staff and containment units containing Lickers, creatures created through experimentation with the T-virus. When everyone regroups, they are ambushed by a horde of zombies, and a gunfight ensues. J.D. perishes as the group is overwhelmed. A bitten Rain retreats with Kaplan and Spence; Matt becomes separated from Alice, who starts regaining her memories.\n\nMatt looks for information about his sister, Lisa, and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Red Queen's chamber, where the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before she then shoots him dead. They all reach safety except Kaplan, who is bitten and separated from the group.\n\nAlice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he was the thief who stole and purposefully released the T-virus, and hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. He turns against the others but is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. Spence retrieves the anti-virus but is then killed by a Licker purposely set upon him by the Red Queen. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal that a still-alive Kaplan shut down the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the anti-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.\n\nOn the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding on the train and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is attacked by a zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, and her head hits a button, opening a door and dropping the Licker under the train, which kills it. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open, and a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis Program]], and that the Hive is to be re-opened for an investigation into the incident.\n\nSometime later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table. After escaping, she goes outside to find Raccoon City deserted and in ruins. The film ends with Alice grabbing a shotgun from an abandoned police car and walking through the streets.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n{{Cast listing |\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Alice\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Rain Ocampo\n* [[Eric Mabius]] as Matthew \"Matt\" Addison\n* [[James Purefoy]] as Spence Parks\n* [[Martin Crewes]] as Chad Kaplan\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as James \"One\" Shade\n* Ryan McCluskey as Mr. Grey\n* Oscar Pearce as Mr. Green\n* [[Indra Ov\u00e9]] as Ms. Black\n* Anna Bolt as Dr. Green\n* [[Joseph May]] as Dr. Blue\n* Robert Tannion as Dr. Brown\n* [[Heike Makatsch]] as Dr. Lisa Addison\n* [[Stephen Billington]] as Mr. White\n* [[Fiona Glascott]] as Ms. Gold\n* [[Pasquale Aleardi]] as J.D.

Described as being action and horror packed, and also very violent, the script was similar to the original game. Some changes were made; for example, there was no mention of the [[Umbrella Corporation]] or [[List of Resident Evil characters#STARS|STARS]]. Instead the plot was about a [[special forces]] team sent by the government to rescue scientists from the mansion laboratory after the [[SWAT|S.W.A.T team]] that was sent in earlier was killed, but during the story they would realize that entire mission was a trap for them and that they are specimens in a medical experiment. The special forces team included all the characters from the game. The script also included all the game's monsters, and the team would have to fight each of them. McElroy's script was rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/constantin-buys-evil-rights-1117433527/|title=Constantin buys 'Evil' rights|author=Variety Staff|date=January 14, 1997 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/979|title=Resident Evil: The Movie!!! |author=staff|website=[[Ain't it Cool News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimson-head.com/apps/forums/topics/show/13319068-alan-mcelroy-resident-evil-script|title=Alan McElroy Resident Evil Script |website=Crimson Head Elder}}</ref><ref>Fangoria #171, April 1998</ref><ref>https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-242, page 31</ref>\n\nIn 1998, [[George A. Romero]] directed a television commercial for the video game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]''. The original game's director, [[Shinji Mikami]], was a fan of Romero and had been influenced by [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|his films]]. The commercial was only shown in Japan, but impressed Sony enough for them to ask him to write and direct ''Resident Evil''. Romero stated that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. Romero's screenplay was based on the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and included characters from the video games. [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Jill Valentine]] were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. [[Barry Burton]], [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]], [[Ada Wong]], and [[Albert Wesker]] were to also appear. The ending to the film would have been similar to the [[Resident Evil (1996 video game)#Endings|''best'' ending]] to the first ''Resident Evil'' game. In 2002 interview for a [[Fangoria]] article about the film, Romero said how he wrote total of five or six different drafts, but his script was rejected as well. Robert Kulzer, head of the production, said in same article how although Romero's script was good, the movie would have received an [[NC-17 rating]] if they went with it. He also said how they thought that McElroy did a pretty good job with his script, but the reason why that one was rejected was because by the time it was finished the second game came out and they felt that the movie based on first game would have been dated and boring. After Romero left the project, other writers and directors were involved in it for the next couple of years before movie finally went into production.<ref>https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_211/page/n15, pages 17-19</ref><ref name=rom-var>{{cite web| url=https://variety.com/2016/film/spotlight/resident-evil-george-romero-failed-1201942677/| title=Why George Romero's 'Resident Evil' Film Failed to Launch| work=Variety| date=December 16, 2016| accessdate=August 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Resident Evil Original Screenplay | publisher = Dailyscript.com | url = http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/resident_evil_romero.html |last1= Romero |first1= George A. |authorlink= George A.

S. Anderson]].<ref name=\"Worldwide\"/> The film stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Eric Mabius]], [[James Purefoy]], [[Martin Crewes]], and [[Colin Salmon]]. It is the first installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is loosely based on the [[Resident Evil|video game series of the same name]].\n\nBorrowing elements from the video games ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', the film follows [[amnesia]]c heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and a band of [[Umbrella Corporation]] commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-virus at a secret underground facility. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing more than $100 million worldwide.\n\nThe film received five sequels: ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' (2004), ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' (2007), ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'' (2010), ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'' (2012), and ''[[Resident Evil: The Final Chapter]]'' (2016).\n\n==Plot==\nUnderneath [[Resident Evil#The%20Arklay%20Mountain%20and%20Raccoon%20City%20incidents|Raccoon City]] exists a [[genetic research]] facility called the Hive, owned by the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility's [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]], seals the Hive and kills everyone inside.\n\n[[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] awakens in the bathroom of a deserted mansion with temporary amnesia. She dresses, checks the mansion, and is tackled by an unknown person as a group of commandos led by James Shade breaks in. Alice's attacker is cuffed and then released when he claims to be Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. Alice and Matt are ordered to go down to the Hive with the group, where they find another amnesiac, Spence, hidden in their train. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence were assigned to guard the Hive's secret entrance under the mansion.\n\nAt the Red Queen's chamber, a laser defense system kills Shade and three more commandos. Despite the Red Queen's urgent pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables it, causing the power to fail and all of the doors in the Hive to open. This releases the zombified staff and containment units containing Lickers, creatures created through experimentation with the T-virus. When everyone regroups, they are ambushed by a horde of zombies, and a gunfight ensues. J.D. perishes as the group is overwhelmed. A bitten Rain retreats with Kaplan and Spence; Matt becomes separated from Alice, who starts regaining her memories.\n\nMatt looks for information about his sister, Lisa, and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Red Queen's chamber, where the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before she then shoots him dead. They all reach safety except Kaplan, who is bitten and separated from the group.\n\nAlice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he was the thief who stole and purposefully released the T-virus, and hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. He turns against the others but is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. Spence retrieves the anti-virus but is then killed by a Licker purposely set upon him by the Red Queen. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal that a still-alive Kaplan shut down the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the anti-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.\n\nOn the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding on the train and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is attacked by a zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, and her head hits a button, opening a door and dropping the Licker under the train, which kills it. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open, and a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis Program]], and that the Hive is to be re-opened for an investigation into the incident.\n\nSometime later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table. After escaping, she goes outside to find Raccoon City deserted and in ruins. The film ends with Alice grabbing a shotgun from an abandoned police car and walking through the streets.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n{{Cast listing |\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Alice\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Rain Ocampo\n* [[Eric Mabius]] as Matthew \"Matt\" Addison\n* [[James Purefoy]] as Spence Parks\n* [[Martin Crewes]] as Chad Kaplan\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as James \"One\" Shade\n* Ryan McCluskey as Mr. Grey\n* Oscar Pearce as Mr. Green\n* [[Indra Ov\u00e9]] as Ms. Black\n* Anna Bolt as Dr. Green\n* [[Joseph May]] as Dr. Blue\n* Robert Tannion as Dr. Brown\n* [[Heike Makatsch]] as Dr. Lisa Addison\n* [[Stephen Billington]] as Mr. White\n* [[Fiona Glascott]] as Ms. Gold\n* [[Pasquale Aleardi]] as J.D.

McElroy]] to write the script.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Magazine Biz|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=104|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1997|page=16}}</ref> The May 1998 issue of ''[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine|PlayStation Magazine]]'' published an article titled ''Resident Evil: The Movie'', about McElroy's script. Described as being action and horror packed, and also very violent, the script was similar to the original game. Some changes were made; for example, there was no mention of the [[Umbrella Corporation]] or [[List of Resident Evil characters#STARS|STARS]]. Instead the plot was about a [[special forces]] team sent by the government to rescue scientists from the mansion laboratory after the [[SWAT|S.W.A.T team]] that was sent in earlier was killed, but during the story they would realize that entire mission was a trap for them and that they are specimens in a medical experiment. The special forces team included all the characters from the game. The script also included all the game's monsters, and the team would have to fight each of them. McElroy's script was rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/constantin-buys-evil-rights-1117433527/|title=Constantin buys 'Evil' rights|author=Variety Staff|date=January 14, 1997 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/979|title=Resident Evil: The Movie!!! |author=staff|website=[[Ain't it Cool News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimson-head.com/apps/forums/topics/show/13319068-alan-mcelroy-resident-evil-script|title=Alan McElroy Resident Evil Script |website=Crimson Head Elder}}</ref><ref>Fangoria #171, April 1998</ref><ref>https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-242, page 31</ref>\n\nIn 1998, [[George A. Romero]] directed a television commercial for the video game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]''. The original game's director, [[Shinji Mikami]], was a fan of Romero and had been influenced by [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|his films]]. The commercial was only shown in Japan, but impressed Sony enough for them to ask him to write and direct ''Resident Evil''. Romero stated that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. Romero's screenplay was based on the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and included characters from the video games. [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Jill Valentine]] were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. [[Barry Burton]], [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]], [[Ada Wong]], and [[Albert Wesker]] were to also appear. The ending to the film would have been similar to the [[Resident Evil (1996 video game)#Endings|''best'' ending]] to the first ''Resident Evil'' game. In 2002 interview for a [[Fangoria]] article about the film, Romero said how he wrote total of five or six different drafts, but his script was rejected as well. Robert Kulzer, head of the production, said in same article how although Romero's script was good, the movie would have received an [[NC-17 rating]] if they went with it. He also said how they thought that McElroy did a pretty good job with his script, but the reason why that one was rejected was because by the time it was finished the second game came out and they felt that the movie based on first game would have been dated and boring. After Romero left the project, other writers and directors were involved in it for the next couple of years before movie finally went into production.<ref>https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_211/page/n15, pages 17-19</ref><ref name=rom-var>{{cite web| url=https://variety.com/2016/film/spotlight/resident-evil-george-romero-failed-1201942677/| title=Why George Romero's 'Resident Evil' Film Failed to Launch| work=Variety| date=December 16, 2016| accessdate=August 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Resident Evil Original Screenplay | publisher = Dailyscript.com | url = http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/resident_evil_romero.html |last1= Romero |first1= George A. |authorlink= George A.

Organization has curtailed some of its international work, pulling out of deals in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Brazil]], while pledging to do no new foreign deals (though it has apparently resurrected an old deal in the [[Dominican Republic]]). Trump's international hotel licensing and management business makes up only $220 million of his estimated $3.5 billion fortune, but it's the most dynamic part of the Trump portfolio\u2014and it throws off chunks of cash with virtually no risk. As the Trumps have wound down some international deals, they continue to push forward with new domestic agreements.</blockquote>\n\nEric Trump, in the ''Forbes'' article, discussed the \"clear separation of church and state that we maintain\" between the business and his father and said that with his father's presidency and related changes \"[y]ou could look at it either way\" in terms of business prospects. He also said that \"he will continue to update his father on the business while he is in the presidency{{nbsp}}... 'probably quarterly{{nbsp}}... profitability reports and stuff like that'.\" The article quoted Larry Noble, general counsel of the nonpartisan [[Campaign Legal Center]] and a former chief [[Ethics in Government Act|ethics officer]] at the [[Federal Election Commission]], and President [[George W. Bush]]'s former chief ethics lawyer, [[Richard Painter]], as looking negatively at such multiple planned updates of President Trump per year.<ref name=Forbes01/> Noble said in part \"if he is now going to get reports from his son about the businesses, then he really isn't separate in any real way.\" Painter said in part \"at the end of the day, he owns the business. He has the conflicts that come with it.\"<ref name=Forbes01/>\n\nAlso in March 2017, ''Forbes'' did a listing of all \"36 mini-Trumps\", as it termed the domestic and international partners\u2014often described as \"billionaires\"\u2014with whom the Trump Organization has worked over the years. Introducing the listing, the magazine reported that at least 14 of the partners attended the president's inauguration and some of them paid for $18,000-a-night accommodations at the [[Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C.|Trump International Hotel]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], for the event.<ref name=Forbes03/>\n\n== Real estate ==\n\n[[File:Trump Organization properties worldwide map.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map highlights countries with properties that are either owned or licensed by the Trump Organization as of December 2016.<ref name=\"real-estate-trump\">{{cite web|title=Trump Real Estate Portfolio|url=http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/|website=The Trump Organization|accessdate=December 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202000421/http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/|archive-date=December 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"trump-golf-list\">{{cite web|title=Trump Golf|url=http://www.trump.com/golf/|website=The Trump Organization|accessdate=December 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122192245/http://www.trump.com/golf/|archive-date=November 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\nAs of 2019, Trump's net worth (as estimated by ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'') is $3.1 billion, with about half of that coming from his New York City real estate holdings, and about a third coming from his national and international properties (including hotels and golf courses).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/donald-trump |title=The Definitive Net Worth of Donald Trump\u2014Forbes.com |access-date=March 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306141913/https://www.forbes.com/donald-trump/ |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Licensing fees paid by outside owners for using Trump's name on their properties also contribute to his overall net worth<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.moneysense.ca/news/donald-trump-to-unveil-details-of-his-personal-fortune/ | title=$10 billion man?

The [[National Urban League]] had sent black and white testers to apply for apartments in Trump-owned complexes; the white people got the apartments, whereas the black peoples did not. According to court records, four superintendents or rental agents reported that applications sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were coded by race. A 1979 ''[[Village Voice]]'' article quoted a rental agent who said Fred Trump had instructed him not to rent to black people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. In 1975, a [[consent decree]] described by the head of DOJ's housing division as \"one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated\" required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers and list vacancies with the Urban League. The Justice Department subsequently stated that continuing \"racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has occurred with such frequency that it has created a substantial impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity.\"<ref>Barrett, Wayne; Campbell, Jon (July 20, 2015).

Organization has curtailed some of its international work, pulling out of deals in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Brazil]], while pledging to do no new foreign deals (though it has apparently resurrected an old deal in the [[Dominican Republic]]). Trump's international hotel licensing and management business makes up only $220 million of his estimated $3.5 billion fortune, but it's the most dynamic part of the Trump portfolio\u2014and it throws off chunks of cash with virtually no risk. As the Trumps have wound down some international deals, they continue to push forward with new domestic agreements.</blockquote>\n\nEric Trump, in the ''Forbes'' article, discussed the \"clear separation of church and state that we maintain\" between the business and his father and said that with his father's presidency and related changes \"[y]ou could look at it either way\" in terms of business prospects. He also said that \"he will continue to update his father on the business while he is in the presidency{{nbsp}}... 'probably quarterly{{nbsp}}... profitability reports and stuff like that'.\" The article quoted Larry Noble, general counsel of the nonpartisan [[Campaign Legal Center]] and a former chief [[Ethics in Government Act|ethics officer]] at the [[Federal Election Commission]], and President [[George W.

The [[National Urban League]] had sent black and white testers to apply for apartments in Trump-owned complexes; the white people got the apartments, whereas the black peoples did not. According to court records, four superintendents or rental agents reported that applications sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were coded by race. A 1979 ''[[Village Voice]]'' article quoted a rental agent who said Fred Trump had instructed him not to rent to black people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. In 1975, a [[consent decree]] described by the head of DOJ's housing division as \"one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated\" required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers and list vacancies with the Urban League. The Justice Department subsequently stated that continuing \"racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has occurred with such frequency that it has created a substantial impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity.\"<ref>Barrett, Wayne; Campbell, Jon (July 20, 2015).

If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.  This process is used for red blood cell diseases such as sickle cell crises or severe malaria.  The automated red blood cell collection procedure for donating erythrocytes is referred to as 'Double Reds' or 'Double Red Cell Apheresis.'<ref>[http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm dtm double red cell<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705090407/http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Plateletpheresis]] (thrombapheresis, thrombocytapheresis) \u2013 [[platelet|blood platelets]]. Plateletpheresis is the collection of platelets by apheresis while returning the RBCs, WBCs, and component plasma. The yield is normally the equivalent of between six and ten random platelet concentrates. Quality control demands the platelets from apheresis be equal to or greater than 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> in number and have a pH of equal to or greater than 6.2 in 90% of the products tested and must be used within five days.\n* [[Leukapheresis]] \u2013 [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells). Leukopheresis is the removal of [[Granulocyte|PMN]]s, basophils, eosinophils for transfusion into patients whose PMNs are ineffective or where traditional therapy has failed.  There is limited data to suggest the benefit of granulocyte infusion.  The complications of this procedure are the difficulty in collection and short shelf life (24 hours at 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Since the \"buffy coat\" layer sits directly atop the RBC layer, HES, a sedimenting agent, is employed to improve yield while minimizing RBC collection.  Quality control demands the resultant concentrate be 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> granulocytes in 75% of the units tested and that the product be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease (inactivate lymphocytes).  Irradiation does not affect PMN function.  Since there is usually a small amount of RBCs collected, ABO compatibility should be employed when feasible.\n* Stem cell harvesting \u2013 circulating [[bone marrow]] cells are harvested to use in [[bone marrow transplantation]].\n\n==== Donor safety ====\n\n* Single use kits \u2013 Apheresis is done using single-use kits, so there is no risk of infection from blood-contaminated tubing or centrifuge.\n* Immune system effects \u2013 \"the immediate decreases in blood lymphocyte counts and serum immunoglobulin concentrations are of slight to moderate degree and are without known adverse effects.

That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a [[Volume expander#Types|crystalloid]] like [[normal saline]] (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up [[oncotic pressure]]. Some institutions use [[normal serum albumin]], but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the linguistic term|Apheresis (linguistics)}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Pheresis|Phoresis}}\n{{More footnotes|article|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox interventions |\n  Name        = Apheresis |\n  Image       = Image:Apheresis.svg |\n  Caption     = Whole blood enters the centrifuge (1) and separates into plasma (2), leukocytes (3), and erythrocytes (4).

It is thus an [[extracorporeal]] therapy.\n\nThe apheresis machine was invented by American medical technologist Herb Cullis in 1972.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Did you know? 10 Historical Facts about Blood Transfusion\n| first = | last = \n| website = \n| date = \n| accessdate = 2019-01-23\n| url = https://www.nzblood.co.nz/news/2015/did-you-know-10-historical-facts-about-blood-transfusion/\n| language =  \n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nOne of the uses of apheresis is for collecting stem cells.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official CPC Certification Study Guide|last=Katherine|first=Abel|publisher=American Medical Association|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=128}}</ref> \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Method ==\n\nDepending on the substance that is being removed, different processes are employed in apheresis. If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.  This process is used for red blood cell diseases such as sickle cell crises or severe malaria.  The automated red blood cell collection procedure for donating erythrocytes is referred to as 'Double Reds' or 'Double Red Cell Apheresis.'<ref>[http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm dtm double red cell<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705090407/http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Plateletpheresis]] (thrombapheresis, thrombocytapheresis) \u2013 [[platelet|blood platelets]]. Plateletpheresis is the collection of platelets by apheresis while returning the RBCs, WBCs, and component plasma. The yield is normally the equivalent of between six and ten random platelet concentrates. Quality control demands the platelets from apheresis be equal to or greater than 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> in number and have a pH of equal to or greater than 6.2 in 90% of the products tested and must be used within five days.\n* [[Leukapheresis]] \u2013 [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells). Leukopheresis is the removal of [[Granulocyte|PMN]]s, basophils, eosinophils for transfusion into patients whose PMNs are ineffective or where traditional therapy has failed.  There is limited data to suggest the benefit of granulocyte infusion.  The complications of this procedure are the difficulty in collection and short shelf life (24 hours at 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Since the \"buffy coat\" layer sits directly atop the RBC layer, HES, a sedimenting agent, is employed to improve yield while minimizing RBC collection.  Quality control demands the resultant concentrate be 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> granulocytes in 75% of the units tested and that the product be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease (inactivate lymphocytes).  Irradiation does not affect PMN function.  Since there is usually a small amount of RBCs collected, ABO compatibility should be employed when feasible.\n* Stem cell harvesting \u2013 circulating [[bone marrow]] cells are harvested to use in [[bone marrow transplantation]].\n\n==== Donor safety ====\n\n* Single use kits \u2013 Apheresis is done using single-use kits, so there is no risk of infection from blood-contaminated tubing or centrifuge.\n* Immune system effects \u2013 \"the immediate decreases in blood lymphocyte counts and serum immunoglobulin concentrations are of slight to moderate degree and are without known adverse effects.

These guidelines are based upon a systematic review of available scientific literature.  Clinical utility for a given disease is denoted by assignment of an '''ASFA Category''' (I \u2013 IV).  The quality and strength of evidence are denoted by standard [[Evidence-based medicine#GRADE working group|GRADE]] recommendations. ASFA Categories are defined as follows:\n* '''Category I''' for disorders where therapeutic apheresis is accepted as a first line treatment,\n* '''Category II''' for disorders where therapeutic apheresis is accepted as a second-line treatment, \n* '''Category III''' for disorders where the optimal role of therapeutic apheresis is not clearly established and \n* '''Category IV''' for disorders where therapeutic apheresis is considered ineffective or harmful.\n\n===Diseases and disorders===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a [[Volume expander#Types|crystalloid]] like [[normal saline]] (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up [[oncotic pressure]]. Some institutions use [[normal serum albumin]], but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "name_user": "Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m", "label": "safe", "comment": "formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis"}
