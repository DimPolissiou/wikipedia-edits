Ivanchuk's nerves were notably exposed during the high-tension atmosphere of World Championship match-format tournaments, such as in 2002 where he was heavily favored in the FIDE championship final after having defeated defending champion Anand in the semifinals, only to lose to countryman [[Ruslan Ponomariov]] in a significant upset, denying him the World Championship. Subsequent match-play tournaments in World Championship cycles saw Ivanchuk consistently underperform; in the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004]], [[Chess World Cup 2005]], [[Chess World Cup 2007]], and [[Chess World Cup 2009]], he failed to advance past the third round despite being seeded No. 5, No. 1, No. 1 and No. 6 respectively in those events.\n\nIvanchuk's world championship aspirations were also dampened by the unfortunate title split 1993 to 2006. Due to obligations with FIDE, Ivanchuk and Anand did not participate in the 2002 Dortmund Candidates tournament for the [[Classical World Chess Championship 2004]].<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Yasser Seirawan]]|url=http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/pragueyass2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020609192256/http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/pragueyass2.html|archivedate=June 9, 2002|title=From a Fresh Start to a New Dawn \u2013 Part 2|work=[[The Week in Chess]]|date=2002|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was then narrowly excluded, on the basis of rating, from the rival [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2005]].

Ivanchuk's nerves were notably exposed during the high-tension atmosphere of World Championship match-format tournaments, such as in 2002 where he was heavily favored in the FIDE championship final after having defeated defending champion Anand in the semifinals, only to lose to countryman [[Ruslan Ponomariov]] in a significant upset, denying him the World Championship. Subsequent match-play tournaments in World Championship cycles saw Ivanchuk consistently underperform; in the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004]], [[Chess World Cup 2005]], [[Chess World Cup 2007]], and [[Chess World Cup 2009]], he failed to advance past the third round despite being seeded No. 5, No. 1, No. 1 and No. 6 respectively in those events.\n\nIvanchuk's world championship aspirations were also dampened by the unfortunate title split 1993 to 2006.

Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to [[Acid-base homeostasis|tight control of the pH]] of the [[extracellular fluids]] (ECF).  Over-breathing ([[hyperventilation]]) and under-breathing ([[hypoventilation]]), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. Both cause distressing symptoms.\n\nBreathing has other important functions. It provides a mechanism for [[speech]], [[laughter]] and similar expressions of the emotions. It is also used for [[reflex]]es such as [[yawning]], [[cough reflex|coughing]] and [[sneezing]].

The [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]] (between the [[nostril]]s and the [[pharynx]]) are quite narrow, firstly by being divided in two by the [[nasal septum]], and secondly by [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] walls that have several longitudinal folds, or shelves, called\n[[nasal concha]]e,<ref name=grays /> thus exposing a large area of [[Mucous membrane of nose|nasal mucous membrane]] to the air as it is inhaled (and exhaled).

The sticky mucus also traps much of the particulate matter that is breathed in, preventing it from reaching the lungs.<ref name=tortora1 /><ref name=grays>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Peter L |last2=Warwick |first2=Roger |last3=Dyson|first3=Mary |last4=Bannister |first4=Lawrence H. |title=Gray's Anatomy| pages=1172\u20131173, 1278\u20131282 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Churchill Livingstone | edition=Thirty-seventh |date=1989|isbn= 0443 041776 }}</ref>\n\n===Lower airways===\nThe anatomy of a typical mammalian respiratory system, below the structures normally listed among the \"upper airways\" (the nasal cavities, the pharynx, and larynx), is often described as a '''respiratory tree'''  or  '''tracheobronchial tree''' (figure on the left). Larger airways give rise to branches that are slightly narrower, but more numerous than the \"trunk\" airway that gives rise to the branches.  The human respiratory tree may consist of, on average, 23 such branchings into progressively smaller airways, while the respiratory tree of the [[mouse]] has up to 13 such branchings.  Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such as the trachea and bronchi) function mainly to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions such as the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli are specialized for [[gas exchange]].<ref name=tortora1 /><ref name=gilroy>{{cite book|last1=Gilroy|first1=Anne M.|last2=MacPherson|first2= Brian R.|last3= Ross|first3=Lawrence M.|title= Atlas of Anatomy|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|date=2008|pages=108\u2013111|isbn=978-1-60406-062-1}}</ref>\n\nThe trachea and the first portions of the main bronchi are outside the lungs. The rest of the \"tree\" branches within the lungs, and ultimately extends to every part of the [[lung]]s.\n\nThe alveoli are the blind-ended terminals of the \"tree\", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit via the same route it used to enter the alveoli. A system such as this creates [[Dead space (physiology)|dead space]], a volume of air that fills the airways (the dead space) at the end of inhalation, and is breathed out, unchanged, during the next exhalation, never having reached the alveoli. Similarly, the dead space is filled with alveolar air at the end of exhalation, and is the first air to breathed back into the alveoli, before any fresh air reaches the alveoli during inhalation. The dead space volume of a typical adult human is about 150&nbsp;ml.\n\n==Gas exchange==\n{{Main|Gas exchange}}\nThe primary purpose of breathing is to bring atmospheric air (in small doses) into the alveoli where [[gas exchange]] with the gases in the blood takes place. The equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the alveolar blood and the alveolar air occurs by [[Diffusion#Diffusion vs. bulk flow|diffusion]]. At the end of each exhalation, the adult human lungs still contain 2,500\u20133,000 mL of air, their [[functional residual capacity]] or FRC. With each breath (inhalation) only as little as about 350 mL of warm, moistened atmospherically is added, and well mixed, with the FRC. Consequently, the gas composition of the FRC changes very little during the breathing cycle. Since the pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates with this virtually unchanging mixture of air in the lungs (which has a substantially different composition from that of the ambient air), the partial pressures of the arterial blood gases also do not change with each breath. The tissues are therefore not exposed to swings in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the blood during the breathing cycle, and the [[peripheral chemoreceptor|peripheral]] and [[central chemoreceptors]] do not need to \"choose\" the point in the breathing cycle at which the blood gases need to be measured, and responded to. Thus the homeostatic control of the breathing rate simply depends on the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This then also maintains  [[Acid\u2013base homeostasis|the constancy of the pH]] of the blood.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\n==Control==\n\n{{Main|Control of ventilation}}\nThe rate and depth of breathing is automatically controlled by the [[respiratory center]]s that receive information from the [[peripheral chemoreceptors|peripheral]] and [[central chemoreceptors]]. These [[chemoreceptor]]s continuously monitor the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood. The sensors are, firstly, the central chemoreceptors on the surface of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the [[brain stem]] which are particularly sensitive to [[pH]] as well as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and [[cerebrospinal fluid]].<ref name=tortora1 /> The second group of sensors measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. Together the latter is known as the peripheral chemoreceptors which are situated in the [[Aortic body|aortic]] and [[carotid body|carotid bodies]].<ref name=tortora1 /> Information from all of these chemoreceptors is conveyed to the [[respiratory center]]s in the [[pons]] and [[medulla oblongata]], which responds to deviations in the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood from normal by adjusting the rate and depth of breathing, in such a way as to restore partial pressure of carbon dioxide back to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg), the pH to 7.4 and, to a lesser extent, the partial pressure of oxygen to 13&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg).<ref name=tortora1 /> For instance, [[Physical exercise|exercise]] increases the production of carbon dioxide by the active muscles. This carbon dioxide diffuses into the venous blood and ultimately raises the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This is immediately sensed by the carbon dioxide chemoreceptors on the brain stem. The respiratory centers respond to this information by causing the rate and depth of breathing to increase to such an extent that the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood return almost immediately to the same levels as at rest. The respiratory centers communicate with the muscles of breathing via motor nerves, of which the [[phrenic nerve]]s, which innervate the diaphragm, are probably the most important.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nAutomatic breathing can be overridden to a limited extent by simple choice, or to facilitate [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[speech]], [[singing]] or other [[vocal]] training. It is impossible to suppress the urge to breathe to the point of hypoxia but training can increase the ability to breath-hold.\n\nOther automatic breathing control reflexes also exist. Submersion, particularly of the face, in cold water, triggers a response called the [[diving reflex]].<ref name=\"pann\">{{cite journal|pmc=3768097|year=2013|author1=Michael Panneton|first1=W|title=The Mammalian Diving Response: An Enigmatic Reflex to Preserve Life?|journal=Physiology|volume=28|issue=5|pages=284\u2013297|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2013|pmid=23997188}}</ref><ref name=\"Physiology and Pathophysiology\">{{cite journal|title=The physiology and pathophysiology of human breath-hold diving|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/106/1/284 |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=106 |issue=1 |date=1 January 2009 |pages=284\u2013292 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.90991.2008 |pmid=18974367 |first1=Peter |last1=Lindholm |first2=Claes EG |last2=Lundgren |accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>  This firstly has the result of shutting down the airways against the influx of water.

At altitude, a pressure differential is still required to drive air into and out of the lungs as it is at sea level. The mechanism for breathing at altitude is essentially identical to breathing at sea level but with the following differences:\n\nThe atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, roughly halving with every {{convert|5500|m|ft}} rise in altitude.<ref name=altitude>{{cite web|url=http://www.altitude.org/calculators/air_pressure.php|title=Online high altitude oxygen calculator|publisher=altitude.org|accessdate=15 August 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729214053/http://www.altitude.org/calculators/air_pressure.php|archivedate=29 July 2012}}</ref> The composition of atmospheric air is, however, almost constant below 80&nbsp;km, as a result of the continuous mixing effect of the weather.<ref name = tyson /> The concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O<sub>2</sub> per liter of air) therefore decreases at the same rate as the atmospheric pressure.<ref name = tyson>{{cite book |last1=Tyson |first1=P.D.|last2=Preston-White|first2=R.A. |title=The weather and climate of Southern Africa. |location=Cape Town |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2013| pages= 3\u201310, 14\u201316, 360|isbn=9780195718065 }}</ref> At sea level, where the [[ambient pressure]] is about 100&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]], oxygen contributes 21% of the atmosphere and the partial pressure of oxygen ({{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}}) is 21&nbsp;kPa (i.e. 21% of 100&nbsp;kPa). At the summit of [[Mount Everest]], {{convert|8848|m|ft}}, where the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7&nbsp;kPa, oxygen still contributes 21% of the atmosphere but its partial pressure is only 7.1&nbsp;kPa (i.e. 21% of 33.7&nbsp;kPa = 7.1&nbsp;kPa).<ref name = tyson /> Therefore, a greater volume of air must be inhaled at altitude than at sea level in order to breath in the same amount of oxygen in a given period.\n\nDuring inhalation, air is warmed and saturated with [[Vapour pressure of water|water vapor]] as it passes through the nose and [[pharynx]] before it enters the alveoli. The ''saturated'' vapor pressure of water is dependent only on temperature; at a body core temperature of 37&nbsp;\u00b0C it is 6.3&nbsp;kPa (47.0&nbsp;mmHg), regardless of any other influences, including altitude.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. |last2=Lenter| first2= C.|title=Scientific Tables| location=Basle, Switzerland|publisher=Ciba-Geigy |date=1970|edition= Seventh| pages= 257\u2013258 }}</ref> Consequently, at sea level, the ''tracheal'' air (immediately before the inhaled air enters the alveoli) consists of: water vapor ({{math|''P''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>}} = 6.3&nbsp;kPa), nitrogen ({{math|''P''<sub>N<sub>2</sub></sub>}} = 74.0&nbsp;kPa), oxygen ({{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} = 19.7&nbsp;kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases, a total of 100&nbsp;kPa. In dry air, the {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} at sea level is 21.0&nbsp;kPa, compared to a {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} of 19.7&nbsp;kPa in the tracheal air (21% of [100 \u2013 6.3] = 19.7&nbsp;kPa). At the summit of Mount Everest tracheal air has a total pressure of 33.7&nbsp;kPa, of which 6.3&nbsp;kPa is water vapor,  reducing the {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} in the tracheal air to 5.8&nbsp;kPa (21% of [33.7 \u2013 6.3] = 5.8&nbsp;kPa), beyond what is accounted for by a reduction of atmospheric pressure alone (7.1&nbsp;kPa).\n\nThe [[pressure gradient]] forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is also reduced by altitude. Doubling the volume of the lungs halves the pressure in the lungs at any altitude. Having the sea level air pressure (100&nbsp;kPa) results in a pressure gradient of 50&nbsp;kPa but doing the same at 5500&nbsp;m, where the atmospheric pressure is 50&nbsp;kPa, a doubling of the volume of the lungs results in a pressure gradient of the only 25&nbsp;kPa. In practice, because we breathe in a gentle, cyclical manner that generates pressure gradients of only 2\u20133&nbsp;kPa, this has little effect on the actual rate of inflow into the lungs and is easily compensated for by breathing slightly deeper.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koen |first1=Chrisvan L. |last2=Koeslag |first2=Johan H. | title=On the stability of subatmospheric intrapleural and intracranial pressures |journal= News in Physiological Sciences | date=1995 |volume=10 |pages=176\u2013178 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=West |first1=J.B. |title=Respiratory physiology: the essentials. |location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |date=1985| pages= 21\u201330, 84\u201384, 98\u2013101 }}</ref> The lower [[viscosity]] of air at altitude allows air to flow more easily and this also helps compensate for any loss of pressure gradient.\n\nAll of the above effects of low atmospheric pressure on breathing are normally accommodated by increasing the respiratory minute volume (the volume of air breathed in  \u2013 ''or'' out \u2013 per minute), and the mechanism for doing this is automatic. The exact increase required is determined by the [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|respiratory gases homeostatic mechanism]], which regulates the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} and {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}}. This [[Homeostasis|homeostatic mechanism]] prioritizes the regulation of the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}} over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}} is maintained at very close to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (or 40&nbsp;mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}}, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the atmospheric {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}}) falls to below 75% of its value at sea level, oxygen [[homeostasis]] is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about {{convert|2500|m|ft}}. If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperventilation at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}} with a consequent rise in the [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH of the arterial plasma]] leading to [[respiratory alkalosis]]. This is one contributor to [[Altitude sickness|high altitude sickness]]. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.\n\n===Breathing at depth===\n[[File:Breathing Resistance.svg|thumb|300px|Typical breathing effort when breathing through a diving regulator]]\nPressure increases with the depth of water at the rate of about one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] \u2013 slightly more than 100 kPa, or one [[Bar (unit)|bar]], for every 10 meters.  Air breathed underwater by [[underwater diving|divers]] is at the ambient pressure of the surrounding water and this has a complex range of physiological and biochemical implications.  If not properly managed, breathing compressed gasses underwater may lead to several [[diving disorder]]s which include [[Barotrauma#Pulmonary barotrauma|pulmonary barotrauma]], [[decompression sickness]], [[nitrogen narcosis]], and [[oxygen toxicity]].  The effects of breathing gasses under pressure are further complicated by the use of one or more [[Breathing gas|special gas mixtures]].\n\nAir is provided by a [[diving regulator]], which reduces the high pressure in a [[diving cylinder]] to the ambient pressure. The [[breathing performance of regulators]] is a factor when choosing a suitable regulator for the [[Scuba diving#Types of diving|type of diving]] to be undertaken. It is desirable that breathing from a regulator requires low effort even when supplying large amounts of air. It is also recommended that it supplies air smoothly without any sudden changes in resistance while inhaling or exhaling. In the graph, right, note the initial spike in pressure on exhaling to open the exhaust valve and that the initial drop in pressure on inhaling is soon overcome as the [[Venturi effect]] designed into the regulator to allow an easy draw of air. Many regulators have an adjustment to change the ease of inhaling so that breathing is effortless.\n\n==Respiratory disorders==\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n|  name        = Breathing Patterns\n|  image       = File:Breathing abnormalities.svg\n|  caption     = Graph showing normal as well as different kinds of pathological breathing patterns.\n\n| pronounce       = \n| specialty       = \n| symptoms        =\n| complications   =\n| onset           =\n| duration        =\n| types           = \n| causes          =\n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       =\n| differential    =\n| prevention      =\n| treatment       =\n| medication      =\n| prognosis       =\n| frequency       =\n| deaths          = \n}}\nAbnormal breathing patterns include [[Kussmaul breathing]], [[Biot's respiration]] and [[Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration]].\n\nOther breathing disorders include [[shortness of breath]] (dyspnea), [[stridor]], [[apnea]], [[sleep apnea]] (most commonly [[obstructive sleep apnea]]), [[mouth breathing]], and [[snoring]].

[[Singing|Singers]] also rely on [[Singing#Breath control|breath control]].\n\nCommon cultural expressions related to breathing include: \"to catch my breath\", \"took my breath away\", \"inspiration\", \"to expire\", \"get my breath back\".\n\n===Breathing and mood===\nCertain breathing patterns have a tendency to occur with certain moods. Due to this relationship, practitioners of various disciplines consider that they can encourage the occurrence of a particular mood by adopting the breathing pattern that it most commonly occurs in conjunction with. For instance, and perhaps the most common recommendation is that deeper breathing which utilizes the diaphragm and abdomen more can encourage a more relaxed and confident mood. Practitioners of different disciplines often interpret the importance of breathing regulation and its perceived influence on mood in different ways. Buddhists may consider that it helps precipitate a sense of inner-peace, holistic healers that it encourages an overall state of health<ref>Hobert, Ingfried, 'Healthy Breathing \u2013 The Right Breathing' in ''Guide to Holistic Healing in the New Millenium'', Munchen: Verlag Peter Erd, 1999, pp. 48\u201349</ref> and business advisers that it provides relief from work-based stress.\n\n===Breathing and physical exercise===\nDuring physical exercise, a deeper breathing pattern is adapted to facilitate greater oxygen absorption. An additional reason for the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern is to strengthen the body's core. During the process of deep breathing, the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower position in the core and this helps to generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hanslindgren.com/articles/diaphragm-function-for-core-stability/ | title=Diaphragm function for core stability \u00bb Hans Lindgren DC}}</ref> Typically, this allows for more powerful physical movements to be performed. As such, it is frequently recommended when lifting heavy weights to take a deep breath or adopt a deeper breathing pattern.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Medicine}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* {{annotated link|Agonal respiration}}\n* {{annotated link|Ataxic respiration}}\n* {{annotated link|Bad breath}}\n* {{annotated link|Breath gas analysis}}\n* {{annotated link|Breathing gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon cycle}}\n* {{annotated link|Central sleep apnea}}\n* {{annotated link|Eupnea}}\n* {{annotated link|Liquid breathing}}\n* {{annotated link|Nasal cycle}}\n* {{annotated link|Nitrogen washout}}\n* {{annotated link|Respiratory adaptation}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Parkes M | title=Breath-holding and its breakpoint | journal=Exp Physiol | volume=91 | issue=1 | pages=1\u201315 | year=2006 | pmid=16272264 | doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2005.031625}} ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090328130104/http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/content/full/91/1/1 Full text]''\n\n{{Respiratory physiology}}\n{{Circulatory and respiratory system symptoms and signs}}\n{{Underwater diving}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Respiration]]\n[[Category:Reflexes]]\n[[Category:Human body]]\n[[Category:Gases]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Breath}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Process of moving air into and out of the lungs}}\n[[File:Real-time MRI - Thorax.ogv|thumb|upright=1.4|Real-time [[magnetic resonance imaging]] of the human thorax during breathing]]\n[[File:X-ray video of a female American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) while breathing - pone.0004497.s009.ogv|thumb|upright=1.4|X-ray video of a female [[American alligator]] while breathing.]]\n'''Breathing''' (or '''ventilation''')  is the process of moving [[air]] into and out of the [[lung]]s to facilitate [[gas exchange]] with the [[Milieu int\u00e9rieur|internal environment]], mostly by bringing in [[oxygen]] and flushing out [[carbon dioxide]]. \n\nAll aerobic creatures need oxygen for [[cellular respiration]], which uses the oxygen to break down foods for energy and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product.

Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to [[Acid-base homeostasis|tight control of the pH]] of the [[extracellular fluids]] (ECF).  Over-breathing ([[hyperventilation]]) and under-breathing ([[hypoventilation]]), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. Both cause distressing symptoms.\n\nBreathing has other important functions. It provides a mechanism for [[speech]], [[laughter]] and similar expressions of the emotions. It is also used for [[reflex]]es such as [[yawning]], [[cough reflex|coughing]] and [[sneezing]]. Animals that cannot [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] by [[perspiration]], because they lack sufficient [[sweat gland]]s, may lose heat by evaporation through panting.\n\n==Mechanics==\n{{Further|Muscles of respiration}}\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| header = The \"pump handle\" and \"bucket handle movements\" of the ribs \n| width1 = 200\n| image1 = ribcage during inhalation.jpg\n| caption1 = The effect of the [[Muscles of respiration|muscles of inhalation]] in expanding the [[rib cage]].

However, at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also causing the [[rib cage]] to expand during inhalation (see diagram on another side of the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation causes the rib cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting positions.

The end-exhalatory lung volume is now less air than the resting \"functional residual capacity\".<ref name=tortora1 /> However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human, there is always still at least one liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\n[[Diaphragmatic breathing]] causes the abdomen to rhythmically bulge out and fall back. It is, therefore, often referred to as \"abdominal breathing\". These terms are often used interchangeably because they describe the same action.\n\nWhen the accessory muscles of inhalation are activated, especially during [[labored breathing]], the clavicles are pulled upwards, as explained above. This external manifestation of the use of the accessory muscles of inhalation is sometimes referred to as [[clavicular breathing]], seen especially during [[asthma]] attacks and in people with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].\n\n==Passage of air==\n{{Main|Respiratory tract}}\n\n===Upper airways===\n[[File:illu quiz lung05.jpg|thumb|left|240px|'''The lower airways'''.{{ordered list |[[Vertebrate trachea|Trachea]] |[[Main bronchus|Mainstem bronchus]] |[[Secondary bronchus|Lobar bronchus]] |[[Tertiary bronchus|Segmental bronchus]] |[[Bronchiole]] |[[Alveolar duct]] |[[Pulmonary alveolus|Alveolus]]}}]]\n[[File:Nose in cold weather.gif|thumb|200px|Inhaled air is warmed and moistened by the wet, warm nasal mucosa, which consequently cools and dries.

The [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]] (between the [[nostril]]s and the [[pharynx]]) are quite narrow, firstly by being divided in two by the [[nasal septum]], and secondly by [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] walls that have several longitudinal folds, or shelves, called\n[[nasal concha]]e,<ref name=grays /> thus exposing a large area of [[Mucous membrane of nose|nasal mucous membrane]] to the air as it is inhaled (and exhaled). This causes the inhaled air to take up moisture from the wet [[mucus]], and warmth from the underlying blood vessels, so that the air is very nearly saturated with [[water vapor]] and is at almost body temperature by the time it reaches the [[larynx]].<ref name=tortora1 /> Part of this moisture and heat is recaptured as the exhaled air moves out over the partially dried-out, cooled mucus in the nasal passages, during breathing out. The sticky mucus also traps much of the particulate matter that is breathed in, preventing it from reaching the lungs.<ref name=tortora1 /><ref name=grays>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Peter L |last2=Warwick |first2=Roger |last3=Dyson|first3=Mary |last4=Bannister |first4=Lawrence H. |title=Gray's Anatomy| pages=1172\u20131173, 1278\u20131282 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Churchill Livingstone | edition=Thirty-seventh |date=1989|isbn= 0443 041776 }}</ref>\n\n===Lower airways===\nThe anatomy of a typical mammalian respiratory system, below the structures normally listed among the \"upper airways\" (the nasal cavities, the pharynx, and larynx), is often described as a '''respiratory tree'''  or  '''tracheobronchial tree''' (figure on the left). Larger airways give rise to branches that are slightly narrower, but more numerous than the \"trunk\" airway that gives rise to the branches.  The human respiratory tree may consist of, on average, 23 such branchings into progressively smaller airways, while the respiratory tree of the [[mouse]] has up to 13 such branchings.  Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such as the trachea and bronchi) function mainly to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions such as the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli are specialized for [[gas exchange]].<ref name=tortora1 /><ref name=gilroy>{{cite book|last1=Gilroy|first1=Anne M.|last2=MacPherson|first2= Brian R.|last3= Ross|first3=Lawrence M.|title= Atlas of Anatomy|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|date=2008|pages=108\u2013111|isbn=978-1-60406-062-1}}</ref>\n\nThe trachea and the first portions of the main bronchi are outside the lungs. The rest of the \"tree\" branches within the lungs, and ultimately extends to every part of the [[lung]]s.\n\nThe alveoli are the blind-ended terminals of the \"tree\", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit via the same route it used to enter the alveoli. A system such as this creates [[Dead space (physiology)|dead space]], a volume of air that fills the airways (the dead space) at the end of inhalation, and is breathed out, unchanged, during the next exhalation, never having reached the alveoli. Similarly, the dead space is filled with alveolar air at the end of exhalation, and is the first air to breathed back into the alveoli, before any fresh air reaches the alveoli during inhalation. The dead space volume of a typical adult human is about 150&nbsp;ml.\n\n==Gas exchange==\n{{Main|Gas exchange}}\nThe primary purpose of breathing is to bring atmospheric air (in small doses) into the alveoli where [[gas exchange]] with the gases in the blood takes place. The equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the alveolar blood and the alveolar air occurs by [[Diffusion#Diffusion vs. bulk flow|diffusion]]. At the end of each exhalation, the adult human lungs still contain 2,500\u20133,000 mL of air, their [[functional residual capacity]] or FRC. With each breath (inhalation) only as little as about 350 mL of warm, moistened atmospherically is added, and well mixed, with the FRC. Consequently, the gas composition of the FRC changes very little during the breathing cycle. Since the pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates with this virtually unchanging mixture of air in the lungs (which has a substantially different composition from that of the ambient air), the partial pressures of the arterial blood gases also do not change with each breath. The tissues are therefore not exposed to swings in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the blood during the breathing cycle, and the [[peripheral chemoreceptor|peripheral]] and [[central chemoreceptors]] do not need to \"choose\" the point in the breathing cycle at which the blood gases need to be measured, and responded to. Thus the homeostatic control of the breathing rate simply depends on the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This then also maintains  [[Acid\u2013base homeostasis|the constancy of the pH]] of the blood.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\n==Control==\n\n{{Main|Control of ventilation}}\nThe rate and depth of breathing is automatically controlled by the [[respiratory center]]s that receive information from the [[peripheral chemoreceptors|peripheral]] and [[central chemoreceptors]]. These [[chemoreceptor]]s continuously monitor the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood. The sensors are, firstly, the central chemoreceptors on the surface of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the [[brain stem]] which are particularly sensitive to [[pH]] as well as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and [[cerebrospinal fluid]].<ref name=tortora1 /> The second group of sensors measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. Together the latter is known as the peripheral chemoreceptors which are situated in the [[Aortic body|aortic]] and [[carotid body|carotid bodies]].<ref name=tortora1 /> Information from all of these chemoreceptors is conveyed to the [[respiratory center]]s in the [[pons]] and [[medulla oblongata]], which responds to deviations in the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood from normal by adjusting the rate and depth of breathing, in such a way as to restore partial pressure of carbon dioxide back to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg), the pH to 7.4 and, to a lesser extent, the partial pressure of oxygen to 13&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;mm&nbsp;Hg).<ref name=tortora1 /> For instance, [[Physical exercise|exercise]] increases the production of carbon dioxide by the active muscles. This carbon dioxide diffuses into the venous blood and ultimately raises the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This is immediately sensed by the carbon dioxide chemoreceptors on the brain stem. The respiratory centers respond to this information by causing the rate and depth of breathing to increase to such an extent that the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood return almost immediately to the same levels as at rest. The respiratory centers communicate with the muscles of breathing via motor nerves, of which the [[phrenic nerve]]s, which innervate the diaphragm, are probably the most important.<ref name=tortora1 />\n\nAutomatic breathing can be overridden to a limited extent by simple choice, or to facilitate [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[speech]], [[singing]] or other [[vocal]] training. It is impossible to suppress the urge to breathe to the point of hypoxia but training can increase the ability to breath-hold.\n\nOther automatic breathing control reflexes also exist. Submersion, particularly of the face, in cold water, triggers a response called the [[diving reflex]].<ref name=\"pann\">{{cite journal|pmc=3768097|year=2013|author1=Michael Panneton|first1=W|title=The Mammalian Diving Response: An Enigmatic Reflex to Preserve Life?|journal=Physiology|volume=28|issue=5|pages=284\u2013297|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2013|pmid=23997188}}</ref><ref name=\"Physiology and Pathophysiology\">{{cite journal|title=The physiology and pathophysiology of human breath-hold diving|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/106/1/284 |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=106 |issue=1 |date=1 January 2009 |pages=284\u2013292 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.90991.2008 |pmid=18974367 |first1=Peter |last1=Lindholm |first2=Claes EG |last2=Lundgren |accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>  This firstly has the result of shutting down the airways against the influx of water.

The ''saturated'' vapor pressure of water is dependent only on temperature; at a body core temperature of 37&nbsp;\u00b0C it is 6.3&nbsp;kPa (47.0&nbsp;mmHg), regardless of any other influences, including altitude.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. |last2=Lenter| first2= C.|title=Scientific Tables| location=Basle, Switzerland|publisher=Ciba-Geigy |date=1970|edition= Seventh| pages= 257\u2013258 }}</ref> Consequently, at sea level, the ''tracheal'' air (immediately before the inhaled air enters the alveoli) consists of: water vapor ({{math|''P''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>}} = 6.3&nbsp;kPa), nitrogen ({{math|''P''<sub>N<sub>2</sub></sub>}} = 74.0&nbsp;kPa), oxygen ({{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} = 19.7&nbsp;kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases, a total of 100&nbsp;kPa. In dry air, the {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} at sea level is 21.0&nbsp;kPa, compared to a {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} of 19.7&nbsp;kPa in the tracheal air (21% of [100 \u2013 6.3] = 19.7&nbsp;kPa). At the summit of Mount Everest tracheal air has a total pressure of 33.7&nbsp;kPa, of which 6.3&nbsp;kPa is water vapor,  reducing the {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} in the tracheal air to 5.8&nbsp;kPa (21% of [33.7 \u2013 6.3] = 5.8&nbsp;kPa), beyond what is accounted for by a reduction of atmospheric pressure alone (7.1&nbsp;kPa).\n\nThe [[pressure gradient]] forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is also reduced by altitude. Doubling the volume of the lungs halves the pressure in the lungs at any altitude. Having the sea level air pressure (100&nbsp;kPa) results in a pressure gradient of 50&nbsp;kPa but doing the same at 5500&nbsp;m, where the atmospheric pressure is 50&nbsp;kPa, a doubling of the volume of the lungs results in a pressure gradient of the only 25&nbsp;kPa. In practice, because we breathe in a gentle, cyclical manner that generates pressure gradients of only 2\u20133&nbsp;kPa, this has little effect on the actual rate of inflow into the lungs and is easily compensated for by breathing slightly deeper.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koen |first1=Chrisvan L. |last2=Koeslag |first2=Johan H. | title=On the stability of subatmospheric intrapleural and intracranial pressures |journal= News in Physiological Sciences | date=1995 |volume=10 |pages=176\u2013178 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=West |first1=J.B. |title=Respiratory physiology: the essentials. |location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |date=1985| pages= 21\u201330, 84\u201384, 98\u2013101 }}</ref> The lower [[viscosity]] of air at altitude allows air to flow more easily and this also helps compensate for any loss of pressure gradient.\n\nAll of the above effects of low atmospheric pressure on breathing are normally accommodated by increasing the respiratory minute volume (the volume of air breathed in  \u2013 ''or'' out \u2013 per minute), and the mechanism for doing this is automatic. The exact increase required is determined by the [[Homeostasis#Blood partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide|respiratory gases homeostatic mechanism]], which regulates the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}} and {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}}. This [[Homeostasis|homeostatic mechanism]] prioritizes the regulation of the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}} over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}} is maintained at very close to 5.3&nbsp;kPa (or 40&nbsp;mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}}, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the atmospheric {{math|''P''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>}}) falls to below 75% of its value at sea level, oxygen [[homeostasis]] is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about {{convert|2500|m|ft}}. If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperventilation at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial {{math|''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>}} with a consequent rise in the [[Homeostasis#Extracellular fluid pH|pH of the arterial plasma]] leading to [[respiratory alkalosis]]. This is one contributor to [[Altitude sickness|high altitude sickness]]. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.\n\n===Breathing at depth===\n[[File:Breathing Resistance.svg|thumb|300px|Typical breathing effort when breathing through a diving regulator]]\nPressure increases with the depth of water at the rate of about one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] \u2013 slightly more than 100 kPa, or one [[Bar (unit)|bar]], for every 10 meters.  Air breathed underwater by [[underwater diving|divers]] is at the ambient pressure of the surrounding water and this has a complex range of physiological and biochemical implications.  If not properly managed, breathing compressed gasses underwater may lead to several [[diving disorder]]s which include [[Barotrauma#Pulmonary barotrauma|pulmonary barotrauma]], [[decompression sickness]], [[nitrogen narcosis]], and [[oxygen toxicity]].  The effects of breathing gasses under pressure are further complicated by the use of one or more [[Breathing gas|special gas mixtures]].\n\nAir is provided by a [[diving regulator]], which reduces the high pressure in a [[diving cylinder]] to the ambient pressure. The [[breathing performance of regulators]] is a factor when choosing a suitable regulator for the [[Scuba diving#Types of diving|type of diving]] to be undertaken. It is desirable that breathing from a regulator requires low effort even when supplying large amounts of air. It is also recommended that it supplies air smoothly without any sudden changes in resistance while inhaling or exhaling. In the graph, right, note the initial spike in pressure on exhaling to open the exhaust valve and that the initial drop in pressure on inhaling is soon overcome as the [[Venturi effect]] designed into the regulator to allow an easy draw of air. Many regulators have an adjustment to change the ease of inhaling so that breathing is effortless.\n\n==Respiratory disorders==\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n|  name        = Breathing Patterns\n|  image       = File:Breathing abnormalities.svg\n|  caption     = Graph showing normal as well as different kinds of pathological breathing patterns.\n\n| pronounce       = \n| specialty       = \n| symptoms        =\n| complications   =\n| onset           =\n| duration        =\n| types           = \n| causes          =\n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       =\n| differential    =\n| prevention      =\n| treatment       =\n| medication      =\n| prognosis       =\n| frequency       =\n| deaths          = \n}}\nAbnormal breathing patterns include [[Kussmaul breathing]], [[Biot's respiration]] and [[Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration]].\n\nOther breathing disorders include [[shortness of breath]] (dyspnea), [[stridor]], [[apnea]], [[sleep apnea]] (most commonly [[obstructive sleep apnea]]), [[mouth breathing]], and [[snoring]]. Many conditions are associated with obstructed airways. [[Hypopnea]] refers to overly [[shallow breathing]]; [[hyperpnea]] refers to fast and deep breathing brought on by a demand for more oxygen, as for example by exercise. The terms [[hypoventilation]] and [[hyperventilation]] also refer to shallow breathing and fast and deep breathing respectively, but under inappropriate circumstances or disease. However, this distinction (between, for instance, hyperpnea and hyperventilation) is not always adhered to, so that these terms are frequently used interchangeably.<ref name=\"Dorlands\">{{Citation |last1=Andreoli| first1= Thomas E. |display-authors=etal | publisher = Saunders |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |edition= 30th |pages= 887, 891, 897, 900 |location= Philadelphia, PA |url=http://dorlands.com/ }}</ref>\n\nA range of [[breath test]]s can be used to diagnose diseases such as dietary intolerances.\nA [[rhinomanometry|rhinomanometer]] uses acoustic technology to examine the air flow through the nasal passages.<ref>{{citation |page=101 |title=Functional Reconstructive Nasal Surgery |author1=E.

Historically, breath has often been considered in terms of the concept of life force. The [[Hebrew Bible]] refers to God breathing the breath of life into clay to make Adam a living soul ([[nephesh]]). It also refers to the breath as returning to God when a mortal dies. The terms [[spirit]], [[prana]], the Polynesian [[mana]], the Hebrew [[ruach]] and the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] in psychology are related to the concept of breath.<ref>[http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/2730/6/?spage=14&letter=P psych-, psycho-, -psyche, -psychic, -psychical, -psychically + (Greek: mind, spirit, consciousness; mental processes; the human soul; breath of life)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn [[T'ai chi]], [[aerobic exercise]] is combined with specific breathing exercises to strengthen the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm muscles]], improve posture and make better use of the body's [[Qi]], (energy). Different forms of [[meditation]], and [[yoga]] advocate various breathing methods. A form of [[Buddhist meditation]] called [[anapanasati]] meaning mindfulness of breath was first introduced by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Breathing disciplines are incorporated into [[meditation]], certain forms of [[yoga]] such as [[pranayama]], and the [[Buteyko method]] as a treatment for asthma and other conditions.<ref>Swami Saradananda, The Power of Breath, Castle House: Duncan Baird Publishers, 2009</ref>\n\nIn music, some [[wind instrument]] players use a technique called [[circular breathing]].  [[Singing|Singers]] also rely on [[Singing#Breath control|breath control]].\n\nCommon cultural expressions related to breathing include: \"to catch my breath\", \"took my breath away\", \"inspiration\", \"to expire\", \"get my breath back\".\n\n===Breathing and mood===\nCertain breathing patterns have a tendency to occur with certain moods. Due to this relationship, practitioners of various disciplines consider that they can encourage the occurrence of a particular mood by adopting the breathing pattern that it most commonly occurs in conjunction with. For instance, and perhaps the most common recommendation is that deeper breathing which utilizes the diaphragm and abdomen more can encourage a more relaxed and confident mood. Practitioners of different disciplines often interpret the importance of breathing regulation and its perceived influence on mood in different ways. Buddhists may consider that it helps precipitate a sense of inner-peace, holistic healers that it encourages an overall state of health<ref>Hobert, Ingfried, 'Healthy Breathing \u2013 The Right Breathing' in ''Guide to Holistic Healing in the New Millenium'', Munchen: Verlag Peter Erd, 1999, pp. 48\u201349</ref> and business advisers that it provides relief from work-based stress.\n\n===Breathing and physical exercise===\nDuring physical exercise, a deeper breathing pattern is adapted to facilitate greater oxygen absorption. An additional reason for the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern is to strengthen the body's core. During the process of deep breathing, the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower position in the core and this helps to generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hanslindgren.com/articles/diaphragm-function-for-core-stability/ | title=Diaphragm function for core stability \u00bb Hans Lindgren DC}}</ref> Typically, this allows for more powerful physical movements to be performed. As such, it is frequently recommended when lifting heavy weights to take a deep breath or adopt a deeper breathing pattern.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Medicine}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* {{annotated link|Agonal respiration}}\n* {{annotated link|Ataxic respiration}}\n* {{annotated link|Bad breath}}\n* {{annotated link|Breath gas analysis}}\n* {{annotated link|Breathing gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon cycle}}\n* {{annotated link|Central sleep apnea}}\n* {{annotated link|Eupnea}}\n* {{annotated link|Liquid breathing}}\n* {{annotated link|Nasal cycle}}\n* {{annotated link|Nitrogen washout}}\n* {{annotated link|Respiratory adaptation}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{cite journal | author=Parkes M | title=Breath-holding and its breakpoint | journal=Exp Physiol | volume=91 | issue=1 | pages=1\u201315 | year=2006 | pmid=16272264 | doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2005.031625}} ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090328130104/http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/content/full/91/1/1 Full text]''\n\n{{Respiratory physiology}}\n{{Circulatory and respiratory system symptoms and signs}}\n{{Underwater diving}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Respiration]]\n[[Category:Reflexes]]\n[[Category:Human body]]\n[[Category:Gases]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "27.34.48.30", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"}
{"title_page": "Anusvara", "text_new": "{{short description|Diacritic in Indic scripts}}\n{{Diacritical marks|{{lang|hi|\u0902}}}}\n'''Anusvara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|\u0905\u0928\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930}} ''{{IAST|anusv\u0101ra}}'') is a symbol used in many [[Indic scripts]] to mark a type of [[nasalization|nasal sound]], typically transliterated {{grapheme|\u1e43}}. Depending on its location in the word and the language for which it is used, its exact pronunciation can vary. In the context of ancient [[Sanskrit]], ''anusvara'' is the name of the particular nasal sound itself, regardless of written representation.\n\n== Sanskrit ==\nIn [[Vedic Sanskrit]], the anusv\u0101ra (lit. \"after-sound\" or \"subordinate sound\"){{Sfn|Allen|1953|p=40}} was an [[allophonic]] (derived) nasal sound.\n\nThe exact nature of the sound has been subject to debate. The material in the various [[Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya| ancient phonetic treatises]] points towards different phonetic interpretations, and these discrepancies have historically been attributed to either differences in the description of the same pronunciation<ref>[[William Dwight Whitney|Whitney]], cited in {{Harvnb|Emeneau|1946|p=91}}</ref> or to dialectal or diachronic variation.{{sfn|Varma|1961|pp=148\u201355}}{{sfn|Emeneau|1946|p=91}} In a 2013 reappraisal of the evidence, Cardona concludes that these reflect real dialectal differences.{{sfn|Cardona|2013}}\n\nThe environments in which the anusvara could arise, however, were well defined. In the earliest [[Vedic Sanskrit]], it was an allophone of /m/ at a [[morpheme]] boundary, or of /n/ within morphemes, when it was preceded by a vowel and followed by a [[fricative]] ({{IAST|/\u015b/, /\u1e63/, /s/, /h/}}).{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=40}} In later Sanskrit its use expanded to other contexts, first before /r/ under certain conditions, then, in [[Classical Sanskrit]], before {{IAST|/l/}} and {{IAST|/y/}}.{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=40}} Later still, {{IAST|[[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]}} gave anusvara as an alternative pronunciation{{fix|text=of what?}} in word-final [[sandhi]], and later treatises also prescribed it at morpheme junctions and within morphemes.{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=41}} In the later written language, the diacritic used to represent anusvara was optionally used to indicate a [[nasal stop]] having the same [[place of articulation]] as a following [[plosive]].\n\n== Devanagari script ==\nIn the [[Devanagari script]], anusvara is represented with a [[Dot (diacritic)|dot]] (''bindu'') above the letter (e.g. <big>\u092e\u0902</big>). In the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] (IAST), the corresponding symbol is \u1e43 (''m'' with an [[underdot]]). Some transcriptions render notation of phonetic variants used in some Vedic [[shakha]]s  with variant transcription (\u1e41).\n\nIn writing Sanskrit, the anusvara is often used as an alternative representation of the nasal stop with the same place of articulation as the following plosive. For example, {{IPA|[\u0259\u014b\u0261\u0259]}} 'limb (of the body)' may be written with either a conjunct, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917 ''a\u1e45ga'', or with an anusvara, \u0905\u0902\u0917 ''a\u1e43ga''. A variant of the anusvara, the [[anun\u0101sika]] or 'candrabindu', was used more explicitly for nasalized vowels, as in \u0905\u0901\u0936 ''a\u1e43\u015ba'' for {{IPA|[\u0259\u0303\u0255\u0259]}} 'portion'.<ref name=\"DB\">William Bright, \"The Devanagari Script\", in Daniels & Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', OUP, 1996.</ref>\n\n=== Hindi ===\nIn  [[Standard Hindi]], the {{IAST|anusv\u0101ra|}} is traditionally defined as representing a nasal consonant [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] to a following [[plosive]], in contrast to the {{lang|hi-Latn|[[Chandrabindu|candrabindu]]}} ({{lang|hi-Latn|anun\u0101sika}}), which indicates [[nasal vowel|vowel nasalization]]. In practice, however, the two are often used interchangeably.\n\nThe precise phonetic value of the phoneme, whether it is represented by {{lang|hi-Latn|anusv\u0101ra|}} or {{lang|hi-Latn|[[Chandrabindu|candrabindu]]}}, is dependent on the phonological environment.<ref>The following rules are from {{Harvtxt|Ohala|1983|pp=87\u201390}}</ref>\n\nWord-finally it is realized as nasalization of the preceding vowel: ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ku\u0101\u1e43}}'' {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0303\u00e3\u02d0]}}, \"a well\". It results in vowel nasalization also medially between a short vowel and a non-[[obstruent]] (''{{lang|hi-Latn|ku\u1e43var}}'' {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0303\u028b\u0259r]}} \"a youth\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ga\u1e43\u1e5b\u0101s\u0101}}'' {{IPA|[\u0261\u0259\u0303\u027da\u02d0sa\u02d0]}} \"a long-handled axe\") and, in native words, between a long vowel and a voiceless plosive (''{{lang|hi-Latn|d\u0101\u1e43t}}'' {{IPA|[d\u00e3\u02d0t]}} \"tooth\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|s\u0101\u1e43p}}'' {{IPA|[s\u00e3\u02d0p]}} \"a snake\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|p\u016b\u1e43ch}}'' {{IPA|[p\u0169\u02d0t\u0283\u02b0]}} \"tail\").\n\nIt is pronounced as a homorganic nasal, with the preceding vowel becoming nasalized [[allophone|allophonically]], in the following cases: between a long vowel and a voiced plosive (''{{lang|hi-Latn|t\u0101\u1e43b\u0101}}'' {{IPA|[ta\u02d0mba\u02d0]}} \"copper\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|c\u0101\u1e43d\u012b}}'' {{IPA|[t\u0283a\u02d0ndi\u02d0]}} \"silver\"), between a long vowel and a voiceless plosive in loanwords (''{{lang|hi-Latn|d\u0101\u1e43t}}'' {{IPA|[da\u02d0nt]}} \"repressed\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|bai\u1e43k}}'' {{IPA|[b\u00e6\u02d0\u014bk]}} \"a bank\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|khaz\u0101\u1e43c\u012b}}'' {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u0259za\u02d0\u0272t\u0283i\u02d0]}}), and between a short vowel and an obstruent (''{{lang|hi-Latn|sa\u1e43bh\u0101l-}}'' {{IPA|[s\u0259mb\u02b1a\u02d0l]}} \"to support\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|sa\u1e43d\u016bk}}'' {{IPA|[s\u0259ndu\u02d0k]}} \"a chest\").\n\nThe last rule has two sets of exceptions where the {{lang|hi-Latn|anusv\u0101ra|}} effects only a nasalization of the preceding short vowel. Words from the first set are morphologically derived from words with a long nasalized vowel (''{{lang|hi-Latn|ba\u1e43\u1e6d-}}''  {{IPA|[b\u0259\u0303\u0288]}}, \"to be divided\"  from ''{{lang|hi-Latn|b\u0101\u1e43\u1e6d-}}'' {{IPA|[b\u00e3\u0288]}}, \"to divide\";  ''{{lang|hi-Latn|si\u1e43c\u0101\u012b}}'' {{IPA|[s\u026a\u0303t\u0283ai]}}, \"irrigation\" from ''{{lang|hi-Latn|s\u012b\u1e43c-}}'' {{IPA|[s\u0129\u02d0t\u0283]}}, \"to irrigate\"). In suchs cases, the vowel is sometimes denasalized ({{IPA|[b\u0259\u0288]}}, {{IPA|[s\u026at\u0283ai]}} instead of {{IPA|[b\u0259\u0303\u0288-]}}, {{IPA|[s\u026a\u0303t\u0283ai]}}). The second set is composed of a few words like ''({{lang|hi-Latn|pahu\u1e43c-}}'' {{IPA|[pah\u028a\u0303t\u0283]}}, \"to arrive\" and ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43s-}}'' {{IPA|[h\u0259\u0303s]}}, \"to laugh\").<ref group=\"note\">{{Harvtxt|Ohala|1983|p=90}} lists five more such words: ''{{lang|hi-Latn|dha\u1e43s-}}'' \"to sink\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|pha\u1e43s-}}'' \"to be stuck\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43sl\u012b}}'' \"a necklace\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43siy\u0101}}'' \"a sickle\" and ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43s\u012b}}'' \"laughter\".</ref>\n\n=== Marathi ===\nIn [[Marathi Language|Marathi]] the anusvara is pronounced as a [[nasal consonant|nasal]] that is [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] to the following consonant (with the same [[place of articulation]]). For example, it is pronounced as the [[dental nasal]] \u0928\u094d before [[dental consonant]]s, as the [[bilabial nasal]] \u092e\u094d before [[bilabial consonants]], etc.{{citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=sounds quite plausible, but the phonetivs of nasals in South Asian languages can be complex so the claim might as well turn out to be false.}}\n\n===Nepali===\nIn [[Nepali language|Nepali]], chandrabindu and anusvara have the same pronunciation similarly to Hindi. Therefore, there is a great deal of variation regarding which occurs in any given position. Many words containing anusvara thus have alternative spellings with [[chandrabindu]] instead of anusvara and vice versa.\n\n==Other Indic script languages==\nAnusvara is used in other languages using [[Indic scripts]] as well, usually to represent suprasegmental phones (such as [[phonation]] type or nasalization) or other nasal sounds.\n\n===Bengali===\n[[File:Bengali Letter Anusvara.svg|thumb|50px]]\nIn the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]], the anusvara diacritic (<big>\u0985\u09a8\u09c1\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u09b0</big> ''onushshar'' in Bengali) is written as a circle above a slanted line (<big>\u0982</big>), and represents {{IPAslink|\u014b}}. It is used in the name of the Bengali language <big>\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be</big> {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}}. It has merged in pronunciation with the letter <big>\u0999</big> ''ung\u00f4'' in Bengali. Although the anusvara is a consonant in [[Bengali phonology]], it is nevertheless treated in the written system as a diacritic in that it is always directly adjacent to the preceding consonant, even when consonants are spaced, apart in titles or banners: <big>\u09ac\u09be\u0982-\u09b2\u09be-\u09a6\u09c7-\u09b6</big> ''bang-la-de-sh'', not <big>\u09ac\u09be-\u0982-\u09b2\u09be-\u09a6\u09c7-\u09b6</big> ''ba-ng-la-de-sh'' for <big>\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6</big> ''[[Bangladesh]]'' It is never pronounced with the inherent vowel \"\u00f4\", and it cannot take a vowel sign (instead, the consonant <big>\u0999</big> ''ung\u00f4'' is used pre-vocalically).\n\n===Burmese===\nIn the [[Burmese script]], the anusvara ({{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1000\u103a\u1019\u103c\u1005\u103a}} ''auk myit'' {{IPA-my|a\u028a\u0294 mj\u026a\u0294|IPA}}) is represented as a dot underneath a nasalised final to indicate a [[Burmese language#Tones|creaky tone]] (with a shortened vowel). Burmese also uses a dot above to indicate the {{IPA|/-\u0274/}} nasalized ending (called \"Myanmar Sign Anusvara\" in Unicode), called {{my|\u101e\u1031\u1038\u101e\u1031\u1038\u1010\u1004\u103a}} ''thay thay tin'' ({{IPA-my|\u03b8\u00e9 \u00f0\u00e9 t\u026a\u0300\u0270\u0303|IPA}})\n\n===Sinhala===\nIn the [[Sinhala script]], the anusvara is not a nonspacing combining mark but an spacing combining mark. It has circular shape and follows its base letter ( \u0d82).<ref>See an example in Anshuman Pandey\u2019s ''Proposal to encode a nasal character in Vedic Extensions'', [https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17117r-vedic-double-antargomukha.pdf L2/17-117R].</ref> It is called {{transl|si|binduva}} in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], which means \"dot\". The anusvara represents {{IPAslink|\u014b}} at the end of a syllable. It is used in fact, in the name of the [[Sinhala language]] \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd {{IPA-si|\u02c8si\u014b\u0266\u0259l\u0259|}}. It has merged in pronunciation with the letter \u0d9e \u1e45a in Sinhala.\n\n===Telugu===\nThe [[Telugu script]] has full-zero (anusv\u0101ra) \u0c02 , half-zero (arthanusv\u0101ra) and ''visarga'' to convey various shades of nasal sounds. Anusvara is represented as a circle shape after a letter:<ref>{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=18}}</ref> \u0c15 - ka and \u0c15\u0c02 - kam.\n\n===Thai===\nThe equivalent of the anusvara in the [[Thai alphabet]] is the [[Thai alphabet#anusvara|''nikkhahit'']], which is used when rendering Sanskrit and [[Pali]] texts. It is written as an open circle above the consonant (for example {{lang|th|\u0e2d\u0e4d}}) and its pronunciation depends on the following sound: if it is a consonant then the nikkhahit is pronounced as a homorganic nasal, and if it is at the end of a word it is pronounced as the velar nasal {{IPA|\u014b}}.{{cn|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Anunasika==\n'''Anunasika''' (''{{IAST|anun\u0101sika}}'') is a form of [[Nasal vowel|vowel nasalization]], often represented by an anusvara. It is a form of open mouthed nasalization, akin to the nasalization of vowels followed by \"n\" or \"m\" in Parisian [[French language|French]]. When \"n\" or \"m\" follow a vowel, the \"n\" or \"m\" becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasal (pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part or all of the air to leave through the nostrils). Anunasika is sometimes called a ''subdot'' because of its [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]] representation.\n\nIn [[Devanagari]] and related orthographies, it is represented by the [[chandrabindu]] diacritic (''example'': \u092e\u0901 ).\n\nIn [[Burmese language|Burmese]], the anunasika, called {{my|\u101e\u1031\u1038\u101e\u1031\u1038\u1010\u1004\u103a}} ({{IPA-my|\u03b8\u00e9 \u00f0\u00e9 t\u026a\u0300\u0270\u0303|IPA}}) and represented as {{angbr|{{lang|my|\u1036}}}}, creates the {{IPA|/-\u0270\u0303/}} nasalized ending when it is attached as a dot above a letter. The anunasika represents the -m final in Pali.\n\n== Unicode ==\n[[Unicode]] encodes anusvara and anusvara-like characters for a variety of scripts:\n\n{|\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ South Asian scripts\n!

Depending on its location in the word and the language for which it is used, its exact pronunciation can vary. In the context of ancient [[Sanskrit]], ''anusvara'' is the name of the particular nasal sound itself, regardless of written representation.\n\n== Sanskrit ==\nIn [[Vedic Sanskrit]], the anusv\u0101ra (lit. \"after-sound\" or \"subordinate sound\"){{Sfn|Allen|1953|p=40}} was an [[allophonic]] (derived) nasal sound.\n\nThe exact nature of the sound has been subject to debate. The material in the various [[Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya| ancient phonetic treatises]] points towards different phonetic interpretations, and these discrepancies have historically been attributed to either differences in the description of the same pronunciation<ref>[[William Dwight Whitney|Whitney]], cited in {{Harvnb|Emeneau|1946|p=91}}</ref> or to dialectal or diachronic variation.{{sfn|Varma|1961|pp=148\u201355}}{{sfn|Emeneau|1946|p=91}} In a 2013 reappraisal of the evidence, Cardona concludes that these reflect real dialectal differences.{{sfn|Cardona|2013}}\n\nThe environments in which the anusvara could arise, however, were well defined. In the earliest [[Vedic Sanskrit]], it was an allophone of /m/ at a [[morpheme]] boundary, or of /n/ within morphemes, when it was preceded by a vowel and followed by a [[fricative]] ({{IAST|/\u015b/, /\u1e63/, /s/, /h/}}).{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=40}} In later Sanskrit its use expanded to other contexts, first before /r/ under certain conditions, then, in [[Classical Sanskrit]], before {{IAST|/l/}} and {{IAST|/y/}}.{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=40}} Later still, {{IAST|[[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]}} gave anusvara as an alternative pronunciation{{fix|text=of what?}} in word-final [[sandhi]], and later treatises also prescribed it at morpheme junctions and within morphemes.{{sfn|Allen|1953|p=41}} In the later written language, the diacritic used to represent anusvara was optionally used to indicate a [[nasal stop]] having the same [[place of articulation]] as a following [[plosive]].\n\n== Devanagari script ==\nIn the [[Devanagari script]], anusvara is represented with a [[Dot (diacritic)|dot]] (''bindu'') above the letter (e.g. <big>\u092e\u0902</big>). In the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] (IAST), the corresponding symbol is \u1e43 (''m'' with an [[underdot]]). Some transcriptions render notation of phonetic variants used in some Vedic [[shakha]]s  with variant transcription (\u1e41).\n\nIn writing Sanskrit, the anusvara is often used as an alternative representation of the nasal stop with the same place of articulation as the following plosive. For example, {{IPA|[\u0259\u014b\u0261\u0259]}} 'limb (of the body)' may be written with either a conjunct, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917 ''a\u1e45ga'', or with an anusvara, \u0905\u0902\u0917 ''a\u1e43ga''. A variant of the anusvara, the [[anun\u0101sika]] or 'candrabindu', was used more explicitly for nasalized vowels, as in \u0905\u0901\u0936 ''a\u1e43\u015ba'' for {{IPA|[\u0259\u0303\u0255\u0259]}} 'portion'.<ref name=\"DB\">William Bright, \"The Devanagari Script\", in Daniels & Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', OUP, 1996.</ref>\n\n=== Hindi ===\nIn  [[Standard Hindi]], the {{IAST|anusv\u0101ra|}} is traditionally defined as representing a nasal consonant [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] to a following [[plosive]], in contrast to the {{lang|hi-Latn|[[Chandrabindu|candrabindu]]}} ({{lang|hi-Latn|anun\u0101sika}}), which indicates [[nasal vowel|vowel nasalization]]. In practice, however, the two are often used interchangeably.\n\nThe precise phonetic value of the phoneme, whether it is represented by {{lang|hi-Latn|anusv\u0101ra|}} or {{lang|hi-Latn|[[Chandrabindu|candrabindu]]}}, is dependent on the phonological environment.<ref>The following rules are from {{Harvtxt|Ohala|1983|pp=87\u201390}}</ref>\n\nWord-finally it is realized as nasalization of the preceding vowel: ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ku\u0101\u1e43}}'' {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0303\u00e3\u02d0]}}, \"a well\". It results in vowel nasalization also medially between a short vowel and a non-[[obstruent]] (''{{lang|hi-Latn|ku\u1e43var}}'' {{IPA|[k\u028a\u0303\u028b\u0259r]}} \"a youth\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ga\u1e43\u1e5b\u0101s\u0101}}'' {{IPA|[\u0261\u0259\u0303\u027da\u02d0sa\u02d0]}} \"a long-handled axe\") and, in native words, between a long vowel and a voiceless plosive (''{{lang|hi-Latn|d\u0101\u1e43t}}'' {{IPA|[d\u00e3\u02d0t]}} \"tooth\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|s\u0101\u1e43p}}'' {{IPA|[s\u00e3\u02d0p]}} \"a snake\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|p\u016b\u1e43ch}}'' {{IPA|[p\u0169\u02d0t\u0283\u02b0]}} \"tail\").\n\nIt is pronounced as a homorganic nasal, with the preceding vowel becoming nasalized [[allophone|allophonically]], in the following cases: between a long vowel and a voiced plosive (''{{lang|hi-Latn|t\u0101\u1e43b\u0101}}'' {{IPA|[ta\u02d0mba\u02d0]}} \"copper\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|c\u0101\u1e43d\u012b}}'' {{IPA|[t\u0283a\u02d0ndi\u02d0]}} \"silver\"), between a long vowel and a voiceless plosive in loanwords (''{{lang|hi-Latn|d\u0101\u1e43t}}'' {{IPA|[da\u02d0nt]}} \"repressed\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|bai\u1e43k}}'' {{IPA|[b\u00e6\u02d0\u014bk]}} \"a bank\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|khaz\u0101\u1e43c\u012b}}'' {{IPA|[k\u02b0\u0259za\u02d0\u0272t\u0283i\u02d0]}}), and between a short vowel and an obstruent (''{{lang|hi-Latn|sa\u1e43bh\u0101l-}}'' {{IPA|[s\u0259mb\u02b1a\u02d0l]}} \"to support\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|sa\u1e43d\u016bk}}'' {{IPA|[s\u0259ndu\u02d0k]}} \"a chest\").\n\nThe last rule has two sets of exceptions where the {{lang|hi-Latn|anusv\u0101ra|}} effects only a nasalization of the preceding short vowel. Words from the first set are morphologically derived from words with a long nasalized vowel (''{{lang|hi-Latn|ba\u1e43\u1e6d-}}''  {{IPA|[b\u0259\u0303\u0288]}}, \"to be divided\"  from ''{{lang|hi-Latn|b\u0101\u1e43\u1e6d-}}'' {{IPA|[b\u00e3\u0288]}}, \"to divide\";  ''{{lang|hi-Latn|si\u1e43c\u0101\u012b}}'' {{IPA|[s\u026a\u0303t\u0283ai]}}, \"irrigation\" from ''{{lang|hi-Latn|s\u012b\u1e43c-}}'' {{IPA|[s\u0129\u02d0t\u0283]}}, \"to irrigate\"). In suchs cases, the vowel is sometimes denasalized ({{IPA|[b\u0259\u0288]}}, {{IPA|[s\u026at\u0283ai]}} instead of {{IPA|[b\u0259\u0303\u0288-]}}, {{IPA|[s\u026a\u0303t\u0283ai]}}). The second set is composed of a few words like ''({{lang|hi-Latn|pahu\u1e43c-}}'' {{IPA|[pah\u028a\u0303t\u0283]}}, \"to arrive\" and ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43s-}}'' {{IPA|[h\u0259\u0303s]}}, \"to laugh\").<ref group=\"note\">{{Harvtxt|Ohala|1983|p=90}} lists five more such words: ''{{lang|hi-Latn|dha\u1e43s-}}'' \"to sink\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|pha\u1e43s-}}'' \"to be stuck\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43sl\u012b}}'' \"a necklace\", ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43siy\u0101}}'' \"a sickle\" and ''{{lang|hi-Latn|ha\u1e43s\u012b}}'' \"laughter\".</ref>\n\n=== Marathi ===\nIn [[Marathi Language|Marathi]] the anusvara is pronounced as a [[nasal consonant|nasal]] that is [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] to the following consonant (with the same [[place of articulation]]). For example, it is pronounced as the [[dental nasal]] \u0928\u094d before [[dental consonant]]s, as the [[bilabial nasal]] \u092e\u094d before [[bilabial consonants]], etc.{{citation needed|date=December 2015|reason=sounds quite plausible, but the phonetivs of nasals in South Asian languages can be complex so the claim might as well turn out to be false.}}\n\n===Nepali===\nIn [[Nepali language|Nepali]], chandrabindu and anusvara have the same pronunciation similarly to Hindi. Therefore, there is a great deal of variation regarding which occurs in any given position. Many words containing anusvara thus have alternative spellings with [[chandrabindu]] instead of anusvara and vice versa.\n\n==Other Indic script languages==\nAnusvara is used in other languages using [[Indic scripts]] as well, usually to represent suprasegmental phones (such as [[phonation]] type or nasalization) or other nasal sounds.\n\n===Bengali===\n[[File:Bengali Letter Anusvara.svg|thumb|50px]]\nIn the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]], the anusvara diacritic (<big>\u0985\u09a8\u09c1\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u09b0</big> ''onushshar'' in Bengali) is written as a circle above a slanted line (<big>\u0982</big>), and represents {{IPAslink|\u014b}}. It is used in the name of the Bengali language <big>\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be</big> {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}}. It has merged in pronunciation with the letter <big>\u0999</big> ''ung\u00f4'' in Bengali. Although the anusvara is a consonant in [[Bengali phonology]], it is nevertheless treated in the written system as a diacritic in that it is always directly adjacent to the preceding consonant, even when consonants are spaced, apart in titles or banners: <big>\u09ac\u09be\u0982-\u09b2\u09be-\u09a6\u09c7-\u09b6</big> ''bang-la-de-sh'', not <big>\u09ac\u09be-\u0982-\u09b2\u09be-\u09a6\u09c7-\u09b6</big> ''ba-ng-la-de-sh'' for <big>\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6</big> ''[[Bangladesh]]'' It is never pronounced with the inherent vowel \"\u00f4\", and it cannot take a vowel sign (instead, the consonant <big>\u0999</big> ''ung\u00f4'' is used pre-vocalically).\n\n===Burmese===\nIn the [[Burmese script]], the anusvara ({{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1000\u103a\u1019\u103c\u1005\u103a}} ''auk myit'' {{IPA-my|a\u028a\u0294 mj\u026a\u0294|IPA}}) is represented as a dot underneath a nasalised final to indicate a [[Burmese language#Tones|creaky tone]] (with a shortened vowel). Burmese also uses a dot above to indicate the {{IPA|/-\u0274/}} nasalized ending (called \"Myanmar Sign Anusvara\" in Unicode), called {{my|\u101e\u1031\u1038\u101e\u1031\u1038\u1010\u1004\u103a}} ''thay thay tin'' ({{IPA-my|\u03b8\u00e9 \u00f0\u00e9 t\u026a\u0300\u0270\u0303|IPA}})\n\n===Sinhala===\nIn the [[Sinhala script]], the anusvara is not a nonspacing combining mark but an spacing combining mark. It has circular shape and follows its base letter ( \u0d82).<ref>See an example in Anshuman Pandey\u2019s ''Proposal to encode a nasal character in Vedic Extensions'', [https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2017/17117r-vedic-double-antargomukha.pdf L2/17-117R].</ref> It is called {{transl|si|binduva}} in [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], which means \"dot\". The anusvara represents {{IPAslink|\u014b}} at the end of a syllable. It is used in the name of the [[Sinhala language]] \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd {{IPA-si|\u02c8si\u014b\u0266\u0259l\u0259|}}. It has merged in pronunciation with the letter \u0d9e \u1e45a in Sinhala.\n\n===Telugu===\nThe [[Telugu script]] has full-zero (anusv\u0101ra) \u0c02 , half-zero (arthanusv\u0101ra) and ''visarga'' to convey various shades of nasal sounds. Anusvara is represented as a circle shape after a letter:<ref>{{cite book |title= A History of Telugu Literature |last= Chenchiah |first= P. |authorlink= |author2=Rao, Raja Bhujanga |year= 1988 |publisher= Asian Educational Services |location= |isbn= 81-206-0313-3 |page=18}}</ref> \u0c15 - ka and \u0c15\u0c02 - kam.\n\n===Thai===\nThe equivalent of the anusvara in the [[Thai alphabet]] is the [[Thai alphabet#anusvara|''nikkhahit'']], which is used when rendering Sanskrit and [[Pali]] texts. It is written as an open circle above the consonant (for example {{lang|th|\u0e2d\u0e4d}}) and its pronunciation depends on the following sound: if it is a consonant then the nikkhahit is pronounced as a homorganic nasal, and if it is at the end of a word it is pronounced as the velar nasal {{IPA|\u014b}}.{{cn|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Anunasika==\n'''Anunasika''' (''{{IAST|anun\u0101sika}}'') is a form of [[Nasal vowel|vowel nasalization]], often represented by an anusvara. It is a form of open mouthed nasalization, akin to the nasalization of vowels followed by \"n\" or \"m\" in Parisian [[French language|French]]. When \"n\" or \"m\" follow a vowel, the \"n\" or \"m\" becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasal (pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part or all of the air to leave through the nostrils). Anunasika is sometimes called a ''subdot'' because of its [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]] representation.\n\nIn [[Devanagari]] and related orthographies, it is represented by the [[chandrabindu]] diacritic (''example'': \u092e\u0901 ).\n\nIn [[Burmese language|Burmese]], the anunasika, called {{my|\u101e\u1031\u1038\u101e\u1031\u1038\u1010\u1004\u103a}} ({{IPA-my|\u03b8\u00e9 \u00f0\u00e9 t\u026a\u0300\u0270\u0303|IPA}}) and represented as {{angbr|{{lang|my|\u1036}}}}, creates the {{IPA|/-\u0270\u0303/}} nasalized ending when it is attached as a dot above a letter. The anunasika represents the -m final in Pali.\n\n== Unicode ==\n[[Unicode]] encodes anusvara and anusvara-like characters for a variety of scripts:\n\n{|\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ South Asian scripts\n!

Prince [[Hiranyakasipu]] refused to worship the god Vishnu. The prince's son, [[Prahlada]], loved and was devoted to Vishnu greatly and criticized his father's lack of faith. Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then relented and allowed him to come home. Father and son quickly began to argue about Vishnu's nature. When Prahlada stated that Vishnu was present everywhere, including in the walls of their home, his father kicked a pillar. Vishnu emerged from the pillar in the form of a man with a lion's head, and killed Hiranyakasipu. Prahlada eventually became the king, and had a grandson named [[Mahabali|Bali]]. Bali founded Mahabalipuram on this site.\n\nMyths also mention that Gods were jealous of the architectural elegance of the monuments of Mahablipuram, and as a result they caused floods to occur, which submerged most parts of the city, except for a few structures that are seen now.<ref>{{cite book|author=National Geographic|title=Sacred Places of a Lifetime: 500 of the World's Most Peaceful and Powerful Destinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNqDFSxR8-MC&pg=PA154|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=21 October 2008|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0336-7|pages=154\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Main|Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram}}\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:Shore temple, mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Shore temple, Mahabalipuram, India.]]\n\n[[File:Seashore temple Mamallapuram.jpg|thumb|SeaShore temple, Mahabalipuram,Tamil Nadu, India.]]\n\nAll the three Temples of the Shore Temple complex are built on the same platform.

A ''[[kalasa]]'' and [[finial]] are fitted above the ''shikhara.'' ''[[gavaksha|kudus]]'' (horseshoe-arch dormer like projections) and small shrines are part of the cornices at both levels of the structure. A Somaskanda panel decorates the back wall of the inner shrine. There is no ''mantapa'' (hall) in front of this shrine (probably damaged). The external walls display two panels.

The typical design of ''kudus'' and small square shrines are part of the cornice arrangement.

The circular wall and superstructure are of structural type. There are lions depicted on the pilasters. It is reported as a unique single tiered temple and not seen in other temples of the Pallava period. Its circular shikara, is in [[vesara style architecture]]. The shikhara is erected on a circular ''griva'', which has ''kudus'' and ''maha-nasikas'' on its four sides and each ''nasika'' has an image of [[Ganesha]]. The [[kalasa]] above the shikara is missing.<ref name=Tatva/> The carving of the Bhuvaraha depicts [[Varaha]] as the [[boar]] incarnation of Vishnu. This image is in unusual form, unlike another Varaha depictions in other regions of the country, as there is no [[Bhudevi]] shown nor an ocean. The depiction is in the form of Varaha performing a diving act into the ocean to rescue Bhudevi or mother earth. The symbolism of this act denotes the myth, only when the temple is submerged in water, as it is below the ground level.<ref name=Tatva/> The sculpture is seen broken and the base has an inscription referring to titles of the Pallava king Rajasimha. The wall that surrounds the shrine to prevent intrusion of sand from the sea also has an inscription on the topmost layer, in Pallava-Grantha script, which equates the king with [[Arjuna]].<ref name=Tatva/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_mahabalipuram_remains.asp|title=World Heritage Sites \u2013 Mahabalipuram \u2013 Excavated Remains|accessdate=30 December 2012|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India through National Informatics Centre}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nASI has constructed break-water wall all around the sea shore to save the temple from further damage.<ref name=Tatva/> The temple structures, affected by rough Sea and winds with salt content are being conserved by the Archaeological Survey of India by building protective [[groyne]]s, treatment with wall paper pulp, and by planting [[casurina tree]]s along the affected coast line. The pulp treatment absorbs the saline water. In addition, chemical treatment is also given the monument to prevent water seepage into the rock. This kind of treatment is also reported to take out water stored inside the rock thus allowing the stone to breathe and preserve its strength. The area around the Shore Temple, has been beautified. The horticulture wing of the ASI has created a green lawn of 11 acres (4.4 hectares) around the Shore Temple. Fixing of signages with information on the monuments and creating fountains was also part of the beautification programme planned by ASI.<ref name=Front/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram]]\n*[http://undividedtravel.com/a-visit-to-the-grandeurs-of-pallavas-shore-temple/ A visit to the grandeurs of pallavas- Shore temple, Mahabalipuram]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Shore temple ariel.jpg|Aerial view of the Shore Temple\nFile:Shore_temple_2.JPG|Shore Temple, left side\nFile:Shore_temple_3.JPG|Shore Temple, right side\nFile:View of Shore Temple.jpg|Shore Temple, View of Shore Temple\nFile:Shore temple at Mammallapuram.jpg|Shore Temple, Temple Vimanam\nFile:Mahabali006.jpg|Shore Temple, circa 1914.

Prince [[Hiranyakasipu]] refused to worship the god Vishnu. The prince's son, [[Prahlada]], loved and was devoted to Vishnu greatly and criticized his father's lack of faith. Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then relented and allowed him to come home. Father and son quickly began to argue about Vishnu's nature. When Prahlada stated that Vishnu was present everywhere, including in the walls of their home, his father kicked a pillar. Vishnu emerged from the pillar in the form of a man with a lion's head, and killed Hiranyakasipu. Prahlada eventually became the king, and had a grandson named [[Mahabali|Bali]]. Bali founded Mahabalipuram on this site.\n\nMyths also mention that Gods were jealous of the architectural elegance of the monuments of Mahablipuram, and as a result they caused floods to occur, which submerged most parts of the city, except for a few structures that are seen now.<ref>{{cite book|author=National Geographic|title=Sacred Places of a Lifetime: 500 of the World's Most Peaceful and Powerful Destinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNqDFSxR8-MC&pg=PA154|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=21 October 2008|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0336-7|pages=154\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Main|Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram}}\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:Shore temple, mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Shore temple, Mahabalipuram, India.]]\n\n[[File:Seashore temple Mamallapuram.jpg|thumb|SeaShore temple, Mahabalipuram,Tamil Nadu, India.]]\n\nAll the three Temples of the Shore Temple complex are built on the same platform.

Built with sculpted granite stones hauled from a nearby quarry, it is the earliest important structural temple in [[South India]]. Its pyramidal structure is {{Convert|60|ft}} high and sits on a {{Convert|50|ft}} square platform.

The main shrine is dedicated to [[Arkadeep]] as is the smaller second shrine. A small third shrine, between the two, is dedicated to a reclining [[Vishnu]] and may have had water channelled into the temple, entering the Vishnu shrine. The two Shiva shrines are [[orthogonal]] in configuration. The entrance is through a [[Transverse plane|transverse]] [[barrel vault]] [[gopuram]].

At the rear are two shrines facing in opposite directions. The inner shrine dedicated to ''Ksatriyasimnesvara'' is reached through a passage while the other, dedicated to [[Vishnu]], is facing outwards. The [[Durga]] is seated on her lion ''[[vahana]]''. A small shrine may have been in the cavity in the lion's chest.<ref name=\"art\"/>\n\nThe Shore Temples configuration of the two Shiva shrines with the small Vishnu shrine in between illustrates an attempt to balance the different, competing religious requirements.<ref name=ching2/>\n\nThe roofs of the temples have ornamentation similar to the Pancha Rathas. The roofs have [[finials]] on the top, indicative of its religious functional nature, as it was a completed temple. The octagonal shape of the [[shikaras]] of the two temples dedicated to Shiva are in the Dravidian architectural style.<ref name=Tatva/> Beneath the towers, the sanctuary walls are mostly blank without any decorations but the columns are carved over lion mounted bases.<ref name= Mamalla>{{Cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/mamallapuram/st02.html|title=Mamallapuram| accessdate=30 December 2012|publisher=Art and Archaeology.com}}</ref> The decorations on the outer faces of these shrines are similar to those seen on the Pancha Rathas, though due to their closeness to the sea, are partially eroded due to salty winds.<ref name=Art/>\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the temple are the [[Dharalinga]] and the [[Somaskanda]] panel, which are enshrined in the interior walls of the sanctum of the east facing Kshatriyasimhesvara temple. The Dharalinga is deified in the ''garbhagriha'', which is in square shape of {{Convert|12|ft}}  and the height is {{Convert|11|ft}}. The Dharalinga or Shivalinga is in Rajasimha style, carved out of black [[basalt]] stone. It has sixteen faces with slight fluting to create a crown at the top. The top portion of the linga is damaged. Its total height is {{Convert|6|ft}} with one foot embedded in the foundation to provide stability.<ref name=Tatva/> A [[bas-relief]], which is a family image of Shiva and his consort [[Parvati]] with their child [[Kartikeya]] built over a stone slab is located in a small shrine in the temple. This is also called the Somaskanada panel, a carved stone panel. Two more similar panels are seen at the entrance porch of the temple.

Sculptures of Shiva as [[Tripurantaka]] and Durga are seen on the back side of the north wall of the main shrine. There is also a circumambulatory passage to go round the main shrine in a clockwise direction.<ref name=Tatva/>\n\nThe smaller Shiva temple behind the main temple is a double storied structure with a stepped pyramidal tower with an octagonal ''shikhara'' built over a circular ''griva.'' A ''[[kalasa]]'' and [[finial]] are fitted above the ''shikhara.'' ''[[gavaksha|kudus]]'' (horseshoe-arch dormer like projections) and small shrines are part of the cornices at both levels of the structure. A Somaskanda panel decorates the back wall of the inner shrine. There is no ''mantapa'' (hall) in front of this shrine (probably damaged). The external walls display two panels. One is called ''[[Ekapada]]murti'', an eye-legged form of Shiva with Brahma and Vishnu emanating from his sides. The second  panel is of Nagaraja (king of serpents) standing below a five-hooded serpent.<ref name=Tatva/>\n\n[[Anantashayi Vishnu]] (reclining posture of Vishnu lying on the serpent [[Shesha|Ananta]]) is enshrined in a small rectangular shrine between the large Kshatriyasimhesvara temple and the Rajasimha Pallaveshvara temple. Vishnu is depicted with four arms but his attributes are missing (damaged). The temple structure's rectangular tower is missing. The typical design of ''kudus'' and small square shrines are part of the cornice arrangement. The external walls have carvings of Krishna slaying the demon [[Keshi (demon)|Kesi]], Krishna dancing over [[Kaliya]] (the seven hooded serpent), and Vishnu seated on his vehicle [[Garuda]] in the act of saving [[Ganjendra moksha|Gajendra]] (elephant) from the mouth of a crocodile. Inscription noted in Pallava [[Grantha script]] is on the lintel indicating it as the earliest shrine of the complex.<ref name=Tatva/>\n\nThe entire compound wall surrounding the temples is sculpted with large sculptures of Nandi, the vehicle or mount of Shiva,<ref name=Art/> and also with Yalis and Varahas (boars).<ref name=Stand/> back to pallava king\n\n==Lion monolith==\nA monolith sculpture of a partly carved and partly sculpted lion with a hole in its torso is erected within the compound wall of the temple complex. A miniature image of [[Durga]] is sculpted on the back of the image, which is a depiction of Durga as [[Mahishasurmardini]]. The open mouth of the lion is inferred as representation of its role as the favourite mount of Durga. A female guardian with a bow is also carved on the leg of the lion.<ref name=Tatva/>\n\n===Miniature Shrine===\n[[File:Miniature Shrine Shore Temple.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Miniature Shrine in Shore Temple complex]]\nIn 1990, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) discovered a miniature shrine with the [[Bhuvaraha]] image in a well type enclosure. This is dated to the Pallava King Narasimhavarman Mamalla's (AD 638\u2013660) reign. It was enclosed with an elliptical well built during Rajasimha's (AD 700\u2013728) period.

The circular wall and superstructure are of structural type. There are lions depicted on the pilasters. It is reported as a unique single tiered temple and not seen in other temples of the Pallava period. Its circular shikara, is in [[vesara style architecture]]. The shikhara is erected on a circular ''griva'', which has ''kudus'' and ''maha-nasikas'' on its four sides and each ''nasika'' has an image of [[Ganesha]]. The [[kalasa]] above the shikara is missing.<ref name=Tatva/> The carving of the Bhuvaraha depicts [[Varaha]] as the [[boar]] incarnation of Vishnu. This image is in unusual form, unlike another Varaha depictions in other regions of the country, as there is no [[Bhudevi]] shown nor an ocean. The depiction is in the form of Varaha performing a diving act into the ocean to rescue Bhudevi or mother earth. The symbolism of this act denotes the myth, only when the temple is submerged in water, as it is below the ground level.<ref name=Tatva/> The sculpture is seen broken and the base has an inscription referring to titles of the Pallava king Rajasimha. The wall that surrounds the shrine to prevent intrusion of sand from the sea also has an inscription on the topmost layer, in Pallava-Grantha script, which equates the king with [[Arjuna]].<ref name=Tatva/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_mahabalipuram_remains.asp|title=World Heritage Sites \u2013 Mahabalipuram \u2013 Excavated Remains|accessdate=30 December 2012|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India through National Informatics Centre}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nASI has constructed break-water wall all around the sea shore to save the temple from further damage.<ref name=Tatva/> The temple structures, affected by rough Sea and winds with salt content are being conserved by the Archaeological Survey of India by building protective [[groyne]]s, treatment with wall paper pulp, and by planting [[casurina tree]]s along the affected coast line. The pulp treatment absorbs the saline water. In addition, chemical treatment is also given the monument to prevent water seepage into the rock. This kind of treatment is also reported to take out water stored inside the rock thus allowing the stone to breathe and preserve its strength. The area around the Shore Temple, has been beautified. The horticulture wing of the ASI has created a green lawn of 11 acres (4.4 hectares) around the Shore Temple. Fixing of signages with information on the monuments and creating fountains was also part of the beautification programme planned by ASI.<ref name=Front/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram]]\n*[http://undividedtravel.com/a-visit-to-the-grandeurs-of-pallavas-shore-temple/ A visit to the grandeurs of pallavas- Shore temple, Mahabalipuram]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Shore temple ariel.jpg|Aerial view of the Shore Temple\nFile:Shore_temple_2.JPG|Shore Temple, left side\nFile:Shore_temple_3.JPG|Shore Temple, right side\nFile:View of Shore Temple.jpg|Shore Temple, View of Shore Temple\nFile:Shore temple at Mammallapuram.jpg|Shore Temple, Temple Vimanam\nFile:Mahabali006.jpg|Shore Temple, circa 1914.

The league was founded in 1956, two years after the start of professional football in the Netherlands. As of the 2019\u201320 season it is [[UEFA coefficient#Country coefficient|ranked]] the 9th best league in Europe by [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2019 |title=Country coefficients 2018/19 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=uefa.com |publisher=[[UEFA]] |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe top division consists of 18 clubs. Each club meets every other club twice during the season, once at home and once away. At the end of each season, the two clubs at the bottom are automatically [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] to the second level of the Dutch league system, the ''[[Eerste Divisie]]'' (First Division). At the same time, the champion and number two of the ''Eerste Divisie'' are automatically [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the Eredivisie. The number 16 club of the bottom of the Eredivisie goes to separate promotion/relegation play-offs with eight high-placed clubs from the ''Eerste Divisie''.\n\nThe winner of the Eredivisie claims the [[List of Dutch football champions|Dutch national championship]]. [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] has won most titles, 25 (34 national titles). [[PSV Eindhoven]] are next with 21 (24), and [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]] follow with 10 (15). Since 1965, these three clubs have won all but three Eredivisie titles (the 1981 and 2009 titles went to [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] and [[FC Twente]] won the 2010 title). Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are known as the \"[[Big Three (Netherlands)|Big Three]]\" or \"[[Big Three (Netherlands)|Traditional Top Three]]\" of Dutch football. They are the only ones in their current forms to have appeared in every edition of the Eredivisie since its formation. A fourth club, [[FC Utrecht]], is the product of a 1970 merger between three of that city's clubs, one of which, [[VV DOS]], had also never been relegated out of the Eredivisie.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1999, the official name of the league was PTT Telecompetitie (after the sponsor, PTT Telecom), which was changed to [[KPN]] Telecompetitie (because PTT Telecom changed its name to KPN Telecom in 1999) and to KPN Eredivisie in 2000. From 2002 to 2005, the league was called the Holland Casino Eredivisie. Since the 2005\u201306 season, the league has been sponsored by the ''Sponsorloterij'' (lottery), but for legal reasons its name could not be attached to the league (the Dutch government was against the name, because the Eredivisie would, after Holland Casino's sponsorship, yet again be sponsored by a company providing games of chance).\nOn 8 August 2012 it was made public that tycoon [[Rupert Murdoch]] had secured the rights to the Eredivisie for 12 years at the expense of 1 billion euros, beginning in the 2013\u201314 season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=van der Kraan|first1=Marcel|title=Murdoch koopt tv-rechten eredivisie|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/nationaal/20924148/__MURDOCH_KOOPT_TV-RECHTEN__.html|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=De Telegraaf|publisher=TMG Landelijke Media B.V.|date=8 August 2012}}</ref> Within this deal the five largest Eredivisie clubs should receive 5 million euros per year for the duration of the contract.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Seegers|first1=Jules|title=5 vragen over wat de deal Murdoch-Eredivisie betekent voor de kijker|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/08/08/vijf-vragen-over-wat-de-megadeal-murdoch-eredivisie-betekent-voor-de-kijker/|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=nrc.nl|publisher=NRC Media|date=8 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nFrom the foundation of the Dutch national football championship in 1898 until 1954, the title was decided through play-offs by a handful of clubs who had previously won their regional league.<ref name=rsssf>{{cite web | title = Netherlands&nbsp;\u2013 Regional Analysis | url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/region-netherlands.html | publisher = RSSSF | accessdate =12 October 2013}}</ref> The competition was purely an amateur one; the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] (KNVB) rejected any form of payment and suspended players who were caught receiving salary or transfer fees.<ref name=vakq>{{in lang|nl}}{{cite web | title = Eredivisie&nbsp;\u2013 ontstaan | url = http://www.vakq.eu/van_q_tot_q/e3s895/item | publisher = Vak Q | accessdate =13 October 2013}}</ref> The call for professional football grew in the early fifties after many national team members left to play abroad in search for financial benefits.<ref name=timerime>{{cite web | title = Professionalism and European Games | url = http://www.timerime.com/es/periodos/71504/Professionalism+and+European+Games/ | publisher = TimeRime | accessdate = 12 October 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131021091404/http://www.timerime.com/es/periodos/71504/Professionalism+and+European+Games/ | archive-date = 21 October 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The KNVB would usually suspend these players, preventing them from appearing for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]].

Clubs like [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]], [[FC Utrecht]] and [[FC Groningen]] also have fairly large fanbases. The regular season average league attendance was just over 7,000 in 1990, but this figure has risen sharply over the years thanks to the opening of new stadiums and the expansion of existing ones nationwide. Average attendance for the 2018-19 season was 18,010, with Ajax having the largest (52,987) and [[S.B.V. Excelsior|Excelsior]] having the smallest (4,223). Ajax's figures however differ from those provided by the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]] since the club counts all tickets sold instead of the number of people going through the turnstiles.\n{{clear}}\n\n==All-time ranking (since 1956)==\n:''Last updated following the [[2017\u201318 Eredivisie|2017\u201318 season]]''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#C0FFC0\n|Playing in

Division\"'') is the highest echelon of professional [[football in the Netherlands]]. The league was founded in 1956, two years after the start of professional football in the Netherlands. As of the 2019\u201320 season it is [[UEFA coefficient#Country coefficient|ranked]] the 9th best league in Europe by [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2019 |title=Country coefficients 2018/19 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=uefa.com |publisher=[[UEFA]] |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe top division consists of 18 clubs. Each club meets every other club twice during the season, once at home and once away. At the end of each season, the two clubs at the bottom are automatically [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] to the second level of the Dutch league system, the ''[[Eerste Divisie]]'' (First Division). At the same time, the champion and number two of the ''Eerste Divisie'' are automatically [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the Eredivisie. The number 16 club of the bottom of the Eredivisie goes to separate promotion/relegation play-offs with eight high-placed clubs from the ''Eerste Divisie''.\n\nThe winner of the Eredivisie claims the [[List of Dutch football champions|Dutch national championship]]. [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] has won most titles, 25 (34 national titles). [[PSV Eindhoven]] are next with 21 (24), and [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]] follow with 10 (15). Since 1965, these three clubs have won all but three Eredivisie titles (the 1981 and 2009 titles went to [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] and [[FC Twente]] won the 2010 title). Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are known as the \"[[Big Three (Netherlands)|Big Three]]\" or \"[[Big Three (Netherlands)|Traditional Top Three]]\" of Dutch football. They are the only ones in their current forms to have appeared in every edition of the Eredivisie since its formation. A fourth club, [[FC Utrecht]], is the product of a 1970 merger between three of that city's clubs, one of which, [[VV DOS]], had also never been relegated out of the Eredivisie.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1999, the official name of the league was PTT Telecompetitie (after the sponsor, PTT Telecom), which was changed to [[KPN]] Telecompetitie (because PTT Telecom changed its name to KPN Telecom in 1999) and to KPN Eredivisie in 2000. From 2002 to 2005, the league was called the Holland Casino Eredivisie. Since the 2005\u201306 season, the league has been sponsored by the ''Sponsorloterij'' (lottery), but for legal reasons its name could not be attached to the league (the Dutch government was against the name, because the Eredivisie would, after Holland Casino's sponsorship, yet again be sponsored by a company providing games of chance).\nOn 8 August 2012 it was made public that tycoon [[Rupert Murdoch]] had secured the rights to the Eredivisie for 12 years at the expense of 1 billion euros, beginning in the 2013\u201314 season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=van der Kraan|first1=Marcel|title=Murdoch koopt tv-rechten eredivisie|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/nationaal/20924148/__MURDOCH_KOOPT_TV-RECHTEN__.html|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=De Telegraaf|publisher=TMG Landelijke Media B.V.|date=8 August 2012}}</ref> Within this deal the five largest Eredivisie clubs should receive 5 million euros per year for the duration of the contract.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Seegers|first1=Jules|title=5 vragen over wat de deal Murdoch-Eredivisie betekent voor de kijker|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/08/08/vijf-vragen-over-wat-de-megadeal-murdoch-eredivisie-betekent-voor-de-kijker/|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=nrc.nl|publisher=NRC Media|date=8 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nFrom the foundation of the Dutch national football championship in 1898 until 1954, the title was decided through play-offs by a handful of clubs who had previously won their regional league.<ref name=rsssf>{{cite web | title = Netherlands&nbsp;\u2013 Regional Analysis | url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/region-netherlands.html | publisher = RSSSF | accessdate =12 October 2013}}</ref> The competition was purely an amateur one; the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] (KNVB) rejected any form of payment and suspended players who were caught receiving salary or transfer fees.<ref name=vakq>{{in lang|nl}}{{cite web | title = Eredivisie&nbsp;\u2013 ontstaan | url = http://www.vakq.eu/van_q_tot_q/e3s895/item | publisher = Vak Q | accessdate =13 October 2013}}</ref> The call for professional football grew in the early fifties after many national team members left to play abroad in search for financial benefits.<ref name=timerime>{{cite web | title = Professionalism and European Games | url = http://www.timerime.com/es/periodos/71504/Professionalism+and+European+Games/ | publisher = TimeRime | accessdate = 12 October 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131021091404/http://www.timerime.com/es/periodos/71504/Professionalism+and+European+Games/ | archive-date = 21 October 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The KNVB would usually suspend these players, preventing them from appearing for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]].

The meeting, dubbed the ''slaapkamerconferentie'' ('bedroom conference'), led to the Association reluctantly accepting semi-professionalism.<ref name=vakq/>\n\nMeanwhile, both the KNVB and the NBVB started their separate competition. The first professional football match was contested between [[AZ Alkmaar|Alkmaar]] and [[VVV-Venlo|Venlo]].<ref name=vakq/> The leagues went on for eleven rounds, before a merger was negotiated between the two federations in November. Both leagues were cancelled and a new, combined competition emerged immediately. [[De Graafschap]], Amsterdam, Alkmaar and [[Fortuna Sittard|Fortuna '54]] from the NBVB were accepted to the new league. Other clubs merged, which led to new names like [[Roda JC Kerkrade|Rapid J.C.]], Holland Sport and Roda Sport. The first (semi-)professional league was won by [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Netherlands 1954/55 | url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/ned55.html | publisher = RSSSF | accessdate =12 October 2013}}</ref> For the [[1956-57 Eredivisie|1956\u201357 season]], the KNVB abandoned the regional league system.

Clubs like [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]], [[FC Utrecht]] and [[FC Groningen]] also have fairly large fanbases. The regular season average league attendance was just over 7,000 in 1990, but this figure has risen sharply over the years thanks to the opening of new stadiums and the expansion of existing ones nationwide. Average attendance for the 2018-19 season was 18,010, with Ajax having the largest (52,987) and [[S.B.V. Excelsior|Excelsior]] having the smallest (4,223). Ajax's figures however differ from those provided by the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]] since the club counts all tickets sold instead of the number of people going through the turnstiles.\n{{clear}}\n\n==All-time ranking (since 1956)==\n:''Last updated following the [[2017\u201318 Eredivisie|2017\u201318 season]]''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#C0FFC0\n|Playing in

Also, people found in possession of marked goods provide the police with solid evidence of criminal activity. Operation Identification signs and stickers are used to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals who may decide to try elsewhere when informed of the added traceability of the goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdle.net/brochures/ident.pdf  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOperation Identification was developed at a similar time as [[Neighborhood Watch]] was being promoted.<ref name=\":0\"/> Unlike Neighborhood Watch, Operation Identification did not find widespread use, even though it was endorsed by significant organizations such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/08/04/operation-id-marketing-flop/  |title=Operation ID: Biggest Marketing Flop in U.S. History |last= |first= |date=2018-08-04 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Despite this, Operation Identification is still promoted by many police departments and colleges across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification  |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Operation Identification\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amherst.edu/offices/campus_police/programs/operation_id/node/29577  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=University of Amherst |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Operation Identification City Park Denver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Operation Identification sign in [[Denver]], Colorado]]\n\nOperation Identification was initially developed in the United States by the police in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/11/07/police-endorse-operation-id/  |title=Law Enforcement Professionals Endorse Operation ID |last= |first= |date=2018-11-07 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This was in response to the growing incidence of theft across the nation. Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) of funding for 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a single unique identifier or a system of identifiers being installed to aid police operations.

He's a good teacher who inspires his students. He demonstrates how some carefully chosen words and phrases can stimulate the listener's imagination to produce vivid mental imagery. One particular grievance of his involves the way in which young developing minds have been hijacked by the tedious distractions of modern technical gadgetry. He seems to be afflicted with writer's block and hasn't come out with any original work in several years. He publishes the school's literary magazine, which the school administration is planning to shut down for budgetary reasons. He is a high-functioning alcoholic who chronically arrives late to work and is on the verge of being fired. He is divorced and has an adult son from his first marriage, but they have become estranged because of Jack's drinking and general irresponsibility.\n\nDina Delsanto is an artist who has just been hired to teach the advanced art class, which has the same students as Jack's writing class. Dina was a successful painter in [[New York City]], but she now has difficulty painting or even walking and engaging in daily activities because of severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. She can no longer fasten buttons, open medicine bottles or hold paint brushes. She moved to Maine, where her sister and her mother live, so that they can help her during the spells when her arthritis worsens. As a teacher, she is a perfectionist with no interest in her students' personal lives. She simply wants them to concentrate on creating the best works of art that they can. She shows them the difference between paintings that merely demonstrate craft and paintings that evoke feeling as well. She struggles to paint again by overcoming her physical limitations as well as her own artistic difficulties. She finally creates a good work of art and sets it aside to dry. She has, incidentally, professed a complete disdain for the spoken and printed word. She insists that artistically rendered images are the only worthwhile media for expressing \"truth\".\n\nJack's colleagues and friends perceive him as attention-getting, obnoxious and charming. Once he gets wind of Dina's personal philosophy, he provokes an argument with her over which is more important, words or pictures. Their students are drawn into the conflict with class assignments demonstrating the superiority of words over pictures or pictures over words. Dina agrees to have her students contribute their own works of art to Jack's literary magazine. They decide to have an assembly in which each side will put on a presentation arguing the case for words and for pictures. The school administration becomes impressed enough with all of this activity to retain his services as an instructor.\n\nJack pursues Dina romantically and ultimately succeeds. But, during his first night over, he gets drunk on her vodka and crashes headlong into her newest painting. He further confesses to [[plagiarizing]] a poem from his own son, a moral failing for which Dina is even more unforgiving. She throws him out and tells him she doesn't want to have anything more to do with him.\n\nHe confesses the plagiarism to the school board and hands in his resignation. He asks only to continue for the rest of the year and put on the War on Words and Pictures assembly program. The board grants him his request, and the movie concludes with a satisfying resolution at the aforementioned assembly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Jack Marcus\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Dina Delsanto\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Ellen\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Walt\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as Elspeth\n* Adam DiMarco as Swint\n* [[Valerie Tian]] as Emily\n* [[Navid Negahban]] as Rashid\n* [[Janet Kidder]] as Sabine\n* [[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]] as Tom\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Words and Pictures'' grossed $2,171,257 in the United States and $1,175,000 in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $3,346,257.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Words and Pictures'' currently holds an approval rating of 41% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10.

He's a good teacher who inspires his students. He demonstrates how some carefully chosen words and phrases can stimulate the listener's imagination to produce vivid mental imagery. One particular grievance of his involves the way in which young developing minds have been hijacked by the tedious distractions of modern technical gadgetry. He seems to be afflicted with writer's block and hasn't come out with any original work in several years. He publishes the school's literary magazine, which the school administration is planning to shut down for budgetary reasons. He is a high-functioning alcoholic who chronically arrives late to work and is on the verge of being fired. He is divorced and has an adult son from his first marriage, but they have become estranged because of Jack's drinking and general irresponsibility.\n\nDina Delsanto is an artist who has just been hired to teach the advanced art class, which has the same students as Jack's writing class. Dina was a successful painter in [[New York City]], but she now has difficulty painting or even walking and engaging in daily activities because of severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. She can no longer fasten buttons, open medicine bottles or hold paint brushes. She moved to Maine, where her sister and her mother live, so that they can help her during the spells when her arthritis worsens. As a teacher, she is a perfectionist with no interest in her students' personal lives. She simply wants them to concentrate on creating the best works of art that they can. She shows them the difference between paintings that merely demonstrate craft and paintings that evoke feeling as well. She struggles to paint again by overcoming her physical limitations as well as her own artistic difficulties. She finally creates a good work of art and sets it aside to dry. She has, incidentally, professed a complete disdain for the spoken and printed word. She insists that artistically rendered images are the only worthwhile media for expressing \"truth\".\n\nJack's colleagues and friends perceive him as attention-getting, obnoxious and charming. Once he gets wind of Dina's personal philosophy, he provokes an argument with her over which is more important, words or pictures. Their students are drawn into the conflict with class assignments demonstrating the superiority of words over pictures or pictures over words. Dina agrees to have her students contribute their own works of art to Jack's literary magazine. They decide to have an assembly in which each side will put on a presentation arguing the case for words and for pictures. The school administration becomes impressed enough with all of this activity to retain his services as an instructor.\n\nJack pursues Dina romantically and ultimately succeeds. But, during his first night over, he gets drunk on her vodka and crashes headlong into her newest painting. He further confesses to [[plagiarizing]] a poem from his own son, a moral failing for which Dina is even more unforgiving. She throws him out and tells him she doesn't want to have anything more to do with him.\n\nHe confesses the plagiarism to the school board and hands in his resignation. He asks only to continue for the rest of the year and put on the War on Words and Pictures assembly program. The board grants him his request, and the movie concludes with a satisfying resolution at the aforementioned assembly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Jack Marcus\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Dina Delsanto\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Ellen\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Walt\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as Elspeth\n* Adam DiMarco as Swint\n* [[Valerie Tian]] as Emily\n* [[Navid Negahban]] as Rashid\n* [[Janet Kidder]] as Sabine\n* [[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]] as Tom\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Words and Pictures'' grossed $2,171,257 in the United States and $1,175,000 in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $3,346,257.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Words and Pictures'' currently holds an approval rating of 41% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10.

However it has more recently become notorious for it being a design element in a castle at [[Wewelsburg]] chosen by [[Heinrich Himmler]] as an intended center for the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial sun rays [[sig rune|''sig'' runes]], similar to the symbols also employed by the SS in their logo. The symbol is known in German as a Sonnenrad, aka Sun Wheel, & has later become known as the Schwarze Sonne. If it held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown & there is no evidence to suggest the Sonnenrad mosaic at Wewelsburg Castle was a new addition commissioned by the Nazis or Heinrich Himmler. Its association with the occult concept of the \"black sun\", and therefore also its name, developed from the influence of a 1991 German novel ''Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo'' ('The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') by the [[pseudonymous]] author Russell McCloud.{{sfnp|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|p=148}}{{r|Strube}}\n\n==Wewelsburg mosaic==\n[[File:Mann im Kreis.jpg|thumb|300px|The floor of the former SS Generals' Hall (German: ''Obergruppenf\u00fchrersaal'') on the first floor of the North Tower of Wewelsburg Castle showing the dark green mosaic at the center of the hall]]\n\nIn 1933, [[Heinrich Himmler]] acquired [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]]. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.{{sfnp|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\n[[File:Sig runes.svg|thumb|left|75px|[[Sig rune|''Sig'' runes]] used as the logo of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]]]\n\nHimmler's remodeling of Wewelsburg Castle, may have included the dark-green twelve ray Sonnenrad, which appears on the white marble floor of the structure's north tower, the ''Obergruppenf\u00fchrersaal'' or \"General's Hall\", but there is no evidence to suggest it was included as part of Himmler's remodeling & might have already been a mosaic feature, from a previous time period. The intended significance of the image remains unknown, but the artist may have found inspiration from decorative [[Merovingian]] disks (''[[Zierscheibe]]''). According to the historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]:\n\n{{quote |[I]t has been suggested that this twelve-spoke sun wheel derives from decorative disks from the Merovingians of the early medieval period and are supposed to represent the visible sun or its passage through the months of the year.

[Specifically], they adopt the primary iconography of the SS, the Nazi's own elite order. With these symbols, many of the pre-Nazism connections are questionable. Of the numerous permutations of the Wolfsangle, Satanists adopt the form used by the SS and numerous fascist organizations. Likewise, the Totenkopf used in the nineteenth century by the Prussian military was markedly more cartoonish than the SS's Death Head version, which is the version Church of Satan members use. The Black Sun motif is even less ambiguous.

Its association with the occult concept of the \"black sun\", and therefore also its name, developed from the influence of a 1991 German novel ''Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo'' ('The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') by the [[pseudonymous]] author Russell McCloud.{{sfnp|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|p=148}}{{r|Strube}}\n\n==Wewelsburg mosaic==\n[[File:Mann im Kreis.jpg|thumb|300px|The floor of the former SS Generals' Hall (German: ''Obergruppenf\u00fchrersaal'') on the first floor of the North Tower of Wewelsburg Castle showing the dark green mosaic at the center of the hall]]\n\nIn 1933, [[Heinrich Himmler]] acquired [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]].

According to scholar Chris Mathews:\n\n{{quote|In defending their use, Satanists draw attention to their historical origins, as most have origins that precede their Nazi application, some stretching centuries back into the past. [Specifically], they adopt the primary iconography of the SS, the Nazi's own elite order. With these symbols, many of the pre-Nazism connections are questionable. Of the numerous permutations of the Wolfsangle, Satanists adopt the form used by the SS and numerous fascist organizations. Likewise, the Totenkopf used in the nineteenth century by the Prussian military was markedly more cartoonish than the SS's Death Head version, which is the version Church of Satan members use. The Black Sun motif is even less ambiguous. Though based on medieval German symbols, the Wewelsburg mosaic is a unique design commissioned specifically for Himmler, and its primary contemporary association is [[Nazi occultism]], for which Nazi Satanic groups and [[Esoteric Nazism|esoteric neo-Nazis]] adopt it.<ref name=\"MATHEWS-2009-153\">{{cite book |last=Mathews |first=Chris |title=Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture |date=2009 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-36639-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Modern_Satanism.html?id=mQrbsOWaOyUC&q=%22black+sun%22 |page=153 |ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Mathews, \"Despite the systematic exploitation of ambiguity, any denial that Nazi symbols are being used ''as'' Nazi symbols is both disingenuous and unconvincing.\"<ref name=\"MATHEWS-2009-153\"/>\n\n==Neo-Nazism==\n\nThe Black Sun symbol occurs frequently in print publications and on websites associated with Nazi occult circles{{sfnp|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|pp=148\u2013150}} ,{{sfnp|Grumke|Wagner|2002|p=219}} in which context it is also called a ''sun wheel'' or ''Sonnenrad''.<ref name=\"ADL\">{{cite web |title=Sonnenrad |url=https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/sonnenrad |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Deconstructing\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer, no byline--> |title=Deconstructing the symbols and slogans spotted in Charlottesville |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/local/charlottesville-videos/ |work=The Washington Post |date=18 August 2017}}</ref>{{r|Nathan}}{{pb}}The symbol has been used by [[neo-Nazi]], [[neo-volkisch movements|neo-''v\u00f6lkisch'']], and [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] groups during the [[Unite the Right rally]] in Charlottesville, Virginia,<ref name=\"PORTER-2017\">{{cite news |last=Porter |first=Tom |date=13 August 2017 |title=Who are the White Nationalist Groups that Demonstrated in Charlottesville? |work=Newsweek |url=https://www.newsweek.com/who-are-white-nationalist-groups-who-demonstrated-charlottesville-650162}}</ref><ref name=\"SPLC\">{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer, no byline--> |title=Flags and Other Symbols Used By Neo-Nazi Groups in Charlottesville |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/08/12/flags-and-other-symbols-used-far-right-groups-charlottesville |website=Hatewatch |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=12 August 2017}}</ref> the Australian neo-Nazi group [[Antipodean Resistance]],<ref name=\"Nathan\">{{cite web |last=Nathan |first=Julie |date=20 April 2018 |title=Antipodean Resistance: The Rise and Goals of Australia's New Nazis |url=https://www.abc.net.au/religion/antipodean-resistance-the-rise-and-goals-of-australias-new-nazis/10094794 |website=ABC Religion & Ethics |publisher=Australian Beroadcasting Corporation}}</ref> and the [[Azov Battalion]], a Ukrainian movement, originally a military regiment,<ref name=\"Colborne\">{{cite news |last=Colborne |first=Michael |title=The Christchurch shooting, Eastern Europe's far-right and a 'cherry-picked reading of history' |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-10/christchurch-shooting-far-right-groups-in-ukraine-eastern-europe/10983542 |work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 April 2019}}</ref> widely associated with neo-fascism and neo-Nazism.<ref name=\"Luhn\">{{cite news |last=Luhn |first=Alec |date=30 August 2014 |title=Preparing for War With Ukraine's Fascist Defenders of Freedom |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/08/30/preparing-for-war-with-ukraines-fascist-defenders-of-freedom/ |work=Foreign Policy}}</ref>\n\nThe symbol was used on the cover of the [[Christchurch mosque shooter]]'s manifesto, and was engraved on the guns used in the attack.<ref name=\"Dearden\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/new-zealand-christchurch-mosque-attack-white-genocide-conspiracy-theory-a8824671.html |title=New Zealand attack: How nonsensical white genocide conspiracy theory cited by gunman is spreading poison around the world |last=Dearden |first=Lizzie |date=16 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190316233021/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/new-zealand-christchurch-mosque-attack-white-genocide-conspiracy-theory-a8824671.html |archive-date=16 March 2019 |url-status=live |work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 2018, the symbol appeared on merchandise for Colombian pop singer Shakira's [[El Dorado World Tour]].<ref name=\"Schumacher\">{{cite web |last=Schumacher |first=Elizabeth |title=Shakira selling Nazi-like trinket for El Dorado tour |url=https://www.dw.com/en/shakira-selling-nazi-like-trinket-for-el-dorado-tour/a-44301030 |website=Deutsche Welle |date=19 June 2018}}</ref> According to [[Live Nation Entertainment]], \"The necklace Live Nation designed for Shakira's 'El Dorado World Tour' was based on [[pre-Columbian]] imagery ...

Although [[Poland]] did not become a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) until 1993, earlier contests had often been broadcast on [[Telewizja Polska]] (TVP), the Polish broadcaster.\n\nPoland's debut in the contest in {{escyr|1994}} remains its most successful entry, with [[Edyta G\u00f3rniak]] finishing second. This remains Poland's only top five result in the contest. The country reached the top ten for the second time with [[Ich Troje]] finishing seventh in {{escyr|2003}}. Poland then failed to qualify from the semi-finals in six out of seven years between 2005 and 2011, before withdrawing from the contest in 2012 and 2013. Since returning in 2014, Poland had qualified for the final for four consecutive years (2014\u20132017), achieving a third top ten finish in {{escyr|2016}}, with [[Micha\u0142 Szpak]] finishing eighth. Since 2018 the country failed to qualify two times in row (2018\u20132019)\n\n==History==\nThe first ever performance by Poland was at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 contest]]: [[Edyta G\u00f3rniak]]'s song was also by far the most successful for Poland to date, receiving 166 points and placing second. Poland was almost disqualified that year though; there was no free-language rule in operation at the time, and a furor erupted at the dress rehearsal when G\u00f3rniak sung the second half of \"To nie ja!\" in English. Six national delegations formally petitioned for Poland to be disqualified; however Eurovision rules required a majority of delegations (13 in this case) to complain before the European Broadcasting Union could examine the case for disqualification, so Poland was allowed to remain.\n\nThe Polish entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] was again selected through internally was [[Justyna Steczkowska]] with \"[[Sama (song)|Sama]]\". Steczkowska could not replicate G\u00f3rniak's 2nd place, receiving only 15 points and placing 18th.\n\nThe 1996 entry was [[Kasia Kowalska]] with \"[[Chc\u0119 zna\u0107 sw\u00f3j grzech...]]\". It placed 15th with 31 points.\n\nPoland competed in the 1997 competition with the song \"[[Ale jestem]]\" , was the first uptempo Polish entry, which was performed by [[Anna Maria Jopek]] .At the close of voting, it had received 54 points, placing 11th in a field of 25.\n \nIn 1998 Poland was represented by band [[Sixteen (Polish band)|Sixteen]] they performed the song \"[[To Takie Proste]]\" in the final of the competition, finishing 17th of 25 entrants.\n\nin 1999 Mietek Szcze\u015bniak represented Poland with the song \"[[Przytul mnie mocno]]\",he also was the first man who represented his country. He placed 18th with 17 points.\n\nPoland returned to Eurovision following an enforced one-year absence [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]].\n\nFor the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]] Poland organized its first public selection for Eurovision entry; It was no surprise when the group [[Ich Troje]] won the public vote ahead of [[Blue Caf\u00e9]], placing 7th of 26 countries in the final. This placing allowed Poland to skip the semi-final of the 2004 contest, automatically qualifying for the final.\n\nThe Polish entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 contest]] was again selected through National Final, the winner of Krajowe Eliminacje was Blue Caf\u00e9  with \"[[Love Song (Blue Caf\u00e9 song)|Love Song]]\". Group could not replicate Ich Troje's 7th place, receiving only 27 points and placing 17th.\n\nIn 2005 [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] went back to an internal selection, picking \"[[Czarna dziewczyna]]\", a multilingual song performed in [[Polish language|Polish]] and Russian.Poland competed first time at the semi-final. The song just missed out on a place in the final, coming 11th in the semi-final with 81 points only 4-point behind Latvia.\n\nPoland's 2006 entry with the comeback of the public vote on TVP, Ich Troje were chosen again in 2006 with song \"[[Follow My Heart]]\", but could not repeat their 7th place from 2003 failed to qualify for the final, coming 11th with 70 points in the semi-final only 5-point behind Macedonia. Poland's [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]] entry, \"[[Time To Party]]\", sung by [[The Jet Set]], only finished 14th in the semi-final.\n\nPoland's only appearance in the final between 2005 and 2011, was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]]. Even then, its song (\"[[For Life (Isis Gee song)|For Life]]\", sung by [[Isis Gee]]) placed a lowly 24th.\n\nIn the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], Poland selected [[Lidia Kopania]] and her song \"[[I Don't Wanna Leave]]\" performed in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009, however she failed to qualify finished 12th with 43 points.\n\nThe 2010 entry for Poland was [[Marcin Mrozi\u0144ski]] with song \"[[Legenda (song)|Legenda]]\", country performed in the first semi-final on 25 May 2010 but he didn't qualify for the final, finishing 13th with 44 points.\n\nIn 2011, Poland was represented by [[Magdalena Tul]], and the country's entry was sung in Polish. Her song was called \"Jestem\", translated as \"I'm\", although initially a favorite with bookmakers, \"Jestem\" failed to qualify finished last 19th with 18 points in the first semi-final. This is the worst Polish result to date.\n\nMembers of the Polish OGAE have said at their annual convention that they would like [[Edyta G\u00f3rniak]] to represent Poland for a second time. For years it was unknown if G\u00f3rniak would enter Eurovision again,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12221/ogae_poland_a_convention_to_remember|title=OGAE Poland: A convention to remember|author=Floras, Stella|publisher=ESCToday|date=25 August 2008|accessdate=25 August 2008}}</ref> until when in 2016 she made a second attempt at representing her country in the contest, placing third in the national final.\n\n===Withdrawal===\nIn December 2011, it was announced that Poland would not compete at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] in [[Baku]]. The Polish broadcaster stated that having to organize the [[European Football Championship 2012]] (hosted by Poland and [[Ukraine]]) was a major factor in their withdrawal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Poland: TVP withdraws from Eurovision 2012|url=http://www.escdaily.com/poland-tvp-withdraws-from-eurovision-2012/#|last=Van Ee|first=Dennis|publisher=ESCDaily|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref> TVP informed esctoday.com that their decision to abstain would not hamper their chances of being back in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], leaving the door open for a return then. However, Poland confirmed on 22 November 2012 that it would not be participating in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]].<ref>{{cite web|title=No return: Poland will not be in Malm\u00f6|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39143|work=esctoday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Return===\nTVP, the Polish national broadcaster has confirmed on 5 December 2013 that Poland will return to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014.<ref>http://www.esctoday.com/69854/tvp-poland/</ref><ref>http://www.tvp.pl/o-tvp/centrum-prasowe/komunikaty-prasowe/tvp-znow-w-konkursie-eurowizji/13230106</ref> On 25 February, it was announced that [[Donatan]] and [[Cleo (Polish singer)|Cleo]] would represent Poland with their song \"My S\u0142owianie\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvp.pl/o-tvp/centrum-prasowe/komunikaty-prasowe/my-slowianie-na-eurowizji/14156701|title=My, S\u0142owianie na Eurowizji|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=25 February 2014|publisher=[[Telewizja Polska|Tvp.pl]]|language=Polish}}</ref> They qualified for the final placing 8th with 70 points, making it only the second time Poland has qualified for the final since 2008. [[Donatan]] and [[Cleo (Polish singer)|Cleo]] performed 9th in the final and ended up placing 14th out of 26 with 62 points. The duo fared clearly better with the televoters, finishing third in the semi-final and 5th in the final respectively.\n\nIn 2015 TVP has selected their entry internally again by choosing [[Monika Kuszy\u0144ska]] and her song \"In The Name of Love\". She was the first ever Eurovision participant to sit in a wheelchair during her performance, due to the fact that she was paralyzed after being involved in a serious car accident in 2006. Monika performed last in the second semi-final on 21 May 2015 and qualified for the final placing 8th with 57 points. In the final, she came 23rd out of 27 acts, receiving ten points. Alike Donatan and Cleo, she fared clearly better with the televoters, coming fourth in the semi-final and 15th in the final respectively.\n\nIn 2016, TVP went back to conducting a national final, called Krajowe Eliminacje, with [[Micha\u0142 Szpak]] winning. Szpak performed second in the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in sixth place, with 151 points. In the final, held on 14 May 2016, he performed 12th and placed 8th out of 26 acts, with 229 points, which gave Poland their third best result ever.\n\nIn 2017, TVP decided to host the second edition of the national final, with [[Kasia Mo\u015b]] and her song \"Flashlight\" winning. Mo\u015b performed 11th in the first semi-final on 9 May 2017. She qualified for the final placing 9th with 119 points. In the final, held on 13 May 2017, she performed 2nd and came 22nd out of 26 acts with 64 points total.\n\nPoland's run of qualifications came to an end in 2018, when the song \"[[Light Me Up (Gromee song)|Light Me Up]]\" by Polish DJ [[Gromee]] and Swedish vocalist [[Lukas Meijer]], again chosen during the national final, failed to qualify to the final by placing 14th with 81 points in the second semi-final. It is the first Polish entry since its return to the contest in 2014, to not qualify for the final.\n\nIn 2019, TVP returned to internal selection, after a successful internal choice of [[Roksana W\u0119giel]] for [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]. On 15 February 2019 it was announced that TVP has chosen [[Tulia (band)|Tulia]] for the Polish representative to Tel Aviv. However Poland failed to qualify for the grand final by placing 11th with 120 points in the first semi-final only 2-point behind Belarus.\n\nIn 2020, TVP will use talent show ''[[Szansa na sukces]]'' to select the Polish artist and song, having used the show to select the song \"[[Superhero (Viki Gabor song)|Superhero]]\" performed by [[Viki Gabor]] for the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2019]], winning the contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2020/01/02/poland-szansa-na-sukces-to-select-eurovision-2020-entrant/|title=Poland: Szansa na Sukces to Select Eurovision 2020 Entrant|website=eurovoix.com|date=2 January 2020|first=Neil|last=Farren}}</ref>\n\n== Contestants ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key<!--\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner-->\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place<!--\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place-->\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-style=\"background:silver;\"\n!{{Escyr|1994}}\n|[[Edyta G\u00f3rniak]]\n|[[Polish language|Polish]]\n|\"[[To nie ja!]]\"\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|166\n|rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1995}}\n|[[Justyna Steczkowska]]\n|Polish\n|\"[[Sama (song)|Sama]]\"\n|align=center|18\n|align=center|15\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1996}}\n|[[Kasia Kowalska]]\n|Polish\n|\"[[Chc\u0119 zna\u0107 sw\u00f3j grzech...]]\"\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|31\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|42\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1997}}\n|[[Anna Maria Jopek]]\n|Polish\n|\"[[Ale jestem]]\"\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|54\n|rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1998}}\n|[[Sixteen (band)|Sixteen]]\n|Polish\n|\"[[To takie proste]]\"\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|19\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1999}}\n|[[Mietek Szcze\u015bniak]]\n|Polish\n|\"[[Przytul mnie mocno]]\"\n|align=center|18\n|align=center|17\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|2000}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}} \n|-\n!{{Escyr|2001}}\n|[[Andrzej Piaseczny]]\n|[[English language|English]]\n|\"[[2 Long]]\"\n|align=center|20\n|align=center|11\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|2002}}}}\n|colspan=\"7\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2003}}\n|[[Ich Troje]]\n|[[German language|German]], Polish, [[Russian language|Russian]]\n|\"[[Keine Grenzen \u2013 \u017badnych granic]]\"\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|90\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|2004}}\n|[[Blue Caf\u00e9]]\n|English, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n|\"[[Love Song (Blue Caf\u00e9 song)|Love Song]]\"\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|27\n|colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"-9999\" {{N/A|Top 11 previous year}}{{efn|name=note2|According to the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest|then-Eurovision rules]], the top ten non-[[Big Four (Eurovision)|Big Four]] countries from the previous year along with the Big Four automatically qualified for the Grand Final without having to compete in semi-finals.

Although [[Poland]] did not become a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) until 1993, earlier contests had often been broadcast on [[Telewizja Polska]] (TVP), the Polish broadcaster.\n\nPoland's debut in the contest in {{escyr|1994}} remains its most successful entry, with [[Edyta G\u00f3rniak]] finishing second. This remains Poland's only top five result in the contest. The country reached the top ten for the second time with [[Ich Troje]] finishing seventh in {{escyr|2003}}. Poland then failed to qualify from the semi-finals in six out of seven years between 2005 and 2011, before withdrawing from the contest in 2012 and 2013. Since returning in 2014, Poland had qualified for the final for four consecutive years (2014\u20132017), achieving a third top ten finish in {{escyr|2016}}, with [[Micha\u0142 Szpak]] finishing eighth. Since 2018 the country failed to qualify two times in row (2018\u20132019)\n\n==History==\nThe first ever performance by Poland was at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 contest]]: [[Edyta G\u00f3rniak]]'s song was also by far the most successful for Poland to date, receiving 166 points and placing second. Poland was almost disqualified that year though; there was no free-language rule in operation at the time, and a furor erupted at the dress rehearsal when G\u00f3rniak sung the second half of \"To nie ja!\" in English. Six national delegations formally petitioned for Poland to be disqualified; however Eurovision rules required a majority of delegations (13 in this case) to complain before the European Broadcasting Union could examine the case for disqualification, so Poland was allowed to remain.\n\nThe Polish entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] was again selected through internally was [[Justyna Steczkowska]] with \"[[Sama (song)|Sama]]\". Steczkowska could not replicate G\u00f3rniak's 2nd place, receiving only 15 points and placing 18th.\n\nThe 1996 entry was [[Kasia Kowalska]] with \"[[Chc\u0119 zna\u0107 sw\u00f3j grzech...]]\". It placed 15th with 31 points.\n\nPoland competed in the 1997 competition with the song \"[[Ale jestem]]\" , was the first uptempo Polish entry, which was performed by [[Anna Maria Jopek]] .At the close of voting, it had received 54 points, placing 11th in a field of 25.\n \nIn 1998 Poland was represented by band [[Sixteen (Polish band)|Sixteen]] they performed the song \"[[To Takie Proste]]\" in the final of the competition, finishing 17th of 25 entrants.\n\nin 1999 Mietek Szcze\u015bniak represented Poland with the song \"[[Przytul mnie mocno]]\",he also was the first man who represented his country. He placed 18th with 17 points.\n\nPoland returned to Eurovision following an enforced one-year absence [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]].\n\nFor the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]] Poland organized its first public selection for Eurovision entry; It was no surprise when the group [[Ich Troje]] won the public vote ahead of [[Blue Caf\u00e9]], placing 7th of 26 countries in the final. This placing allowed Poland to skip the semi-final of the 2004 contest, automatically qualifying for the final.\n\nThe Polish entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 contest]] was again selected through National Final, the winner of Krajowe Eliminacje was Blue Caf\u00e9  with \"[[Love Song (Blue Caf\u00e9 song)|Love Song]]\". Group could not replicate Ich Troje's 7th place, receiving only 27 points and placing 17th.\n\nIn 2005 [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] went back to an internal selection, picking \"[[Czarna dziewczyna]]\", a multilingual song performed in [[Polish language|Polish]] and Russian.Poland competed first time at the semi-final. The song just missed out on a place in the final, coming 11th in the semi-final with 81 points only 4-point behind Latvia.\n\nPoland's 2006 entry with the comeback of the public vote on TVP, Ich Troje were chosen again in 2006 with song \"[[Follow My Heart]]\", but could not repeat their 7th place from 2003 failed to qualify for the final, coming 11th with 70 points in the semi-final only 5-point behind Macedonia. Poland's [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]] entry, \"[[Time To Party]]\", sung by [[The Jet Set]], only finished 14th in the semi-final.\n\nPoland's only appearance in the final between 2005 and 2011, was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]]. Even then, its song (\"[[For Life (Isis Gee song)|For Life]]\", sung by [[Isis Gee]]) placed a lowly 24th.\n\nIn the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], Poland selected [[Lidia Kopania]] and her song \"[[I Don't Wanna Leave]]\" performed in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009, however she failed to qualify finished 12th with 43 points.\n\nThe 2010 entry for Poland was [[Marcin Mrozi\u0144ski]] with song \"[[Legenda (song)|Legenda]]\", country performed in the first semi-final on 25 May 2010 but he didn't qualify for the final, finishing 13th with 44 points.\n\nIn 2011, Poland was represented by [[Magdalena Tul]], and the country's entry was sung in Polish. Her song was called \"Jestem\", translated as \"I'm\", although initially a favorite with bookmakers, \"Jestem\" failed to qualify finished last 19th with 18 points in the first semi-final. This is the worst Polish result to date.\n\nMembers of the Polish OGAE have said at their annual convention that they would like [[Edyta G\u00f3rniak]] to represent Poland for a second time. For years it was unknown if G\u00f3rniak would enter Eurovision again,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12221/ogae_poland_a_convention_to_remember|title=OGAE Poland: A convention to remember|author=Floras, Stella|publisher=ESCToday|date=25 August 2008|accessdate=25 August 2008}}</ref> until when in 2016 she made a second attempt at representing her country in the contest, placing third in the national final.\n\n===Withdrawal===\nIn December 2011, it was announced that Poland would not compete at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] in [[Baku]]. The Polish broadcaster stated that having to organize the [[European Football Championship 2012]] (hosted by Poland and [[Ukraine]]) was a major factor in their withdrawal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Poland: TVP withdraws from Eurovision 2012|url=http://www.escdaily.com/poland-tvp-withdraws-from-eurovision-2012/#|last=Van Ee|first=Dennis|publisher=ESCDaily|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref> TVP informed esctoday.com that their decision to abstain would not hamper their chances of being back in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], leaving the door open for a return then. However, Poland confirmed on 22 November 2012 that it would not be participating in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]].<ref>{{cite web|title=No return: Poland will not be in Malm\u00f6|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=39143|work=esctoday.com|accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Return===\nTVP, the Polish national broadcaster has confirmed on 5 December 2013 that Poland will return to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014.<ref>http://www.esctoday.com/69854/tvp-poland/</ref><ref>http://www.tvp.pl/o-tvp/centrum-prasowe/komunikaty-prasowe/tvp-znow-w-konkursie-eurowizji/13230106</ref> On 25 February, it was announced that [[Donatan]] and [[Cleo (Polish singer)|Cleo]] would represent Poland with their song \"My S\u0142owianie\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvp.pl/o-tvp/centrum-prasowe/komunikaty-prasowe/my-slowianie-na-eurowizji/14156701|title=My, S\u0142owianie na Eurowizji|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=25 February 2014|publisher=[[Telewizja Polska|Tvp.pl]]|language=Polish}}</ref> They qualified for the final placing 8th with 70 points, making it only the second time Poland has qualified for the final since 2008. [[Donatan]] and [[Cleo (Polish singer)|Cleo]] performed 9th in the final and ended up placing 14th out of 26 with 62 points. The duo fared clearly better with the televoters, finishing third in the semi-final and 5th in the final respectively.\n\nIn 2015 TVP has selected their entry internally again by choosing [[Monika Kuszy\u0144ska]] and her song \"In The Name of Love\". She was the first ever Eurovision participant to sit in a wheelchair during her performance, due to the fact that she was paralyzed after being involved in a serious car accident in 2006. Monika performed last in the second semi-final on 21 May 2015 and qualified for the final placing 8th with 57 points. In the final, she came 23rd out of 27 acts, receiving ten points. Alike Donatan and Cleo, she fared clearly better with the televoters, coming fourth in the semi-final and 15th in the final respectively.\n\nIn 2016, TVP went back to conducting a national final, called Krajowe Eliminacje, with [[Micha\u0142 Szpak]] winning. Szpak performed second in the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in sixth place, with 151 points. In the final, held on 14 May 2016, he performed 12th and placed 8th out of 26 acts, with 229 points, which gave Poland their third best result ever.\n\nIn 2017, TVP decided to host the second edition of the national final, with [[Kasia Mo\u015b]] and her song \"Flashlight\" winning. Mo\u015b performed 11th in the first semi-final on 9 May 2017. She qualified for the final placing 9th with 119 points. In the final, held on 13 May 2017, she performed 2nd and came 22nd out of 26 acts with 64 points total.\n\nPoland's run of qualifications came to an end in 2018, when the song \"[[Light Me Up (Gromee song)|Light Me Up]]\" by Polish DJ [[Gromee]] and Swedish vocalist [[Lukas Meijer]], again chosen during the national final, failed to qualify to the final by placing 14th with 81 points in the second semi-final.
