A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4, which went to war as the V-2. Beginning in September 1944, over 3,000 V-2s were launched by the German [[Wehrmacht]] against Allied targets, first [[London]] and later [[Antwerp]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]]. According to a 2011 BBC documentary,{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=89}} the attacks from V-2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.<ref name=\"Thimm\">''Am Anfang war die V2.

Wernher von Braun and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans and many of the original V-2 team ended up [[Operation Paperclip|working]] at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established V-2 production, and moved it to the Soviet Union.\n\n==Developmental history==\nIn the late 1920s, a young [[Wernher von Braun]] bought a copy of [[Hermann Oberth]]'s book, ''[[Wege zur Raumschiffahrt|Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen]]'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces'').<ref name=\"WvB\">[[Wernher von Braun#Early life]].</ref> Starting in 1930, he attended the [[Technical University of Berlin]], where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests.<ref name=\"WvB\"/> Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] gained power in Germany.<ref name=\"PrusRocketeer\">[[Wernher von Braun#The Prussian rocketeer and working under the Nazis]].</ref> An artillery captain, [[Walter Dornberger]], arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who from then on worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at [[Kummersdorf]].<ref name=\"PrusRocketeer\"/> Von Braun's thesis, ''Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket'' (dated 16 April 1934), was kept classified by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and was not published until 1960.<ref>''Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beitr\u00e4ge zu dem Problem der Fl\u00fcssigkeitsrakete.

The rocket reached a height of {{cvt|80|km}} after shutting off the engine.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] V2 Factory: Nordhausen 070723</ref>\n\nThe fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] ([[T-Stoff]]) with [[sodium permanganate]] ([[Z-Stoff]]) [[catalyst]]. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy.<ref name=Kennedy>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Gregory P. |title=Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile |year=1983 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, DC |pages=27, 74}}</ref>\n\nThe [[turbopump]], rotating at 4000 [[rpm]], forced the alcohol and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 33 gallons per second, where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter.  Thrust increased to 8 tons during this preliminary stage, before increasing to 25 tons, lifting the 13.5 ton rocket.  Combustion gases exited the chamber at 5100 degrees Fahrenheit, and a speed of 6500 feet per second.  The oxygen to fuel mixture was 1.0:0.85 at 25 tons of thrust, but as [[ambient pressure]] decreased with flight altitude, thrust increased until it reached 29 tons.<ref name=walter>{{cite book |last1=Dornberger |first1=Walter |title=V-2 |date=1954 |publisher=The Viking Press, Inc. |location=New York |page=17-18,120,122-123,132}}</ref><ref name=\"steven\">{{cite book |last1=Zaloga |first1=Steven |title=V-2 Ballistic Missile, 1942-52 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=9781841765419 |page=19}}</ref><ref name=redstone/>  \n\nDr. Thiel's development of the 25 ton rocket motor relied on pump feeding, rather than on the earlier pressure feeding.  The motor was also based on centrifugal injection and film cooling, in which alcohol was admitted into the motor and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through numerous small perforations.  The injection head was removed from the combustion chamber, which was reduced from 6 to 1 foot, and the connection to the nozzle made cone shaped.  The resultant 1.5 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of 220 [[pounds per square inch]].  Thiel's 1.5 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 4.5 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber.  By 1939, eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the 0.12 inch thick sheet-steel chamber, were used to make the 25 ton motor.<ref name=walter/>{{rp|52-55}}\n\nThe alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] heated the fuel and cooled the [[combustion chamber]]. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled [[boundary layer]] that further protected the wall of the chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse exhaust plume. By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with [[shock diamond]]s.\n\nThe warhead was another source of troubles. The explosive employed was [[amatol|amatol 60/40]] detonated by an electric [[contact fuze]]. Amatol had the advantage of stability, and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of [[fiberglass]], but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed {{convert|975|kg|lb}} and contained {{convert|910|kg|lb}} of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.\n\nThe protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the A-4 did not have the tendency to form ice, which was common to other early missiles (like the [[balloon tank]]-design [[SM-65 Atlas]]). The tanks held {{convert|4173|kg|lb}} of ethyl alcohol and {{convert|5553|kg|lb}} of oxygen.<ref>War machine encyclopedia, Limited publishing, London 1983 p 1690-92</ref>\n\n[[File:Antwerp V-2.jpg|thumb|Captured V-2 on public display in Antwerp, 1945.

Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named \"Big Ben\" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee, to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.<ref name=\"stock25\">Jeremy Stocker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 \"Britain and Ballistic Missile Defence, 1942\u20132002\"], pp. 20\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Anti-aircraft gun system===\nGeneral [[Frederick Alfred Pile]], commander of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], studied the problem and proposed that enough [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nPile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that were provided with pre-configured firing data for {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nAt a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from [[Roderic Hill]] and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with [[RV Jones]] and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, \"[[Bernard Montgomery|Monty]] beat us to it\", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nWith the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they turned their attention to Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.<ref name=stock25/>\n\n===Direct attack===\nAnother defence against the V-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructure\u2014expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties\u2014or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through [[disinformation]]. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the [[Double-Cross System]]).{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=100}}\n\nAccording to the BBC television presenter [[Raymond Baxter]], who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a V2 launch site, when one missile was launched in front of them. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html|title=V2ROCKET.COM - Den Haag, Wassenaar, Hoek van Holland|website=www.v2rocket.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1945 the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the \"Haagse Bos\" in The Hague by a [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|large-scale bombardment]], but due to navigational errors the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians.

The setup may look similar to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] launch procedure but in the case of the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.\n\nThe [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket is a direct descendant of the V-2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=27 April 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220003451/http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===USSR===\n{{Main|Soviet space program}}\n[[File:\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434 \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0420-1.jpg|thumb|right|R-1 rocket (V-2 rebuilt by Russia) on a ''Vidalwagen'' at Kapustin Yar]]\nThe [[Soviet Union|USSR]] also captured a number of V-2s and staff, letting them stay in Germany for a time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/a4_team_moscow.html#end|title=End of a honeymoon|access-date=2019-06-23|last=Zak|first=Anatoly|publication-date=2012}}</ref> The first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945.

The rocket reached a height of {{cvt|80|km}} after shutting off the engine.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] V2 Factory: Nordhausen 070723</ref>\n\nThe fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] ([[T-Stoff]]) with [[sodium permanganate]] ([[Z-Stoff]]) [[catalyst]]. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy.<ref name=Kennedy>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Gregory P. |title=Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile |year=1983 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, DC |pages=27, 74}}</ref>\n\nThe [[turbopump]], rotating at 4000 [[rpm]], forced the alcohol and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 33 gallons per second, where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter.  Thrust increased to 8 tons during this preliminary stage, before increasing to 25 tons, lifting the 13.5 ton rocket.  Combustion gases exited the chamber at 5100 degrees Fahrenheit, and a speed of 6500 feet per second.  The oxygen to fuel mixture was 1.0:0.85 at 25 tons of thrust, but as [[ambient pressure]] decreased with flight altitude, thrust increased until it reached 29 tons.<ref name=walter>{{cite book |last1=Dornberger |first1=Walter |title=V-2 |date=1954 |publisher=The Viking Press, Inc. |location=New York |page=17-18,120,122-123,132}}</ref><ref name=\"steven\">{{cite book |last1=Zaloga |first1=Steven |title=V-2 Ballistic Missile, 1942-52 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=9781841765419 |page=19}}</ref><ref name=redstone/>  \n\nDr. Thiel's development of the 25 ton rocket motor relied on pump feeding, rather than on the earlier pressure feeding.  The motor was also based on centrifugal injection and film cooling, in which alcohol was admitted into the motor and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through numerous small perforations.  The injection head was removed from the combustion chamber, which was reduced from 6 to 1 foot, and the connection to the nozzle made cone shaped.  The resultant 1.5 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of 220 [[pounds per square inch]].  Thiel's 1.5 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 4.5 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber.  By 1939, eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the 0.12 inch thick sheet-steel chamber, were used to make the 25 ton motor.<ref name=walter/>{{rp|52-55}}\n\nThe alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] heated the fuel and cooled the [[combustion chamber]]. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled [[boundary layer]] that further protected the wall of the chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse exhaust plume. By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with [[shock diamond]]s.\n\nThe warhead was another source of troubles. The explosive employed was [[amatol|amatol 60/40]] detonated by an electric [[contact fuze]]. Amatol had the advantage of stability, and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of [[fiberglass]], but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed {{convert|975|kg|lb}} and contained {{convert|910|kg|lb}} of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.\n\nThe protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the A-4 did not have the tendency to form ice, which was common to other early missiles (like the [[balloon tank]]-design [[SM-65 Atlas]]). The tanks held {{convert|4173|kg|lb}} of ethyl alcohol and {{convert|5553|kg|lb}} of oxygen.<ref>War machine encyclopedia, Limited publishing, London 1983 p 1690-92</ref>\n\n[[File:Antwerp V-2.jpg|thumb|Captured V-2 on public display in Antwerp, 1945. Exhaust vanes and external rudders in tail section shown.]]\nThe V-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins, and four internal [[graphite]] vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. The LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free [[gyroscope]]s (a horizontal and a vertical) for lateral stabilization, and a [[PIGA accelerometer]] to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and [[azimuth]] to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.<ref>Stakem, Patrick H.

Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named \"Big Ben\" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee, to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.<ref name=\"stock25\">Jeremy Stocker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 \"Britain and Ballistic Missile Defence, 1942\u20132002\"], pp. 20\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Anti-aircraft gun system===\nGeneral [[Frederick Alfred Pile]], commander of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], studied the problem and proposed that enough [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nPile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that were provided with pre-configured firing data for {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nAt a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from [[Roderic Hill]] and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with [[RV Jones]] and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, \"[[Bernard Montgomery|Monty]] beat us to it\", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nWith the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they turned their attention to Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.<ref name=stock25/>\n\n===Direct attack===\nAnother defence against the V-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructure\u2014expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties\u2014or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through [[disinformation]]. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the [[Double-Cross System]]).{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=100}}\n\nAccording to the BBC television presenter [[Raymond Baxter]], who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a V2 launch site, when one missile was launched in front of them. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html|title=V2ROCKET.COM - Den Haag, Wassenaar, Hoek van Holland|website=www.v2rocket.com}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1945 the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the \"Haagse Bos\" in The Hague by a [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|large-scale bombardment]], but due to navigational errors the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians.

{"title_page": "Rock Band Unplugged", "text_new": "{{short description|2009 video game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title=Rock Band Unplugged\n|image=[[File:Rock band unplugged.jpg]]\n|caption=''Rock Band Unplugged'' cover art\n|developer=[[Harmonix]]<br/>[[Backbone Entertainment]]\n|publisher=[[MTV|MTV Games]]\n'''|designer=\n|engine=\n|series=''[[Rock Band]]''\n|released=June 9, 2009\n|genre=[[Rhythm game]]\n|modes=[[Single player]]\n|platforms=[[PlayStation Portable]]\n}}\n\n'''''Rock Band Unplugged''''' is an expansion of the [[Rock Band|''Rock Band'' series]] of [[music video game]]s released for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game is developed by [[Backbone Entertainment]] in conjunction with [[Harmonix]], published by [[MTV Games]] and distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].  The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.\n\nThe core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'', with the player responsible for playing all four instruments&mdash;[[lead guitar|lead]] and [[bass guitar]], [[drum]]s, and [[singing|vocals]]&mdash;using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to ''Rock Band'''s, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the ''Rock Band'' series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to ''Unplugged'' before they are released as [[downloadable content]] for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the [[PlayStation Store]].\n\n''Rock Band Unplugged'', in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a \"Limited Edition Entertainment Pack\" that also includes a ''Rock Band Unplugged''-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie ''[[School of Rock]]''.<ref name=\"pr announce\"/> A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of \"Rock Band Unplugged\" that is compatible with downloadable content <!-- as opposed to the 3 half-song demo in the PS Store --> is included with the [[PSP Go]].<ref name=\"pspgo-rbdemo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/27/psp-gos-rock-band-unplugged-demo-plays-dlc/|title=PSP Go's Rock Band Unplugged demo plays DLC |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:RBUnplugged screen.jpg|left|thumb|The player must repeatedly switch between four different instruments to complete a song.]]\n{{See also|Rock Band#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay features in ''Rock Band''}}\nThe main gameplay modes in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' are similar to that of the console versions of the game. In Tour mode, the player creates a customized band, plays sets of songs at venues around the world, earning cash and fame, and unlocking new vehicles, venues, and staff. Songs completed in Tour mode then become available in Quick Play mode, which allows any song to be played without the need to create a band.\n\nSongs in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' feature tracks for the same four instruments as in ''Rock Band'': lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. During the Quick Play and Tour modes, gameplay is similar to Harmonix' previous games ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'': The player presses combinations of buttons on the PSP to match notes in time with the rhythm of the currently-selected instrument. After completing a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] without missing any notes, the instrument continues to play automatically for a set amount of time, allowing the player to switch to another instrument using the shoulder buttons.<ref name=\"rbu announce\"/> Successfully completing multiple phrases in a row builds a score multiplier, as well as allowing the song to play in its entirety. Not completing a phrase in a track for an extended period of time will drain the Crowd Meter for that instrument, eventually causing the instrument to fail. A failed track will eventually cause the entire band to fail if not saved in time.\n\nOverdrive is handled similarly to the main ''Rock Band'' series. By hitting certain white-colored sections of notes placed throughout a song, the player fills the Energy Meter. Once the meter is at least half full, the player may press down on the D-pad or X to activate Overdrive, which revives all failed instruments and enables a temporary state that boosts the score multiplier and slows the degradation of the Crowd Meter for all instruments.  During solos, the player is automatically switched to the appropriate instrument; each note is scored individually, and the phrasing and track-switching elements do not apply until the solo is over.\n\nTwo additional modes, Band Survival Mode and Warmup Mode, are included in the \"Extras\" section of the game. In both modes, notes are scored individually, instead of being divided into phrases. Tracks will not play automatically, causing the Crowd Meter for unselected instruments to continually drop in Band Survival Mode. In Warmup Mode, only the currently-selected track is affected by missed notes.  No multiplayer mode is included in the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/04/partial-rock-band-unplugged-track-list-revealed.ars | title = Partial Rock Band Unplugged track list revealed | website = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 2009-04-01 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 | first = Andrew | last = Webster }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n''Rock Band Unplugged'' features 41 tracks, all of them [[master recording]]s. The game uses the PSP's Wi-Fi capabilities to provide additional downloadable content from music providers through the PlayStation Store.  Players can also download new tracks to the PSP through the PC version of the PlayStation Store.<ref name=\"pr announce\">{{cite web | url = http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/04-08-2009/0005002756&EDATE= | title = 'Rock Band Unplugged' for the PSP(R) (PlayStation(R)Portable) System: The Award-Winning Music Video Game is Going On the Road On June 9, 2009 | publisher = PR Newswire | date = 2009-04-08 | accessdate = 2009-04-08 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417202302/http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F04-08-2009%2F0005002756&EDATE= | archivedate = April 17, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/02/24/littlebigplanet-psp-announced-plus-tons-of-other-major-titles/ | title = 'LittleBigPlanet' PSP Announced, Plus Tons Of Other Major Titles | first = Stephan | last= Totilo | publisher = [[MTV]] | date=  2009-02-24 | accessdate = 2009-02-24}}</ref> Ten songs were made available for download on the day of the game's release,<ref name=\"gi preview\">{{cite news|title=Rock Band Unplugged|date=May 2009|work=[[Game Informer]]|pages=73}}</ref> and two new songs are released each week.

The ''Lite'' version includes the 5 Starter Pack songs, but can accept all downloadable content (DLC). The in-game Music Store enables users to download any of the original ''Rock Band Unplugged'' songs for the same price as the existing downloadable songs. Original ''Rock Band Unplugged'' songs can only be purchased through the in-game Music Store, while additional DLC songs can be purchased from either the PlayStation Store or the in-game Music Store.

The game's gameplay was praised, likening it to the success of Harmonix' previous games ''Frequency'' and ''Amplitude'',<ref name=\"gameinformer review\"/><ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> and called a \"unexpectedly nostalgic pleasure\".<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> It was further considered a general improvement on the standard ''Rock Band'' gameplay format, \"adding a new level of depth for veteran players\",<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> and that by being in control of all parts of the band, the player would be more connected to their virtual band than in the console versions.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> Reviewers praised the use of sound, particularly the slight volume emphasis given to the current instrument that is being played, though recommended the use of headphones to overcome the poor speaker quality of the PSP unit.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The choice of control scheme was also praised, which avoided introducing too many difficult button combinations on the PSP unit.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> The game's difficulty was also noted to be well-balanced both between songs and individual difficulty levels.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/>\n\nReviewers noted that the \"World Tour\" mode of the game suffered the same problems that both ''Rock Band'' games had when they were first released, in that without additional content, the player would be likely playing the same song several times over as they progress through the tour.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"gameinformer review\"/><ref name=\"1up review\"/> The lack of multiplayer or online leaderboards for ''Rock Band Unplugged'' was considered its largest weakness.<ref name=\"1up review\"/> [[IGN]]'s Greg Miller lamented that unlike the social nature of ''Rock Band'' on consoles, the lack of such interaction cooperative or competitively with a second player leaves little reason to come back to the game or purchase additional content.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Carolyn Petit, in considering the success of the multiplayer aspects of the other ''Rock Band'' titles, considered the omission \"baffling\".<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The cost of additional downloadable content, even in consideration of it being more of the same that already exists in the ''Rock Band'' series, remains the same, from $0.99 to $1.99 a song.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> Reviewers also criticized the need to repurchase such downloadable content for the game, with no way to reuse existing PlayStation 3 ''Rock Band'' content with the PSP game.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140222022324/http://www.rockband.com/games/unplugged ''Rock Band Unplugged'' website] \n\n{{Rock Band series}} \n{{Harmonix games}}\n\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Drumming video games]]\n[[Category:Guitar video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable-only games]]\n[[Category:Rock Band series]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2009 video game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title=Rock Band Unplugged\n|image=[[File:Rock band unplugged.jpg]]\n|caption=''Rock Band Unplugged'' cover art\n|developer=[[Harmonix]]<br/>[[Backbone Entertainment]]\n|publisher=[[MTV|MTV Games]]\n'''|designer=\n|engine=\n|series=''[[Rock Band]]''\n|released=June 9, 2009\n|genre=[[Rhythm game]]\n|modes=[[Single player]]\n|platforms=[[PlayStation Portable]]\n}}\n\n'''''Rock Band Unplugged''''' is an expansion of the [[Rock Band|''Rock Band'' series]] of [[music video game]]s released for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game is developed by [[Backbone Entertainment]] in conjunction with [[Harmonix]], published by [[MTV Games]] and distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].  The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.\n\nThe core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'', with the player responsible for playing all four instruments&mdash;[[lead guitar|lead]] and [[bass guitar]], [[drum]]s, and [[singing|vocals]]&mdash;using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to ''Rock Band'''s, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the ''Rock Band'' series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to ''Unplugged'' before they are released as [[downloadable content]] for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the [[PlayStation Store]].\n\n''Rock Band Unplugged'', in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a \"Limited Edition Entertainment Pack\" that also includes a ''Rock Band Unplugged''-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie ''[[School of Rock]]''.<ref name=\"pr announce\"/> A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of \"Rock Band Unplugged\" that is compatible with downloadable content <!-- as opposed to the 3 half-song demo in the PS Store --> is included with the [[PSP Go]].<ref name=\"pspgo-rbdemo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/27/psp-gos-rock-band-unplugged-demo-plays-dlc/|title=PSP Go's Rock Band Unplugged demo plays DLC |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:RBUnplugged screen.jpg|left|thumb|The player must repeatedly switch between four different instruments to complete a song.]]\n{{See also|Rock Band#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay features in ''Rock Band''}}\nThe main gameplay modes in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' are similar to that of the console versions of the game. In Tour mode, the player creates a customized band, plays sets of songs at venues around the world, earning cash and fame, and unlocking new vehicles, venues, and staff. Songs completed in Tour mode then become available in Quick Play mode, which allows any song to be played without the need to create a band.\n\nSongs in ''Rock Band Unplugged'' feature tracks for the same four instruments as in ''Rock Band'': lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. During the Quick Play and Tour modes, gameplay is similar to Harmonix' previous games ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'': The player presses combinations of buttons on the PSP to match notes in time with the rhythm of the currently-selected instrument. After completing a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] without missing any notes, the instrument continues to play automatically for a set amount of time, allowing the player to switch to another instrument using the shoulder buttons.<ref name=\"rbu announce\"/> Successfully completing multiple phrases in a row builds a score multiplier, as well as allowing the song to play in its entirety. Not completing a phrase in a track for an extended period of time will drain the Crowd Meter for that instrument, eventually causing the instrument to fail. A failed track will eventually cause the entire band to fail if not saved in time.\n\nOverdrive is handled similarly to the main ''Rock Band'' series. By hitting certain white-colored sections of notes placed throughout a song, the player fills the Energy Meter. Once the meter is at least half full, the player may press down on the D-pad or X to activate Overdrive, which revives all failed instruments and enables a temporary state that boosts the score multiplier and slows the degradation of the Crowd Meter for all instruments.  During solos, the player is automatically switched to the appropriate instrument; each note is scored individually, and the phrasing and track-switching elements do not apply until the solo is over.\n\nTwo additional modes, Band Survival Mode and Warmup Mode, are included in the \"Extras\" section of the game. In both modes, notes are scored individually, instead of being divided into phrases. Tracks will not play automatically, causing the Crowd Meter for unselected instruments to continually drop in Band Survival Mode. In Warmup Mode, only the currently-selected track is affected by missed notes.  No multiplayer mode is included in the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/04/partial-rock-band-unplugged-track-list-revealed.ars | title = Partial Rock Band Unplugged track list revealed | website = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 2009-04-01 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 | first = Andrew | last = Webster }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n''Rock Band Unplugged'' features 41 tracks, all of them [[master recording]]s. The game uses the PSP's Wi-Fi capabilities to provide additional downloadable content from music providers through the PlayStation Store.

The game's gameplay was praised, likening it to the success of Harmonix' previous games ''Frequency'' and ''Amplitude'',<ref name=\"gameinformer review\"/><ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> and called a \"unexpectedly nostalgic pleasure\".<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> It was further considered a general improvement on the standard ''Rock Band'' gameplay format, \"adding a new level of depth for veteran players\",<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> and that by being in control of all parts of the band, the player would be more connected to their virtual band than in the console versions.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> Reviewers praised the use of sound, particularly the slight volume emphasis given to the current instrument that is being played, though recommended the use of headphones to overcome the poor speaker quality of the PSP unit.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The choice of control scheme was also praised, which avoided introducing too many difficult button combinations on the PSP unit.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> The game's difficulty was also noted to be well-balanced both between songs and individual difficulty levels.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/>\n\nReviewers noted that the \"World Tour\" mode of the game suffered the same problems that both ''Rock Band'' games had when they were first released, in that without additional content, the player would be likely playing the same song several times over as they progress through the tour.<ref name=\"ign review\"/><ref name=\"gameinformer review\"/><ref name=\"1up review\"/> The lack of multiplayer or online leaderboards for ''Rock Band Unplugged'' was considered its largest weakness.<ref name=\"1up review\"/> [[IGN]]'s Greg Miller lamented that unlike the social nature of ''Rock Band'' on consoles, the lack of such interaction cooperative or competitively with a second player leaves little reason to come back to the game or purchase additional content.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Carolyn Petit, in considering the success of the multiplayer aspects of the other ''Rock Band'' titles, considered the omission \"baffling\".<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/> The cost of additional downloadable content, even in consideration of it being more of the same that already exists in the ''Rock Band'' series, remains the same, from $0.99 to $1.99 a song.<ref name=\"ign review\"/> Reviewers also criticized the need to repurchase such downloadable content for the game, with no way to reuse existing PlayStation 3 ''Rock Band'' content with the PSP game.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140222022324/http://www.rockband.com/games/unplugged ''Rock Band Unplugged'' website] \n\n{{Rock Band series}} \n{{Harmonix games}}\n\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Drumming video games]]\n[[Category:Guitar video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable-only games]]\n[[Category:Rock Band series]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Lacon432", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSoundtrack", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band_Unplugged"}

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up

[[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus

reservoir]]s of SARS-CoV-2]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CCDC) and other institutions;<ref name=\"gisaid\"/><ref name=\"VirologicalInitial\" /> the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a [[common ancestor]]\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> {{As of|2020|March|27|post=,}} 1,495 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.<ref name=\"NextstrainMarch\" />\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five [[conserved sequence]]s of [[nucleic acid]]s, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak]] were insufficient to make them separate [[viral species]]. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]''.<ref name=\"CoronavirusStudyGroup\" />\n\n===Structural biology===\n[[File:Coronavirus virion structure.svg|alt=Figure of a spherical SARSr-CoV virion showing locations of structural proteins forming the viral envelope and the inner nucleocapsid|thumb|right|Structure of a SARSr-CoV virion]]\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 [[virion]] is approximately 50\u2013200 [[nanometre]]s in diameter.<ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N ([[nucleocapsid]]) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the [[viral envelope]].<ref name=\"WuStructure\" /> The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using [[cryogenic electron microscopy]],<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"GZM-20200220\" /> is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a host cell.<ref name=\"WuStructure\" />\n\n[[File:6VSB spike protein SARS-CoV-2 monomer in homotrimer.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=SARS-CoV-2 spike homotrimer with one protein subunit highlighted; ACE2 binding domain highlighted|SARS-CoV-2 spike [[homotrimer]] with one [[protein subunit]] highlighted; ACE2 binding domain in magenta]]\n\n[[Protein structure prediction|Protein modeling]] experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of [[Viral entry|cell entry]].<ref name=\"SCLSModeling\" /> By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using [[reverse genetics]] methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"Letko22Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"NatMicLetko\" /><ref name=\"ElSahly\" /><ref name=\"Gralinski2020\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /> SARS-CoV-2 may also use [[basigin]] to gain cell entry.<ref name=\"CD147\" />\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = SARS-CoV-2 49531042877.jpg | alt1 = SARS-CoV-2 emerging from a human cell | image2 = SARS-CoV-2 scanning electron microscope image.jpg | alt2 = SARS-CoV-2 virions emerging from a human cell | footer_align = center | footer = Digitally colourised [[Micrograph|electron micrographs]] of SARS-CoV-2 virions (yellow) emerging from human cells [[Cell culture|cultured]] in a laboratory}}\n\nInitial spike protein priming by [[TMPRSS2|transmembrane protease, serine 2]] (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" /> After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's [[protease]] TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a [[fusion peptide]].

/>\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural

humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.
