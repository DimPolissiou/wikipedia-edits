{"title_page": "Absorption refrigerator", "text_new": "{{thermodynamics|cTopic=Processes and Cycles}}\nAn '''absorption refrigerator''' is a [[refrigerator]] that uses a heat source (e.g., [[Solar thermal energy|solar]] energy, a fossil-fueled flame, [[waste heat]] from factories, or [[district heating]] systems) to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling process. The system uses two coolants, the first of which performs [[evaporative cooling]] and is then absorbed into the second coolant; heat is needed to reset the two coolants to their initial states. The principle can also be used to [[air conditioning|air-condition]] buildings using the waste heat from a [[gas turbine]] or [[water heating|water heater]]. Using waste heat from a gas turbine makes the turbine very efficient because it first produces [[electricity]], then hot water, and finally, air-conditioning\u2014[[trigeneration]]. Absorption refrigerators are commonly used in [[recreational vehicle]]s (RVs), [[Popup camper|campers]], and [[Caravan_(towed_trailer)|caravans]] because they can be powered with propane fuel, rather than electricity. Unlike more common [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] systems, an absorption refrigerator can be produced with no moving parts other than the coolants.\n\n==History==\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor compression cycle]] it lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Absorption refrigerators are a popular alternative to regular compressor refrigerators where electricity is unreliable, costly, or unavailable, where noise from the compressor is problematic, or where surplus heat is available (e.g., from turbine exhausts or industrial processes, or from solar plants).\n\nAbsorption cooling was invented by the French scientist [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]] in 1858.<ref>Eric Granryd & Bj\u00f6rn Palm, Refrigerating engineering, Stockholm [[Royal Institute of Technology]], 2005, see chap. 4-3</ref> The original design used water and sulphuric acid. In 1922 [[Baltzar von Platen (1898-1984)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]], while they were still students at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], enhanced the principle with a three-fluid configuration. This \"Platen-Munters\" design can operate without a pump.\n\nCommercial production began in 1923 by the newly formed company ''AB Arctic'', which was bought by [[Electrolux]] in 1925. In the 1960s, absorption refrigeration saw a renaissance due to the substantial demand for refrigerators for [[travel trailer|caravan]]s (travel trailers). AB Electrolux established a subsidiary in the United States, named Dometic Sales Corporation. The company marketed refrigerators for [[recreational vehicle]]s (RVs) under the ''[[Dometic]]'' brand. In 2001, Electrolux sold most of its leisure products line to the venture-capital company [[EQT Partners|EQT]] which created ''Dometic'' as a stand-alone company.\n\nIn 1926, [[Albert Einstein]] and his former student [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]] proposed an alternative design known as the [[Einstein refrigerator]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?q=1781541|title=US Patent 1781541}}</ref> At the 2007 [[TED Conference]], [[Adam Grosser]]  presented his research of a new, very small, \"intermittent absorption\" vaccine refrigeration unit for use in third world countries.

Compression refrigerators typically use an [[Chlorofluorocarbon|HCFC]] or [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]], while absorption refrigerators typically use [[ammonia]] or [[water]] and need at least a second fluid able to absorb the coolant, the ''absorbent'', respectively water (for ammonia) or brine (for water). Both types use [[evaporative cooling]]: when the refrigerant evaporates (boils), it takes some heat away with it, providing the cooling effect. The main difference between the two systems is the way the refrigerant is changed from a gas back into a liquid so that the cycle can repeat. An absorption refrigerator changes the gas back into a liquid using a method that needs only heat, and has no moving parts other than the fluids. \n\n[[File:Absorption refrigerator working.svg|300px|right|Absorption cooling process]]\nThe absorption cooling cycle can be described in three phases:\n#'''Evaporation''': A liquid refrigerant evaporates in a low [[partial pressure]] environment, thus extracting heat from its surroundings (e.g. the refrigerator's compartment). Because of the low partial pressure, the temperature needed for evaporation is also low.\n#'''Absorption''': The second fluid, in a depleted state, sucks out the now gaseous refrigerant, thus providing the low partial pressure. This produces a refrigerant-saturated liquid which then flows to the next step:\n#'''Regeneration''': The refrigerant-saturated liquid is heated, causing the refrigerant to evaporate out. \n::a. The evaporation occurs at the lower end of a narrow tube; the bubbles of refrigerant gas push the refrigerant-depleted liquid into a higher chamber, from which it will flow by gravity to the absorption chamber. \n::b. The hot gaseous refrigerant passes through a heat exchanger, transferring its heat outside the system (such as to surrounding ambient-temperature air), and condenses at a higher place. The condensed (liquid) refrigerant will then flow by gravity to supply the evaporation phase.\nThe system thus silently provides for the mechanical circulation of the liquid without a usual pump.\nA third fluid, gaseous, is usually added to avoid pressure concerns when condensation occurs (see below).\n\nIn comparison, a compressor refrigerator uses a compressor, usually powered by either an electric or internal combustion motor, to increase the pressure on the gaseous refrigerant. The resulting hot, high-pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger (\"condenser\") that is exposed to the external environment (usually air in the room). The condensed refrigerant, now at a temperature near to that of the external environment but at higher pressure, then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section. The orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the high pressure condenser section and the low pressure evaporator section.  The lower pressure in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate, which absorbs heat from the refrigerator food compartment. The now-vaporized refrigerant then goes back into the compressor to repeat the cycle. \n\n===Simple salt and water system===\nA simple absorption refrigeration system common in large commercial plants uses a solution of [[lithium bromide]] or [[lithium chloride]] salt and water.  Water under low pressure is evaporated from the coils that are to be chilled. The water is absorbed by a lithium bromide/water solution. The system drives the water off the lithium bromide solution with heat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sapali|first=S.

The intake of warm, moist air is passed through a sprayed solution of salt water. The spray lowers the humidity but does not significantly change the temperature. The less humid, warm air is then passed through an [[evaporative cooler]], consisting of a spray of fresh water, which cools and re-humidifies the air. Humidity is removed from the cooled air with another spray of salt solution, providing the outlet of cool, dry air.\n\nThe salt solution is regenerated by heating it under low pressure, causing water to evaporate. The water evaporated from the salt solution is re-condensed, and rerouted back to the evaporative cooler.\n\n===Single pressure absorption refrigeration===\n[[File:Absorption fridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Domestic absorption refrigerator.'''<br>\n1.

Colour indicates relative temperature: blue=cold, red is hottest. The heat source (7) is contained entirely within the insulation section (6).]]\n\nA single-pressure absorption refrigerator takes advantage of the fact that a liquid's evaporation rate depends upon the ''partial'' pressure of the vapor above the liquid and goes up with lower partial pressure.  While having the same total pressure throughout the system, the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure of the refrigerant (therefore high evaporation rate) in the part of the system that draws heat out of the low-temperature interior of the refrigerator, but maintains the refrigerant at high partial pressure (therefore low evaporation rate) in the part of the system that expels heat to the ambient-temperature air outside the refrigerator.\n\nThe refrigerator uses three substances: [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen]] gas, and [[water]]. The cycle is closed, with all hydrogen, water and ammonia collected and endlessly reused. The system is pressurized to the pressure where the boiling point of ammonia is higher than the temperature of the condenser coil (the coil which transfers heat to the air outside the refrigerator, by being hotter than the outside air.) This pressure is typically 14\u201316&nbsp;atm at which pressure the dew point of ammonia will be about 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe cooling cycle starts with liquid ammonia at room temperature entering the evaporator. The volume of the evaporator is greater than the volume of the liquid, with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen lowers the [[partial pressure]] of the ammonia gas, thus lowering the [[evaporation point]] of the liquid below the temperature of the refrigerator's interior. Ammonia evaporates, taking a small amount of heat from the liquid and lowering the liquid's temperature. It continues to evaporate, while the large [[enthalpy of vaporization]] (heat) flows from the warmer refrigerator interior to the cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas.\n\nIn the next two steps, the ammonia gas is separated from the hydrogen so it can be reused.\n\n#The ammonia (gas) and hydrogen (gas) mixture flows through a pipe from the evaporator into the absorber. In the absorber, this mixture of gases contacts water (technically, a weak solution of ammonia in water). The gaseous ammonia dissolves in the water, while the hydrogen, which doesn't, collects at the top of the absorber, leaving the now-strong ammonia-and-water solution at the bottom. The hydrogen is now separate while the ammonia is now dissolved in the water.\n#The next step separates the ammonia and water. The ammonia/water solution flows to the generator (boiler), where heat is applied to boil off the ammonia, leaving most of the water (which has a higher boiling point) behind. Some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia; this water is removed in the final separation step, by passing it through the separator, an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles, allowing the water vapor to condense and drain back to the generator.\n\nThe pure ammonia gas then enters the condenser. In this [[heat exchanger]], the hot ammonia gas transfers its heat to the outside air, which is below the boiling point of the full-pressure ammonia, and therefore condenses. The condensed (liquid) ammonia flows down to be mixed with the hydrogen gas released from the absorption step, repeating the cycle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adsorption refrigeration]]\n*[[Icyball]]\n*[[Quantum absorption refrigerator]]\n*[[RV Fridge]]\n\nReejeet\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.070604|title=Quantum Absorption Refrigerator|year=2012 |last1=Levy |first1=A. |last2=Kosloff |first2=R.|journal=Phys.

The system uses two coolants, the first of which performs [[evaporative cooling]] and is then absorbed into the second coolant; heat is needed to reset the two coolants to their initial states. The principle can also be used to [[air conditioning|air-condition]] buildings using the waste heat from a [[gas turbine]] or [[water heating|water heater]]. Using waste heat from a gas turbine makes the turbine very efficient because it first produces [[electricity]], then hot water, and finally, air-conditioning\u2014[[trigeneration]]. Absorption refrigerators are commonly used in [[recreational vehicle]]s (RVs), [[Popup camper|campers]], and [[Caravan_(towed_trailer)|caravans]] because they can be powered with propane fuel, rather than electricity. Unlike more common [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] systems, an absorption refrigerator can be produced with no moving parts other than the coolants.\n\n==History==\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor compression cycle]] it lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle).

It formed in 1997 following a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's [[ceasefire]] that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the Real IRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as simply \"the Irish Republican Army\" in English or ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the [[Terrorism Act 2000#Proscribed groups|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]].\n\nSince its formation, the Real IRA has [[Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]] against the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)\u2014formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC)\u2014and the [[British Army]]. It is the largest and most active of the \"[[dissident republican]]\" paramilitary groups [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|operating against]] the British [[security forces]]. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, and with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The organisation has also been responsible for bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and disruption. The most notable of these was the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 people. After that bombing the Real IRA went on ceasefire, but resumed operations again in 2000. In March 2009 it claimed responsibility for an [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting|attack on Massereene Barracks]] which killed two British soldiers, the first to be killed in Northern Ireland since 1997. The Real IRA has also been involved in [[vigilantism in Northern Ireland|vigilantism]], mainly against drug dealers and organised crime gangs. In Dublin in particular it has been accused of extortion and engaging in feuds with these gangs.\n\nIn July 2012 it was reported that [[Republican Action Against Drugs]] (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA.

It formed in 1997 following a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's [[ceasefire]] that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the Real IRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as simply \"the Irish Republican Army\" in English or ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the [[Terrorism Act 2000#Proscribed groups|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]].\n\nSince its formation, the Real IRA has [[Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]] against the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)\u2014formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC)\u2014and the [[British Army]]. It is the largest and most active of the \"[[dissident republican]]\" paramilitary groups [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|operating against]] the British [[security forces]]. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, and with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The organisation has also been responsible for bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and disruption.

From left to right: Sparky, Biff, and Blinky.\n|creator=[[Tom Tomorrow]]\n|current=\n|status=Running\n|syndicate=self-syndicated\n\n|genre= Humor, Political comics, Satirical comics\n|first=1988\n|last=\n}}\n'''''This Modern World''''' is a weekly [[satire|satirical]] [[comic strip]] by [[cartoonist]] and political commentator [[Tom Tomorrow]] (real name Dan Perkins) that covers current events from a left-wing point of view.  Tomorrow also runs a weblog that informs readers about stories of interest, often presented as a follow up to his cartoons. ''This Modern World'' appears mainly in alternative weekly newspapers.\n\n==Summary==\nVisually ''This Modern World'' draws inspiration from a [[retro]], 1950s sensibility, with brightly colored illustrations that are also inspired by [[clip art]]. Initially, the strip was almost completely composed of actual vintage clip art and magazine cutouts, assembled collage-style and often manipulated and retouched. However, Tomorrow has gradually replaced cutouts with his own drawings, which merely mimic the clip art look. Usually drawn in four panels, it is not uncommon for all panels to be identical or nearly so, with only the dialogue and/or facial expressions changing.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe '50s theme extends to the typically verbose dialogue of his human characters which is often bubbly, over-enthusiastic, and na\u00efve. The stupidity of the humans is countered by Sparky, a fast-talking penguin (although the strip occasionally postulates he is actually an [[auk]]) with a red visor, who provides much of the strip's political commentary.\n\nA recurring theme in the comic books (though far less so in the strips) was that of \"reality engineering\", wherein \"the very fabric of space and time\" is mined for \"the good of mankind\". This periodically generates \"reality discontinuities\", where reality breaks down. These are (generally) resolved by reality engineers.<ref>Tomorrow, Tom. \u201cThis Modern World.\u201d Self-Syndicated, 1988.</ref>\n\n==Animation==\nFrom 2000 to 2001, an animated ''This Modern World'' series was produced by Flickerlab for [[Mondo Media]], with [[Bob Harris (writer)|Bob Harris]] as the voice of Sparky. Each episode was approximately five minutes long.\n\n===Crew===\n*'''Directed by''' Harold Moss\n*'''Writers''': Harold Moss, Tom Tomorrow, Bob Harris\n*'''Executive Producer for Mondo Media''': Jan Mallis\n*'''Produced by''' Angela Webb\n*'''Producer for Mondo Media''': Eileen McKee\n*'''Animation Director''': Miguel Hernandez\n*'''Animation''': Matthew Benton, Anand Nunnally, Kareem Thompson, Angela Moy, Antonio Jimenez\n*'''Assistant Animators''': Bill Stout, Matt Bookbinder, D.A. Strawder, Johanna Bystrom\n*'''Illustrations & Backgrounds''': Antonio Jimenez\n*'''Sound Record & Mix''': Tom Lino\n\n==Characters==\nThe series has been through several incarnations through the years, the first of which appeared in the \"Suburban High Life\" comic books published by [[Slave Labor Graphics|Slave Labor]] in the late 1980s. Characters include:\n\n;Tom Tomorrow (fictional)\nIn an \"intermediate\" version of the strip, a character ''named'' Tom Tomorrow was in the strip. He was a [[private investigator|private eye]] who was dressed in a [[radiation suit]] so his face was never seen. He was eventually phased out.\n\n;Dippy the Wonder-Penguin\nTom Tomorrow's sidekick. His vocabulary was limited to \"wank\".\n\n;Sparky the Wonder Penguin\nA sort of upgraded version of Dippy (who had been phased out by the time of Sparky's introduction), Sparky can actually talk. Similar to Dippy, Spark's first words in the strip are \"George [H. W.] Bush is a '''wanker'''\".  A strong liberal advocate, he briefly became a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] after being hit on the head with a random falling toilet.\n\n;Blinky the Dog\nA small dog ([[Boston Terrier]]) who shares some of Sparky's political sympathies. Normally very mellow, he briefly became a radical when steroids were put into his food when he was intended to replace the then-Republican Sparky.\n\n;Bob Friendly\nMr. Friendly is in charge of the advertising section of This Modern World (thus breaking the [[fourth wall]]). It was he who introduced Sparky the Penguin. He appears only occasionally.\n\n;Dr. Wilbur von Philbert\nOne of the longest-running characters in the strip, Dr. von Philbert is the person who discovered how to mine reality for energy.\n\n;Biff and Wanda\nTwo blow-dried [[News anchor|anchorpeople]] of the \"Action McNews\", a newscast in which Tomorrow suggests that most [[News program|TV news]] is little more than PR spin. A Biff and Wanda strip almost always ends with a cut to a commercial break (\"Now, these messages!\")\n\n;Biff and Betty\nBiff and Betty are two [[archetype]]s of 1950s people, who sometimes share their thoughts on the modern world. Biff often appears alone with Sparky, expressing a naive conservative opinion which invariably prompts an exasperated liberal rebuttal from the penguin.\n\n;Invisible Hand of the Free Market Man\nInvisible Hand of the Free Market Man (abbreviated I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man in dialog in the strip) is a [[superhero]] character, wearing what is basically a [[Superman]] costume, with an I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man logo (a hand with the IHOTF in each finger, and M in the palm) where the Superman logo would be.  I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man's head is a giant left hand with facial features in the palm.  I.H.O.T.F.M.-Man is an ardent defender of [[Adam Smith]]'s [[invisible hand]] metaphor, and usually intervenes in situations where the purity of [[free market]] economics is in jeopardy.  His declarations are often based on principles of free market economics taken to their logical extreme.  The first panel of a comic featuring I.H.O.T.F.M-Man is usually a parody of the cover of [[Action Comics 1]].\n\n;Conservative Jones and Moonbat McWacky\nConservative Jones and Moonbat McWacky are two children used in the strip to satirize conservative talking points. Conservative, who is dressed as a detective, asks Moonbat questions about politics. Moonbat gives reasonable answers, which the Conservative turns into illogical statements about liberals.\n\n;Tom Tomorrow\nTom occasionally appears in his own strips, this time as himself (again, breaking the [[fourth wall]]).\n\n;Public figures\nAll the presidents since [[Ronald Reagan]] have appeared, as well as other political and media figures. [[Rush Limbaugh]] is a favorite caricature subject, although he usually talks through a radio and is not personally shown. (He was once, however, depicted as a pig, in a strip parodying the film ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]''.) Conservative columnist [[Ann Coulter]] is often the target of particularly unflattering caricatures, usually popping up in the middle of a strip to make a typically inflammatory remark, ending with a guttural \"Haw haw haw!\" laugh. In a few strips, [[George W. Bush]] gets hold of what appears to be the [[DeLorean time machine|DeLorean]] from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and goes back in time to meet the [[founding fathers]]. [[Karl Rove]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] make frequent appearances.\n\n;Parallel Earth\nThe strip occasionally visits a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel Earth]], a deliberate parody of our own world. A \"small cute dog\" was elected as commander-in-chief in their 2000 presidential election, and re-elected in 2004.\n\n;Planet Glox\nActually shown is only a newscast from Glox with two anchor-aliens. Their newscast resembles Fox News, and they report about news strikingly similar to that on earth, but in factual scientific terminology (i.e., [[Coneheads]]-style), thereby making, for example, fun of the public obsession with the sexual activities of public figures by referring to the global importance of touching reproductive organs.\n\n==Other recurring elements==\n\n===Supergiant Conglomerated Corporation===\nA fictitious, stereotypical [[big business]] or [[megacorporation]] in an unspecified industry, but appears to represent the [[military-industrial complex]]. This company has been portrayed as being unethical, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], obsessed with [[spin (public relations)|spin]], and environmentally unfriendly. Occasionally written as \"Supergiant Amalgamated Corporation\".\n\n===Action McNews===\nThe (presumably local) TV news program on which Biff and Wanda are anchors.\n\n==References==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n*''The Great Big Book of Tomorrow'' (a collection of the cartoons from 1992\u20132002)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://thismodernworld.com/cartoon-archive/ This Modern World Cartoon Archive]\n\n[[Category:Alternative Comics titles]]\n[[Category:1988 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:American comic strips]]\n[[Category:Political comic strips]]\n[[Category:American comedy webcomics]]\n[[Category:Satirical webcomics]]\n[[Category:Political webcomics]]\n[[Category:Comics adapted into animated series]]\n[[Category:Comics featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Comics set in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the comic strip|the album by Stan Kenton|This Modern World (album)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n{{Infobox Comic strip\n|title=This Modern World\n|image=[[File:This Modern World cast.jpg|220px]]\n|caption= Several of the main characters in ''This Modern World.''

The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia.

Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.\n\n===Dataset footprints===\n[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />\n\n===Data binning===\n{{Main|Data binning}}\n\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50\u00d750 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.\n\n===Data reduction===\n{{Main|data reduction}}\nOne advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and result mapping as desired).\n\n===Hierarchical representation===\n{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}\nAs a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.\n\n[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]\n===Equal angle grids===\nEqual angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude\u2013longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A. Jon |last2=Sahr |first2=Kevin |last3=White |first3=Denis |last4=Song |first4=Lian |year=1999 |title=Comparing geometrical properties of global grids |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271\u2013288 |doi=}}</ref> On the actual surface of the globe, the cells are approximately \"square\" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four. By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.\n\n===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===\nLocal and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />\n\n==The c-squares global grid notation==\n[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]\n\n===Initial 10 degree squares===\n10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude\u2013longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.\n\n===Subsequent recursive subdivision===\nC-squares extends the initial WMO 10\u00d710 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:\n*1000 ... 10\u00d710 degree square (up to 1000\u00d71000 km nominal)\n*1000:1 ... 5\u00d75 degree square (up to 500\u00d7500 km nominal)\n*1000:100 ... 1\u00d71 degree square (up to 100\u00d7100 km nominal)\n*1000:100:1 ... 0.5\u00d70.5 degree square (up to 50\u00d750km nominal)\n*1000:100:100 ... 0.1\u00d70.1 degree square (up to 10\u00d710 km nominal)\n*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05\u00d70.05 degree square (up to 5\u00d75km nominal)\n(etc.)\n\nThe nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude \u00b145 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1\u00d71 degree square measures approximately 111\u00d769 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>\n\n[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]\nTo produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).\n\nFrom 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].\n\n==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==\nA set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).\n\nC-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):\n\n[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2|3112:370:2|3112:360:4|3111:360:3|3110:469:3|3112:360:3|3111:469:2|3111:469:1|3110:469:1|3111:458:4|3111:458:3|3110:458:2|3111:457:2|3111:247:3|3110:248:3|3111:246:2|3110:247:2|3111:235:4|3111:134:1|3110:237:1|3112:235:2|3112:225:3|3111:122:4|3110:227:3|3112:124:4|3111:121:2|3112:124:1|3112:122:2|3112:123:1|3110:216:4|3112:112:3|3111:110:3|3110:217:1|3110:216:2|3110:205:3|3110:205:1|3110:206:2|3110:205:2|3010:496:4|3010:496:2 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2| (etc.)].\n\n[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]\nIt should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).\n\n==Spatial searching==\nIn a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.\n\nThe asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.\n\n==Spatial data exchange and assembly==\nExamples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" /> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''

The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia. C-squares codes and associated published software are free to use and the software is released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), a licence of the Free Software Foundation.\n\n==History==\nThe c-squares method was developed by Tony Rees at [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia (then \"CSIRO Marine Research\") in 2001-2, initially as a method for spatial indexing, rapid query, and compact storage and visualization of dataset spatial \"footprints\" in an agency-specific [[Geospatial metadata|metadata directory]] (data catalogue).<ref name=\"about_c-squares\">CSIRO Marine Research, 2002: [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/about-csquares.htm About C-Squares.]</ref><ref name = \"Rees_2002\">Rees, Tony (2002): \"C-squares\u2013a new metadata element for improved spatial querying and representation of spatial dataset coverage in metadata records\".

Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.\n\n===Dataset footprints===\n[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />\n\n===Data binning===\n{{Main|Data binning}}\n\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50\u00d750 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.\n\n===Data reduction===\n{{Main|data reduction}}\nOne advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and result mapping as desired).\n\n===Hierarchical representation===\n{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}\nAs a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.\n\n[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]\n===Equal angle grids===\nEqual angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude\u2013longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A. Jon |last2=Sahr |first2=Kevin |last3=White |first3=Denis |last4=Song |first4=Lian |year=1999 |title=Comparing geometrical properties of global grids |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271\u2013288 |doi=}}</ref> On the actual surface of the globe, the cells are approximately \"square\" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four. By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.\n\n===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===\nLocal and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />\n\n==The c-squares global grid notation==\n[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]\n\n===Initial 10 degree squares===\n10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude\u2013longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.\n\n===Subsequent recursive subdivision===\nC-squares extends the initial WMO 10\u00d710 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:\n*1000 ... 10\u00d710 degree square (up to 1000\u00d71000 km nominal)\n*1000:1 ... 5\u00d75 degree square (up to 500\u00d7500 km nominal)\n*1000:100 ... 1\u00d71 degree square (up to 100\u00d7100 km nominal)\n*1000:100:1 ... 0.5\u00d70.5 degree square (up to 50\u00d750km nominal)\n*1000:100:100 ... 0.1\u00d70.1 degree square (up to 10\u00d710 km nominal)\n*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05\u00d70.05 degree square (up to 5\u00d75km nominal)\n(etc.)\n\nThe nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude \u00b145 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1\u00d71 degree square measures approximately 111\u00d769 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>\n\n[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]\nTo produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).\n\nFrom 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].\n\n==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==\nA set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).\n\nC-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):\n\n[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2|3112:370:2|3112:360:4|3111:360:3|3110:469:3|3112:360:3|3111:469:2|3111:469:1|3110:469:1|3111:458:4|3111:458:3|3110:458:2|3111:457:2|3111:247:3|3110:248:3|3111:246:2|3110:247:2|3111:235:4|3111:134:1|3110:237:1|3112:235:2|3112:225:3|3111:122:4|3110:227:3|3112:124:4|3111:121:2|3112:124:1|3112:122:2|3112:123:1|3110:216:4|3112:112:3|3111:110:3|3110:217:1|3110:216:2|3110:205:3|3110:205:1|3110:206:2|3110:205:2|3010:496:4|3010:496:2 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2| (etc.)].\n\n[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]\nIt should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).\n\n==Spatial searching==\nIn a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.\n\nThe asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.\n\n==Spatial data exchange and assembly==\nExamples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" /> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''
