With their debut single finally recorded, the band, having struggled to choose a new name for the band, settled on Chapel Club,<ref name=\"guestlist.net\"/> inspired by Bowman's interest in religion and religious imagery and by the proximity of the band's rehearsal space to St. Luke's Church on London's Old Street. The single was scheduled for release in October through their management's label East City Records, however despite being named BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record in the World' and gaining radio play on stations including BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC 6Music, XFM and NME Radio, the single was cancelled due to a copyright issue regarding the chorus lyrics from the song \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\". The copyright wrangle was later resolved with the original song's publisher, allowing the band to release the song in the future.\n\nAutumn 2009 saw Chapel Club's first gigs under their new name, as they hosted their own residency at the Shacklewell Arms pub in Dalston, London.<ref name=\"www.music-news.com showreview\">{{cite web|author=Alex Litton |url=http://www.music-news.com/showreview.asp?nReviewID=6747 |title=Chapel Club interview |website=Music-News.com |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}</ref> The gigs attracted significant media attention that led to interest from several independent and major record labels. In November 2009 and after just 3 gigs under their new name, the band signed with Universal Records imprint Polydor.<ref name=\"examiner.co.uk\"/> The band denied press reports that they had signed for large amounts of cash, claiming that their deal favoured creative control and long-term commitment over financial reward. In the same month, the band recorded 'O Maybe I' with Claudius Mittendorfer, at Atomic Heart Studios in New York. The song was recorded and produced in a day and a half. The single, now serving as the band's debut single, was released in February 2010 on Polydor on 7\" and digitally via the band's own website. The single was named Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record in the World' as well as 'Record of the Week' on Steve Harris' XFM show.\n\nIn April 2010, having tried out several producers, the band began work on their debut album with Paul Epworth at The Pool in South London. The album sessions produced a further eight tracks, including follow up single, 'Five Trees' which was released in May 2010 entered the NME chart at number six. The album was mixed and mastered in June, but release was delayed due to Polydor wanting the band to go out on tour to build up a fanbase first. Throughout the summer, the band played a host of UK and European festivals including Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds, Oxford Truck Festival, Middlesbrough Music Live, Sheffield Tramlines, Jersey Live, Belgium's [[Pukkelpop]], Germany's Haldern-pop, Sweden's Way Out West and a headline slot on the second stage at London's Field Day festival.\n\nIn September 2010, the band embarked on the NME Emerge Radar Tour, playing alongside [[The Joy Formidable]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nme.com/news/chapel-club/51892 |title=Emerge NME Radar Tour band Chapel Club give away free download |website=Nme.com |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}</ref> The band's next single 'All The Eastern Girls' was released in October, before the band embarked on a support tour with [[Two Door Cinema Club]] in November/December across Europe.

With their debut single finally recorded, the band, having struggled to choose a new name for the band, settled on Chapel Club,<ref name=\"guestlist.net\"/> inspired by Bowman's interest in religion and religious imagery and by the proximity of the band's rehearsal space to St. Luke's Church on London's Old Street. The single was scheduled for release in October through their management's label East City Records, however despite being named BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record in the World' and gaining radio play on stations including BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC 6Music, XFM and NME Radio, the single was cancelled due to a copyright issue regarding the chorus lyrics from the song \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\". The copyright wrangle was later resolved with the original song's publisher, allowing the band to release the song in the future.\n\nAutumn 2009 saw Chapel Club's first gigs under their new name, as they hosted their own residency at the Shacklewell Arms pub in Dalston, London.<ref name=\"www.music-news.com showreview\">{{cite web|author=Alex Litton |url=http://www.music-news.com/showreview.asp?nReviewID=6747 |title=Chapel Club interview |website=Music-News.com |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}</ref> The gigs attracted significant media attention that led to interest from several independent and major record labels. In November 2009 and after just 3 gigs under their new name, the band signed with Universal Records imprint Polydor.<ref name=\"examiner.co.uk\"/> The band denied press reports that they had signed for large amounts of cash, claiming that their deal favoured creative control and long-term commitment over financial reward. In the same month, the band recorded 'O Maybe I' with Claudius Mittendorfer, at Atomic Heart Studios in New York. The song was recorded and produced in a day and a half. The single, now serving as the band's debut single, was released in February 2010 on Polydor on 7\" and digitally via the band's own website. The single was named Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record in the World' as well as 'Record of the Week' on Steve Harris' XFM show.\n\nIn April 2010, having tried out several producers, the band began work on their debut album with Paul Epworth at The Pool in South London. The album sessions produced a further eight tracks, including follow up single, 'Five Trees' which was released in May 2010 entered the NME chart at number six. The album was mixed and mastered in June, but release was delayed due to Polydor wanting the band to go out on tour to build up a fanbase first.

The [[NSA]] intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, Mihdhar, and the name \"Nawaf\" (Hazmi). While the agency feared \"Something nefarious might be afoot\", it took no further action. The CIA had already been alerted by Saudi intelligence about the status of Mihdhar and Hazmi as al-Qaeda members, and a CIA team broke into Mihdhar's [[Dubai]] hotel room and discovered that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. While [[Alec Station]] alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact, it did not share this information with the FBI. The [[Malaysian Special Branch]] observed the January 5, 2000 meeting of the two al-Qaeda members, and informed the CIA that Mihdhar, Hazmi, and Khallad were flying to [[Bangkok]], but the CIA never notified other agencies of this, nor did it ask the [[State Department]] to put Mihdhar on its watchlist. An FBI liaison to Alec Station asked permission to inform the FBI of the meeting but was told: \"This is not a matter for the FBI.\"{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=310\u2013312}}\n\nBy late June, senior counter-terrorism official [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] and CIA director [[George Tenet]] were \"convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come\", although the CIA believed the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel.{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=235\u2013236}} In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on \"full alert\", telling them, \"Something really spectacular is going to happen here. soon.\" He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] to go to \"Threat Condition Delta.\"{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=344}}{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=236\u2013237}} Clarke would later write: \"Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States. in the FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States. They had specific information about individual terrorists. None of that information got to me or the White House.\"{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nOn July 13, Tom Wilshire, a CIA agent assigned to the FBI's international terrorism division, emailed his superiors at the CIA's [[Counterterrorism Center]] (CTC) requesting permission to inform the FBI that Hazmi was in the country and that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. The CIA never responded.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=340}}\n\nThe same day in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst working in the CTC, was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and they were not given Mihdhar's date of birth nor passport number.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=340\u2013343}} In late August 2001, Gillespie told the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the State Department, the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo, which hindered their efforts.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=352\u2013353}}\n\nAlso in July, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters, Alec Station, and to FBI agents in New York alerting them to \"the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges.\" The agent, Kenneth Williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=350}} In July, Jordan alerted the U.S. that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S.; \"months later\", Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack's codename was \"The Big Wedding\" and that it involved airplanes.{{sfnp|Yitzhak|2016|p=218}}\n\nOn August 6, 2001, the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief (\"PDB\"), designated \"For the President Only\", was entitled [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|\"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\"]] The memo noted that \"The FBI information. indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=THE OSAMA BIN LADEN FILE: National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 343|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB343/|website=The National Security Archive|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-August, one [[Minnesota]] flight school alerted the FBI about [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who had asked \"suspicious questions.\" The FBI found that Moussaoui was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his French visa. Their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of [[probable cause]].{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=350\u2013351}}\n\nThe failures in intelligence-sharing were attributed to 1995 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with CIA and NSA reluctance to reveal \"sensitive sources and methods\" such as tapped phones.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=342\u2013343}} Testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]] in April 2004, then-[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recalled that the \"single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents.\"{{sfnp|Javorsek II|Rose|Marshall|Leitner|2015|p=742}} Clarke also wrote: \"There were failures in the organizations failures to get information to the right place at the right time.\"{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|p=238}}\n\n==Attacks==\n{{Further|Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks}}\n[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Flight paths of the four planes used on September 11]]\n\nEarly on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]]<nowiki/>s and two [[Boeing 767]]<nowiki/>s) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in Los Angeles and one to [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]] in San Francisco) after takeoffs from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts; [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"911-ch1\" /> Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be full of fuel.<ref name=\"Chap7\" /><!-- weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome? -->\n\nThe four flights were:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 11]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 7:59{{nbsp}}a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers.

The [[NSA]] intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, Mihdhar, and the name \"Nawaf\" (Hazmi). While the agency feared \"Something nefarious might be afoot\", it took no further action. The CIA had already been alerted by Saudi intelligence about the status of Mihdhar and Hazmi as al-Qaeda members, and a CIA team broke into Mihdhar's [[Dubai]] hotel room and discovered that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. While [[Alec Station]] alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact, it did not share this information with the FBI. The [[Malaysian Special Branch]] observed the January 5, 2000 meeting of the two al-Qaeda members, and informed the CIA that Mihdhar, Hazmi, and Khallad were flying to [[Bangkok]], but the CIA never notified other agencies of this, nor did it ask the [[State Department]] to put Mihdhar on its watchlist. An FBI liaison to Alec Station asked permission to inform the FBI of the meeting but was told: \"This is not a matter for the FBI.\"{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=310\u2013312}}\n\nBy late June, senior counter-terrorism official [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] and CIA director [[George Tenet]] were \"convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come\", although the CIA believed the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel.{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=235\u2013236}} In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on \"full alert\", telling them, \"Something really spectacular is going to happen here. soon.\" He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] to go to \"Threat Condition Delta.\"{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=344}}{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=236\u2013237}} Clarke would later write: \"Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States. in the FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States. They had specific information about individual terrorists. None of that information got to me or the White House.\"{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nOn July 13, Tom Wilshire, a CIA agent assigned to the FBI's international terrorism division, emailed his superiors at the CIA's [[Counterterrorism Center]] (CTC) requesting permission to inform the FBI that Hazmi was in the country and that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. The CIA never responded.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=340}}\n\nThe same day in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst working in the CTC, was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and they were not given Mihdhar's date of birth nor passport number.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=340\u2013343}} In late August 2001, Gillespie told the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the State Department, the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo, which hindered their efforts.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=352\u2013353}}\n\nAlso in July, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters, Alec Station, and to FBI agents in New York alerting them to \"the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges.\" The agent, Kenneth Williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=350}} In July, Jordan alerted the U.S. that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S.; \"months later\", Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack's codename was \"The Big Wedding\" and that it involved airplanes.{{sfnp|Yitzhak|2016|p=218}}\n\nOn August 6, 2001, the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief (\"PDB\"), designated \"For the President Only\", was entitled [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|\"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\"]] The memo noted that \"The FBI information. indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=THE OSAMA BIN LADEN FILE: National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 343|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB343/|website=The National Security Archive|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-August, one [[Minnesota]] flight school alerted the FBI about [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who had asked \"suspicious questions.\" The FBI found that Moussaoui was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his French visa. Their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of [[probable cause]].{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=350\u2013351}}\n\nThe failures in intelligence-sharing were attributed to 1995 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with CIA and NSA reluctance to reveal \"sensitive sources and methods\" such as tapped phones.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=342\u2013343}} Testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]] in April 2004, then-[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recalled that the \"single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents.\"{{sfnp|Javorsek II|Rose|Marshall|Leitner|2015|p=742}} Clarke also wrote: \"There were failures in the organizations failures to get information to the right place at the right time.\"{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|p=238}}\n\n==Attacks==\n{{Further|Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks}}\n[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Flight paths of the four planes used on September 11]]\n\nEarly on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]]<nowiki/>s and two [[Boeing 767]]<nowiki/>s) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in Los Angeles and one to [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]] in San Francisco) after takeoffs from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts; [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"911-ch1\" /> Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be full of fuel.<ref name=\"Chap7\" /><!-- weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome? -->\n\nThe four flights were:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 11]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 7:59{{nbsp}}a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers.

A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, robberies, gang violence, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and [[murder\u2013suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!
