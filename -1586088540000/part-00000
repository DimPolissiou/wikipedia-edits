The [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] seek refuge with [[Krishna]] at His abode 'on an island called [[Kshir Sagar|Svetadvipa]], which is situated in the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of milk]]' (Canto 8: Chapter 5). Krishna instructs the Devas to form a pact with the [[Asura|Asuras]] (led by [[Mahabali|Bali]]) to churn the ocean of milk and warns them about the emergence of the poison, Kalakuta. Later, 'observing that most of the demons and demigods had been crushed by the falling of the mountain' to be used as a churning rod, Krishna brings them back to life, lifts the Mandara mountain, and carries it on the back of Garuda to the Ocean of Milk (Canto 8: Chapter 6). The Ocean is churned with [[Vasuki]] as a rope, the sleepy Kurma as the base who 'extended for eight hundred thousand miles like a large island' and felt a 'pleasing sensation' at being scratched, and Ajita Himself personally helping. Poison is generated, to which [[Shiva]] 'compassionately took the whole quantity of poison in his palm and drank it' as an example of voluntary suffering for others; the remaining poison was drunk by animals with poisonous bites such as [[Scorpion|scorpions]] and [[Cobra|Cobras]] (Canto 8: Chapter 7).\n\nChurned with a renewed vigor by 'the sons of Kasyapa', the Ocean of Milk produces auspicious beings, including [[Lakshmi]] and [[Dhanvantari]] - 'a plenary portion of a plenary portion of Lord [[Vishnu|Visnu]]' - with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]; Canto 8: Chapter 8). After the demons steal the nectar, [[Vishnu]] incarnates as [[Mohini]]-[[Murti]], who despite warning the lustful and infatuated demons not to trust Her, is still given the Amrita which She distributes to the Devas (Canto 8: Chapter 9). Vishnu leaves and a battle ensues between the Devas and Asuras.

In this account, the [[Daitya|Daityas]] led by [[Mahabali|Bali]] repeatedly defeat the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by [[Indra]] due to being resurrected by the sage [[Shukra|Sukra]] (son of [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]]) when killed, using a mantra provided by [[Shiva]]. Advised by [[Brahma]], the Devas secure an alliance with Bali in [[Patala]], the agreement of Mandarachala (king of the mountains) to be used as a churning rod, and the agreement of [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma - said to be 'endowed with 1/4 of Vishnu's power... to support the Earth' - as the rope and base of the churning rod, respectively. Unable the churn the Ocean of Milk by themselves, the Devas and Asuras approach [[Vishnu]] 'absorbed in deep meditation' in [[Vaikuntha]] for help, who agrees (CCXLIX). \n\nAfter producing several auspicious items (e.g. the [[Kaustubha|Kaustubha Gem]]) and beings (e.g. [[Lakshmi]]), several 'venomous insects and terrible beings' are produced along with 'hundreds of poisonous things' such as [[Halahala]], before the emergence of a powerful poison-being called Kalakuta that wishes to destroy both the Devas and Demons. After challenging them to either swallow him or 'go to Lord [[Shiva]]', the latter is approached and swallows the poison-being before returning to his abode (CCL). The [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] being churned once again produces more auspicious beings and items, including [[Dhanvantari]] with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), before [[Vishnu]] 'assumes the form of a bewitching damsel' ([[Mohini]]) to take the nectar from the Asuras and give it to the Devas. The Asuras are then destroyed by Vishnu in battle using His 'terrible [[Sudarshana Chakra|Chakra]]' (CCLI).

I myself, in the form of a tortoise, shall fully hold the (Mandara) mountain (on my back).|source=Padma Purana (translated by N.A. Deshpande, 1988), Part 5, Chapter 8, Verses 19b-23}}\n[[File:Dashavatara.jpg|thumb|280x280px|the [[Dashavatara]], or ten principle [[Avatar|avatars]] of [[Vishnu]].]]\nIn the second account, narrated by [[S\u016bta|Suta]], as a result of the curse the 'mother of the worlds' ([[Lakshmi]]) disappears, and the world is ruined by drought and famine, forcing the gods - oppressed by hunger and thirst - to seek refuge with [[Vishnu]] at the shore of the [[Kshir Sagar|Milky Ocean]] (Part 5: 8). [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] ([[Vasuki]] in the first account) is used as a churning rope. On [[Ekadashi]] day, the poison Kalakuta emerges, which is swallowed by [[Shiva]] 'meditating upon Vishnu in his heart'. An evil being called [[Alakshmi|Alaksmi]] (i.e. a-Laksmi or 'not [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]]') them emerges and is told to reside in places such as where there is quarrel, gambling, adultery, theft, and so forth (Part 5: 9). The churning continues and auspicious beings and items emerge, including 'the brother of Laksmi, [who] sprang up with nectar. (So also) [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|Tulasi]] [i.e. [[Lakshmi]]], Visnu's wife'. On this occasion, Vishnu assumes the form of [[Mohini]] merely to distribute the nectar amongst the gods, without mention of tricking the Asuras (Part 5: 10).\n\nThe third account, narrated by [[Shiva]], is very similar to the others except with a far greater emphasis on [[Lakshmi]], and although the poison Kalakuta emerges and is swallowed by Shiva, there is no mention of Alaksmi or the Mohini avatar (Part 9: 231-232). The [[N\u0101ga|Naga]] used as a rope for churning is referred to as 'the Lord of the Serpents' (likely [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]]). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned as an avatar of [[Vishnu]] (Part 1: 3.25b-29), as a giver of boons (Part 1: 5.81-87), and is stated to have appeared during the fourth war between the Devas and Asuras (Part 1: 13.180); during the churning, [[Indra]] is stated to have vanquished [[Prahlada]] (Part 1: 13.186)\n* Relating to Kurma as the [[World Turtle|world-turtle]], it is stated 'Due to truth (alone), the sun rises; also the wind blows; the ocean would (i.e. does) not cross its boundary nor would (i.e. does) the Tortoise avert (sustaining) the earth' (Part 2: 53.3); Kurma is also mentioned as the 'first tortoise', the prop of everything, cause of production of ambrosia, and the support of the Earth (Part 7: 71.169-188); finally, after raising the earth from the waters in the form of a boar ([[Varaha]]), it is stated that [[Vishnu]] placed it on the head of [[Shesha|Sesa]] before taking the form of Kurma (Part 9: 237.15-19)\n* Kurma is named as one of the 10 primary avatars ([[Dashavatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] by [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] (Part 7: 66.44-54), [[Brahma]] (Part 7: 71.23-29b), and [[Shiva]] (Part 9: 229.40-44) \n*[[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] and [[Aditi]] are stated to incarnate as [[Vasudeva Anakadundubhi]] and [[Devaki]], the parents of [[Krishna]] (Part 7: 71.244-264)\n* The [[Shaligram|salagrama]] of Kurma is described as 'raised, round on the surface, and is filled with a disc (like figure). Marked with Kaustubha, it has a green colour' (Part 8: 20.51b-73)\n* Kurma is stated to reside in [[Vaikuntha]] (Part 9: 228.19-24); and is one of the 108 names of Vishnu (Part 10: 17.103-117)\n* Shiva gives salutations to Kurma, who 'extracted the Earth along with mountains, forests and groves, from inside the water of the deep ocean' (Part 10:  6.175-190)\n\n=== Shiva Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Shiva Purana|Shiva]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 2:''' 1.44-45, 16.5;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 3:''' 11.19, 11.49-50, 16, 22;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart3|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 3 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 4:''' 4.53, 10.38, 31.134-136, 37.35-39<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart4|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 4 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref>\n|Nothing notable in part 1<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn the [[Shiva Purana]], neither of the two accounts of the [[Samudra manthan]] mention Kurma. Poison is generated by the churning in both accounts, although only in the first account is [[Shiva]] stated to have drank it (Part 3: 16). The second mentions the [[Mohini]] avatar of [[Vishnu]] incarnating at the 'behest of [[Shiva|Siva]]' (Part 3: 22). Other details include:\n\n* It stated that 'On account of the [sexual] alliance of [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Parvati]], the earth quaked with the weight along with [[Shesha|Sesa]] (the serpent) and Kacchapa (the tortoise [i.e. Kurma]). By the weight of Kacchapa, the cosmic air, the support of everything, was stunned and the three worlds became terrified and agitated' (Part 2: 1.44-45); Kurma supports the Earth (Part 3: 11.19)\n* The skull of Kurma is stated to be in the necklace of [[Shiva]] (Part 3: 11.49-50)\n* Kurma is named as one of the 10 primary avatars ([[Dashavatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] (Part 4: 31.134-136)\n* One of the ten 'vital breaths' ([[prana]] or [[Vayu]]) is called 'Kurma' (Part 4: 37.35-36) and is stated to be for 'the activity of closing the eyes' (Part 4: 37.39; the [[Agni Purana]] states it to be for opening the eyes)\n\n=== Skanda Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Skanda Purana|Skanda]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' 8.89, 9-12;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12961|title=THE SKANDA-PURANA PART. 1|last=N.A|date=1950|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS PUBLISHERS PVT.

It rolled on the back, neck, thighs, and space between the knees of the noble-souled tortoise.

In the first, the churning of the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of Milk]] takes place after [[Indra]] is cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]], resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi]], misery to all, and ruin of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], defeated in battle by the [[Asura|Asuras]] who take their precious items such as gems to [[Patala]]. On the advice of [[Brahma]], Indra and the Devas make a pact with [[Mahabali|Bali]], leader of Asuras, to recover the gems from the Ocean of Milk. Unable to move the Mandara mountain to use as a churning rod, [[Vishnu]] is asked for help, who arrives on [[Garuda]], takes the mountain to the ocean, and incarnates as Kurma. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning rope. The Kalakuta poison generated envelopes the Devas and [[Daitya|Daityas]] - causing ignorance and lust - before enveloping all existence (including [[Vaikuntha]]) and reducing the [[World egg|cosmic egg]] to ash (Part 1: 9). [[Shiva]] is approached for refuge, and the origin and need to worship [[Ganesha]] to 'achieve success in undertaking' is explained before Shiva drinks the poison (Part 1: 10). More information on Ganesha-worship is given before the churning resumes, producing many auspicious items and beings, including Lakshmi (Part 1: 11). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), which is taken by the Asuras. Vishnu incarnates as [[Mohini]], and despite warning Bali that 'Women should never be trusted by a wise man' is still given the nectar which She gives to the Devas (Part 1: 12).\n\nIn the second account, Indra is again cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]] (Part 7: 8), resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]], and with her, an absence of 'Penance, Purity, Mercy, Truth... True [[Dharma]], Prosperity... Strength [and] [[Sattva]] (quality of goodness)'. Hunger, poverty, anger, lust, flesh-eating, and perverse-thinking abound, including belief that [[adharma]] is [[dharma]], and perverse interpretations of the [[Vedas]] to justify killing animals (Part 7: 9). [[Vishnu]] is approached for refuge by the Devas and instructs them to churn the [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] (Part 7: 10). Indra forms a pact with the Asuras, [[Shesha|Sesa]] is used as a churning rope with the Mandara Mountain, and Vishnu incarnates as Kurma as the base. After a thousand years of churning the poison [[Halahala]] is generated and swallowed by Shiva; the drops that fell are taken by serpents, scorpions, and some [[Medicine|medicinal]] plants (Part 7: 11). The churning continues for another thousand years, producing auspicious items and beings, including Laksmi (Part 7: 12). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the pitcher of [[Amrita]] which is taken by the Asuras, and Vishnu assumes 'a marvellously beautiful feminine form that enchanted all the world' ([[Mohini]]). Despite warning the Asuras not to trust her, Mohini is given the Amrita which is handed to the Devas before the Asuras are destroyed in battle (Part 7: 13).\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Mohini (Oleograph).jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Mohini]], the female enchantress avatar of [[Vishnu]].]]\nIn the third brief account, the churning takes place after 'a great loss of gems due to wicked souls' and the loss of righteousness. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning cord as the Devas and Asuras 'placed the main plant of activity on the back of the (divine) tortoise and churned out the precious gems'. Many auspicious items and beings are generated, including Sura (alcohol; in other accounts [[Varuni]]) and [[Dhanvantari]]. Quarreling ensues between the Devas and Asuras, and Vishnu incarnates as 'the fascinating form of a woman' ([[Mohini]]) to beguile the demons as [[Indra]] gives them the Sura and via 'slight of hand' takes the [[Amrita]]. Halahala poison is also generated which is consumed by [[Shiva]] (Part 12: 44).\n\nIn the fourth account, the legend is briefly retold by [[Vishvamitra|Visvamitra]]. The details are much the same as the previous accounts, with Vasuki as the cord as the 'Kacchapa (Tortoise incarnation of [[Vishnu|Visnu]]) held up (the mountain)', including the Kalakuta poison drunk by [[Shiva]] and the incarnation of [[Mohini]] to trick the Asuras. The notable exception is that the churning first produces a 'hideous' family of three of [[Samudra manthan|Ratnas]] (jewels); rejected by both the Devas and [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], they are accepted by Ka (i.e. [[Brahma]]; Part 18: 210). \n\nNotably, reminiscent the account of [[Prajapati]] and the [[Tortoise]] in the [[Taittiriya Shakha|Taittiriya Aranyaka]] (see above), there is also an account, during the time of the universal dissolution, when [[Brahma]] 'assumed the form of a ''Khadyota'' ([[Firefly]], Glow-worm)' and moved about for a thousand divine years before finding 'the Lord [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]] asleep in the form of a tortoise'. Woken by Brahma, Vishnu 'got up ejecting the three worlds that had been swallowed at the time of the close of the [previous] [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]' with all creation - including the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], moon, sun, and planets - being generated from and by Him. Vishnu also sees the Earth 'was in the great ocean perched on the back of the tortoise' (Part 14: Reva Khanda: 7). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned to have held the Mandara Mountain (Part 1: 8.89);\n* After being resorted to by [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] and 'Permeated by her, Kurma, the sire of the universe, lifted up the [[Vedas]]' (Part 2: 47.12-15)\n* Exploring the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]], 'The primordial Tortoise that was stationed as the bulbous root of the Golden Mountain as well as its support was seen by Acyuta [Vishnu]'; It is also by Shiva's blessing that [[Shesha|Sesa]], Kurma, and others are capable of bearing the burden of that Linga (Part 3: Uttarardha: 11.8-11)\n* After [[Varaha]] lifted the earth out of the waters, [[Vishnu]] 'placed the Elephants of the Quarters, the King of Serpents and the Tortoise for giving her extra support. That receptacle of Mercy ([[Hari]]) willingly applied his own [[Shakti|Sakti]] (power) in an unmanifest form as a support for them all' (Part 4: Venkatacala Mahatmya: 36.20-26); [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] also states Kurma supports the earth (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22); and [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma are also later stated to stabilise the Earth (Part 17: Nagara Khanda: 144.117)\n* Kurma is mentioned where [[Vishnu]] is stated to be the annihilator in the form of [[Rudra]] (Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra Mahatmya:  22.32-43)\n* Kurma is named as one of 12 incarnations of [[Vishnu]], who states to [[Brahma]]:\n\n{{quote|When the sons of [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] (i.e. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[Asura|Asuras]]) will churn the ocean for (obtaining) nectar, I [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]], assuming the form of a tortoise, will bear on my back Mount Mandara used as the churning rod.|source=Skanda Purana (Unknown translator, 1951), Part 7, Chapter 18, Verses 12-20}}\n\n* In the procedure for [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] [[Mandala]] construction, [[Matsya]] and Kurma should be installed in the South-West and depicted as animals below the waist but in human form above (Part 7: Vasudeva-Mamatmya: 27.32-33)\n*It is stated that the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]] evolved from 'the back of a tortoise (shell)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 19.16) and that 'The [[B\u012bj\u0101|Bija]] [origin] of Vahni (Fire) is accompanied by (the seed of) [[Vayu|Vata]] (Wind) and the Bija of Kurma (tortoise)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 20.20-23)\n*One of the names of the Goddess [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]] is 'Kurmayana', meaning 'Having the tortoise as her vehicle' (Part 10: Purvardha: 29.17-168)\n*It is stated that 'Like a tortoise that withdraws all its limbs, he who withdraws the sense-organs though the proper procedure of [[Pratyahara]] shall become free from sins' (Part 10: Purvardha: 41.102)\n*[[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]] - the [[Shakti]] of Kurma - has a noose in her hand and is located to the south of [[Lakshmi|Mahalaksmi]] (Part 11: Uttarardha: 70.69)\n*'Kurma' is one of the thousand names ([[Vishnu Sahasranama]]) of [[Vishnu]] (Part 12: Avantiksetra Mahatmya: 63.83)\n*Kurma is listed in the [[Dashavatara]], or ten primary incarnations of Vishnu (Part 15: Reva-Khanda, 151.1-7)\n*[[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] refers to a Ksetra (temple) that stands on Kaccapa (i.e. a tortoise) and states there will be a city named after Him, ''Bhrgukaccha'' (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22)\n*[[Indradyumna|Indrayumna]] visits a tortoise living in [[Manasa]] Lake, called Mantharaka.

The [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] seek refuge with [[Krishna]] at His abode 'on an island called [[Kshir Sagar|Svetadvipa]], which is situated in the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of milk]]' (Canto 8: Chapter 5). Krishna instructs the Devas to form a pact with the [[Asura|Asuras]] (led by [[Mahabali|Bali]]) to churn the ocean of milk and warns them about the emergence of the poison, Kalakuta. Later, 'observing that most of the demons and demigods had been crushed by the falling of the mountain' to be used as a churning rod, Krishna brings them back to life, lifts the Mandara mountain, and carries it on the back of Garuda to the Ocean of Milk (Canto 8: Chapter 6). The Ocean is churned with [[Vasuki]] as a rope, the sleepy Kurma as the base who 'extended for eight hundred thousand miles like a large island' and felt a 'pleasing sensation' at being scratched, and Ajita Himself personally helping. Poison is generated, to which [[Shiva]] 'compassionately took the whole quantity of poison in his palm and drank it' as an example of voluntary suffering for others; the remaining poison was drunk by animals with poisonous bites such as [[Scorpion|scorpions]] and [[Cobra|Cobras]] (Canto 8: Chapter 7).\n\nChurned with a renewed vigor by 'the sons of Kasyapa', the Ocean of Milk produces auspicious beings, including [[Lakshmi]] and [[Dhanvantari]] - 'a plenary portion of a plenary portion of Lord [[Vishnu|Visnu]]' - with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]; Canto 8: Chapter 8). After the demons steal the nectar, [[Vishnu]] incarnates as [[Mohini]]-[[Murti]], who despite warning the lustful and infatuated demons not to trust Her, is still given the Amrita which She distributes to the Devas (Canto 8: Chapter 9).

In the first, the churning of the ocean of Milk takes place after [[Indra]] is cursed by the sage [[Durvasa]] for arrogance, resulting in the gods and the people of Earth being 'deprived of their glory' (Prakriti-Khanda: 36/XXXVI).

In this account, the [[Daitya|Daityas]] led by [[Mahabali|Bali]] repeatedly defeat the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by [[Indra]] due to being resurrected by the sage [[Shukra|Sukra]] (son of [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]]) when killed, using a mantra provided by [[Shiva]]. Advised by [[Brahma]], the Devas secure an alliance with Bali in [[Patala]], the agreement of Mandarachala (king of the mountains) to be used as a churning rod, and the agreement of [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma - said to be 'endowed with 1/4 of Vishnu's power... to support the Earth' - as the rope and base of the churning rod, respectively. Unable the churn the Ocean of Milk by themselves, the Devas and Asuras approach [[Vishnu]] 'absorbed in deep meditation' in [[Vaikuntha]] for help, who agrees (CCXLIX). \n\nAfter producing several auspicious items (e.g. the [[Kaustubha|Kaustubha Gem]]) and beings (e.g. [[Lakshmi]]), several 'venomous insects and terrible beings' are produced along with 'hundreds of poisonous things' such as [[Halahala]], before the emergence of a powerful poison-being called Kalakuta that wishes to destroy both the Devas and Demons. After challenging them to either swallow him or 'go to Lord [[Shiva]]', the latter is approached and swallows the poison-being before returning to his abode (CCL). The [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] being churned once again produces more auspicious beings and items, including [[Dhanvantari]] with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), before [[Vishnu]] 'assumes the form of a bewitching damsel' ([[Mohini]]) to take the nectar from the Asuras and give it to the Devas. The Asuras are then destroyed by Vishnu in battle using His 'terrible [[Sudarshana Chakra|Chakra]]' (CCLI).

In the first, narrated by [[Pulastya]], as a result of the curse the 'three worlds, along with Indra, were void of affluence... [and] the [[Daitya|Daityas]] (sons of [[Diti]]) and [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]] (sons of [[Danu (Asura)|Danu]]) started military operations against [the] gods', forcing them to seek refuge with [[Vishnu]]. [[Vasuki]] is used as a rope to churn the ocean. Notably, during the churning, [[Varuni]] (Goddess of Wine) is upon emerging rejected by the gods and accepted by the [[Asura|Asuras]], the opposite of the account given in the [[Brahmanda Purana]] (to explain the meaning of 'Asura'). Unnamed poison also emerges which is drunk by [[Shiva]], before the emergence of [[Dhanvantari]] with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]) as well as [[Lakshmi]].

[[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] ([[Vasuki]] in the first account) is used as a churning rope. On [[Ekadashi]] day, the poison Kalakuta emerges, which is swallowed by [[Shiva]] 'meditating upon Vishnu in his heart'. An evil being called [[Alakshmi|Alaksmi]] (i.e. a-Laksmi or 'not [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]]') them emerges and is told to reside in places such as where there is quarrel, gambling, adultery, theft, and so forth (Part 5: 9). The churning continues and auspicious beings and items emerge, including 'the brother of Laksmi, [who] sprang up with nectar. (So also) [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|Tulasi]] [i.e. [[Lakshmi]]], Visnu's wife'. On this occasion, Vishnu assumes the form of [[Mohini]] merely to distribute the nectar amongst the gods, without mention of tricking the Asuras (Part 5: 10).\n\nThe third account, narrated by [[Shiva]], is very similar to the others except with a far greater emphasis on [[Lakshmi]], and although the poison Kalakuta emerges and is swallowed by Shiva, there is no mention of Alaksmi or the Mohini avatar (Part 9: 231-232). The [[N\u0101ga|Naga]] used as a rope for churning is referred to as 'the Lord of the Serpents' (likely [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]]). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned as an avatar of [[Vishnu]] (Part 1: 3.25b-29), as a giver of boons (Part 1: 5.81-87), and is stated to have appeared during the fourth war between the Devas and Asuras (Part 1: 13.180); during the churning, [[Indra]] is stated to have vanquished [[Prahlada]] (Part 1: 13.186)\n* Relating to Kurma as the [[World Turtle|world-turtle]], it is stated 'Due to truth (alone), the sun rises; also the wind blows; the ocean would (i.e. does) not cross its boundary nor would (i.e. does) the Tortoise avert (sustaining) the earth' (Part 2: 53.3); Kurma is also mentioned as the 'first tortoise', the prop of everything, cause of production of ambrosia, and the support of the Earth (Part 7: 71.169-188); finally, after raising the earth from the waters in the form of a boar ([[Varaha]]), it is stated that [[Vishnu]] placed it on the head of [[Shesha|Sesa]] before taking the form of Kurma (Part 9: 237.15-19)\n* Kurma is named as one of the 10 primary avatars ([[Dashavatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] by [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] (Part 7: 66.44-54), [[Brahma]] (Part 7: 71.23-29b), and [[Shiva]] (Part 9: 229.40-44) \n*[[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] and [[Aditi]] are stated to incarnate as [[Vasudeva Anakadundubhi]] and [[Devaki]], the parents of [[Krishna]] (Part 7: 71.244-264)\n* The [[Shaligram|salagrama]] of Kurma is described as 'raised, round on the surface, and is filled with a disc (like figure).

The second mentions the [[Mohini]] avatar of [[Vishnu]] incarnating at the 'behest of [[Shiva|Siva]]' (Part 3: 22).

It rolled on the back, neck, thighs, and space between the knees of the noble-souled tortoise.

In the first, the churning of the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of Milk]] takes place after [[Indra]] is cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]], resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi]], misery to all, and ruin of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], defeated in battle by the [[Asura|Asuras]] who take their precious items such as gems to [[Patala]]. On the advice of [[Brahma]], Indra and the Devas make a pact with [[Mahabali|Bali]], leader of Asuras, to recover the gems from the Ocean of Milk. Unable to move the Mandara mountain to use as a churning rod, [[Vishnu]] is asked for help, who arrives on [[Garuda]], takes the mountain to the ocean, and incarnates as Kurma. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning rope. The Kalakuta poison generated envelopes the Devas and [[Daitya|Daityas]] - causing ignorance and lust - before enveloping all existence (including [[Vaikuntha]]) and reducing the [[World egg|cosmic egg]] to ash (Part 1: 9). [[Shiva]] is approached for refuge, and the origin and need to worship [[Ganesha]] to 'achieve success in undertaking' is explained before Shiva drinks the poison (Part 1: 10). More information on Ganesha-worship is given before the churning resumes, producing many auspicious items and beings, including Lakshmi (Part 1: 11). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), which is taken by the Asuras. Vishnu incarnates as [[Mohini]], and despite warning Bali that 'Women should never be trusted by a wise man' is still given the nectar which She gives to the Devas (Part 1: 12).\n\nIn the second account, Indra is again cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]] (Part 7: 8), resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]], and with her, an absence of 'Penance, Purity, Mercy, Truth... True [[Dharma]], Prosperity... Strength [and] [[Sattva]] (quality of goodness)'. Hunger, poverty, anger, lust, flesh-eating, and perverse-thinking abound, including belief that [[adharma]] is [[dharma]], and perverse interpretations of the [[Vedas]] to justify killing animals (Part 7: 9). [[Vishnu]] is approached for refuge by the Devas and instructs them to churn the [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] (Part 7: 10). Indra forms a pact with the Asuras, [[Shesha|Sesa]] is used as a churning rope with the Mandara Mountain, and Vishnu incarnates as Kurma as the base. After a thousand years of churning the poison [[Halahala]] is generated and swallowed by Shiva; the drops that fell are taken by serpents, scorpions, and some [[Medicine|medicinal]] plants (Part 7: 11). The churning continues for another thousand years, producing auspicious items and beings, including Laksmi (Part 7: 12). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the pitcher of [[Amrita]] which is taken by the Asuras, and Vishnu assumes 'a marvellously beautiful feminine form that enchanted all the world' ([[Mohini]]). Despite warning the Asuras not to trust her, Mohini is given the Amrita which is handed to the Devas before the Asuras are destroyed in battle (Part 7: 13).\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Mohini (Oleograph).jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Mohini]], the female enchantress avatar of [[Vishnu]].]]\nIn the third brief account, the churning takes place after 'a great loss of gems due to wicked souls' and the loss of righteousness. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning cord as the Devas and Asuras 'placed the main plant of activity on the back of the (divine) tortoise and churned out the precious gems'. Many auspicious items and beings are generated, including Sura (alcohol; in other accounts [[Varuni]]) and [[Dhanvantari]]. Quarreling ensues between the Devas and Asuras, and Vishnu incarnates as 'the fascinating form of a woman' ([[Mohini]]) to beguile the demons as [[Indra]] gives them the Sura and via 'slight of hand' takes the [[Amrita]]. Halahala poison is also generated which is consumed by [[Shiva]] (Part 12: 44).\n\nIn the fourth account, the legend is briefly retold by [[Vishvamitra|Visvamitra]]. The details are much the same as the previous accounts, with Vasuki as the cord as the 'Kacchapa (Tortoise incarnation of [[Vishnu|Visnu]]) held up (the mountain)', including the Kalakuta poison drunk by [[Shiva]] and the incarnation of [[Mohini]] to trick the Asuras. The notable exception is that the churning first produces a 'hideous' family of three of [[Samudra manthan|Ratnas]] (jewels); rejected by both the Devas and [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], they are accepted by Ka (i.e. [[Brahma]]; Part 18: 210). \n\nNotably, reminiscent the account of [[Prajapati]] and the [[Tortoise]] in the [[Taittiriya Shakha|Taittiriya Aranyaka]] (see above), there is also an account, during the time of the universal dissolution, when [[Brahma]] 'assumed the form of a ''Khadyota'' ([[Firefly]], Glow-worm)' and moved about for a thousand divine years before finding 'the Lord [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]] asleep in the form of a tortoise'. Woken by Brahma, Vishnu 'got up ejecting the three worlds that had been swallowed at the time of the close of the [previous] [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]' with all creation - including the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], moon, sun, and planets - being generated from and by Him. Vishnu also sees the Earth 'was in the great ocean perched on the back of the tortoise' (Part 14: Reva Khanda: 7). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned to have held the Mandara Mountain (Part 1: 8.89);\n* After being resorted to by [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] and 'Permeated by her, Kurma, the sire of the universe, lifted up the [[Vedas]]' (Part 2: 47.12-15)\n* Exploring the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]], 'The primordial Tortoise that was stationed as the bulbous root of the Golden Mountain as well as its support was seen by Acyuta [Vishnu]'; It is also by Shiva's blessing that [[Shesha|Sesa]], Kurma, and others are capable of bearing the burden of that Linga (Part 3: Uttarardha: 11.8-11)\n* After [[Varaha]] lifted the earth out of the waters, [[Vishnu]] 'placed the Elephants of the Quarters, the King of Serpents and the Tortoise for giving her extra support. That receptacle of Mercy ([[Hari]]) willingly applied his own [[Shakti|Sakti]] (power) in an unmanifest form as a support for them all' (Part 4: Venkatacala Mahatmya: 36.20-26); [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] also states Kurma supports the earth (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22); and [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma are also later stated to stabilise the Earth (Part 17: Nagara Khanda: 144.117)\n* Kurma is mentioned where [[Vishnu]] is stated to be the annihilator in the form of [[Rudra]] (Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra Mahatmya:  22.32-43)\n* Kurma is named as one of 12 incarnations of [[Vishnu]], who states to [[Brahma]]:\n\n{{quote|When the sons of [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] (i.e. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[Asura|Asuras]]) will churn the ocean for (obtaining) nectar, I [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]], assuming the form of a tortoise, will bear on my back Mount Mandara used as the churning rod.|source=Skanda Purana (Unknown translator, 1951), Part 7, Chapter 18, Verses 12-20}}\n\n* In the procedure for [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] [[Mandala]] construction, [[Matsya]] and Kurma should be installed in the South-West and depicted as animals below the waist but in human form above (Part 7: Vasudeva-Mamatmya: 27.32-33)\n*It is stated that the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]] evolved from 'the back of a tortoise (shell)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 19.16) and that 'The [[B\u012bj\u0101|Bija]] [origin] of Vahni (Fire) is accompanied by (the seed of) [[Vayu|Vata]] (Wind) and the Bija of Kurma (tortoise)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 20.20-23)\n*One of the names of the Goddess [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]] is 'Kurmayana', meaning 'Having the tortoise as her vehicle' (Part 10: Purvardha: 29.17-168)\n*It is stated that 'Like a tortoise that withdraws all its limbs, he who withdraws the sense-organs though the proper procedure of [[Pratyahara]] shall become free from sins' (Part 10: Purvardha: 41.102)\n*[[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]] - the [[Shakti]] of Kurma - has a noose in her hand and is located to the south of [[Lakshmi|Mahalaksmi]] (Part 11: Uttarardha: 70.69)\n*'Kurma' is one of the thousand names ([[Vishnu Sahasranama]]) of [[Vishnu]] (Part 12: Avantiksetra Mahatmya: 63.83)\n*Kurma is listed in the [[Dashavatara]], or ten primary incarnations of Vishnu (Part 15: Reva-Khanda, 151.1-7)\n*[[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] refers to a Ksetra (temple) that stands on Kaccapa (i.e. a tortoise) and states there will be a city named after Him, ''Bhrgukaccha'' (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22)\n*[[Indradyumna|Indrayumna]] visits a tortoise living in [[Manasa]] Lake, called Mantharaka. The tortoise reveals it used to be a [[Brahmin]] called [[Shandilya (Rishi)|Sandilya]], who as a boy he would use baked bricks to build altars. Although reborn as great King, he was overtaken by lust and was cursed by [[Shiva]] to incarnate as a tortoise (Part 18: Nagara Khanda: 271.245-455)\n*The star constellations in the form of Kurma (i.e. the tortoise) are discussed, where it is also stated Kurma is stationed in [[Bharata Khanda|Bharata]] and faces the east (Part 19: Prabhasa-Ksetra Mahatmya: 7.17-37 and 11.18)\n*A Holy spot called Prabhasa in [[Bharata Khanda|Bharata]] is located to the south-west of the shrine of Kurma (Part 20: Prabhasa Khanda: 167.33)\n*The 13 wives of [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] named are somewhat different to other Puranic accounts (Aditi, Diti, Vinata, Kadru, Simhika, Suprabha, Uluki, Anuviddha, Sita, Irsya, Himsa, Maya, and Niskrti; Part 20: Prabhasa Khanda: 199.11-12)\n\n=== Vamana Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Vamana Purana|Vamana]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|N/A\n|No notable mentions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.313087|title=The Vamana Purana With English Translation|last=Gupta|first=anand Swarup|date=1968}}</ref>\n|}\n\n=== Varaha Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Varaha Purana|Varaha]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' 4.2-3, 8.43, 12.10, 40, 41.46-48, 48.17, 55.36-39, 113.21, 113.42;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12962|title=THE VARAHA PURANA PART. 1|last=N.A|date=1960|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, DELHI}}</ref> '''Part 2:''' 163.35, 211.69<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12972|title=THE VARAHA PURANA PART. 2|last=N.A|date=1960|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, DELHI}}</ref>\n|}\n\n{{quote|...[''Kurmadvadasivrata'': In] the month of Pausa ([[Makara (month)|Makara]]) [[Amrita|amrta]] was churned from the ocean, and then lord [[Vishnu|Visnu]], on his own accord, became a Kurma (tortoise).
