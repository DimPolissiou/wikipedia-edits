The name \"Sturnidae\" comes from the [[Latin]] word for starling, ''sturnus''. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called [[myna]]s, and many African species are known as [[Lamprotornis|glossy starlings]] because of their [[iridescence|iridescent]] [[Feather|plumage]]. Starlings are native to [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], as well as northern [[Australia]] and the islands of the tropical [[Pacific]]. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as [[North America]], [[Hawaii]] and [[New Zealand]], where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be [[invasive species]]. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the [[common starling]], and throughout much of [[Asia]] and the Pacific, the [[common myna]] is indeed common.\n\nStarlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very [[gregarious]]. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat [[insect]]s and [[fruit]]. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively [[omnivore]]s. Many species search for prey such as [[Beetle#Development|grub]]s by \"open-bill probing\", that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb ''zirkeln'' (pronounced {{IPA-de|\u02c8ts\u026a\u0281kl\u0329n|}}).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=East R.  |author2=R.

Most species nest in holes and lay blue or white [[bird egg|eggs]].\n\nStarlings have diverse and complex vocalizations and have been known to embed sounds from their surroundings into their own calls, including [[car alarm]]s and human speech patterns. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls and are the subject of research into the evolution of [[human language]].<ref>{{ cite web | last=Zimmer | first=Carl | date=2 May 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/science/02song.html | title=Starlings' listening skills may shed light on language evolution | work=The New York Times | accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Starling (5503763150).jpg|thumb|[[Common starling]] (''Sturnus vulgaris'') has [[iridescent]] [[plumage]]]]\nStarlings are medium-sized [[passerines]].<ref name = \"HBW\">{{cite book|first=Adrian|last=Craig |first2=Chris |last2=Feare|editor1=del Hoyo, Josep |editor2=Elliott, Andrew |editor3=Christie, David |contribution=Family Sturnidae (Starlings)|title=Handbook of the Birds of the World.

The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to [[iridescence]]; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have [[Crest (feathers)|crests]] or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or, as in the [[Bali starling]], structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibres. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Distribution, habitat and movements==\n[[File:Chestnut-tailed Starling I IMG 2508.jpg|thumb|[[Chestnut-tailed starling]] is a partial migrant over much of the east of its range, but its movements are poorly understood]]\nStarlings inhabit a wide range of habitats from the [[Arctic Circle]] to the [[Equator]]. In fact the only habitat they do not typically occupy is the driest sandy deserts. The family is naturally absent from the Americas and from large parts of Australia but is present over the majority of Europe, Africa and Asia. The genus ''[[Aplonis]]'' has also spread widely across the islands of the Pacific reaching [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]]<ref name = \"HBW\"/> (in addition one species in the genus ''[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]'' has reached the [[Solomon Islands]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Doughty|first=Chris |author2=Day, Nicholas |author3=Andrew Plant|title=Birds of the Solomons, Vanuatu & New Caledonia|publisher=Christopher Helm|location=London|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7136-4690-0}}</ref>). It is also a species of this genus that is the only starling found in northern Australia.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nAsian species are most common in evergreen forests; 39 species found in Asia are predominantly forest birds as opposed to 24 found in more open or human modified environments. In contrast to this, African species are more likely to be found in open woodlands and savannah; 33 species are open area specialists compared to 13 true forest species. The high diversity of species found in Asia and Africa is not matched by Europe, which has one widespread (and very common) species and two more restricted species. The [[European starling]] is both highly widespread and extremely catholic in its habitat, occupying most types of open habitat. Like many other starling species it has also adapted readily to human-modified habitat, including farmland, orchards, plantations and urban areas.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nSome species of starling are [[bird migration|migratory]], either entirely, like the [[Shelley's starling]], which breeds in [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Somalia]] and migrates to [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and southern Somalia, or the [[white-shouldered starling]], which is migratory in part of its range but is resident in others.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe [[European starling]] was purposefully introduced to North America in 1890\u20131891 by the [[American Acclimatization Society]], an organization dedicated to introducing European flora and fauna into North America for cultural and economic reasons.  [[Eugene Schieffelin]], chairman at the time, allegedly decided all birds mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] should be in North America (the bird had been mentioned in [[Henry IV, Part 1]]). A hundred of them were released from New York's [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"Mirsky\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=call-of-the-reviled|date=May 23, 2008 |journal=Scientific American |title=Shakespeare to blame for introduction of European starlings to U.S |first1=Steve |last1=Mirsky |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Spectacular Starlings at Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve, Cymru, Wales.webm|thumb|[[Swarm behaviour|Murmuration]] of common starlings at [[Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve]], [[Wales]]]]\nThe starlings are generally a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. A [[murmuration]] describes both the [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] of starlings, as well as their consequentially large flight formations. These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behaviour; in the non-breeding season some roosts can number in the thousands of birds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Mimic ===\nStarlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15\u201320 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species or calls that are simple in frequency structure and show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. There are local dialects of mimicked sounds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Aplonis opaca.jpg|thumb|[[Micronesian starling]]s have been observed feeding on the eggs of [[seabird]]s]]\nThe diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example [[Santalum album|white sandalwood]], [[Ficus benghalensis|Indian Banyan]]. In addition to trees they are also important dispersers of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[mistletoe]]s. In South Africa, the [[red-winged starling]] is an important disperser of the [[introduced species|introduced]] ''[[Acacia cyclops]]''. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, which led to the speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> Laboratory experiments on [[European starling]]s have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Prinzinger |first=R.|author2=Hakimi G.A. |year=1996|title=Alcohol resorption and alcohol degradation in the European Starling ''Sturnus vulgaris''|journal=Journal f\u00fcr Ornithologie|volume=137|issue=3|pages=319\u2013327|doi=10.1007/BF01651072}}</ref> In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume [[nectar]]. The extent to which starlings are important [[pollinator]]s is unknown, but at least some are, such as the [[slender-billed starling]] of alpine East Africa, which pollinates [[megaherb|giant]] [[lobelia]]s.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Systematics==\n{{update section|date=December 2019}}\nThe starling family Sturnidae was introduced (as Sturnidia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | volume=1815 | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=68 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310146 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=157, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref>\nThe starlings belong to the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] Muscicapoidea, together with [[thrush (bird)|thrush]]es, [[Old World flycatcher|flycatcher]]s and [[chat (bird)|chat]]s, as well as [[dippers]], which are quite distant relatives, and [[Mimidae]] (thrashers and mockingbirds).

The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping conveys little information about [[biogeography]], and obscures the evolutionary distinctness of the three lineages. Establishing a valid name for the [[clade]] consisting of Sibley/Monroe's \"pan-Sturnidae\" would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.\n\nStarlings probably originated in the general area of [[East Asia]], perhaps towards the southwestern [[Pacific]], as evidenced by the number of [[plesiomorph]]ic lineages to occur there. Expansion into Africa appears to have occurred later, as most [[Synapomorphy|derived]] forms are found there. An alternative scenario would be African origin for the entire \"sturnoid\" group,<ref name=zuccon/> with the oxpeckers representing an ancient [[relict]] and the mimids arriving in South America.

Given the overall evidence for origin of most [[Passeri]] families in the first half of the [[Miocene]], it appears to be not too far off the mark however.<ref name=zuccon/>\n\nAs of 2007, recent studies<ref name=zuccon/><ref name=cibois/> identified two major [[clade]]s of this family, corresponding to the generally drab, often striped, largish \"atypical [[myna]]s\" and other mainly Asian-Pacific lineages, and the often smaller, sometimes highly [[apomorph]]ic [[taxa]] which are most common in Africa and the Palearctic, usually have metallic coloration, and in a number of species also bright [[carotinoid]] plumage colors on the underside. Inside this latter group, there is a clade consisting of species which, again, are usually not too brightly colored, and which consists of the \"typical\" myna-''[[Sturnus]]'' assemblage.\n\nThe [[Philippine creeper]]s, a single genus of three species of [[treecreeper]]-like birds appear to be highly [[apomorph]]ic members of the more initial radiation of the Sturnidae.<ref name=zuccon/> While this may seem odd at first glance, their placement has always been contentious. In addition, [[biogeography]] virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem have ever reached the [[Wallacea]], let alone the [[Philippines]]. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually they may remain a separate family.\n\nGenus sequence follows traditional treatments. This is apparently not entirely correct, with ''Scissirostrum'' closer to ''Aplonis'' than to ''Gracula'' for example, and ''[[Acridotheres]]'' among the most advanced genera. Too few taxa have yet been studied as regards their relationships however, and thus a change in sequence has to wait on further studies.\n\nAs of 2009, the review by Lovette & Rubenstein (2008) is the most recent work on the phylogeny of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lovette, I., McCleery, B., Talaba, A., & Rubenstein, D. |year=2008 |title=A complete species-level molecular phylogeny for the \"Eurasian\" starlings (Sturnidae: Sturnus, Acridotheres, and allies): Recent diversification in a highly social and dispersive avian group |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=251\u2013260 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2008.01.020 |url=http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |pmid=18321732 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205083032/http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |archivedate=February 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Oriental-Australasian clade===\n[[File:Polynesian Starling.jpg|thumb|[[Polynesian starling]], ''Aplonis tabuensis'', ranges from the [[Solomon Islands]] to [[Tonga]]]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Rhabdornis]]'''''\u2014Philippine creepers (three species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Aplonis]]'''''\u2014Pacific starlings (c. 20 living species, 4\u20135 recently [[extinct]])\n* '''Genus ''[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]'''''\n** [[Yellow-faced myna]], ''Mino dumontii''\n** [[Golden myna]], ''Mino anais''\n** [[Long-tailed myna]], ''Mino kreffti''\n* '''Genus ''[[Basilornis]]'''''\n** [[Sulawesi myna]], ''Basilornis celebensis''\n** [[Helmeted myna]], ''Basilornis galeatus''\n** [[Long-crested myna]], ''Basilornis corythaix''\n** [[Apo myna]], ''Basilornis mirandus''\n[[File:Beo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Hill myna]]s, ''[[Gracula]]'' species]]<!-- Check which species this is. -->\n* '''Genus ''[[Sarcops]]'''''\u2014Coleto\n* '''Genus ''[[Streptocitta]]'''''\n** [[White-necked myna]], ''Streptocitta albicollis''\n** [[Bare-eyed myna]], ''Streptocitta albertinae''\n* '''Genus ''[[Enodes]]'''''\u2014fiery-browed myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Scissirostrum]]'''''\u2014finch-billed myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Ampeliceps]]'''''\u2014golden-crested myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Gracula]]'''''\u2014hill mynas (five species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Leucopsar]]'''''\u2014Bali myna\n\n===Afrotropical-Palearctic clade===\n[[File:Lamprotornis nitens, Kruger.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Cape starling]] (''Lamprotornis nitens'')]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Acridotheres]]'''''\u2014typical mynas (10 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Spodiopsar]]''''' (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Hylopsar]]''''' (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Agropsar]]''''' (sometimes included in ''Sturnus'' or ''Sturnia'') (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnia]]''''' (sometimes included in ''Sturnus'')\n** [[White-shouldered starling]], ''Sturnia sinensis''\n** [[Chestnut-tailed starling]], ''Sturnia malabarica''\n** [[White-headed starling]], ''Sturnia erythropygia''\n** [[Malabar starling]], ''Sturnia blythii''\n** [[Brahminy starling]], ''Sturnia pagodarum''\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnus]]'''''\u2014typical starlings (2 species)\n** [[Common starling]], ''Sturnus vulgaris''\n** [[Spotless starling]], ''Sturnus unicolor''\n[[File:CIMG0623.JPG|thumb|African [[superb starling]]]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Rosy starling|Pastor]]'''''\u2014 rosy starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Gracupica]]'''''\u2014 2 species\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnornis]]'''''\u2014white-faced starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Creatophora]]'''''\u2014wattled starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Notopholia]]''''' -black-bellied starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Lamprotornis]]'''''\u2014typical glossy-starlings (20 species;

The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the [[common starling]], and throughout much of [[Asia]] and the Pacific, the [[common myna]] is indeed common.\n\nStarlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very [[gregarious]]. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat [[insect]]s and [[fruit]]. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively [[omnivore]]s. Many species search for prey such as [[Beetle#Development|grub]]s by \"open-bill probing\", that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb ''zirkeln'' (pronounced {{IPA-de|\u02c8ts\u026a\u0281kl\u0329n|}}).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=East R.  |author2=R.

The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to [[iridescence]]; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have [[Crest (feathers)|crests]] or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or, as in the [[Bali starling]], structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibres. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Distribution, habitat and movements==\n[[File:Chestnut-tailed Starling I IMG 2508.jpg|thumb|[[Chestnut-tailed starling]] is a partial migrant over much of the east of its range, but its movements are poorly understood]]\nStarlings inhabit a wide range of habitats from the [[Arctic Circle]] to the [[Equator]]. In fact the only habitat they do not typically occupy is the driest sandy deserts. The family is naturally absent from the Americas and from large parts of Australia but is present over the majority of Europe, Africa and Asia. The genus ''[[Aplonis]]'' has also spread widely across the islands of the Pacific reaching [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]]<ref name = \"HBW\"/> (in addition one species in the genus ''[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]'' has reached the [[Solomon Islands]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Doughty|first=Chris |author2=Day, Nicholas |author3=Andrew Plant|title=Birds of the Solomons, Vanuatu & New Caledonia|publisher=Christopher Helm|location=London|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7136-4690-0}}</ref>). It is also a species of this genus that is the only starling found in northern Australia.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nAsian species are most common in evergreen forests; 39 species found in Asia are predominantly forest birds as opposed to 24 found in more open or human modified environments. In contrast to this, African species are more likely to be found in open woodlands and savannah; 33 species are open area specialists compared to 13 true forest species. The high diversity of species found in Asia and Africa is not matched by Europe, which has one widespread (and very common) species and two more restricted species. The [[European starling]] is both highly widespread and extremely catholic in its habitat, occupying most types of open habitat. Like many other starling species it has also adapted readily to human-modified habitat, including farmland, orchards, plantations and urban areas.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nSome species of starling are [[bird migration|migratory]], either entirely, like the [[Shelley's starling]], which breeds in [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Somalia]] and migrates to [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and southern Somalia, or the [[white-shouldered starling]], which is migratory in part of its range but is resident in others.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe [[European starling]] was purposefully introduced to North America in 1890\u20131891 by the [[American Acclimatization Society]], an organization dedicated to introducing European flora and fauna into North America for cultural and economic reasons.  [[Eugene Schieffelin]], chairman at the time, allegedly decided all birds mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] should be in North America (the bird had been mentioned in [[Henry IV, Part 1]]). A hundred of them were released from New York's [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"Mirsky\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=call-of-the-reviled|date=May 23, 2008 |journal=Scientific American |title=Shakespeare to blame for introduction of European starlings to U.S |first1=Steve |last1=Mirsky |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Spectacular Starlings at Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve, Cymru, Wales.webm|thumb|[[Swarm behaviour|Murmuration]] of common starlings at [[Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve]], [[Wales]]]]\nThe starlings are generally a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. A [[murmuration]] describes both the [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] of starlings, as well as their consequentially large flight formations. These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behaviour; in the non-breeding season some roosts can number in the thousands of birds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Mimic ===\nStarlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15\u201320 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species or calls that are simple in frequency structure and show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. There are local dialects of mimicked sounds.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Aplonis opaca.jpg|thumb|[[Micronesian starling]]s have been observed feeding on the eggs of [[seabird]]s]]\nThe diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example [[Santalum album|white sandalwood]], [[Ficus benghalensis|Indian Banyan]]. In addition to trees they are also important dispersers of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[mistletoe]]s. In South Africa, the [[red-winged starling]] is an important disperser of the [[introduced species|introduced]] ''[[Acacia cyclops]]''. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, which led to the speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> Laboratory experiments on [[European starling]]s have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Prinzinger |first=R.|author2=Hakimi G.A. |year=1996|title=Alcohol resorption and alcohol degradation in the European Starling ''Sturnus vulgaris''|journal=Journal f\u00fcr Ornithologie|volume=137|issue=3|pages=319\u2013327|doi=10.1007/BF01651072}}</ref> In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume [[nectar]].

The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping conveys little information about [[biogeography]], and obscures the evolutionary distinctness of the three lineages. Establishing a valid name for the [[clade]] consisting of Sibley/Monroe's \"pan-Sturnidae\" would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.\n\nStarlings probably originated in the general area of [[East Asia]], perhaps towards the southwestern [[Pacific]], as evidenced by the number of [[plesiomorph]]ic lineages to occur there.

Given the overall evidence for origin of most [[Passeri]] families in the first half of the [[Miocene]], it appears to be not too far off the mark however.<ref name=zuccon/>\n\nAs of 2007, recent studies<ref name=zuccon/><ref name=cibois/> identified two major [[clade]]s of this family, corresponding to the generally drab, often striped, largish \"atypical [[myna]]s\" and other mainly Asian-Pacific lineages, and the often smaller, sometimes highly [[apomorph]]ic [[taxa]] which are most common in Africa and the Palearctic, usually have metallic coloration, and in a number of species also bright [[carotinoid]] plumage colors on the underside. Inside this latter group, there is a clade consisting of species which, again, are usually not too brightly colored, and which consists of the \"typical\" myna-''[[Sturnus]]'' assemblage.\n\nThe [[Philippine creeper]]s, a single genus of three species of [[treecreeper]]-like birds appear to be highly [[apomorph]]ic members of the more initial radiation of the Sturnidae.<ref name=zuccon/> While this may seem odd at first glance, their placement has always been contentious. In addition, [[biogeography]] virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem have ever reached the [[Wallacea]], let alone the [[Philippines]]. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually they may remain a separate family.\n\nGenus sequence follows traditional treatments. This is apparently not entirely correct, with ''Scissirostrum'' closer to ''Aplonis'' than to ''Gracula'' for example, and ''[[Acridotheres]]'' among the most advanced genera. Too few taxa have yet been studied as regards their relationships however, and thus a change in sequence has to wait on further studies.\n\nAs of 2009, the review by Lovette & Rubenstein (2008) is the most recent work on the phylogeny of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lovette, I., McCleery, B., Talaba, A., & Rubenstein, D. |year=2008 |title=A complete species-level molecular phylogeny for the \"Eurasian\" starlings (Sturnidae: Sturnus, Acridotheres, and allies): Recent diversification in a highly social and dispersive avian group |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics & Evolution |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=251\u2013260 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2008.01.020 |url=http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |pmid=18321732 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205083032/http://www.dustinrubenstein.com/webpage/PUBLICATIONS_files/MPE2008.pdf |archivedate=February 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Oriental-Australasian clade===\n[[File:Polynesian Starling.jpg|thumb|[[Polynesian starling]], ''Aplonis tabuensis'', ranges from the [[Solomon Islands]] to [[Tonga]]]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Rhabdornis]]'''''\u2014Philippine creepers (three species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Aplonis]]'''''\u2014Pacific starlings (c. 20 living species, 4\u20135 recently [[extinct]])\n* '''Genus ''[[Mino (bird)|Mino]]'''''\n** [[Yellow-faced myna]], ''Mino dumontii''\n** [[Golden myna]], ''Mino anais''\n** [[Long-tailed myna]], ''Mino kreffti''\n* '''Genus ''[[Basilornis]]'''''\n** [[Sulawesi myna]], ''Basilornis celebensis''\n** [[Helmeted myna]], ''Basilornis galeatus''\n** [[Long-crested myna]], ''Basilornis corythaix''\n** [[Apo myna]], ''Basilornis mirandus''\n[[File:Beo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Hill myna]]s, ''[[Gracula]]'' species]]<!-- Check which species this is. -->\n* '''Genus ''[[Sarcops]]'''''\u2014Coleto\n* '''Genus ''[[Streptocitta]]'''''\n** [[White-necked myna]], ''Streptocitta albicollis''\n** [[Bare-eyed myna]], ''Streptocitta albertinae''\n* '''Genus ''[[Enodes]]'''''\u2014fiery-browed myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Scissirostrum]]'''''\u2014finch-billed myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Ampeliceps]]'''''\u2014golden-crested myna\n* '''Genus ''[[Gracula]]'''''\u2014hill mynas (five species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Leucopsar]]'''''\u2014Bali myna\n\n===Afrotropical-Palearctic clade===\n[[File:Lamprotornis nitens, Kruger.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Cape starling]] (''Lamprotornis nitens'')]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Acridotheres]]'''''\u2014typical mynas (10 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Spodiopsar]]''''' (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Hylopsar]]''''' (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Agropsar]]''''' (sometimes included in ''Sturnus'' or ''Sturnia'') (2 species)\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnia]]''''' (sometimes included in ''Sturnus'')\n** [[White-shouldered starling]], ''Sturnia sinensis''\n** [[Chestnut-tailed starling]], ''Sturnia malabarica''\n** [[White-headed starling]], ''Sturnia erythropygia''\n** [[Malabar starling]], ''Sturnia blythii''\n** [[Brahminy starling]], ''Sturnia pagodarum''\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnus]]'''''\u2014typical starlings (2 species)\n** [[Common starling]], ''Sturnus vulgaris''\n** [[Spotless starling]], ''Sturnus unicolor''\n[[File:CIMG0623.JPG|thumb|African [[superb starling]]]]\n* '''Genus ''[[Rosy starling|Pastor]]'''''\u2014 rosy starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Gracupica]]'''''\u2014 2 species\n* '''Genus ''[[Sturnornis]]'''''\u2014white-faced starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Creatophora]]'''''\u2014wattled starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Notopholia]]''''' -black-bellied starling\n* '''Genus ''[[Lamprotornis]]'''''\u2014typical glossy-starlings (20 species;

Of the 12,731 aircraft built, approximately 4,735 were lost during the War. Those that had flown in combat missions and survived the War were subsequently sent to [[Aircraft boneyard|boneyards]], such as those at [[Marine Corps Air Facility Walnut Ridge|Walnut Ridge]] and [[Kingman Airport (Arizona)|Kingman]], for smelting. Consequently, only five planes that survive today \u2013 [[The Swoose|40-3097]], [[Swamp Ghost|41-2446]], [[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|41-24485]], [[Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby|42-32076]], and [[The Pink Lady (aircraft)|44-8846]] \u2013 claim combat provenance. The majority of survivors are planes that were built too late to see active service and then were used through the 1950s and 1960s in both military and civilian capacities. Many surviving examples are painted to represent actual planes that flew in combat. Today, 46 planes survive in complete form, 10 <!--10 aircraft are airworthy after the crash of Nine-O-Nine.  Their serial numbers are 44-8543, 44-8846, 44-83514, 44-83546, 44-83563, 44-83872, 44-85718, 44-85740, 44-85784, and 44-85829.--> of which are airworthy, and 39 of which reside in the United States.\n\n== Surviving aircraft ==\n\n=== Surviving aircraft by manufacturer ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Plant\n!Number produced\n!Number surviving\n|-\n|Boeing Seattle (BO)\n|6,981\n|9\n|-\n|Douglas Long Beach (DL)\n|3,000\n|23\n|-\n|Vega Burbank (VE)\n|2,750\n|14\n|-\n|\n|'''12,731'''\n|'''46'''\n|}\n\n=== Surviving aircraft ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"7%\" |Serial\n! width=\"12%\" |Geographic location\n!Institutional location\n!Status\n!History\n! width=\"9%\" |<small>Photo</small>\n|-\n|[[The Swoose|40-3097]]\n|{{flagicon|United States}} [[Dayton, Ohio]]\n|[[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]\n|under restoration for display\n|Built at Boeing Seattle in 1940 as B-17D.

Written by Dana Horgan & Leah Fong and directed by Mark Garris, it premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States on October 27, 2017.\n\nIn the episode, Rumpelstiltskin's life with Belle is explored and the consequences that awaits the couple, while in the Present, Weaver must deal with a suddenly unstable Tilly, when Victoria demands that she be brought back under his control, and Ivy takes Lucy out for a Halloween trick-or-treat that goes awry.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Opening sequence ===\n\n\nHalloween themed decorations are seen in the forest  \n\n=== In the characters' past ===\nIt has been a year after the Final Battle, and Gold and Belle now enjoy life in Storybrooke as a family with their son Gideon. On Gideon's first birthday, Gold tells Belle that he has acquired a family travel book so they can document their adventures. \n\nThe family leaves Storybrooke and spends years travelling the realms, however age begins to catch up to Belle. Rumple has now grown tired of being The Dark One and wants to rid himself of the cursed immortality and darkness once and for all. He takes the dagger and throws it into a wishing river, only for it to instantly return to him. He vows to Belle that he will find a way to dispose of it. As the years continue to go by, Gideon, now a bookworm like his mother, leaves for college at 18, while Rumpelstiltskin and Belle continue to look for a way to get rid of the dagger. Belle finds a solution which says they must travel to the Edge of Realms and wait for sunset after an eternal day, which will finally allow them to get rid of the dagger and the darkness forever.\n\nAs Rumple and Belle arrived to the Edge of Realms, they realise that as the day is eternal then the sun may never set. Belle suggests that the two settle down and enjoy their life in this location. The two decided to build a nice home for the family, where they live for many years happily together.\n\nOne day, many years later, as Belle checks the drapes, she collapses. A distraught Rumple suggests that he uses his powers to heal her and reverse her aging, only to discover that Belle had known he couldn't dispose of the dagger here. She knew, from ages ago, that the \"sunset\" referred to in the prophecy signified her own death, and wanted to live a happy life with Rumple and Gideon before passing, which she did. In her final moments, she asks that Rumple let her go, but tells him that once he is rid of the dagger that he'll return to her. With that, Belle passes away peacefully, leaving Rumple sobbing and heartbroken.\n\nAt Belle's grave, Gideon, having returned to pay respects to his mother, offers to take the dagger and use it to transfer the darkness into himself so that Rumple can join his wife in death. Rumple refuses, not wanting another one of his sons to be lost because of his darkness. He also reveals that he already has someone else ready to hand the dagger over to: a mysterious Guardian.\n\nSome time later Rumple steps through a portal into the New Enchanted Forest and instantly runs into Alice from Wonderland.\n\n=== In Seattle ===\nIt's Halloween Day in Hyperion Heights, where Weaver is having a brief but awkward conversation with Tilly, who is wearing a rabbit mask. Later on in Victoria's car, Tilly surprises Victoria and tells her that she knows about who she is before Victoria used pepper spray on Tilly and end up taking Tilly's backpack. Victoria then talks to Weaver about Tilly's actions, and insists that Tilly takes her pills, as it keeps her from remembering that she is actually Alice. Victoria warns Weaver to do this or he'll pay dearly. The situation with Tilly spills over into the disagreements between Rogers and Weaver to the point of him telling Rogers that he doesn't care about anyone. Hours later, Weaver finds Tilly to ask her why she stopped taking the pills. Tilly believes that everyone in Hyperion Heights are all pieces of the same puzzle, but they're all \"wearing masks\" (a reference to the Halloween theme of the episode). Weaver asked Tilly to elaborate further but she said she'd rather show him.\n\nThe two then head at the train tracks for the answer, and while en route Weaver handed Tilly a sandwich that was secretly laced with the pill's ingredients. Suddenly Tilly, having bitten into the sandwich, begins complaining about the pills making her small and in a White Rabbit-eqse fashion bails out of the vehicle. When Weaver catches up to Tilly, she insists that she is this close to revealing the answer and pulls out the iconic chipped teacup in front of Weaver. She refers to him as Rumpelstiltskin, and even though this triggers a flashback, Weaver doesn't seem to remember his past and still deems Tilly as crazy. Tilly then takes Weaver's gun and fatally shoots him in order to prove that he is immortal. Hours later at a hospital, Weaver is in a comatose state, where he sees a vision of Belle's spirit, before regaining consciousness. Weaver tells Rogers that it was a robber who shot him and orders for Tilly to be let go, in order to let off Tilly. Rogers and Tilly play a game of chess in the waiting area of the hospital, with Tilly now back on her pills and oblivious again of her previous life as Alice.\n\nIn between the situation, Jacinda drops off Lucy's Hallowe'en costume to Ivy, who has been tasked with taking her step-niece around the neighborhood to get candy. However Ivy's distraction with her cell phone just gave Lucy the opportunity to give Ivy the slip. Around the same time, Roni consoles Henry after trying to get used to having lost his family, but suggested that he move on and try to find happiness again by pursuing Jacinda. Henry then visits Jacinda at her workplace but the conversation is cut short when they learn that Ivy lost Lucy, and since Jacinda can't leave her job, Henry volunteers to help find Lucy. Later that night, Henry catches up with Ivy, and as they search for Lucy, Ivy tells Henry about how she feels about her mother, saying that she feels alone and always on the wrong side of things. Henry then figured out where to find Lucy and Ivy finds her. The three then returned to Mr. Clucks, but Ivy insists that Jacinda take Lucy trick or treating with Henry.\n\nAfterwards, Victoria confronts Weaver with blackmail if he doesn't keep Tilly on her medication, but Weaver isn't having any of this. During the confrontation he refers to Victoria using his old endearment word, \"Dearie\", implying he is \"awake\" from the curse. Meanwhile, at Roni's, Ivy treats Henry to a few drinks as a thanks for his helpful encouragement given earlier on the bench.\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe montage of Belle and Rumple building their house together consists of s lot of references to [[Up (2009 film)|Disney's 2009 animated movie \"Up\"]], inclusive of the building process of the house, the house itself, the twin chairs, the picnics, and the background music.\n\n\n\nAs with \u201cA Pirate\u2019s Life,\u201d both Carlyle and de Ravin knew about the outcome of their characters before production began on the episode.

However Ivy\u2019s distraction with her cell phone just gave Lucy the opportunity to give Ivy the slip. Around the same time, Roni consoles Henry after trying to get used to having lost his family, but suggested that he move on and try to find happiness again by pursuing Jacinda. Henry then visits Jacinda at her workplace but the conversation is cut short when they learn that Ivy lost Lucy, and since Jacinda can\u2019t leave her job, Henry volunteers to help find Lucy. Later that night, Henry catches up with Ivy, and as they search for Lucy, Ivy tells Henry about how she feels about her mother, saying that she feels alone and always on the wrong side of things. Henry then figured out where to find Lucy and Ivy finds her. The three then returned to Mr. Clucks, but Ivy insists that Jacinda take Lucy trick or treating with Henry.\n\nAfterwards, Victoria confronts Weaver with blackmail if he doesn\u2019t keep Tilly on her medication, but Weaver isn\u2019t having any of this. During the confrontation he refers to Victoria using his old endearment word, \"Dearie\", implying he is \"awake\" from the curse. Meanwhile, at Roni\u2019s, Ivy treats Henry to a few drinks as a thanks for his helpful encouragement given earlier on the bench.\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe montage of Belle and Rumple building their house together consists of s lot of references to [[Up (2009 film)|Disney's 2009 animated movie \"Up\"]], inclusive of the building process of the house, the house itself, the twin chairs, the picnics, and the background music.\n\n\n\nAs with \u201cA Pirate\u2019s Life,\u201d both Carlyle and de Ravin knew about the outcome of their characters before production began on the episode.

It was written and storyboarded by Lamar Abrams and Katie Mitroff. The episode was viewed by 1.384 million viewers.\n\nIn this episode, [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] tells [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] the story of how Ruby and Sapphire met each other, [[List of Steven Universe characters#Fusions|fused]] to create Garnet, began their romantic relationship, and eventually joined the Crystal Gems. The episode received a nomination for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation]] and was adapted as a best-selling children's book.\n\n==Plot==\nGarnet ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]) awakens Steven ([[Zach Callison]]) at midnight on his birthday to tell him the tale of how Ruby ([[Charlyne Yi]]) and Sapphire ([[Erica Luttrell]]) first met and [[List of Steven Universe characters#Fusions|fused]] to become Garnet.\n\n5,750 years in the past, the Gem Homeworld is in the process of colonizing Earth, but a group of rebels is halting progress. A team of diplomats is sent to Earth to investigate, among them being Sapphire and three Ruby bodyguards. Sapphire reports her vision of the future to Blue Diamond, the leader of the mission: in the upcoming battle, the rebels will defeat seven Gems, including Sapphire herself and two Rubies, but will be captured, ending the rebellion.\n\nThe rebels\u2014Rose Quartz ([[Susan Egan]]) and Pearl ([[Deedee Magno Hall]])\u2014attack the Sky Arena. The battle proceeds as Sapphire had foreseen, and once two of the Rubies have been defeated, Sapphire thanks the remaining Ruby for her efforts and prepares for the inevitable. Ruby refuses to accept this outcome and leaps towards Sapphire, saving her but unintentionally fusing with her and forming Garnet for the first time. The crowd of diplomats stares in surprise and disgust at the confused Garnet, and Rose and Pearl flee during the distraction.\n\nGarnet immediately defuses, and Ruby takes the blame for the failure of Sapphire's prediction and the illicit fusion. Blue Diamond sentences Ruby to be [[Capital punishment|shattered]], but Sapphire grabs her and escapes, jumping down to Earth's surface. On the ground, Ruby and Sapphire find shelter and discuss their feelings about the unexpected fusion. Over a [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of the two of them exploring Earth and getting to know each other better, they sing the song \"Something Entirely New\", trying to understand what it means to have become Garnet. They end with a fusion dance, fusing into Garnet once more.\n\nHaving difficulty getting used to her body, Garnet tumbles down a hill into Pearl and Rose. Rose welcomes Garnet and encourages her to talk about how she feels. Garnet peppers Rose with questions about Ruby, Sapphire, and their fusion, but Rose tells Garnet that she already is \"the answer\" she seeks to all her questions. \n\nIn the present, as Garnet finishes her story, Steven asks her what the answer was. She tells him: \"love\".\n\n==Production==\n\nEpisodes of ''Steven Universe'' are written and storyboarded by a single team. \"The Answer\" was written by Lamar Abrams and Katie Mitroff, and directed by supervising director Joe Johnston, while Byung Ki Lee provided animation direction, and Jasmin Lai served as art director.
