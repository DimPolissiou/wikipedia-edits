Despite the significant differences between Indo-European languages and Dravidian languages, those Hindu calendars which are based on lunar cycle are generally phonetic variants of each other, while the solar cycle are generally variants of each other too, suggesting that the time keeping knowledge travelled widely across the Indian subcontinent in ancient times.<ref name=richmond80/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe Tamil lunar month names are forward shifted by a month compared to Vikrami month names, in part because Tamil calendar integrates greater emphasis for the solar cycle in a manner similar to the neighboring Kerala region and it follows the Amanta system for lunar months. This is in contrast to Vikrami calendar which keeps the Purnimanta system and emphasizes the lunar cycle.<ref>[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/indian_regional.html Regional Varieties of the Indian Calendars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703200148/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/indian_regional.html |date=3 July 2017 }}, Helmer Aslaksen and Akshay Regulagedda, National University of Singapore (2012)</ref> A few major calendars are summarized below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n  |+ Calendar month names in different Hindu calendars<ref name=richmond80/>\n!#||style=\"background: #ffad66;\" |Vikrami<br>(lunar)<ref name=fuller292/>||Assamese||Bengali||Tamil\n!Odia|| style=\"background: #ffad66;\" |Vikrami<br>(solar)||Malayalam<br>(solar)\n!Kannada/Telugu||Tulu (solar)||Gregorian\n|-\n|1|| align=\"center\" |[[Vaisakha|Vais&#257;kha]] || align=\"center\" |Bohag|| align=\"center\" |Boishakh|| align=\"center\" |Chithirai\n|Baisakha|| align=\"center\" |M\u0113sha|| align=\"center\" |Medam\n|Vais\u0101kha || align=\"center\" |Paggu\n| align=\"center\" | April\u2013May\n|-\n|2|| align=\"center\" |[[Jyeshta]]|| align=\"center\" |Zeth|| align=\"center\" |Jj\u00f4isth\u00f4|| align=\"center\" | Vaigasi\n|Jyestha|| align=\"center\" |Vrisha|| align=\"center\" |Edavam\n|Jyeshta||  align=\"center\" |B\u0113sha||align=\"center\" | May\u2013June\n|-\n|3|| align=\"center\" |[[Aashaadha|&#256;sh&#257;da]] || align=\"center\" |Ahar|| align=\"center\" |Ashar || align=\"center\" | Aani\n|Asadha|| align=\"center\" |Mithuna|| align=\"center\" |Mithunam\n|\u0100sh\u0101da|| align=\"center\" |K\u0101rtel|| align=\"center\" | June\u2013July \n|-\n|4|| align=\"center\" |[[Shraavana]] || align=\"center\" |Xa\u00fcn|| align=\"center\" |Shrab\u00f4n|| align=\"center\" | Aadi\n|Srabana|| align=\"center\" |Karka|| align=\"center\" |Karkadakam\n|Shr\u0101vana||align=\"center\" |Aa\u1e6di|| align=\"center\" |July\u2013August\n|-\n|5|| align=\"center\" |[[Bhadrapada|Bh&#257;dra]] || align=\"center\" |Bhado|| align=\"center\" |Bh\u0101dr\u00f4/Bh\u0101ddur|| align=\"center\" | Aavani\n|Bhadraba|| align=\"center\" |Singa|| align=\"center\" |Chingam\n|Bh\u0101drapada||align=\"center\" |Sona|| align=\"center\" | August\u2013September \n|-\n|6|| align=\"center\" |[[Ashvin|Ashwina]] || align=\"center\" |Ahin|| align=\"center\" |Ashshin|| align=\"center\" | Purattasi\n|Aswina|| align=\"center\" |Kanya|| align=\"center\" |Kanni\n|\u0100swayuja||align=\"center\" |Kanya/Nirn\u0101l|| align=\"center\" |September\u2013October\n|-\n|7|| align=\"center\" |[[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] || align=\"center\" |Kati|| align=\"center\" |Kattik|| align=\"center\" | Aippasi\n|Kartika|| align=\"center\" |Tula|| align=\"center\" |Tulam\n|K\u0101rtika||align=\"center\" |Bontel|| align=\"center\" |October\u2013November \n|-\n|8|| align=\"center\" |M\u0101rgasirsa<br> ([[Agrahayana]]) || align=\"center\" |Agh\u00fcn|| align=\"center\" |Agrohoyon/Aghran|| align=\"center\" | Karthigai\n|Margasira|| align=\"center\" |Vrischika|| align=\"center\" |Vrischikam\n|M\u0101rgasira||align=\"center\" |J\u0101rde|| align=\"center\" |November\u2013December \n|-\n|9|| align=\"center\" |[[Pausha]] || align=\"center\" |Puh|| align=\"center\" |Poush/P\u016bsh|| align=\"center\" |Margazhi\n|Pousa|| align=\"center\" |Dhanus|| align=\"center\" |Dhanu \n|Pushya|| align=\"center\" |Perarde||align=\"center\" |December\u2013January \n|-\n|10|| align=\"center\" |[[Maagha|M&#257;gha]] || align=\"center\" |Magh|| align=\"center\" |Magh|| align=\"center\" |Thai \n|Magha|| align=\"center\" |Makara|| align=\"center\" |Makaram\n|Magha||align=\"center\" |Puyintel|| align=\"center\" |January\u2013February \n|-\n|11|| align=\"center\" |[[Phalguna|Ph&#257;lguna]] || align=\"center\" |Phagun|| align=\"center\" |Ph\u0101lgun/Ph\u0101gun|| align=\"center\" |Maasi\n|Phalguna|| align=\"center\" |Kumbha|| align=\"center\" |Kumbham\n|Phalguna||align=\"center\" |M\u0101yi|| align=\"center\" |February\u2013March \n|-\n|12|| align=\"center\" | [[Chaitra]] || align=\"center\" |S\u00f3t|| align=\"center\" |Choitr\u00f4_Choi\u021b|| align=\"center\" |Panguni\n|Chaitra|| align=\"center\" |Mina|| align=\"center\" |Minam\n|Chaitra|| align=\"center\" |Suggi||align=\"center\" |March\u2013April\n|}\n\n===Corrections between lunar and solar months===\n[[File:Hindu Lunisolar Calendar.ogv|thumb|The astronomical basis of the Hindu lunar months. Also illustrates Adhika Masa (Year 2-Bhadrapada) repeats; the first time the Sun moves entirely within Simha Rashi thus rendering it an Adhika Masa]]\nTwelve Hindu mas (m\u0101sa, lunar month) are equal to approximately 354 days, while the length of a sidereal (solar) year is about 365 days. This creates a difference of about eleven days, which is offset every (29.53/10.63) = 2.71 years, or approximately every 32.5 months.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/> The twelve months are subdivided into six lunar seasons timed with the agriculture cycles, blooming of natural flowers, fall of leaves, and weather. To account for the mismatch between lunar and solar calendar, the Hindu scholars adopted intercalary months, where a particular month just repeated. The choice of this month was not random, but timed to sync back the two calendars to the cycle of agriculture and nature.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe repetition of a month created the problem of scheduling festivals, weddings and other social events without repetition and confusion. This was resolved by declaring one month as ''Shudha'' (pure, clean, regular, proper, also called ''Deva'' month) and the other ''Mala'' or ''Adhika'' (extra, unclean and inauspicious, also called [[Purushottam Maas|Asura masa]]).<ref name=\"Underhill1991p32\">{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA32|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20, 32 note 5}}</ref>\n\nThe Indian mathematicians who calculated the best way to adjust the two years, over long periods of a ''yuga'' (era, tables calculating 1000 of years), they determined that the best means to intercalate the months is to time the intercalary months on a 19-year cycle. This intercalation is generally adopted in the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 16th and 19th year of this cycle. Further, the complex rules rule out the repetition of [[Agrahayana|M\u0101rgasirsa]] (also called ''Agahana''), [[Pausha]] and [[Maagha]] lunar months. The historic Hindu texts are not consistent on these rules, with competing ideas flourishing in the Hindu culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=\u015aa\u1e45kara B\u0101lakr\u0325sh\u1e47a D\u012bkshita|title= The Indian Calendar |year=1896|url= https://archive.org/details/indiancalendarwi00sewerich |publisher=S.

This occurs because of the complexity of the relative lunar, solar and earth movements. According to the Hindu calendar theory, states uriel Marion Underhill, \"when the sun is in perigee, and a lunar month being at its longest, if the new moon immediately precedes a [[Sankranti|samkranti]], then the first of the two lunar months is deleted (called ''nija'' or ''kshaya'').\" This, for example, happened in the year 1 BCE, when there was no new moon between Makara samkranti and Kumbha samkranti, and the month of Pausha was dropped.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n==Day==\nJust like months, the Hindu calendar has two measures of a day, one based on the lunar movement and the other on solar. The solar day or civil day, called ''divasa'' (\t\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938), has been what most Hindus traditionally use, is easy and empirical to observe, by poor and rich, with or without a clock, and it is defined as the period from one sunrise to another. The lunar day is called ''tithi'' (\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f), and this is based on complicated measures of lunar movement. A lunar day or ''tithi'' may, for example, begin in the middle of an afternoon and end next afternoon.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=23, 26\u201327}}</ref> Both these days do not directly correspond to a mathematical measure for a day such as equal 24 hours of a solar year, a fact that the Hindu calendar scholars knew, but the system of ''divasa'' was convenient for the general population. The ''tithi'' have been the basis for timing rituals and festivals, while ''divasa'' for everyday use. The Hindu calendars adjust the mismatch in ''divasa'' and ''tithi'', using a methodology similar to the solar and lunar months.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nA ''Tithi'' is technically defined in Indian texts, states [[John E. Cort]], as \"the time required by the combined motions of the sun and moon to increase (in a bright fortnight) or decrease (in a dark fortnight) their relative distance by twelve degrees of the zodiac.<ref name=\"Cort2001p2\">{{cite book|author=John E.

The technical standard makes each ''tithi'' contain different number of hours, but helps the overall integrity of the calendar. Given the variation in the length of a solar day with seasons, and moon's relative movements, the start and end time for ''tithi'' varies over the seasons and over the years, and the ''tithi'' adjusted to sync with ''divasa'' periodically with intercalation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=23\u201328}}</ref>\n\n===Weekday/V\u0101sara===\n''V\u0101sara'' refers to the weekdays in Sanskrit.<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams]], [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0900/mw__0981.html \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0930], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 948</ref> Also referred to as ''Vara'' and used as a suffix.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\">{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

[[Sanskrit]]-derived and influenced languages. There are many variations of the names in the regional languages, mostly using alternate names of the celestial bodies involved.\n\n===Five limbs of time===\nThe complete Indian calendars contain five ''angas'' or parts of information: lunar day (tithi), solar day (diwas), [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] (naksatra), planetary joining (yoga) and astronomical period (karanam). This structure gives the calendar the name ''Panchangam''.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\"/> The first two are discussed above.\n\n====Yoga====\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}\nThe [[Sanskrit]] word Yoga means \"union, joining, attachment\", but in astronomical context, this word means latitudinal and longitudinal information. The longitude of the sun and the longitude of the moon are added, and normalised to a value ranging between 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 (if greater than 360, one subtracts 360). This sum is divided into 27 parts. Each part will now equal 800' (where ' is the symbol of the [[arcminute]] which means 1/60 of a degree). These parts are called the ''yogas''. They are labelled:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n# Vi\u1e63kambha\n# Pr\u012bti\n# \u0100yu\u015bm\u0101n\n# Saubh\u0101gya\n# \u015aobhana\n# Atiga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# Sukarma\n# [[Dhrti]]\n# \u015a\u016bla\n# Ga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# [[V\u1e5bddhi]]\n# [[Dhruva]]\n# Vy\u0101ghat\u0101\n# Har\u1e63a\u1e47a\n# [[Vajra]]\n# [[Siddhi]]\n# Vyatip\u0101ta\n# Variyas\n# Parigha\n# [[\u015aiva]]\n# [[Siddha]]\n# S\u0101dhya\n# \u015aubha\n# \u015aukla\n# [[Brahma]]\n# M\u0101hendra\n# Vaidh\u1e5bti\n{{div col end}}\nAgain, minor variations may exist. The ''yoga'' that is active during sunrise of a day is the prevailing ''yoga'' for the day.\n\n====Kara\u1e47a====\nA '''kara\u1e47a''' is half of a '''[[tithi]]'''. To be precise, a kara\u1e47a is the time required for the angular distance between the sun and the moon to increase in steps of 6\u00b0 starting from 0\u00b0. (Compare with the definition of a tithi.)\n\nSince the tithis are 30 in number, and since 1 tithi = 2 kara\u1e47as, therefore one would logically expect there to be 60 kara\u1e47as. But there are only 11 such kara\u1e47as which fill up those slots to accommodate for those 30 tithis. There are actually 4 \"fixed\" (sthira) kara\u1e47as and 7 \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe 4\n# \u015aakuni (\u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u093f)\n# Catu\u1e63p\u0101da (\u091a\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0926)\n# [[N\u0101ga]] (\u0928\u093e\u0917)\n# Ki\u1e43stughna(\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0918\u094d\u0928)\n\nThe 7 \"repeating\" kara\u1e47as are:<ref name=\"Burgess1989\">{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|title=S\u00fbrya-Siddh\u00e2nta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC&pg=PA107|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=107\u2013}}</ref>\n# [[Vava]] or Bava (\u092c\u0935)\n# Valava or B\u0101lava (\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0935)\n# Kaulava (\u0915\u094c\u0932\u0935)\n# Taitila or Taitula (\u0924\u0948\u0924\u093f\u0932)\n# [[Gara]] or Garaja (\u0917\u0930\u091c)\n# Va\u1e47ija (\u0935\u0923\u093f\u091c)\n# Vi\u1e63\u1e6di ([[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]]) (\u092d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e)\n* Now the first half of the 1st ''tithi'' (of \u015aukla Pak\u1e63a) is always ''Ki\u1e43tughna kara\u1e47a''. Hence this '''kara\u1e47a''' is \"fixed\".\n* Next, the 7-repeating kara\u1e47as repeat eight times to cover the next 56 half-''tithis''. Thus these are the \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n* The 3 remaining half-''tithis'' take the remaining \"fixed\" kara\u1e47as in order. Thus these are also \"fixed\" (sthira).\n* Thus one gets 60 kara\u1e47as from those 11 preset kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe Vedic day begins at sunrise. The kara\u1e47a at sunrise of a particular day shall be the prevailing kara\u1e47a for the whole day.\n(citation needed )\n\n====Nakshatra====\n\n[[Nakshatras]] are divisions of ecliptic, each 13\u00b0 20', starting from 0\u00b0 Aries.

Despite the significant differences between Indo-European languages and Dravidian languages, those Hindu calendars which are based on lunar cycle are generally phonetic variants of each other, while the solar cycle are generally variants of each other too, suggesting that the time keeping knowledge travelled widely across the Indian subcontinent in ancient times.<ref name=richmond80/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe Tamil lunar month names are forward shifted by a month compared to Vikrami month names, in part because Tamil calendar integrates greater emphasis for the solar cycle in a manner similar to the neighboring Kerala region and it follows the Amanta system for lunar months. This is in contrast to Vikrami calendar which keeps the Purnimanta system and emphasizes the lunar cycle.<ref>[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/indian_regional.html Regional Varieties of the Indian Calendars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703200148/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/indian_regional.html |date=3 July 2017 }}, Helmer Aslaksen and Akshay Regulagedda, National University of Singapore (2012)</ref> A few major calendars are summarized below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n  |+ Calendar month names in different Hindu calendars<ref name=richmond80/>\n!#||style=\"background: #ffad66;\" |Vikrami<br>(lunar)<ref name=fuller292/>||Assamese||Bengali||Tamil\n!Odia|| style=\"background: #ffad66;\" |Vikrami<br>(solar)||Malayalam<br>(solar)\n!Kannada/Telugu||Tulu (solar)||Gregorian\n|-\n|1|| align=\"center\" |[[Vaisakha|Vais&#257;kha]] || align=\"center\" |Bohag|| align=\"center\" |Boishakh|| align=\"center\" |Chithirai\n|Baisakha|| align=\"center\" |M\u0113sha|| align=\"center\" |Medam\n|Vais\u0101kha || align=\"center\" |Paggu\n| align=\"center\" | April\u2013May\n|-\n|2|| align=\"center\" |[[Jyeshta]]|| align=\"center\" |Zeth|| align=\"center\" |Jj\u00f4isth\u00f4|| align=\"center\" | Vaigasi\n|Jyestha|| align=\"center\" |Vrisha|| align=\"center\" |Edavam\n|Jyeshta||  align=\"center\" |B\u0113sha||align=\"center\" | May\u2013June\n|-\n|3|| align=\"center\" |[[Aashaadha|&#256;sh&#257;da]] || align=\"center\" |Ahar|| align=\"center\" |Ashar || align=\"center\" | Aani\n|Asadha|| align=\"center\" |Mithuna|| align=\"center\" |Mithunam\n|\u0100sh\u0101da|| align=\"center\" |K\u0101rtel|| align=\"center\" | June\u2013July \n|-\n|4|| align=\"center\" |[[Shraavana]] || align=\"center\" |Xa\u00fcn|| align=\"center\" |Shrab\u00f4n|| align=\"center\" | Aadi\n|Srabana|| align=\"center\" |Karka|| align=\"center\" |Karkadakam\n|Shr\u0101vana||align=\"center\" |Aa\u1e6di|| align=\"center\" |July\u2013August\n|-\n|5|| align=\"center\" |[[Bhadrapada|Bh&#257;dra]] || align=\"center\" |Bhado|| align=\"center\" |Bh\u0101dr\u00f4/Bh\u0101ddur|| align=\"center\" | Aavani\n|Bhadraba|| align=\"center\" |Singa|| align=\"center\" |Chingam\n|Bh\u0101drapada||align=\"center\" |Sona|| align=\"center\" | August\u2013September \n|-\n|6|| align=\"center\" |[[Ashvin|Ashwina]] || align=\"center\" |Ahin|| align=\"center\" |Ashshin|| align=\"center\" | Purattasi\n|Aswina|| align=\"center\" |Kanya|| align=\"center\" |Kanni\n|\u0100swayuja||align=\"center\" |Kanya/Nirn\u0101l|| align=\"center\" |September\u2013October\n|-\n|7|| align=\"center\" |[[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] || align=\"center\" |Kati|| align=\"center\" |Kattik|| align=\"center\" | Aippasi\n|Kartika|| align=\"center\" |Tula|| align=\"center\" |Tulam\n|K\u0101rtika||align=\"center\" |Bontel|| align=\"center\" |October\u2013November \n|-\n|8|| align=\"center\" |M\u0101rgasirsa<br> ([[Agrahayana]]) || align=\"center\" |Agh\u00fcn|| align=\"center\" |Agrohoyon/Aghran|| align=\"center\" | Karthigai\n|Margasira|| align=\"center\" |Vrischika|| align=\"center\" |Vrischikam\n|M\u0101rgasira||align=\"center\" |J\u0101rde|| align=\"center\" |November\u2013December \n|-\n|9|| align=\"center\" |[[Pausha]] || align=\"center\" |Puh|| align=\"center\" |Poush/P\u016bsh|| align=\"center\" |Margazhi\n|Pousa|| align=\"center\" |Dhanus|| align=\"center\" |Dhanu \n|Pushya|| align=\"center\" |Perarde||align=\"center\" |December\u2013January \n|-\n|10|| align=\"center\" |[[Maagha|M&#257;gha]] || align=\"center\" |Magh|| align=\"center\" |Magh|| align=\"center\" |Thai \n|Magha|| align=\"center\" |Makara|| align=\"center\" |Makaram\n|Magha||align=\"center\" |Puyintel|| align=\"center\" |January\u2013February \n|-\n|11|| align=\"center\" |[[Phalguna|Ph&#257;lguna]] || align=\"center\" |Phagun|| align=\"center\" |Ph\u0101lgun/Ph\u0101gun|| align=\"center\" |Maasi\n|Phalguna|| align=\"center\" |Kumbha|| align=\"center\" |Kumbham\n|Phalguna||align=\"center\" |M\u0101yi|| align=\"center\" |February\u2013March \n|-\n|12|| align=\"center\" | [[Chaitra]] || align=\"center\" |S\u00f3t|| align=\"center\" |Choitr\u00f4_Choi\u021b|| align=\"center\" |Panguni\n|Chaitra|| align=\"center\" |Mina|| align=\"center\" |Minam\n|Chaitra|| align=\"center\" |Suggi||align=\"center\" |March\u2013April\n|}\n\n===Corrections between lunar and solar months===\n[[File:Hindu Lunisolar Calendar.ogv|thumb|The astronomical basis of the Hindu lunar months. Also illustrates Adhika Masa (Year 2-Bhadrapada) repeats; the first time the Sun moves entirely within Simha Rashi thus rendering it an Adhika Masa]]\nTwelve Hindu mas (m\u0101sa, lunar month) are equal to approximately 354 days, while the length of a sidereal (solar) year is about 365 days. This creates a difference of about eleven days, which is offset every (29.53/10.63) = 2.71 years, or approximately every 32.5 months.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/> The twelve months are subdivided into six lunar seasons timed with the agriculture cycles, blooming of natural flowers, fall of leaves, and weather. To account for the mismatch between lunar and solar calendar, the Hindu scholars adopted intercalary months, where a particular month just repeated. The choice of this month was not random, but timed to sync back the two calendars to the cycle of agriculture and nature.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe repetition of a month created the problem of scheduling festivals, weddings and other social events without repetition and confusion. This was resolved by declaring one month as ''Shudha'' (pure, clean, regular, proper, also called ''Deva'' month) and the other ''Mala'' or ''Adhika'' (extra, unclean and inauspicious, also called [[Purushottam Maas|Asura masa]]).<ref name=\"Underhill1991p32\">{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA32|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20, 32 note 5}}</ref>\n\nThe Indian mathematicians who calculated the best way to adjust the two years, over long periods of a ''yuga'' (era, tables calculating 1000 of years), they determined that the best means to intercalate the months is to time the intercalary months on a 19-year cycle. This intercalation is generally adopted in the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 16th and 19th year of this cycle. Further, the complex rules rule out the repetition of [[Agrahayana|M\u0101rgasirsa]] (also called ''Agahana''), [[Pausha]] and [[Maagha]] lunar months. The historic Hindu texts are not consistent on these rules, with competing ideas flourishing in the Hindu culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=\u015aa\u1e45kara B\u0101lakr\u0325sh\u1e47a D\u012bkshita|title= The Indian Calendar |year=1896|url= https://archive.org/details/indiancalendarwi00sewerich |publisher=S.

This occurs because of the complexity of the relative lunar, solar and earth movements. According to the Hindu calendar theory, states uriel Marion Underhill, \"when the sun is in perigee, and a lunar month being at its longest, if the new moon immediately precedes a [[Sankranti|samkranti]], then the first of the two lunar months is deleted (called ''nija'' or ''kshaya'').\" This, for example, happened in the year 1 BCE, when there was no new moon between Makara samkranti and Kumbha samkranti, and the month of Pausha was dropped.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n==Day==\nJust like months, the Hindu calendar has two measures of a day, one based on the lunar movement and the other on solar. The solar day or civil day, called ''divasa'' (\t\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938), has been what most Hindus traditionally use, is easy and empirical to observe, by poor and rich, with or without a clock, and it is defined as the period from one sunrise to another. The lunar day is called ''tithi'' (\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f), and this is based on complicated measures of lunar movement. A lunar day or ''tithi'' may, for example, begin in the middle of an afternoon and end next afternoon.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=23, 26\u201327}}</ref> Both these days do not directly correspond to a mathematical measure for a day such as equal 24 hours of a solar year, a fact that the Hindu calendar scholars knew, but the system of ''divasa'' was convenient for the general population. The ''tithi'' have been the basis for timing rituals and festivals, while ''divasa'' for everyday use. The Hindu calendars adjust the mismatch in ''divasa'' and ''tithi'', using a methodology similar to the solar and lunar months.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nA ''Tithi'' is technically defined in Indian texts, states [[John E. Cort]], as \"the time required by the combined motions of the sun and moon to increase (in a bright fortnight) or decrease (in a dark fortnight) their relative distance by twelve degrees of the zodiac.<ref name=\"Cort2001p2\">{{cite book|author=John E.

The technical standard makes each ''tithi'' contain different number of hours, but helps the overall integrity of the calendar. Given the variation in the length of a solar day with seasons, and moon's relative movements, the start and end time for ''tithi'' varies over the seasons and over the years, and the ''tithi'' adjusted to sync with ''divasa'' periodically with intercalation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=23\u201328}}</ref>\n\n===Weekday/V\u0101sara===\n''V\u0101sara'' refers to the weekdays in Sanskrit.<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams]], [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0900/mw__0981.html \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0930], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 948</ref> Also referred to as ''Vara'' and used as a suffix.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\">{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

[[Sanskrit]]-derived and influenced languages. There are many variations of the names in the regional languages, mostly using alternate names of the celestial bodies involved.\n\n===Five limbs of time===\nThe complete Indian calendars contain five ''angas'' or parts of information: lunar day (tithi), solar day (diwas), [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] (naksatra), planetary joining (yoga) and astronomical period (karanam). This structure gives the calendar the name ''Panchangam''.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\"/> The first two are discussed above.\n\n====Yoga====\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}\nThe [[Sanskrit]] word Yoga means \"union, joining, attachment\", but in astronomical context, this word means latitudinal and longitudinal information. The longitude of the sun and the longitude of the moon are added, and normalised to a value ranging between 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 (if greater than 360, one subtracts 360). This sum is divided into 27 parts. Each part will now equal 800' (where ' is the symbol of the [[arcminute]] which means 1/60 of a degree). These parts are called the ''yogas''. They are labelled:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n# Vi\u1e63kambha\n# Pr\u012bti\n# \u0100yu\u015bm\u0101n\n# Saubh\u0101gya\n# \u015aobhana\n# Atiga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# Sukarma\n# [[Dhrti]]\n# \u015a\u016bla\n# Ga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# [[V\u1e5bddhi]]\n# [[Dhruva]]\n# Vy\u0101ghat\u0101\n# Har\u1e63a\u1e47a\n# [[Vajra]]\n# [[Siddhi]]\n# Vyatip\u0101ta\n# Variyas\n# Parigha\n# [[\u015aiva]]\n# [[Siddha]]\n# S\u0101dhya\n# \u015aubha\n# \u015aukla\n# [[Brahma]]\n# M\u0101hendra\n# Vaidh\u1e5bti\n{{div col end}}\nAgain, minor variations may exist. The ''yoga'' that is active during sunrise of a day is the prevailing ''yoga'' for the day.\n\n====Kara\u1e47a====\nA '''kara\u1e47a''' is half of a '''[[tithi]]'''. To be precise, a kara\u1e47a is the time required for the angular distance between the sun and the moon to increase in steps of 6\u00b0 starting from 0\u00b0. (Compare with the definition of a tithi.)\n\nSince the tithis are 30 in number, and since 1 tithi = 2 kara\u1e47as, therefore one would logically expect there to be 60 kara\u1e47as. But there are only 11 such kara\u1e47as which fill up those slots to accommodate for those 30 tithis. There are actually 4 \"fixed\" (sthira) kara\u1e47as and 7 \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe 4\n# \u015aakuni (\u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u093f)\n# Catu\u1e63p\u0101da (\u091a\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0926)\n# [[N\u0101ga]] (\u0928\u093e\u0917)\n# Ki\u1e43stughna(\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0918\u094d\u0928)\n\nThe 7 \"repeating\" kara\u1e47as are:<ref name=\"Burgess1989\">{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|title=S\u00fbrya-Siddh\u00e2nta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC&pg=PA107|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=107\u2013}}</ref>\n# [[Vava]] or Bava (\u092c\u0935)\n# Valava or B\u0101lava (\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0935)\n# Kaulava (\u0915\u094c\u0932\u0935)\n# Taitila or Taitula (\u0924\u0948\u0924\u093f\u0932)\n# [[Gara]] or Garaja (\u0917\u0930\u091c)\n# Va\u1e47ija (\u0935\u0923\u093f\u091c)\n# Vi\u1e63\u1e6di ([[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]]) (\u092d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e)\n* Now the first half of the 1st ''tithi'' (of \u015aukla Pak\u1e63a) is always ''Ki\u1e43tughna kara\u1e47a''. Hence this '''kara\u1e47a''' is \"fixed\".\n* Next, the 7-repeating kara\u1e47as repeat eight times to cover the next 56 half-''tithis''. Thus these are the \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n* The 3 remaining half-''tithis'' take the remaining \"fixed\" kara\u1e47as in order. Thus these are also \"fixed\" (sthira).\n* Thus one gets 60 kara\u1e47as from those 11 preset kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe Vedic day begins at sunrise. The kara\u1e47a at sunrise of a particular day shall be the prevailing kara\u1e47a for the whole day.\n(citation needed )\n\n====Nakshatra====\n\n[[Nakshatras]] are divisions of ecliptic, each 13\u00b0 20', starting from 0\u00b0 Aries. The purnima of each month is synchronised with a nakshatra.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Festival calendar: solar and lunar dates==\nMany holidays in the Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina traditions are based on the lunar cycles in the lunisolar timekeeping with foundations in the Hindu calendar system. A few holidays, however, are based on the solar cycle, such as the [[Vaisakhi]], [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] and those associated with Sankranti.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peter J.

A descendant of [[Kujula Kadphises]], founder of the Kushan empire, Kanishka came to rule an empire in Bactria extending to [[Pataliputra]] on the [[Gangetic plain]]. The main capital of his empire was located at [[history of Peshawar|''Puru\u1e63apura'']] in [[Gandhara]], with another major capital at [[ancient Kapisa|Kapisa]].\n\nHis conquests and patronage of [[Buddhism]] played an important role in the development of the [[Silk Road]], and in the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|transmission of Mahayana Buddhism]] from Gandhara across the [[Karakoram]] range to [[China]].\n\nEarlier scholars believed that Kanishka ascended the Kushan throne in 78 CE, and that this date was used as the beginning of the [[Saka era|Saka calendar era]]. However, historians no longer regard this date as that of Kanishka's accession. Falk estimates that Kanishka came to the throne in 127 CE.<ref>\nFalk (2001), pp. 121\u2013136.

The [[Rabatak inscription]] uses a [[Greek script]], to write a language described as ''Arya'' (\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1) \u2013 most likely a form of [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] native to [[Ariana]], which was an [[Eastern Iranian language]] of the [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] period.<ref>Gnoli (2002), pp. 84\u201390.</ref> However, this was likely adopted by the Kushans to facilitate communication with local subjects. It is not certain, what language the Kushan elite spoke among themselves.\n\nKanishka was the successor of [[Vima Kadphises]], as demonstrated by an impressive genealogy of the Kushan kings, known as the [[Rabatak inscription]].<ref>Sims-Williams and Cribb (1995/6), pp.75\u2013142.</ref><ref>Sims-Williams (1998), pp. 79\u201383.</ref> The connection of Kanishka with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription as Kanishka makes the list of the kings who ruled up to his time: [[Kujula Kadphises]] as his great-grandfather, [[Vima Taktu]] as his grandfather, [[Vima Kadphises]] as his father, and himself Kanishka: \"for King [[Kujula Kadphises]] (his) great grandfather, and for King [[Vima Taktu]] (his) grandfather, and for King [[Vima Kadphises]] (his) father, and *also for himself, King Kanishka\".<ref>Sims-Williams and Cribb (1995/6), p. 80.</ref>\n\n==Conquests in South and Central Asia==\n[[Image:Kushanmap.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kushan Empire|Kushan territories]] (full line) and maximum extent of Kushan dominions under Kanishka (dotted line), according to the [[Rabatak inscription]].<ref>\"The [[Rabatak inscription]] claims that in the year 1 Kanishka I's authority was proclaimed in India, in all the satrapies and in different cities like Koonadeano (Kundina), Ozeno ([[Ujjain]]), Kozambo (Kausambi), Zagedo ([[Saketa]]), Palabotro ([[Pataliputra]]) and Ziri-Tambo (Janjgir-Champa).

It extended from southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, north of the Amu Darya ([[Oxus]]) in the north west to Northern India, as far as [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] in the south east (the [[Rabatak inscription]] even claims he held [[Pataliputra]] and Sri Champa), and his territory also included [[Kashmir]], where there was a town Kanishkapur (modern day [[Kanispora]]), named after him not far from the [[Baramula]] Pass and which still contains the base of a large stupa.\n\n[[File:Bronze coin of Kanishka found in Khotan.jpg|thumb|Bronze coin of Kanishka, found in [[Khotan]], modern China.]]\nKnowledge of his hold over Central Asia is less well established. The [[Book of the Later Han|Book of the Later Han, ''Hou Hanshu'']], states that general [[Ban Chao]] fought battles near [[Khotan]] with a Kushan army of 70,000 men led by an otherwise unknown Kushan viceroy named Xie (Chinese: \u8b1d) in 90 AD. Ban Chao claimed to be victorious, forcing the Kushans to retreat by use of a [[scorched-earth]] policy. The territories of [[Kashgar]], [[Khotan]] and [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] were Chinese dependencies in the [[Tarim Basin]], modern [[Xinjiang]]. Several coins of Kanishka have been found in the [[Tarim Basin]].<ref>Hill (2009), p. 11.</ref>\n\nControlling both the land (the [[Silk Road]]) and sea trade routes between South Asia and Rome seems to have been one of Kanishka's chief imperial goals.\n\n==Kanishka's coins==\nKanishka's coins portray images of [[Indian religions|Indian]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Greater Iran|Iranian]] and even [[Sumer]]o-[[Elamite]] divinities, demonstrating the [[Syncretism|religious syncretism]] in his beliefs. Kanishka's coins from the beginning of his reign bear legends in Greek language and script and depict Greek divinities. Later coins bear legends in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] that the Kushans evidently spoke, and Greek divinities were replaced by corresponding Iranian ones. All of Kanishka's coins \u2013 even ones with a legend in the Bactrian language \u2013 were written in a modified Greek script that had one additional glyph (\u03f7) to represent /\u0161/ (''sh''), as in the word 'Ku''sh''an' and 'Kani''sh''ka'.\n\n[[File:Kanishka I Greek legend and Helios.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gold coin of Kanishka I with Greek legend and Hellenistic divinity [[Helios]].

Kanishka monogram (tamgha) to the right.]]\n\nKanishka's reputation in Buddhist tradition regarded with utmost importance as he not only believed in Buddhism but also encouraged its teachings as well. As a proof of it, he administered the 4th Buddhist Council in [[Kashmir]] as the head of the council. It was presided by Vasumitra and Ashwaghosha. Images of the [[Buddha]] based on 32 physical signs were made during his time.\n\nHe encouraged both  [[Gandhara]] school of [[Greco-Buddhist Art]] and the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] school of [[Hindu]] art (an inescapable religious syncretism pervades Kushana rule). Kanishka personally seems to have embraced both Buddhism and the Persian attributes but he favored Buddhism more as it can be proven by his devotion to the Buddhist teachings and prayer styles depicted in various books related to kushan empire.\n\nHis greatest contribution to Buddhist architecture was the [[Kanishka stupa]] at [[Peshawar]], Pakistan. Archaeologists who rediscovered the base of it in 1908\u20131909 ascertained that this stupa had a diameter of 286 feet (87 metres). Reports of Chinese pilgrims such as [[Xuanzang]] indicate that its height was 600 to 700 (Chinese) \"feet\" (= roughly 180\u2013210 metres or 591\u2013689&nbsp;ft.) and was covered with jewels.<ref>Dobbins (1971).</ref> Certainly this immense multi-storied building ranks among the wonders of the ancient world.\n\nKanishka is said to have been particularly close to the Buddhist scholar [[Ashvaghosha]], who became his religious advisor in his later years.\n\n===Buddhist coinage===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nThe Buddhist coins of Kanishka are comparatively rare (well under one percent of all known coins of Kanishka). Several show Kanishka on the obverse and the Buddha standing on the reverse. A few also show the [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] and [[Maitreya]]. Like all coins of Kanishka, the design is rather rough and proportions tend to be imprecise; the image of the Buddha is often slightly overdone, with oversize ears and feet spread apart in the same fashion as the Kushan king.\n\nThree types of Kanishka's Buddhist coins are known:\n\n====Standing Buddha====\n[[File:BronzeBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bronze standing Buddha with features similar to those of Kanishka's coins. [[Gandhara]], usually dated 3rd\u20134th century. The Buddha, in Hellenistic style, holds the left corner of his cloak in his hand, and forms the [[abhaya mudra]] ([[Mus\u00e9e Guimet]]).]]\n[[File:Buddha in the coinage of Kanishka I.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of the [[Buddha]] envelopped in a [[mandorla]] in Kanishka's coinage. The mandorla is normally considered as a late evolution in Gandhara art.<ref>\"In Gandhara the appearance of a halo surrounding an entire figure occurs only in the latest phases of artistic production, in the fifth and sixth centuries. By this time in Afghanistan the halo/mandorla had become quite common and is the format that took hold at Central Asian Buddhist sites.\" in {{cite web |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/38782 |website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref>]]\nOnly six Kushan coins of the Buddha are known in gold (the sixth one is the centerpiece of an ancient piece of jewellery, consisting of a Kanishka Buddha coin decorated with a ring of heart-shaped ruby stones). All these coins were minted in gold under Kanishka I, and are in two different denominations: a [[dinar]] of about 8 gm, roughly similar to a Roman [[aureus]], and a quarter dinar of about 2 gm. (about the size of an [[obol (coin)|obol]]).\n\nThe Buddha is represented wearing the monastic robe, the ''[[antaravasaka]]'', the ''[[uttarasanga]]'', and the overcoat ''[[sanghati]]''.\n\nThe ears are extremely large and long, a symbolic exaggeration possibly rendered necessary by the small size of the coins, but otherwise visible in some later Gandharan statues of the Buddha typically dated to the 3rd\u20134th century CE (''illustration, left''). He has an abundant topknot covering the [[usnisha]], often highly stylised in a curly or often globular manner, also visible on later Buddha statues of Gandhara.\n\nIn general, the representation of the Buddha on these coins is already highly symbolic, and quite distinct from the more naturalistic and Hellenistic images seen in early Gandhara sculptures. On several designs a mustache is apparent. The palm of his right hand bears the [[Chakra]] mark, and his brow bear the [[urna]]. An [[aureola]], formed by one, two or three lines, surrounds him.\n\nThe full gown worn by the Buddha on the coins, covering both shoulders, suggests a Gandharan model rather than a Mathuran one.\n\n====\"Shakyamuni Buddha\"====\n[[File:Shakyamuni Buddha on coins of Kanihska I.jpg|thumb|200px|Depictions of the \"[[Shakyamuni Buddha]]\" (with legend \u03f7\u0391\u039a\u0391\u039c\u0391\u039d\u039f \u0392\u039f\u0394\u0394\u039f \"Shakamano Boddo\") in Kanishka's coinage.]]\nThe [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] (with the legend \"Sakamano Boudo\", i.e. Shakamuni Buddha, another name for the historic Buddha [[Siddharta Gautama]]), standing to front, with left hand on hip and forming the abhaya mudra with the right hand. All these coins are in copper only, and usually rather worn.\n\nThe gown of the Shakyamuni Buddha is quite light compared to that on the coins in the name of Buddha, clearly showing the outline of the body, in a nearly transparent way. These are probably the first two layers of monastic clothing the ''[[antaravasaka]]'' and the ''[[uttarasanga]]''. Also, his gown is folded over the left arm (rather than being held in the left hand as above), a feature only otherwise known in the [[Bimaran casket]] and suggestive of a scarf-like ''[[uttariya]]''. He has an abundant topknot covering the [[ushnisha]], and a simple or double [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], sometimes radiating, surrounds his head.\n\n====\"Maitreya Buddha\"====\n[[File:KushanMaitreyaTotal.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Depictions of \"[[Maitreya]]\" (with legend \u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u0391\u0393\u039f \u0392\u039f\u0394\u0394\u039f \"Metrago Boddo\") in Kanishka's coinage.]]\nThe Bodhisattva [[Maitreya]] (with the legend \"Metrago Boudo\") cross-legged on a throne, holding a water pot, and also forming the Abhaya mudra. These coins are only known in copper and are quite  worn out .\nOn the clearest coins, Maitreya seems to be wearing the armbands of an Indian prince, a feature often seen on the statuary of Maitreya. The throne is decorated with small columns, suggesting that the coin representation of Maitreya was directly copied from pre-existing statuary with such well-known features.\n\nThe qualification of \"Buddha\" for Maitreya is inaccurate, as he is instead a [[Bodhisattva]] (he is the Buddha of the future).\n\nThe iconography of these three types is very different from that of the other deities depicted in Kanishka's coinage. Whether Kanishka's deities are all shown from the side, the Buddhas only are shown frontally, indicating that they were copied from contemporary frontal representations of the standing and seated Buddhas in statuary.<ref>''The Crossroads of Asia'', p. 201.

It is said to have contained three bone fragments of the Buddha, which are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Burma.\n\nThe casket is dedicated in [[Kharoshthi]]. The inscription reads:\n\n: \"(*mahara)jasa kanishkasa kanishka-pure nagare aya gadha-karae deya-dharme sarva-satvana hita-suhartha bhavatu mahasenasa sagharaki dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kanishkasa vihare mahasenasa sangharame\"\n\nThe text is signed by the maker, a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's [[stupa]]s (caitya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realisations at such a late date: \"The servant Agisalaos, the superintendent of works at the vihara of Kanishka in the monastery of Mahasena\" (\"dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kaniskasa vihara mahasenasa sangharame\").\n\nThe lid of the casket shows the Buddha on a lotus pedestal, and worshipped by [[Brahma]] and [[Indra]]. The edge of the lid is decorated by a frieze of flying geese. The body of the casket represents a Kushan monarch, probably Kanishka in person, with the Iranian sun and moon gods on his side. On the sides are two images of a seated Buddha, worshiped by royal figures, can be assumed as Kanishka. A garland, supported by [[cherubs]] goes around the scene in typical Hellenistic style.\n\nThe attribution of the casket to Kanishka has been recently disputed, essentially on stylistic ground (for example the ruler shown on the casket is not bearded, to the contrary of Kanishka). Instead, the casket is often attributed to Kanishka's successor [[Huvishka]].\n\n===Kanishka in Buddhist tradition===\n[[File:Kanishka-Inaugurates-Mahyana-Buddhism.jpg|thumb|Kanishka inaugurates Mahayana Buddhism]]\nIn Buddhist tradition, Kanishka is often described as an aggressive, hot tempered, rigid, strict, and a bit harsh  kind of King  before he got converted to Buddhism of which he was very fond, and after his conversion to Buddhism, he became an openhearted, benevolent, and faithful  ruler. As in the Sri-dharma-pitaka-nidana sutra:\n:\"At this time the King of Ngan-si (Pahlava) was very aggressive  and of a violent nature\u2026.There was a bhikshu (monk) arhat who seeing the harsh  deeds done by the king wished to make him repent. So by his supernatural force he caused the king to see the torments of hell. The king was terrified and repented and cried terribly and hence dissolved all his negatives within him and got self realised for the first time in life .\" ''{{IAST|\u015ari-dharma-pi\u1e6daka-nid\u0101na s\u016btra}}''<ref>Kumar (1973), p. 95.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the arrival of Kanishka was reportedly foretold or was  predicted by the Buddha, as well as the construction of his stupa:\n:\". . . the Buddha, pointing to a small boy making a mud tope\u2026.[said] that on that spot {{IAST|Ka\u1e47i\u1e63ka}} would erect a tope by his name.\" ''Vinaya sutra''<ref>Kumar (1973), p. 91.</ref>\n\n[[File:Coin of Kanishka depicting Maitreya.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Kanishka with the Bodhisattva Maitreya \"Metrago Boudo\".]]\nThe same story is repeated in a [[Khotan]]ese scroll found at [[Dunhuang]], which first described how Kanishka would arrive 400 years after the death of the Buddha. The account also describes how Kanishka came to raise his stupa:\n:\"A desire thus arose in [Kanishka to build a vast stupa]\u2026.at that time the four world-regents learnt the mind of the king. So for his sake they took the form of young boys\u2026.[and] began a st\u016bpa of mud....the boys said to [Kanishka] \u2018We are making the {{IAST|Ka\u1e47i\u1e63ka-st\u016bpa}}.\u2019\u2026.At that time the boys changed their form....[and] said to him, \u2018Great king, by you according to the Buddha's prophecy is a {{IAST|Sa\u1e45gh\u0101r\u0101ma}} to be built wholly (?) with a large st\u016bpa and hither relics must be invited which the meritorious good beings...will bring.\"<ref>Kumar (1973). p. 89.</ref>\n\nChinese pilgrims to India, such as [[Xuanzang]], who travelled there around 630 CE also relays the story:\n:\"{{IAST|Ka\u1e47i\u1e63ka}} became sovereign of all Jambudv\u012bpa (Indian subcontinent) but he did not believe in Karma, but he treated Buddhism with honor and respect as he himself  converted to Buddhism intrigued by the teachings and scriptures of it. When he was hunting in the wild country a white hare appeared; the king gave a chase and the hare suddenly disappeared at [the site of the future stupa]\u2026.[when the construction of the st\u016bpa was not going as planned] the king lost his patience and took the matter in his own hands and started resurrecting the plans precisely, thus completing the stupas with utmost perfection and perseverance. These two stupas are still in existence and were resorted to for cures by people afflicted with diseases.\"\nKing Kanishka because of his deeds was highly respected, regarded, honored by all the people he ruled and governed and was regarded the greatest king who ever lived because of his kindness, humbleness and sense of equality and self-righteousness  among all aspects. Thus such great deeds and character of the king Kanishka made his name immortal and thus he was regarded \"THE KING OF KINGS\"<ref>[[Xuanzang]], quoted in: Kumar (1973), p. 93.</ref>\n\n===Transmission of Buddhism to China===\n{{main|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}\nBuddhist monks from the region of [[Gandhara]] played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia from the middle of the 2nd century CE. The [[Kushan]] monk, [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] (c. 178 CE), became the first translator of [[Mahayana]] Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and established a translation bureau at the Chinese capital [[Loyang]]. Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges for the following centuries.\n\nKanishka was probably succeeded by [[Huvishka]]. How and when this came about is still uncertain. It is a fact that there was only one king named Kanishka in the whole Kushan legacy. The inscription on The [[Sacred Rock of Hunza]] also shows the signs of Kanishka.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Coin of Kanishka depicting Mozdoano.jpg|Kanishka with the divinity Mozdoano.\nImage:KanishkaCoinFacing.jpg|Coin of Kanishka.\nImage:KanishkaICoinFoundInAhinposhAfghanistan.jpg|Coin of Kanishka found at [[Ahin Posh]].\nImage:KanishkaICoin.JPG|Coin.\nFile:Kanishka I bronze coin.jpg|Kanishka bronze coin.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Kushan rulers}}\n* [[Menander I]]\n* [[Greco-Buddhism]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n|last       = Bopearachchi\n|first      = Osmund\n |authorlink=Bopearachchi\n|title      = De l'Indus \u00e0 l'Oxus, Arch\u00e9ologie de l'Asie Centrale\n|year       = 2003\n|publisher  = Association imago-mus\u00e9e de Lattes\n|location   = Lattes\n|language   = French\n|isbn         = 978-2-9516679-2-1\n}}\n* Chavannes, \u00c9douard.

Kanishka's coins from the beginning of his reign bear legends in Greek language and script and depict Greek divinities. Later coins bear legends in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] that the Kushans evidently spoke, and Greek divinities were replaced by corresponding Iranian ones. All of Kanishka's coins \u2013 even ones with a legend in the Bactrian language \u2013 were written in a modified Greek script that had one additional glyph (\u03f7) to represent /\u0161/ (''sh''), as in the word 'Ku''sh''an' and 'Kani''sh''ka'.\n\n[[File:Kanishka I Greek legend and Helios.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gold coin of Kanishka I with Greek legend and Hellenistic divinity [[Helios]].

Kanishka monogram (tamgha) to the right.]]\n\nKanishka's reputation in Buddhist tradition regarded with utmost importance as he not only believed in Buddhism but also encouraged its teachings as well. As a proof of it, he administered the 4th Buddhist Council in [[Kashmir]] as the head of the council. It was presided by Vasumitra and Ashwaghosha. Images of the [[Buddha]] based on 32 physical signs were made during his time.\n\nHe encouraged both  [[Gandhara]] school of [[Greco-Buddhist Art]] and the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] school of [[Hindu]] art (an inescapable religious syncretism pervades Kushana rule). Kanishka personally seems to have embraced both Buddhism and the Persian attributes but he favored Buddhism more as it can be proven by his devotion to the Buddhist teachings and prayer styles depicted in various books related to kushan empire.\n\nHis greatest contribution to Buddhist architecture was the [[Kanishka stupa]] at [[Peshawar]], Pakistan. Archaeologists who rediscovered the base of it in 1908\u20131909 ascertained that this stupa had a diameter of 286 feet (87 metres). Reports of Chinese pilgrims such as [[Xuanzang]] indicate that its height was 600 to 700 (Chinese) \"feet\" (= roughly 180\u2013210 metres or 591\u2013689&nbsp;ft.) and was covered with jewels.<ref>Dobbins (1971).</ref> Certainly this immense multi-storied building ranks among the wonders of the ancient world.\n\nKanishka is said to have been particularly close to the Buddhist scholar [[Ashvaghosha]], who became his religious advisor in his later years.\n\n===Buddhist coinage===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nThe Buddhist coins of Kanishka are comparatively rare (well under one percent of all known coins of Kanishka). Several show Kanishka on the obverse and the Buddha standing on the reverse. A few also show the [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] and [[Maitreya]]. Like all coins of Kanishka, the design is rather rough and proportions tend to be imprecise; the image of the Buddha is often slightly overdone, with oversize ears and feet spread apart in the same fashion as the Kushan king.\n\nThree types of Kanishka's Buddhist coins are known:\n\n====Standing Buddha====\n[[File:BronzeBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bronze standing Buddha with features similar to those of Kanishka's coins. [[Gandhara]], usually dated 3rd\u20134th century. The Buddha, in Hellenistic style, holds the left corner of his cloak in his hand, and forms the [[abhaya mudra]] ([[Mus\u00e9e Guimet]]).]]\n[[File:Buddha in the coinage of Kanishka I.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of the [[Buddha]] envelopped in a [[mandorla]] in Kanishka's coinage. The mandorla is normally considered as a late evolution in Gandhara art.<ref>\"In Gandhara the appearance of a halo surrounding an entire figure occurs only in the latest phases of artistic production, in the fifth and sixth centuries. By this time in Afghanistan the halo/mandorla had become quite common and is the format that took hold at Central Asian Buddhist sites.\" in {{cite web |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/38782 |website=www.metmuseum.org}}</ref>]]\nOnly six Kushan coins of the Buddha are known in gold (the sixth one is the centerpiece of an ancient piece of jewellery, consisting of a Kanishka Buddha coin decorated with a ring of heart-shaped ruby stones). All these coins were minted in gold under Kanishka I, and are in two different denominations: a [[dinar]] of about 8 gm, roughly similar to a Roman [[aureus]], and a quarter dinar of about 2 gm. (about the size of an [[obol (coin)|obol]]).\n\nThe Buddha is represented wearing the monastic robe, the ''[[antaravasaka]]'', the ''[[uttarasanga]]'', and the overcoat ''[[sanghati]]''.\n\nThe ears are extremely large and long, a symbolic exaggeration possibly rendered necessary by the small size of the coins, but otherwise visible in some later Gandharan statues of the Buddha typically dated to the 3rd\u20134th century CE (''illustration, left''). He has an abundant topknot covering the [[usnisha]], often highly stylised in a curly or often globular manner, also visible on later Buddha statues of Gandhara.\n\nIn general, the representation of the Buddha on these coins is already highly symbolic, and quite distinct from the more naturalistic and Hellenistic images seen in early Gandhara sculptures. On several designs a mustache is apparent. The palm of his right hand bears the [[Chakra]] mark, and his brow bear the [[urna]]. An [[aureola]], formed by one, two or three lines, surrounds him.\n\nThe full gown worn by the Buddha on the coins, covering both shoulders, suggests a Gandharan model rather than a Mathuran one.\n\n====\"Shakyamuni Buddha\"====\n[[File:Shakyamuni Buddha on coins of Kanihska I.jpg|thumb|200px|Depictions of the \"[[Shakyamuni Buddha]]\" (with legend \u03f7\u0391\u039a\u0391\u039c\u0391\u039d\u039f \u0392\u039f\u0394\u0394\u039f \"Shakamano Boddo\") in Kanishka's coinage.]]\nThe [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] (with the legend \"Sakamano Boudo\", i.e. Shakamuni Buddha, another name for the historic Buddha [[Siddharta Gautama]]), standing to front, with left hand on hip and forming the abhaya mudra with the right hand. All these coins are in copper only, and usually rather worn.\n\nThe gown of the Shakyamuni Buddha is quite light compared to that on the coins in the name of Buddha, clearly showing the outline of the body, in a nearly transparent way. These are probably the first two layers of monastic clothing the ''[[antaravasaka]]'' and the ''[[uttarasanga]]''. Also, his gown is folded over the left arm (rather than being held in the left hand as above), a feature only otherwise known in the [[Bimaran casket]] and suggestive of a scarf-like ''[[uttariya]]''. He has an abundant topknot covering the [[ushnisha]], and a simple or double [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], sometimes radiating, surrounds his head.\n\n====\"Maitreya Buddha\"====\n[[File:KushanMaitreyaTotal.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Depictions of \"[[Maitreya]]\" (with legend \u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u0391\u0393\u039f \u0392\u039f\u0394\u0394\u039f \"Metrago Boddo\") in Kanishka's coinage.]]\nThe Bodhisattva [[Maitreya]] (with the legend \"Metrago Boudo\") cross-legged on a throne, holding a water pot, and also forming the Abhaya mudra. These coins are only known in copper and are quite  worn out .\nOn the clearest coins, Maitreya seems to be wearing the armbands of an Indian prince, a feature often seen on the statuary of Maitreya. The throne is decorated with small columns, suggesting that the coin representation of Maitreya was directly copied from pre-existing statuary with such well-known features.\n\nThe qualification of \"Buddha\" for Maitreya is inaccurate, as he is instead a [[Bodhisattva]] (he is the Buddha of the future).\n\nThe iconography of these three types is very different from that of the other deities depicted in Kanishka's coinage. Whether Kanishka's deities are all shown from the side, the Buddhas only are shown frontally, indicating that they were copied from contemporary frontal representations of the standing and seated Buddhas in statuary.<ref>''The Crossroads of Asia'', p. 201.

It is said to have contained three bone fragments of the Buddha, which are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Burma.\n\nThe casket is dedicated in [[Kharoshthi]]. The inscription reads:\n\n: \"(*mahara)jasa kanishkasa kanishka-pure nagare aya gadha-karae deya-dharme sarva-satvana hita-suhartha bhavatu mahasenasa sagharaki dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kanishkasa vihare mahasenasa sangharame\"\n\nThe text is signed by the maker, a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's [[stupa]]s (caitya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realisations at such a late date: \"The servant Agisalaos, the superintendent of works at the vihara of Kanishka in the monastery of Mahasena\" (\"dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kaniskasa vihara mahasenasa sangharame\").\n\nThe lid of the casket shows the Buddha on a lotus pedestal, and worshipped by [[Brahma]] and [[Indra]]. The edge of the lid is decorated by a frieze of flying geese. The body of the casket represents a Kushan monarch, probably Kanishka in person, with the Iranian sun and moon gods on his side. On the sides are two images of a seated Buddha, worshiped by royal figures, can be assumed as Kanishka. A garland, supported by [[cherubs]] goes around the scene in typical Hellenistic style.\n\nThe attribution of the casket to Kanishka has been recently disputed, essentially on stylistic ground (for example the ruler shown on the casket is not bearded, to the contrary of Kanishka). Instead, the casket is often attributed to Kanishka's successor [[Huvishka]].\n\n===Kanishka in Buddhist tradition===\n[[File:Kanishka-Inaugurates-Mahyana-Buddhism.jpg|thumb|Kanishka inaugurates Mahayana Buddhism]]\nIn Buddhist tradition, Kanishka is often described as an aggressive, hot tempered, rigid, strict, and a bit harsh  kind of King  before he got converted to Buddhism of which he was very fond, and after his conversion to Buddhism, he became an openhearted, benevolent, and faithful  ruler. As in the Sri-dharma-pitaka-nidana sutra:\n:\"At this time the King of Ngan-si (Pahlava) was very aggressive  and of a violent nature\u2026.There was a bhikshu (monk) arhat who seeing the harsh  deeds done by the king wished to make him repent. So by his supernatural force he caused the king to see the torments of hell. The king was terrified and repented and cried terribly and hence dissolved all his negatives within him and got self realised for the first time in life .\" ''{{IAST|\u015ari-dharma-pi\u1e6daka-nid\u0101na s\u016btra}}''<ref>Kumar (1973), p. 95.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the arrival of Kanishka was reportedly foretold or was  predicted by the Buddha, as well as the construction of his stupa:\n:\". . . the Buddha, pointing to a small boy making a mud tope\u2026.[said] that on that spot {{IAST|Ka\u1e47i\u1e63ka}} would erect a tope by his name.\" ''Vinaya sutra''<ref>Kumar (1973), p. 91.</ref>\n\n[[File:Coin of Kanishka depicting Maitreya.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Kanishka with the Bodhisattva Maitreya \"Metrago Boudo\".]]\nThe same story is repeated in a [[Khotan]]ese scroll found at [[Dunhuang]], which first described how Kanishka would arrive 400 years after the death of the Buddha. The account also describes how Kanishka came to raise his stupa:\n:\"A desire thus arose in [Kanishka to build a vast stupa]\u2026.at that time the four world-regents learnt the mind of the king. So for his sake they took the form of young boys\u2026.[and] began a st\u016bpa of mud....the boys said to [Kanishka] \u2018We are making the {{IAST|Ka\u1e47i\u1e63ka-st\u016bpa}}.\u2019\u2026.At that time the boys changed their form....[and] said to him, \u2018Great king, by you according to the Buddha's prophecy is a {{IAST|Sa\u1e45gh\u0101r\u0101ma}} to be built wholly (?) with a large st\u016bpa and hither relics must be invited which the meritorious good beings...will bring.\"<ref>Kumar (1973). p. 89.</ref>\n\nChinese pilgrims to India, such as [[Xuanzang]], who travelled there around 630 CE also relays the story:\n:\"{{IAST|Ka\u1e47i\u1e63ka}} became sovereign of all Jambudv\u012bpa (Indian subcontinent) but he did not believe in Karma, but he treated Buddhism with honor and respect as he himself  converted to Buddhism intrigued by the teachings and scriptures of it. When he was hunting in the wild country a white hare appeared; the king gave a chase and the hare suddenly disappeared at [the site of the future stupa]\u2026.[when the construction of the st\u016bpa was not going as planned] the king lost his patience and took the matter in his own hands and started resurrecting the plans precisely, thus completing the stupas with utmost perfection and perseverance. These two stupas are still in existence and were resorted to for cures by people afflicted with diseases.\"\nKing Kanishka because of his deeds was highly respected, regarded, honored by all the people he ruled and governed and was regarded the greatest king who ever lived because of his kindness, humbleness and sense of equality and self-righteousness  among all aspects. Thus such great deeds and character of the king Kanishka made his name immortal and thus he was regarded \"THE KING OF KINGS\"<ref>[[Xuanzang]], quoted in: Kumar (1973), p. 93.</ref>\n\n===Transmission of Buddhism to China===\n{{main|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}\nBuddhist monks from the region of [[Gandhara]] played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia from the middle of the 2nd century CE. The [[Kushan]] monk, [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] (c. 178 CE), became the first translator of [[Mahayana]] Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and established a translation bureau at the Chinese capital [[Loyang]]. Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges for the following centuries.\n\nKanishka was probably succeeded by [[Huvishka]]. How and when this came about is still uncertain. It is a fact that there was only one king named Kanishka in the whole Kushan legacy. The inscription on The [[Sacred Rock of Hunza]] also shows the signs of Kanishka.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Coin of Kanishka depicting Mozdoano.jpg|Kanishka with the divinity Mozdoano.\nImage:KanishkaCoinFacing.jpg|Coin of Kanishka.\nImage:KanishkaICoinFoundInAhinposhAfghanistan.jpg|Coin of Kanishka found at [[Ahin Posh]].\nImage:KanishkaICoin.JPG|Coin.\nFile:Kanishka I bronze coin.jpg|Kanishka bronze coin.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Kushan rulers}}\n* [[Menander I]]\n* [[Greco-Buddhism]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n|last       = Bopearachchi\n|first      = Osmund\n |authorlink=Bopearachchi\n|title      = De l'Indus \u00e0 l'Oxus, Arch\u00e9ologie de l'Asie Centrale\n|year       = 2003\n|publisher  = Association imago-mus\u00e9e de Lattes\n|location   = Lattes\n|language   = French\n|isbn         = 978-2-9516679-2-1\n}}\n* Chavannes, \u00c9douard.
