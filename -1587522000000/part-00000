The manager selects books and other library materials, but the actual ordering, receiving and processing take place at the Main Library.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wilmington.lib.oh.us/ Wilmington Public Library]\n\n{{coord|39|26|56|N|83|49|40|W|format=dms|display=title|type:landmark_region:US-OH}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wilmington Public Library Of Clinton County, Ohio}}\n[[Category:Public libraries in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Clinton County, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Education in Clinton County, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Library buildings completed in 1904]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_Public_Library"}

The library's design was inspired by [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. Construction began in July, with lot preparations completed by August. On August 26, Mayor E. Elwell declared a half-holiday for the cornerstone laying ceremony, which was executed by the local [[Masonic Lodge|Masons]].

It was the first network to specifically target [[Hispanic]]s of [[Mexico|Mexican]] origin, the first Spanish-language network to take advantage of digital technology, and the first Spanish-language network to broadcast over the [[Internet]].\n\nHTVN operated from 2000 through 2003 and at one time could be viewed over-the-air on nearly 70 television stations, on approximately 300 cable systems, and on the Internet. HTVN was owned by Hispanic Television Network, Inc. of [[Fort Worth, Texas]].\n\n==History==\n===A New Network===\nHTVN was launched in early 2000 following the creation of Hispanic Television Network, Inc. from the merger of Hispano Television Ventures and American Independent Network, Inc., both of Fort Worth. While the new company owned both HTVN and English-language network [[American Independent Network]], it focused the majority of its attention on HTVN. The network's facilities were all-digital and state-of-the-art.\n\n===Early Successes===\nThe new network expanded rapidly, and by March 2000, appeared on 25 television stations, including those in top-10 Hispanic markets [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and [[Brownsville, Texas]].\n\nBy June 2000, HTVN had announced deals with [[Yahoo!]] to broadcast network programming on the Internet [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813190031/http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release536.html], and with [[Mexinema]] and [[Excalibur Media Group]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060627141733/http://www.excaliburmg.com/] to give HTVN the rights to over 500 Mexican-made, Spanish-language movies. It was now on nearly 60 television stations, including full-service flagship station [[KAZD|KLDT]] in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Including cable coverage, HTVN reached over 20 million homes.\n\nBy the end of the year, HTVN had added full-service [[KJLA]] in the Los Angeles market and had partnered with Mexican broadcasting giant [[MVS Television]], providing the network access to MVS' state-of-the-art production facilities and talent base, allowing HTVN to produce programming in the United States, which was scarce at that time.\n\n===Back to Earth===\nThe rapid growth proved to be costly, however, as HTVN's owners reported a 14,492% increase in expenses from first quarter 1999 to first quarter 2000, no doubt the bulk of it from launching the new network. Furthermore, the network did not produce nearly sufficient revenues to cover expenses and their owners announced a $38 million loss for 2000 against only $620,955 in revenue [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225520/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=3898].\n\nBy 2002, HTVN had all but abandoned its over-the-air strategy and was turning its attention to mostly cable distribution. Still, the network was not bringing in sufficient revenue to cover its expenses, and despite its owners' attempts to acquire revenue from other sources, they filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] reorganization in July 2002.\n\nIn early 2003, Hispanic Television Network, Inc. sold its cable agreements to Hispanic children's network, \u00a1Sorpresa! and on July 10, 2003, HTVN formally ceased operations [http://www.secinfo.com/dVm4h.2j.htm].\n\nIn 2009, a new (and unrelated) effort toward a nationwide over-the-air Spanish-language network launched, [[Estrella TV]].\n\n==Contributing factors to network's demise==\nMany factors contributed to HTVN's demise, but three major issues stand out:\n* Overly aggressive growth. HTVN's owners spent tremendous amounts of money to give HTVN maximum coverage and the very best facilities early on. It was a business strategy that was common in the late 1990s and early 2000s and it often proved disastrous, as revenues couldn't catch up with expenses fast enough to allow the company to continue operating.\n* Too-narrow market focus. HTVN proudly announced that its focus would be on Mexican Hispanics, which are estimated to make up two-thirds of all Hispanics in the United States. However, that strategy reduced the potential market by up to 33% and omitted two of the top three Hispanic television markets in the United States, [[New York City|New York]] (whose main Hispanic demographic was [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]]) and [[Miami]] (predominately of [[Cuba]]n origin).\n* Slow economy.

It is located at the junction of Old and State Roads, in an architecturally distinguished building constructed in 1907 via a bequest from Dr. John S. H. Fogg in memory of his father William.  The building was designed by [[C. Howard Walker]], and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 21, 1991.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==Architecture and history==\nThe Fogg Library is set at the northwest corner of Old and State Roads (Old Road being designated [[Maine State Route 103]]), near the northern end of Eliot's linear village center.  It is a 1-1/2 story structure fashioned out of fieldstone, with a flared hip roof, set on a low hill on a triangular lot.  Its distinctive exterior and elevated position adjacent to the main road make it a prominent local landmark.  Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance portico supported by four Ionic columns, with an entablature and fully pedimented gable above.  The roof has three gabled dormers, and there are granite string courses above the foundation and below the windows.  The interior has a central hall, with a reading room on one side and children's room on the other, and stacks located in an ell to the rear.  The interior is relatively little altered since its construction.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=91001817}}|title=NRHP nomination for William Fogg Library|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe first library established in the town Eliot was a private lending library established by William Fogg and housed at his home on Old Road.  Fogg's son, Dr. John H. S. Fogg, a [[Harvard College|Harvard]]-educated doctor, continued his father's interest in education, amassing a collection of books.

It is located at the junction of Old and State Roads, in an architecturally distinguished building constructed in 1907 via a bequest from Dr. John S. H. Fogg in memory of his father William.  The building was designed by [[C. Howard Walker]], and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 21, 1991.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==Architecture and history==\nThe Fogg Library is set at the northwest corner of Old and State Roads (Old Road being designated [[Maine State Route 103]]), near the northern end of Eliot's linear village center.  It is a 1-1/2 story structure fashioned out of fieldstone, with a flared hip roof, set on a low hill on a triangular lot.  Its distinctive exterior and elevated position adjacent to the main road make it a prominent local landmark.  Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance portico supported by four Ionic columns, with an entablature and fully pedimented gable above.  The roof has three gabled dormers, and there are granite string courses above the foundation and below the windows.  The interior has a central hall, with a reading room on one side and children's room on the other, and stacks located in an ell to the rear.  The interior is relatively little altered since its construction.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=91001817}}|title=NRHP nomination for William Fogg Library|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe first library established in the town Eliot was a private lending library established by William Fogg and housed at his home on Old Road.  Fogg's son, Dr. John H. S. Fogg, a [[Harvard College|Harvard]]-educated doctor, continued his father's interest in education, amassing a collection of books.  Upon his death he gave most of his book collection to the town, and bequested $10,000 to the town for construction of a library on land he donated.  The new library was built in 1907, to a design by [[Boston]] architect C. Howard Walker, and supposedly used stone materials gathered from the walls lining the Fogg property.  Fogg also established a trust fund for maintenance of the building.<ref name=NRHP/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Maine]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://williamfogglibrary.org/ William Fogg Library web site]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places}}\n\n[[Category:Library buildings completed in 1907]]\n[[Category:Public libraries in Maine]]\n[[Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine]]\n[[Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Maine]]\n[[Category:Libraries in York County, Maine]]\n[[Category:Eliot, Maine]]\n[[Category:1907 establishments in Maine]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in York County, Maine]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fogg_Library"}
