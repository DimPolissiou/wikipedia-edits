In [[medieval Europe]] such a way of working and form of visual or fine art education was often enforced by local [[guild]] regulations, of the painters' [[Guild of Saint Luke]], and those of other guilds for other crafts. [[Apprentice]]s usually began young, working on simple tasks, and after some years became [[journeymen]], before becoming masters themselves. The system was gradually replaced as the once powerful guilds declined, and the [[academy]] became a favored method of training, although many professional artists continued to use students and assistants, some paid by the artist, some paying fees to learn.<ref name=Harrap>Diana Davies (editor), ''Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists'', Harrap Books Limited, (1990) {{ISBN|0-245-54692-8}}</ref>\n\nIn art, the atelier consists of a master [[artist]], usually a professional [[Painting|painter]], sculptor, or from the mid-19th century a fine art photographer, working with a small number of students to train them in visual or fine arts. This very word has also taken on other similar meanings, indicating a place of work and study of the [[haute couture]] fashion designer, [[Hairdresser|hair stylist]] and artists in general. Atelier schools can be found around the world, particularly in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Janson |first1=H.

They traditionally include sessions for drawing or painting [[Nude (art)|nude art]].\n\n==Methods==\n===Sight-Size===\n[[Image:Belvedere Apollo Pio-Clementino Inv1015.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Apollo Belvedere]],'' (350-325 BC) [[Vatican Museums]]]] [[Image:Tizian 041.jpg|right|thumb|[[Titian]], ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (1516\u20131518)]]\n\n'''Sight-Size''' is a method of drawing and painting an object exactly as it appears to the artist, on a one-to-one scale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kj628Qqpihij7duYzkParopasQvE84pD/view?usp=drive_open&usp=embed_facebook|title=The Modern Sight Size Method|last=Margua Simon|first=Trinka|date=2013|website=Google Docs|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> The artist first sets a vantage point where the subject and the drawing surface appear to be the same size. Then, using a variety of measuring tools\u2014which can include [[Spirit level|levels]], [[mirror]]s, [[plumb bob]]s, strings, and sticks\u2014the artist draws the subject so that, when viewed from the set vantage point, the drawing and the subject have exactly the same [[dimensions]]. When properly done, sight-size drawing can result in extremely accurate and realistic drawings. It can also be used to draw the exact dimensions for a [[Model (art)|model]] in preparation for a painting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAteliers following the sight-size method generally agree that the practice of careful [[drawing]] is the basis of [[painting]], teaching a form of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] based upon careful observations of nature with attention to detail. Using this method, students progress through a series of tasks such as cast drawing, cast painting, drawing and painting from the live model, and still life. Students must complete each task to the instructor's satisfaction before progressing to the next. This system is referred to as \"systematic progression\" or \"systematic teaching and learning\".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAtelier students often begin this progression by drawing [[Plaster#Use in sculptural arts|plaster]] casts. These casts are usually faces, hands, or other parts of the [[human anatomy]]. Plaster casts provide some of the benefits of live, human models, such as the presence of [[natural]] [[shadows]]. They also have their own distinct advantages: they remain perfectly still and their white color allows the student to focus on the pure, [[grayscale]] tones of shadows.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nOne goal for sight-size students is to gain enough skill to transfer an accurate image to the paper or canvas without the aid of a mechanical device. Contemporary realist painter Adrian Gottlieb notes that \"while professional painters pursuing a full-time career will develop an 'eye' that precludes the need for measuring devices and plumb lines (tools necessary during the training period), the observation method itself is not abandoned - instead it becomes second nature. Sight-size can be taught and applied in conjunction with a particular sensitivity to gesture to create life-like imagery; especially when applied to portraiture and figurative works.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nDarren R. Rousar, former student of Richard Lack and [[Charles H. Cecil Studios|Charles Cecil]] as well as the author of ''Cast Drawing Using the Sight-Size Approach'', agrees and defines measuring in broad terms. He says that \"a fully trained artist who uses Sight-size might never use a plumb line or even consciously think about literal measuring. He or she will strive toward achieving the same retinal impression in the painting as is seen in nature.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sightsize.com/misconceptions.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317065127/http://www.sightsize.com/misconceptions.html |archivedate=2009-03-17 |title=Sight-Size Misconceptions |website=Sight-Size.com |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nArt school owner Charles H. Cecil writes:\n\n:In reviving the atelier tradition, [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893\u20131981) adopted sight-size as the basis of his teaching method. He founded his studio on the precedent of private ateliers, such as those of [[Carolus-Duran]] and [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]]. These French masters were accomplished sight-size portraitists who conveyed to their pupils a devotion to the art of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]]. Sargent was trained by both painters and that, in turn, his use of sight-size had a major influence in Great Britain and America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlescecilstudios.com/html/philosophy/atelierTradition.html |title=Atelier tradition|author= Charles H. Cecil Studios |accessdate= September 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nArt from ateliers using the sight-size method is often reminiscent of Greek and Roman sculpture from [[classical antiquity]], such as the [[Apollo Belvedere]]. Paintings may favor the visual imagery of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] art of the mid-18th to 19th century. The sight-size method also lends itself to styles of portraiture in which the artists desires an accurate, natural, true to life or even near photographic image of the sitter as is evident in the work of [[Bouguereau]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Comparative measurement===\nThe comparative measurement method requires proportional accuracy, but allows the artist to vary the size of the image created. This technique broadly encompasses any method of drawing that involves making accurate measurements primarily using the naked eye. In the early training period students may be aided by a pencil, brush or [[plumb line]] to make comparisons, but there is no transfer of 1:1 measurements from subject directly to paper.  Schools that teach this method include The Water Street Atelier and The Swedish Academy of Realist Art.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn his essay, \"[https://www.swedishacademyofrealistart.se/comparative-method The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages]\", the painter and instructor Hans-Peter Szameit, of the Swedish Academy of Realist Art, discusses the disadvantages of sight-size, describing it as essentially the making of a mechanically produced image limited to one size, the \"sight size\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://atelierstockholm.se/about/sight-size/| title=The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages| author=Szameit, Hans-Peter| access-date=2012-06-30| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422000406/http://atelierstockholm.se/about/sight-size/| archive-date=2012-04-22| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Illusion===\n[[File:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - Sketch for Madame Moitessier - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Sketch for Madame Moitessier, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]\nAnother traditional atelier method incorporates the use of illusions that fool the viewer into believing an image is accurate. This method is most often taught in conjunction with advanced compositional theory. Since it is not necessary to copy the subject accurately to achieve a successful illusion, this method allows the artist to experiment with many options while retaining what appears to be a realistic image.\n\nIn one example, the ''Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending'' (c. 1613\u20131614 (drawn), in ''The Education of Marie de' Medici''<ref>{{cite web|website=V&A Images|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1069261/study-of-a-male-figure-drawing-rubens-peter-paul/|title=Prints, Drawings and Paintings Collection: ''Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending in \"The Education of Marie de Medici\"''|accessdate=April 12, 2014}}</ref>), Rubens has obscured the point where the legs attach to the torso. This is one factor that contributes to the ease in which he is able to successfully experiment with a variety of dramatically different leg placements. At least three sets of feet are visible. The viewer is not disturbed by an illogical attachment if the attachment is not visible and the resulting two-dimensional image is pleasing to the eye. This allows the artist to choose from a great number of very different alternatives, making his selection based on personal preference or aesthetics rather than accuracy. In the referenced exercise it is possible to experiment with numerous manipulations regarding the size and placement of each part of the body while at the same time using a collection of two-dimensional foreshortening illusions to retain the appearance of realism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trinkamarguasimon.com/the-art-of-composition|title=The Art of Composition|author=Simon, Trinka Margua|first=|date=2008|work=|access-date=|archiveurl=|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to body parts, artists may rely on the manipulation of many other elements to achieve a successful illusion. These can include: the manipulation of color, value, edge characteristics, overlapping shapes, and a number of different types of paint applications such as [[glazing (window)|glazing]] and [[scumbling]]. Work developed this way would not begin with a drawing, but rather the placement of all relevant elements necessary for the success of the illusions as well as the composition as a whole.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1505989?uid=3738984&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21104848463297 Varnish]</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gurney|first=James|title=James Gurney Interview|url=http://jamesgurney.com/interview.html|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nMany of the illusions designed to mimic reality also speed the painting process, allowing artists more time to design and complete complex large-scale works.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIndividual students of this method study a diverse selection of old masters, although many begin their studies with the [[High Renaissance]] (1490s\u20131527), [[Mannerist]] (1520\u20131580), [[Baroque]] (1600\u20131725), and [[Impressionist]] (1870s\u20131880s) painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Degas]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Rubens]], and [[Titian]]. However, because the emphasis is on creativity, it is often the design of the composition and the application and use of materials that is studied with less focus on reproducing a particular style or subject.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nStudents of these ateliers will therefore exhibit a wide range of personal styles and increasing amounts of creative experimentation. The result is a group whose art is highly individualized, with each student pursuing their own individual interests. There was great diversity at the atelier of [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]] (1846\u20131855).

Julius Kaplan characterised Bonnat as \"a liberal teacher who stressed simplicity in art above high academic finish, as well as overall effect rather than detail.\"<ref name=\"Bonnat\">{{cite book |first=Julius |last=Kaplan |contribution=Leon Bonnat |title=The Dictionary of Art |volume=IV |location=New York |publisher=Grove |year=1996 |isbn=9781884446009 |page=329}}</ref><ref name=\"Scandinavian\">{{cite web | last=Weisberg| first=Gabriel | title=Gabriel P.

It was produced by Saibal Banerjee of [[Magic Moments Motion Pictures]]. It starred [[Vikram Chatterjee]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/bengali/Vikram-to-star-in-new-TV-soap/articleshow/47676901.cms|title=Vikram to star in new TV soap|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> and Solanki Roy in lead roles, Sreetama Bhattacharya in a negative role, and [[Chandan Sen]] and [[Laboni Sarkar]] among others in supporting roles of pivotal characters. The show ended on May 28, 2017, after airing 712 episodes.\n\n== Plot summary==\n'''''Ichchenodi''''' is a unique story of sibling rivalry set within the premise of a [[love triangle]]. ''Ichhenodi'' basically revolves around a story of two sisters, Meghla and Adrija, and how they entangle themselves in a relationship with their love interest, Anurag.\n\nMeghla, who finds the essence of her life in music, is fond of her elder sister Adrija, and loves her above anyone else. The sisters get caught up in a love triangle making their life go upside down. Meghla is proud of her elder sister Adrija as she is a smart, beautiful girl, who is a topper as well when it comes to study. However, Adrija despises her since childhood and hates her after she comes to know that Meghla is not her own sister but adopted. Adrija begins to love Anurag madly but Anurag falls in love with the simple and docile Meghla, and her passion for music. Meghla refuses him and tries to convince him to marry Adrija but circumstances compel them to marry each other. Adrija creates many misunderstandings to destroy the marital life of Meghla and Anurag, but their love conquers every time. Adrija even goes to the extent of trying to kill Meghla on many occasions, but in vain. In frustration, she pushes Anurag from a cliff, who is then saved by Tua, also a passionate singer. Anurag loses his memory in the accident and is named \"Vikram\" by Tua and her family. Tua starts loving Vikram, without knowing his past. Adrija now gets married to Piklu, Anurag's cousin and enters his family to torture Meghla and makes her life hell by instigating Malobika against her, rendering Meghla responsible for Anurag's supposed death and portrays Meghla as a cheap and characterless girl in the eyes of the family members. A distraught and lonely Meghla finds solace in music and is pacified by her ''Guru Maa'', who turns out to be her own biological mother. She soon finds out that Anurag is alive and after many obstacles, they finally reunite (as Anurag's memory returns). Tua along with her aunt, Shariah then join forces with Adrija to separate Meghla from Anurag. They file a case against Anurag, accusing him of deceit and [[polygamy]], but they fail due to the intervention of Adv. Shubhalakshmi, an experienced lawyer. Meghla also helps her to mend her broken relationship with her estranged husband, Adv. Anweshan. Meghla, who now despises Adrija from the core, exposes all her crimes and gets her arrested. Shattered and ashamed of her deeds, Tua changes herself and becomes a loyal confidante to Meghla, despite Anurag's initial reluctance. Adrija flees from police custody and takes the alias of \"Mallika Dasgupta\" to hide herself from the public eye. Deep Dasgupta, husband of the real Mallika (who is now dead), promises to help Adrija without knowledge of her true intentions. Soon Meghla gets pregnant and everyone in the family become happy. But their happiness is short-lived as Adrija kills Meghla's unborn baby. A devastated Anurag blames Meghla for everything and asks for a separation. Meghla, unable to bear Anurag's indifference, files for divorce, and soon, their divorce happens. Meghla restarts her singing career, while Deep helps to get Adrija arrested. Anurag decides to move to [[U.S.A]]. and spends a night with Meghla before his departure. Meghla gets pregnant again but decides to tell nobody about her prospective baby.\n\n===2 Years Later===\nA widowed Malobika misses Anurag and Meghla's presence in the family. Mimi, Anurag's elder cousin sister, returns home, as she promised to Anurag to take over the responsibilities of the Banerjee family in his absence, and also becomes a strong emotional support to Meghla. Meghla, who is now a famous playback singer, raises her son (with Anurag), namely ''Roddur'' single-handedly. Adrija returns in Piklu's life after her release from jail and consequent, change in disposition. She soon becomes pregnant and transforms into a good-hearted person who cares for Piklu and his family. She restores love her towards Meghla and like others, also wants Meghla and Anurag's reunion. Anurag becomes a famous playback singer known as \"AB\" in order to get close to Meghla. Lastly, Mimi and Sanjoy, ''Pagla Ghora'' (Anurag's uncle) and Shabnam get married. Meghla and Anurag too finally reunite and take care of the family and ''Roddur'' together. Adrija and Piklu too have a baby girl; and everything ends well for the Banerjees!\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Image:Ichche Nodee.jpg|thumb|142px|Vikram Chatterjee, Solanki Roy and Aishwarya Sen as Anurag, Meghla and Tua on the title screen of Ichche Nodee]]\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Solanki Roy]] as Meghla Sen - Lead, an aspiring singer who is fond of her elder sister Adrija.

The show ended on May 28, 2017, after airing 712 episodes.\n\n== Plot summary==\n'''''Ichchenodi''''' is a unique story of sibling rivalry set within the premise of a [[love triangle]].''Ichhenodi'' basically revolves around a story of two sisters, Meghla and Adrija, and how they entangle themselves in a relationship with their love interest, Anurag. \nMeghla, who finds the essence of her life in music, is fond of her elder sister Adrija, and loves her above anyone else. The sisters get caught up in a love triangle making their life go upside down. Meghla is proud of her elder sister Adrija as she is a smart, beautiful girl, who is a topper as well when it comes to study. However, Adrija despises her since childhood and hates her after she comes to know that Meghla is not her own sister but adopted. Adrija begins to love Anurag madly but Anurag falls in love with the simple and docile Meghla, and her passion for music. Meghla refuses him and tries to convince him to marry Adrija but circumstances compel them to marry each other. Adrija creates many misunderstandings to destroy the marital life of Meghla and Anurag, but their love conquers every time. Adrija even goes to the extent of trying to kill Meghla on many occasions, but in vain. In frustration, she pushes Anurag from a cliff, who is then saved by Tua, also a passionate singer. Anurag loses his memory in the accident and is named \"Vikram\" by Tua and her family. Tua starts loving Vikram, without knowing his past. Adrija now gets married to Piklu, Anurag's cousin and enters his family to torture Meghla and makes her life hell by instigating Malobika against her, rendering Meghla responsible for Anurag's supposed death and portrays Meghla as a cheap and characterless girl in the eyes of the family members. A distraught and lonely Meghla finds solace in music and is pacified by her ''Guru Maa'', who turns out to be her own biological mother. She soon finds out that Anurag is alive and after many obstacles, they finally reunite (as Anurag's memory returns). Tua along with her aunt, Shariah then join forces with Adrija to separate Meghla from Anurag. They file a case against Anurag, accusing him of deceit and [[polygamy]], but they fail due to the intervention of Adv. Shubhalakshmi, an experienced lawyer. Meghla also helps her to mend her broken relationship with her estranged husband, Adv. Anweshan. Meghla, who now despises Adrija from the core, exposes all her crimes and gets her arrested. Shattered and ashamed of her deeds, Tua changes herself and becomes a loyal confidante to Meghla, despite Anurag's initial reluctance. Adrija flees from police custody and takes the alias of \"Mallika Dasgupta\" to hide herself from the public eye. Deep Dasgupta, husband of the real Mallika (who is now dead), promises to help Adrija without knowledge of her true intentions. Soon Meghla gets pregnant and everyone in the family become happy. But their happiness is short-lived as Adrija kills Meghla's unborn baby. A devastated Anurag blames Meghla for everything and asks for a separation. Meghla, unable to bear Anurag's indifference, files for divorce, and soon, their divorce happens. Meghla restarts her singing career, while Deep helps to get Adrija arrested. Anurag decides to move to [[U.S.A]]. and spends a night with Meghla before his departure. Meghla gets pregnant again but decides to tell nobody about her prospective baby.\n\n===2 Years Later===\nA widowed Malobika misses Anurag and Meghla's presence in the family. Mimi, Anurag's elder cousin sister, returns home, as she promised to Anurag to take over the responsibilities of the Banerjee family in his absence, and also becomes a strong emotional support to Meghla. Meghla, who is now a famous playback singer, raises her son (with Anurag), namely ''Roddur'' single-handedly. Adrija returns in Piklu's life after her release from jail and consequent, change in disposition. She soon becomes pregnant and transforms into a good-hearted person who cares for Piklu and his family. She restores love her towards Meghla and like others, also wants Meghla and Anurag's reunion. Anurag becomes a famous playback singer known as \"AB\" in order to get close to Meghla. Lastly, Mimi and Sanjoy, ''Pagla Ghora'' (Anurag's uncle) and Shabnam get married. Meghla and Anurag too finally reunite and take care of the family and ''Roddur'' together. Adrija and Piklu too have a baby girl; and everything ends well for the Banerjees!\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Image:Ichche Nodee.jpg|thumb|142px|Vikram Chatterjee, Solanki Roy and Aishwarya Sen as Anurag, Meghla and Tua on the title screen of Ichche Nodee]]\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Solanki Roy]] as Meghla Sen - Lead, an aspiring singer who is fond of her elder sister Adrija.

In this [[chemistry|water chemistry]] environment, dissolved [[minerals|mineral concentrations]], temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to [[precipitate]] many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.\n\nIt is estimated that, were the Strait closed even at today's higher sea level, most water in the [[Mediterranean basin]] would evaporate within only a thousand years, as it is believed to have done then,<ref name=\"mainarticle\"/> and such an event would lay down mineral deposits like the salt deposits now found under the sea floor all over the Mediterranean.\n\nAfter a lengthy period of restricted intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33 million years ago,<ref>At the [[Miocene]]/[[Pliocene]] boundary, c. 5.33 million years before the present</ref> the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the [[Zanclean flood]], and has remained open ever since.<ref>[[Preston Cloud|Cloud, P.]], ''Oasis in space.

In that year, the last Muslim government north of the Strait was overthrown by a Spanish force. Since that time, the Strait has come to foster the development of two very distinct and varied cultures on either side of it after sharing much the same culture for over 300 years from the 8th century to the early 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn the northern side, Christian-European culture has remained dominant since the expulsion of the last Muslim kingdom in 1492, along with the [[Romansh language|Romance]] [[Spanish language]], while on the southern side, Muslim-Arabic/Mediterranean has been dominant since the spread of Islam into North Africa in the 700s, along with the [[Arabic]] language. For the last 500 years, religious and cultural intolerance, more than the small travel barrier that the Strait presents, has come to act as a powerful enforcing agent of the cultural separation that exists between these two groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe small [[United Kingdom|British]] enclave of the city of [[Gibraltar]] presents a third cultural group found in the Strait. This enclave was first established in 1704 and has since been used by Britain to act as a surety for control of the sea lanes into and out of the Mediterranean.\n\nFollowing the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]] the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] tried to [[blockade]] the Strait of Gibraltar to hamper the transport of [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]] troops from [[Spanish Morocco]] to Peninsular Spain. On 5 August 1936 the so-called [[Convoy de la victoria]] was able to bring at least 2,500 men across the Strait, breaking the republican blockade.<ref name=\"Antony Beevor 1982 revised 2006\">{{cite book | title = The Battle for Spain | author = Antony Beevor | origyear = 1982| year = 2006 | publisher = Orion | isbn = 978-0-7538-2165-7| author-link = Antony Beevor }}</ref>\n\n==Communications==\n[[File:H\u00e9rcules3D.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|3-d rendering, looking eastwards towards the Mediterranean.]]\n\nThe Strait is an important [[shipping route]] from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Atlantic]].

This direct linkage creates certain unique flow and wave patterns. These unique patterns are created due to the interaction of various regional and global evaporative forces, tidal forces, and wind forces.\n\n===Inflow and outflow===\n[[File:InternalWaves Gibraltar ISS009-E-09952 54.jpg|thumb|The Strait of Gibraltar with the Mediterranean Sea in upper right. [[Internal wave]]s (marked with arrows) are caused by water flowing through the Strait (bottom left, top right).]]\n\nThrough the Strait, water generally flows more or less continually in both an eastward and a westward direction. A smaller amount of deeper saltier and therefore denser waters continually work their way westwards (the [[Mediterranean outflow]]), while a larger amount of surface waters with lower salinity and density continually work their way eastwards (the [[Mediterranean inflow]]). These general flow tendencies may be occasionally interrupted for brief periods by temporary tidal flows, depending on various lunar and solar alignments. Still, on the whole and over time, the balance of the water flow is eastwards, due to an evaporation rate within the Mediterranean basin higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} At the Strait's far western end is the [[Camarinal Sill]], the Strait's shallowest point which limits mixing between the cold, less saline Atlantic water and the warm Mediterranean waters.\n\nThe Mediterranean waters are so much saltier than the Atlantic waters that they sink below the constantly incoming water and form a highly saline (''[[Thermohaline circulation|thermohaline]]'', both warm and salty) layer of bottom water. This layer of bottom-water constantly works its way out into the Atlantic as the Mediterranean outflow. On the Atlantic side of the Strait, a density boundary separates the Mediterranean outflow waters from the rest at about {{convert|100|m|ft fathom|abbr=on}} depth. These waters flow out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until they begin to mix and equilibrate more rapidly, much further out at a depth of about {{convert|1000|m|ft fathom|abbr=on}}. The Mediterranean outflow water layer can be traced for thousands of kilometres west of the Strait, before completely losing its identity.\n\n[[File:Camarinal Still Water Mixing (Simplified).jpg|thumb|left|Simplifed and stylized diagram of currents at the Camarinal Sill]]\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], German [[U-boats]] used the currents to pass into the Mediterranean Sea without detection, by maintaining silence with engines off.<ref>Paterson, Lawrence. ''U-Boats in the Mediterranean 1941\u20131944''. Chatham Publishing, 2007, pp. 19 and 182. {{ISBN|9781861762900}}</ref>  From September 1941 to May 1944 Germany managed to send 62 U-boats into the Mediterranean. All these boats had to navigate the British-controlled Strait of Gibraltar where nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and 10 more had to break off their run due to damage. No U-boats ever made it back into the Atlantic and all were either sunk in battle or scuttled by their own crews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/ops/mediterranean.htm |title=U-boat war in the Mediterranean |publisher=uboat.net |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref>\n\n===Internal waves===\n[[Internal wave]]s (waves at the density boundary layer) are often produced by the Strait. Like traffic merging on a highway, the water flow is constricted in both directions because it must pass over the Camarinal Sill. When large tidal flows enter the Strait and the high tide relaxes, internal waves are generated at the Camarinal Sill and proceed eastwards. Even though the waves may occur down to great depths, occasionally the waves are almost imperceptible at the surface, at other times they can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. These ''internal waves'' continue to flow eastward and to refract around coastal features. They can sometimes be traced for as much as {{convert|100|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}}, and sometimes create [[interference (wave propagation)|interference patterns]] with refracted waves.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wesson |first=J.

The [[United Kingdom]] claims {{convert|5.6|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} around Gibraltar on the northern side of the Strait, putting part of it inside British territorial waters.

In that year, the last Muslim government north of the Strait was overthrown by a Spanish force. Since that time, the Strait has come to foster the development of two very distinct and varied cultures on either side of it after sharing much the same culture for over 300 years from the 8th century to the early 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn the northern side, Christian-European culture has remained dominant since the expulsion of the last Muslim kingdom in 1492, along with the [[Romansh language|Romance]] [[Spanish language]], while on the southern side, Muslim-Arabic/Mediterranean has been dominant since the spread of Islam into North Africa in the 700s, along with the [[Arabic]] language. For the last 500 years, religious and cultural intolerance, more than the small travel barrier that the Strait presents, has come to act as a powerful enforcing agent of the cultural separation that exists between these two groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe small [[United Kingdom|British]] enclave of the city of [[Gibraltar]] presents a third cultural group found in the Strait. This enclave was first established in 1704 and has since been used by Britain to act as a surety for control of the sea lanes into and out of the Mediterranean.\n\nFollowing the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]] the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] tried to [[blockade]] the Strait of Gibraltar to hamper the transport of [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]] troops from [[Spanish Morocco]] to Peninsular Spain. On 5 August 1936 the so-called [[Convoy de la victoria]] was able to bring at least 2,500 men across the Strait, breaking the republican blockade.<ref name=\"Antony Beevor 1982 revised 2006\">{{cite book | title = The Battle for Spain | author = Antony Beevor | origyear = 1982| year = 2006 | publisher = Orion | isbn = 978-0-7538-2165-7| author-link = Antony Beevor }}</ref>\n\n==Communications==\n[[File:H\u00e9rcules3D.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|3-d rendering, looking eastwards towards the Mediterranean.]]\n\nThe Strait is an important [[shipping route]] from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Atlantic]].

This direct linkage creates certain unique flow and wave patterns. These unique patterns are created due to the interaction of various regional and global evaporative forces, tidal forces, and wind forces.\n\n===Inflow and outflow===\n[[File:InternalWaves Gibraltar ISS009-E-09952 54.jpg|thumb|The Strait of Gibraltar with the Mediterranean Sea in upper right. [[Internal wave]]s (marked with arrows) are caused by water flowing through the Strait (bottom left, top right).]]\n\nThrough the Strait, water generally flows more or less continually in both an eastward and a westward direction. A smaller amount of deeper saltier and therefore denser waters continually work their way westwards (the [[Mediterranean outflow]]), while a larger amount of surface waters with lower salinity and density continually work their way eastwards (the [[Mediterranean inflow]]). These general flow tendencies may be occasionally interrupted for brief periods by temporary tidal flows, depending on various lunar and solar alignments. Still, on the whole and over time, the balance of the water flow is eastwards, due to an evaporation rate within the Mediterranean basin higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} At the Strait's far western end is the [[Camarinal Sill]], the Strait's shallowest point which limits mixing between the cold, less saline Atlantic water and the warm Mediterranean waters.\n\nThe Mediterranean waters are so much saltier than the Atlantic waters that they sink below the constantly incoming water and form a highly saline (''[[Thermohaline circulation|thermohaline]]'', both warm and salty) layer of bottom water. This layer of bottom-water constantly works its way out into the Atlantic as the Mediterranean outflow. On the Atlantic side of the Strait, a density boundary separates the Mediterranean outflow waters from the rest at about {{convert|100|m|ft fathom|abbr=on}} depth. These waters flow out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until they begin to mix and equilibrate more rapidly, much further out at a depth of about {{convert|1000|m|ft fathom|abbr=on}}. The Mediterranean outflow water layer can be traced for thousands of kilometres west of the Strait, before completely losing its identity.\n\n[[File:Camarinal Still Water Mixing (Simplified).jpg|thumb|left|Simplifed and stylized diagram of currents at the Camarinal Sill]]\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], German [[U-boats]] used the currents to pass into the Mediterranean Sea without detection, by maintaining silence with engines off.<ref>Paterson, Lawrence.

Chatham Publishing, 2007, pp. 19 and 182. {{ISBN|9781861762900}}</ref>  From September 1941 to May 1944 Germany managed to send 62 U-boats into the Mediterranean. All these boats had to navigate the British-controlled Strait of Gibraltar where nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and 10 more had to break off their run due to damage. No U-boats ever made it back into the Atlantic and all were either sunk in battle or scuttled by their own crews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/ops/mediterranean.htm |title=U-boat war in the Mediterranean |publisher=uboat.net |accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref>\n\n===Internal waves===\n[[Internal wave]]s (waves at the density boundary layer) are often produced by the Strait. Like traffic merging on a highway, the water flow is constricted in both directions because it must pass over the Camarinal Sill. When large tidal flows enter the Strait and the high tide relaxes, internal waves are generated at the Camarinal Sill and proceed eastwards. Even though the waves may occur down to great depths, occasionally the waves are almost imperceptible at the surface, at other times they can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. These ''internal waves'' continue to flow eastward and to refract around coastal features. They can sometimes be traced for as much as {{convert|100|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}}, and sometimes create [[interference (wave propagation)|interference patterns]] with refracted waves.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wesson |first=J.
