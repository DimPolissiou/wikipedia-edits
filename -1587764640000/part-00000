In 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Shapley\u2013Curtis debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber D. Curtis]] over this issue. Shapley argued for a small universe the size of the [[Milky Way galaxy]] and Curtis argued that the universe was much larger. The issue was resolved in the coming decade with Hubble's improved observations.\n\n===Cepheid variable stars outside of the Milky Way===\nEdwin Hubble did most of his professional astronomical observing work at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], home to the world's most powerful telescope at the time. His observations of [[Cepheid variable]] stars in \u201c''spiral [[nebula]]e''\u201d enabled him to calculate the distances to these objects. Surprisingly, these objects were discovered to be at distances which placed them well outside the [[Milky Way]].

In reality we determine, say, a supernova brightness, which provides information about its distance, and the redshift ''z'' = \u2206''\u03bb''/''\u03bb'' of its spectrum of radiation. Hubble correlated brightness and parameter ''z''.\n\nCombining his measurements of galaxy distances with [[Vesto Slipher]] and [[Milton Humason]]'s measurements of the [[redshifts]] associated with the galaxies, Hubble discovered a rough proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance. Though there was considerable [[variance|scatter]] (now known to be caused by [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]]\u2014the 'Hubble flow' is used to refer to the region of space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities), Hubble was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value for the Hubble constant of 500&nbsp;km/s/Mpc (much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in his distance calibrations). (See [[cosmic distance ladder]] for details.)\n\nAt the time of discovery and development of Hubble's law, it was acceptable to explain redshift phenomenon as a [[Doppler shift]] in the context of special relativity, and use the Doppler formula to associate redshift ''z'' with velocity. Today, in the context of general relativity, velocity between distant objects depends on the choice of coordinates used, and therefore, the redshift can be equally described as a Doppler shift or a cosmological shift (or gravitational) due to the expanding space, or some combination of the two.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Bunn |first=E.

This value is the same throughout the universe for a given [[comoving time#Comoving coordinates|comoving time]].\n* <math>D</math> is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the [[comoving distance]], which is constant) from the [[galaxy]] to the observer, measured in [[mega-|mega]] [[parsec]]s (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given [[cosmological time]]. (Recession velocity is just ''v'' = ''dD/dt'').\n\nHubble's law is considered a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance. However, the relation between recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts.\n\nFor distances ''D'' larger than the radius of the [[Hubble sphere]] ''r''<sub>HS</sub>&nbsp;, objects recede at a rate faster than the [[speed of light]] (''See'' [[Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance|Uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion of the significance of this):\n\n:<math>r_{HS} = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\ . </math>\n\nSince the Hubble \"constant\" is a constant only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates the value of the Hubble constant today.<ref name=Keel/> Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (''see'' [[Accelerating universe]]), meaning that, for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some ''fixed'' distance D and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|website=Ask an Astronomer at Cornell University|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031123150109/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|archivedate=23 November 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Redshift velocity and recessional velocity===\n[[Redshift]] can be measured by determining the wavelength of a known transition, such as hydrogen \u03b1-lines for distant quasars, and finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference.

The \"redshift velocity\" ''v<sub>rs</sub>'' is not so simply related to real velocity at larger velocities, however, and this terminology leads to confusion if interpreted as a real velocity. Next, the connection between redshift or redshift velocity and recessional velocity is discussed. This discussion is based on Sartori.<ref name=L_Sartori>{{cite book|last=Sartori |first=L. |date=1996 |title=Understanding Relativity |pages=304\u2013305 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-20029-6\n}}</ref>\n\n====Recessional velocity====\n\nSuppose ''R(t)'' is called the ''[[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]]'' of the universe, and increases as the universe expands in a manner that depends upon the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]] selected. Its meaning is that all measured proper distances ''D(t)'' between co-moving points increase proportionally to ''R''. (The co-moving points are not moving relative to each other except as a result of the expansion of space.) In other words:\n\n:<math>\\frac {D(t)}{D(t_0)} = \\frac{R(t)}{R(t_0)},</math> <ref>\"Introduction to Cosmology\", Matts Roos</ref>\n\nwhere ''t''<sub>0</sub> is some reference time. If light is emitted from a galaxy at time ''t<sub>e</sub>'' and received by us at ''t''<sub>0</sub>, it is redshifted due to the expansion of space, and this redshift ''z'' is simply:\n\n:<math>z = \\frac {R(t_0)}{R(t_e)} - 1. </math>\n\nSuppose a galaxy is at distance ''D'', and this distance changes with time at a rate ''d<sub>t</sub>D''. We call this rate of recession the \"recession velocity\" ''v<sub>r</sub>'':\n\n:<math>v_r = d_tD = \\frac {d_tR}{R} D. </math>\n\nWe now define the Hubble constant as\n\n:<math>H \\equiv \\frac{d_tR}{R}, </math>\n\nand discover the Hubble law:\n\n:<math> v_r = H D. </math>\n\nFrom this perspective, Hubble's law is a fundamental relation between (i) the recessional velocity contributed by the expansion of space and (ii) the distance to an object; the connection between redshift and distance is a crutch used to connect Hubble's law with observations. This law can be related to redshift ''z'' approximately by making a [[Taylor series]] expansion:\n\n:<math> z = \\frac {R(t_0)}{R(t_e)} - 1 \\approx \\frac {R(t_0)} {R(t_0)\\left(1+(t_e-t_0)H(t_0)\\right)}-1 \\approx (t_0-t_e)H(t_0), </math>\n\nIf the distance is not too large, all other complications of the model become small corrections and the time interval is simply the distance divided by the speed of light:\n\n:<math> z \\approx (t_0-t_e)H(t_0) \\approx \\frac {D}{c} H(t_0), </math>\n\nor\n\n:<math> cz \\approx D H(t_0) = v_r. </math>\n\nAccording to this approach, the relation ''cz'' = ''v<sub>r</sub>'' is an approximation valid at low redshifts, to be replaced by a relation at large redshifts that is model-dependent. See [[#redshift|velocity-redshift figure]].\n\n===Observability of parameters===\nStrictly speaking, neither ''v'' nor ''D'' in the formula are directly observable, because they are properties ''now'' of a galaxy, whereas our observations refer to the galaxy in the past, at the time that the light we currently see left it.\n\nFor relatively nearby galaxies ([[redshift]] ''z'' much less than unity), ''v'' and ''D'' will not have changed much, and ''v'' can be estimated using the formula <math>v = zc</math> where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This gives the empirical relation found by Hubble.\n\nFor distant galaxies, ''v'' (or ''D'') cannot be calculated from ''z'' without specifying a detailed model for how ''H'' changes with time. The redshift is not even directly related to the recession velocity at the time the light set out, but it does have a simple interpretation: ''(1+z)'' is the factor by which the universe has expanded while the photon was travelling towards the observer.\n\n===Expansion velocity vs. relative velocity===\nIn using Hubble's law to determine distances, only the velocity due to the expansion of the universe can be used. Since gravitationally interacting galaxies move relative to each other independent of the expansion of the universe,<ref name=\"AM-20170818\">{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}</ref> these relative velocities, called [[Peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]], need to be accounted for in the application of Hubble's law.\n\nThe [[Redshift-space distortions|Finger of God]] effect is one result of this phenomenon. In [[Virial theorem|systems that are gravitationally bound]], such as galaxies or our planetary system, the expansion of space is a much weaker effect than the attractive force of gravity.\n\n=== Time-dependence of Hubble parameter ===\n\nThe parameter <math>H</math> is commonly called the \u201c''Hubble constant''\u201d, but that is a misnomer since it is constant in space only at a fixed time; it varies with time in nearly all cosmological models, and all observations of far distant objects are also observations into the distant past, when the \u201cconstant\u201d had a different value. The \u201c''Hubble parameter''\u201d is a more correct term, with <math>H_0 </math> denoting the present-day value.\n\nAnother common source of confusion is that the [[accelerating universe]] does ''not'' imply that the Hubble parameter is actually increasing with time; since <math> H(t) \\equiv \\dot{a}(t)/a(t) </math>, in most accelerating models <math>a</math> increases relatively faster than <math>\\dot{a}</math>, so H decreases with time. (The recession velocity of one chosen galaxy does increase, but different galaxies passing a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.)\n\nOn defining the dimensionless [[deceleration parameter]] \n:<math>  q \\equiv - \\frac {\\ddot{a}\\, a} {\\dot{a}^2} </math>, it follows that \n:<math> \\frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2 (1+q) </math>\n\nFrom this it is seen that the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, unless <math> q < -1 </math>; the latter can only occur if the universe contains [[phantom energy]], regarded as theoretically somewhat improbable.\n\nHowever, in the standard [[Lambda-CDM]] model, <math> q </math> will tend to &minus;1 from above in the distant future as the cosmological constant becomes increasingly dominant over matter; this implies that <math> H </math> will approach from above to a constant value of <math> \\approx 57 </math> km/s/Mpc, and the scale factor of the universe will then grow exponentially in time.\n\n===Idealized Hubble's law===\nThe mathematical derivation of an idealized Hubble's law for a uniformly expanding universe is a fairly elementary theorem of geometry in 3-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]]/Newtonian coordinate space, which, considered as a [[metric space]], is entirely [[Cosmological principle|homogeneous and isotropic]] (properties do not vary with location or direction). Simply stated the theorem is this:\n{{bquote|Any two points which are moving away from the origin, each along straight lines and with speed proportional to distance from the origin, will be moving away from each other with a speed proportional to their distance apart.}}\n\nIn fact this applies to non-Cartesian spaces as long as they are locally homogeneous and isotropic; specifically to the negatively and positively curved spaces frequently considered as cosmological models (see [[shape of the universe]]).\n\nAn observation stemming from this theorem is that seeing objects recede from us on Earth is not an indication that Earth is near to a center from which the expansion is occurring, but rather that ''every'' observer in an expanding universe will see objects receding from them.\n\n===Ultimate fate and age of the universe===\n[[Image:Friedmann universes.svg|thumb|400px|The [[age of the universe|age]] and [[ultimate fate of the universe]] can be determined by measuring the Hubble constant today and extrapolating with the observed value of the deceleration parameter, uniquely characterized by values of density parameters (\u03a9<sub>M</sub> for [[matter]] and \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> for [[dark energy]]). A \"closed universe\" with \u03a9<sub>M</sub> > 1 and \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> = 0 comes to an end in a [[Big Crunch]] and is considerably younger than its Hubble age. An \"open universe\" with \u03a9<sub>M</sub> \u2264 1 and \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> = 0 expands forever and has an age that is closer to its Hubble age. For the [[accelerating universe]] with nonzero \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> that we inhabit, the age of the universe is coincidentally very close to the Hubble age.]]\n\nThe value of the Hubble parameter changes over time, either increasing or decreasing depending on the value of the so-called [[deceleration parameter]] <math>q</math>, which is defined by\n\n:<math>q = -\\left(1+\\frac{\\dot H}{H^2}\\right).</math>\n\nIn a universe with a deceleration parameter equal to zero, it follows that ''H'' = 1/''t'', where ''t'' is the time since the Big Bang. A non-zero, time-dependent value of <math>q</math> simply requires [[integral|integration]] of the Friedmann equations backwards from the present time to the time when the [[particle horizon|comoving horizon]] size was zero.\n\nIt was long thought that ''q'' was positive, indicating that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction. This would imply an age of the universe less than 1/''H'' (which is about 14 billion years). For instance, a value for ''q'' of 1/2 (once favoured by most theorists) would give the age of the universe as 2/(3''H''). The discovery in 1998 that ''q'' is apparently negative means that the universe could actually be older than 1/''H''. However, estimates of the [[age of the universe]] are very close to 1/''H''.\n\n===Olbers' paradox===\n{{Main|Olbers' paradox}}\nThe expansion of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble's law is relevant to the old conundrum known as [[Olbers' paradox]]: If the universe were [[Infinity|infinite]] in size, [[static universe|static]], and filled with a uniform distribution of [[star]]s, then every line of sight in the sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as [[brightness|bright]] as the surface of a star.

Additionally, in an expanding universe, distant objects [[recessional velocity|recede]] from us, which causes the light emanated from them to be [[redshift]]ed and diminished in brightness by the time we see it.<ref name=Chase_etal_2004/><ref name=Asimov1974/>\n\n===Dimensionless Hubble parameter===\nInstead of working with Hubble's constant, a common practice is to introduce the '''dimensionless Hubble parameter''', usually denoted by ''h'', and to write the Hubble's parameter ''H''<sub>0</sub> as ''h''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;100&nbsp;km&nbsp;[[second|s]]<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;[[Parsec|Mpc]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, all the relative uncertainty of the true value of ''H''<sub>0</sub> being then relegated to ''h''.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Peebles |first=P.

We can also define (see [[density parameter]] for <math>\\Omega_m</math>)\n\n:<math>\\rho_c = \\frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \\pi G};</math>\n\n:<math>\\Omega_m \\equiv \\frac{\\rho_{m_{0}}}{\\rho_c} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{3 H_0^2}\\rho_{m_{0}};</math>\n\ntherefore:\n\n:<math>\\rho=\\frac{\\rho_c \\Omega_m}{a^3}.</math>\n\nAlso, by definition,\n\n:<math>\\Omega_k \\equiv \\frac{-kc^2}{(a_0H_0)^2}</math>\n:<math>\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\equiv \\frac{\\Lambda c^2}{3H_0^2},</math>\n\nwhere the subscript nought refers to the values today, and <math>a_0=1</math>.

So now:\n\n:<math>\\rho = \\rho_m (a)+\\rho_{de}(a),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho_{de}</math> is the mass density of the dark energy. By definition, an equation of state in cosmology is <math>P=w\\rho c^2</math>, and if this is substituted into the fluid equation, which describes how the mass density of the universe evolves with time, then\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\rho}+3\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\left(\\rho+\\frac{P}{c^2}\\right)=0;</math>\n:<math>\\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}=-3\\frac{da}{a}(1+w).</math>\n\nIf ''w'' is constant, then\n\n:<math>\\ln{\\rho}=-3(1+w)\\ln{a};</math>\n\nimplying:\n\n:<math>\\rho=a^{-3(1+w)}.</math>\n\nTherefore, for dark energy with a constant equation of state ''w'', <math>\\rho_{de}(a)= \\rho_{de0}a^{-3(1+w)}</math>.

The Hubble time is the age it would have had if the expansion had been linear, and it is different from the real age of the universe because the expansion is not linear; they are related by a dimensionless factor which depends on the mass-energy content of the universe, which is around 0.96 in the standard [[Lambda-CDM model]].\n\nWe currently appear to be approaching a period where the expansion of the universe is exponential due to the increasing dominance of [[vacuum energy]]. In this regime, the Hubble parameter is constant, and the universe grows by a factor [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']] each Hubble time:\n\n:<math>H \\equiv \\frac{\\dot a}{a} = \\textrm{constant} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad a \\propto e^{Ht} = e^{\\frac{t}{t_H}}</math>\n\nLikewise, the generally accepted value of 2.27 [[Exa|Es]]<sup>\u22121</sup> means that (at the current rate) the universe would grow by a factor of <math>e^{2.27}</math> in one [[exa]]second.\n\nOver long periods of time, the dynamics are complicated by [[general relativity]], [[dark energy]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], etc., as explained above.\n\n===Hubble length===\nThe Hubble length or Hubble distance is a unit of distance in cosmology, defined as <math>cH_0^{-1}</math> \u2014 the speed of light multiplied by the Hubble time. It is equivalent to 4,550 million parsecs or 14.4 billion light years. (The numerical value of the Hubble length in light years is, by definition, equal to that of the Hubble time in years.) The Hubble distance would be the distance between the Earth and the galaxies which are ''currently'' receding from us at the speed of light, as can be seen by substituting <math>D=cH_0^{-1}</math> into the equation for Hubble's law, {{nowrap|''v'' {{=}} ''H''<sub>0</sub>''D''}}.\n\n===Hubble volume===\n{{main|Hubble volume}}\nThe Hubble volume is sometimes defined as a volume of the universe with a [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving]] size of <math>cH_0^{-1}.</math> The exact definition varies: it is sometimes defined as the volume of a sphere with radius <math>cH_0^{-1},</math> or alternatively, a cube of side <math>cH_0^{-1}.</math> Some cosmologists even use the term Hubble volume to refer to the volume of the [[observable universe]], although this has a radius approximately three times larger.\n\n== Measured values of the Hubble constant==\nMultiple methods have been used to determine the Hubble constant.  \"Late universe\" measurements using calibrated distance ladder techniques have converged on a value of approximately {{val|73|u=km/s/Mpc}}.  Since 2000, \"early universe\" techniques based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background have become available, and these agree on a value near  {{val|67.7|u=km/s/Mpc}}.  (This is accounting for the change in the expansion rate since the early universe, so is comparable to the first number.)  As techniques have improved, the estimated [[Measurement uncertainty|measurement uncertainties]] have shrunk, but the range of measured values has not, to the point that the disagreement is now [[statistically significant]].

This idea of an expanding spacetime would eventually lead to the [[Big Bang]] and [[Steady State Theory|Steady State]] theories of cosmology.\n\n===Lema\u00eetre's equation===\nIn 1927, two years before Hubble published his own article, the Belgian priest and astronomer [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] was the first to publish research deriving what is now known as Hubble's law. According to the Canadian astronomer [[Sidney van den Bergh]], \"The 1927 discovery of the expansion of the universe by Lema\u00eetre was published in French in a low-impact journal.

In 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Shapley\u2013Curtis debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber D. Curtis]] over this issue. Shapley argued for a small universe the size of the [[Milky Way galaxy]] and Curtis argued that the universe was much larger. The issue was resolved in the coming decade with Hubble's improved observations.\n\n===Cepheid variable stars outside of the Milky Way===\nEdwin Hubble did most of his professional astronomical observing work at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], home to the world's most powerful telescope at the time. His observations of [[Cepheid variable]] stars in \u201c''spiral [[nebula]]e''\u201d enabled him to calculate the distances to these objects. Surprisingly, these objects were discovered to be at distances which placed them well outside the [[Milky Way]]. They continued to be called \u201cnebulae\u201d and it was only gradually that the term \u201cgalaxies\u201d replaced it.\n\n===Combining redshifts with distance measurements===\n\n[[File:Hubble constant.JPG|thumb |250px |Fit of [[#Redshift velocity|redshift velocities]] to Hubble's law.<ref name=Keel>{{cite book\n |last=Keel |first=W.

In reality we determine, say, a supernova brightness, which provides information about its distance, and the redshift ''z'' = \u2206''\u03bb''/''\u03bb'' of its spectrum of radiation. Hubble correlated brightness and parameter ''z''.\n\nCombining his measurements of galaxy distances with [[Vesto Slipher]] and [[Milton Humason]]'s measurements of the [[redshifts]] associated with the galaxies, Hubble discovered a rough proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance. Though there was considerable [[variance|scatter]] (now known to be caused by [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]]\u2014the 'Hubble flow' is used to refer to the region of space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities), Hubble was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value for the Hubble constant of 500&nbsp;km/s/Mpc (much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in his distance calibrations). (See [[cosmic distance ladder]] for details.)\n\nAt the time of discovery and development of Hubble's law, it was acceptable to explain redshift phenomenon as a [[Doppler shift]] in the context of special relativity, and use the Doppler formula to associate redshift ''z'' with velocity. Today, in the context of general relativity, velocity between distant objects depends on the choice of coordinates used, and therefore, the redshift can be equally described as a Doppler shift or a cosmological shift (or gravitational) due to the expanding space, or some combination of the two.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Bunn |first=E.

This value is the same throughout the universe for a given [[comoving time#Comoving coordinates|comoving time]].\n* <math>D</math> is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the [[comoving distance]], which is constant) from the [[galaxy]] to the observer, measured in [[mega-|mega]] [[parsec]]s (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given [[cosmological time]]. (Recession velocity is just ''v'' = ''dD/dt'').\n\nHubble's law is considered a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance. However, the relation between recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted and is not established except for small redshifts.\n\nFor distances ''D'' larger than the radius of the [[Hubble sphere]] ''r''<sub>HS</sub>&nbsp;, objects recede at a rate faster than the [[speed of light]] (''See'' [[Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance|Uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion of the significance of this):\n\n:<math>r_{HS} = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\ . </math>\n\nSince the Hubble \"constant\" is a constant only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates the value of the Hubble constant today.<ref name=Keel/> Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (''see'' [[Accelerating universe]]), meaning that, for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some ''fixed'' distance D and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|website=Ask an Astronomer at Cornell University|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031123150109/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|archivedate=23 November 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Redshift velocity and recessional velocity===\n[[Redshift]] can be measured by determining the wavelength of a known transition, such as hydrogen \u03b1-lines for distant quasars, and finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference.

Next, the connection between redshift or redshift velocity and recessional velocity is discussed. This discussion is based on Sartori.<ref name=L_Sartori>{{cite book|last=Sartori |first=L. |date=1996 |title=Understanding Relativity |pages=304\u2013305 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-20029-6\n}}</ref>\n\n====Recessional velocity====\n\nSuppose ''R(t)'' is called the ''[[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]]'' of the universe, and increases as the universe expands in a manner that depends upon the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]] selected. Its meaning is that all measured proper distances ''D(t)'' between co-moving points increase proportionally to ''R''. (The co-moving points are not moving relative to each other except as a result of the expansion of space.) In other words:\n\n:<math>\\frac {D(t)}{D(t_0)} = \\frac{R(t)}{R(t_0)},</math> <ref>\"Introduction to Cosmology\", Matts Roos</ref>\n\nwhere ''t''<sub>0</sub> is some reference time. If light is emitted from a galaxy at time ''t<sub>e</sub>'' and received by us at ''t''<sub>0</sub>, it is redshifted due to the expansion of space, and this redshift ''z'' is simply:\n\n:<math>z = \\frac {R(t_0)}{R(t_e)} - 1. </math>\n\nSuppose a galaxy is at distance ''D'', and this distance changes with time at a rate ''d<sub>t</sub>D''. We call this rate of recession the \"recession velocity\" ''v<sub>r</sub>'':\n\n:<math>v_r = d_tD = \\frac {d_tR}{R} D. </math>\n\nWe now define the Hubble constant as\n\n:<math>H \\equiv \\frac{d_tR}{R}, </math>\n\nand discover the Hubble law:\n\n:<math> v_r = H D. </math>\n\nFrom this perspective, Hubble's law is a fundamental relation between (i) the recessional velocity contributed by the expansion of space and (ii) the distance to an object; the connection between redshift and distance is a crutch used to connect Hubble's law with observations. This law can be related to redshift ''z'' approximately by making a [[Taylor series]] expansion:\n\n:<math> z = \\frac {R(t_0)}{R(t_e)} - 1 \\approx \\frac {R(t_0)} {R(t_0)\\left(1+(t_e-t_0)H(t_0)\\right)}-1 \\approx (t_0-t_e)H(t_0), </math>\n\nIf the distance is not too large, all other complications of the model become small corrections and the time interval is simply the distance divided by the speed of light:\n\n:<math> z \\approx (t_0-t_e)H(t_0) \\approx \\frac {D}{c} H(t_0), </math>\n\nor\n\n:<math> cz \\approx D H(t_0) = v_r. </math>\n\nAccording to this approach, the relation ''cz'' = ''v<sub>r</sub>'' is an approximation valid at low redshifts, to be replaced by a relation at large redshifts that is model-dependent. See [[#redshift|velocity-redshift figure]].\n\n===Observability of parameters===\nStrictly speaking, neither ''v'' nor ''D'' in the formula are directly observable, because they are properties ''now'' of a galaxy, whereas our observations refer to the galaxy in the past, at the time that the light we currently see left it.\n\nFor relatively nearby galaxies ([[redshift]] ''z'' much less than unity), ''v'' and ''D'' will not have changed much, and ''v'' can be estimated using the formula <math>v = zc</math> where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This gives the empirical relation found by Hubble.\n\nFor distant galaxies, ''v'' (or ''D'') cannot be calculated from ''z'' without specifying a detailed model for how ''H'' changes with time. The redshift is not even directly related to the recession velocity at the time the light set out, but it does have a simple interpretation: ''(1+z)'' is the factor by which the universe has expanded while the photon was travelling towards the observer.\n\n===Expansion velocity vs. relative velocity===\nIn using Hubble's law to determine distances, only the velocity due to the expansion of the universe can be used. Since gravitationally interacting galaxies move relative to each other independent of the expansion of the universe,<ref name=\"AM-20170818\">{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}</ref> these relative velocities, called [[Peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]], need to be accounted for in the application of Hubble's law.\n\nThe [[Redshift-space distortions|Finger of God]] effect is one result of this phenomenon. In [[Virial theorem|systems that are gravitationally bound]], such as galaxies or our planetary system, the expansion of space is a much weaker effect than the attractive force of gravity.\n\n=== Time-dependence of Hubble parameter ===\n\nThe parameter <math>H</math> is commonly called the \u201c''Hubble constant''\u201d, but that is a misnomer since it is constant in space only at a fixed time; it varies with time in nearly all cosmological models, and all observations of far distant objects are also observations into the distant past, when the \u201cconstant\u201d had a different value. The \u201c''Hubble parameter''\u201d is a more correct term, with <math>H_0 </math> denoting the present-day value.\n\nAnother common source of confusion is that the [[accelerating universe]] does ''not'' imply that the Hubble parameter is actually increasing with time; since <math> H(t) \\equiv \\dot{a}(t)/a(t) </math>, in most accelerating models <math>a</math> increases relatively faster than <math>\\dot{a}</math>, so H decreases with time. (The recession velocity of one chosen galaxy does increase, but different galaxies passing a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.)\n\nOn defining the dimensionless [[deceleration parameter]] \n:<math>  q \\equiv - \\frac {\\ddot{a}\\, a} {\\dot{a}^2} </math>, it follows that \n:<math> \\frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2 (1+q) </math>\n\nFrom this it is seen that the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, unless <math> q < -1 </math>; the latter can only occur if the universe contains [[phantom energy]], regarded as theoretically somewhat improbable.\n\nHowever, in the standard [[Lambda-CDM]] model, <math> q </math> will tend to &minus;1 from above in the distant future as the cosmological constant becomes increasingly dominant over matter; this implies that <math> H </math> will approach from above to a constant value of <math> \\approx 57 </math> km/s/Mpc, and the scale factor of the universe will then grow exponentially in time.\n\n===Idealized Hubble's law===\nThe mathematical derivation of an idealized Hubble's law for a uniformly expanding universe is a fairly elementary theorem of geometry in 3-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]]/Newtonian coordinate space, which, considered as a [[metric space]], is entirely [[Cosmological principle|homogeneous and isotropic]] (properties do not vary with location or direction). Simply stated the theorem is this:\n{{bquote|Any two points which are moving away from the origin, each along straight lines and with speed proportional to distance from the origin, will be moving away from each other with a speed proportional to their distance apart.}}\n\nIn fact this applies to non-Cartesian spaces as long as they are locally homogeneous and isotropic; specifically to the negatively and positively curved spaces frequently considered as cosmological models (see [[shape of the universe]]).\n\nAn observation stemming from this theorem is that seeing objects recede from us on Earth is not an indication that Earth is near to a center from which the expansion is occurring, but rather that ''every'' observer in an expanding universe will see objects receding from them.\n\n===Ultimate fate and age of the universe===\n[[Image:Friedmann universes.svg|thumb|400px|The [[age of the universe|age]] and [[ultimate fate of the universe]] can be determined by measuring the Hubble constant today and extrapolating with the observed value of the deceleration parameter, uniquely characterized by values of density parameters (\u03a9<sub>M</sub> for [[matter]] and \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> for [[dark energy]]). A \"closed universe\" with \u03a9<sub>M</sub> > 1 and \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> = 0 comes to an end in a [[Big Crunch]] and is considerably younger than its Hubble age. An \"open universe\" with \u03a9<sub>M</sub> \u2264 1 and \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> = 0 expands forever and has an age that is closer to its Hubble age. For the [[accelerating universe]] with nonzero \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> that we inhabit, the age of the universe is coincidentally very close to the Hubble age.]]\n\nThe value of the Hubble parameter changes over time, either increasing or decreasing depending on the value of the so-called [[deceleration parameter]] <math>q</math>, which is defined by\n\n:<math>q = -\\left(1+\\frac{\\dot H}{H^2}\\right).</math>\n\nIn a universe with a deceleration parameter equal to zero, it follows that ''H'' = 1/''t'', where ''t'' is the time since the Big Bang. A non-zero, time-dependent value of <math>q</math> simply requires [[integral|integration]] of the Friedmann equations backwards from the present time to the time when the [[particle horizon|comoving horizon]] size was zero.\n\nIt was long thought that ''q'' was positive, indicating that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction. This would imply an age of the universe less than 1/''H'' (which is about 14 billion years). For instance, a value for ''q'' of 1/2 (once favoured by most theorists) would give the age of the universe as 2/(3''H''). The discovery in 1998 that ''q'' is apparently negative means that the universe could actually be older than 1/''H''. However, estimates of the [[age of the universe]] are very close to 1/''H''.\n\n===Olbers' paradox===\n{{Main|Olbers' paradox}}\nThe expansion of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble's law is relevant to the old conundrum known as [[Olbers' paradox]]: If the universe were [[Infinity|infinite]] in size, [[static universe|static]], and filled with a uniform distribution of [[star]]s, then every line of sight in the sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as [[brightness|bright]] as the surface of a star.

The Hubble distance would be the distance between the Earth and the galaxies which are ''currently'' receding from us at the speed of light, as can be seen by substituting <math>D=cH_0^{-1}</math> into the equation for Hubble's law, {{nowrap|''v'' {{=}} ''H''<sub>0</sub>''D''}}.\n\n===Hubble volume===\n{{main|Hubble volume}}\nThe Hubble volume is sometimes defined as a volume of the universe with a [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving]] size of <math>cH_0^{-1}.</math> The exact definition varies: it is sometimes defined as the volume of a sphere with radius <math>cH_0^{-1},</math> or alternatively, a cube of side <math>cH_0^{-1}.</math> Some cosmologists even use the term Hubble volume to refer to the volume of the [[observable universe]], although this has a radius approximately three times larger.\n\n== Measured values of the Hubble constant==\nMultiple methods have been used to determine the Hubble constant.  \"Late universe\" measurements using calibrated distance ladder techniques have converged on a value of approximately {{val|73|u=km/s/Mpc}}.

However, according to research and consulting company [[Gartner]], from [[2020]] ABS will be the basis of sales for most technology [[vendor]]s, and the volume of this market will exceed $5 billion per year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hank Barnes, John-David Lovelock, David Yockelson|title=Tech Go-to-Market: How to Appeal to the Business-Focused Nature of the ABS Organization Through Its Enterprise Personality Profile|url=https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3795763|website=Gartner|date=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ABS concept was developed for use in the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] industry, where an average of 5.4 people make purchasing decisions.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} ABS increases sales volumes by involving all key persons in the transaction, offering them targeted presentation content that takes into account only their business interests.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Differences from account-based marketing==\nBroad industry marketing is not targeted enough to attract the right segment of the target audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The [[account-based marketing]] (ABM) strategy is managed by the marketing department and has a number of limitations. For example, corporate transactions often involve several decision makers, and presentation materials must be prepared for each of them. Contact provided by ABM strategy does not guarantee the continuation of business [[negotiation]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Implementation of ABM strategy provides for lead generation in [[Online and offline|offline]] sales, ABS strategy provides for transformation of leads into sales.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nABS strategy implies [[teamwork]] of all departments involved in sales of goods or services, primarily sales and marketing departments, as well as [[Coaching#Business and executive|corporate coaches]] and top management.

For the first time since the College World Series in 1947, the series was not a true double elimination tournament. Instead, the winners of the two pools met in a single National Championship game. Texas came out of its pool with no losses. Wichita State came out of its pool with one loss. Wichita State defeated Texas in the Championship game. Because each team only had one loss, in the championships prior to 1989, the teams would have played a winner-take-all game for the championship. Therefore, when Texas lost the championship game, rather than play another game for the championship, Wichita State was crowned champion. This new format was adopted for television reasons for the final game. Later, the format was switched to a best of three series in 2003.\n\n====Bracket====\n<onlyinclude>{{SECBracket| \n| RD1-seed01='''1'''\n| RD1-team01='''{{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Florida State Seminoles|title=Florida State}}'''\n| RD1-score01='''4'''\n| RD1-seed02=8\n| RD1-team02={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=North Carolina Tar Heels|title=North Carolina}}\n| RD1-score02=2\n| RD1-seed03='''4'''\n| RD1-team03='''[[1989 Wichita State Shockers baseball team|Wichita State]]'''\n| RD1-score03='''3'''\n| RD1-seed04=5\n| RD1-team04={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Arkansas Razorbacks|title=Arkansas}}\n| RD1-score04=1\n| RD1-seed05=8\n| RD1-team05=North Carolina\n| RD1-score05=3\n| RD1-seed06='''5'''\n| RD1-team06='''Arkansas'''\n| RD1-score06='''7'''\n| RD1-seed09='''2'''\n| RD1-team09='''[[1989 Texas Longhorns baseball team|Texas]]'''\n| RD1-score09='''7'''\n| RD1-seed10=7\n| RD1-team10={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Long Beach State 49ers|title=Long Beach State}}\n| RD1-score10=1\n| RD1-seed11='''3'''\n| RD1-team11='''{{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Miami Hurricanes|title=Miami (FL)}}'''\n| RD1-score11='''5'''\n| RD1-seed12=6\n| RD1-team12={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=LSU Tigers|title=LSU}}\n| RD1-score12=2\n| RD1-seed13=7\n| RD1-team13=Long Beach State\n| RD1-score13=5\n| RD1-seed14='''6'''\n| RD1-team14='''LSU'''\n| RD1-score14='''8'''\n| RD2-seed01='''1'''\n| RD2-team01='''Florida State'''\n| RD2-score01='''4'''\n| RD2-seed02=4\n| RD2-team02=Wichita State\n| RD2-score02=2\n| RD2-seed03=5\n| RD2-team03=Arkansas\n| RD2-score03=4\n| RD2-seed04='''4'''\n| RD2-team04='''Wichita State'''\n| RD2-score04='''8'''\n| RD2-seed05='''2'''\n| RD2-team05='''Texas'''\n| RD2-score05='''12'''\n| RD2-seed06=3\n| RD2-team06=Miami (FL)\n| RD2-score06=2\n| RD2-seed07='''6'''\n| RD2-team07='''LSU'''\n| RD2-score07='''6'''\n| RD2-seed08=3\n| RD2-team08=Miami (FL)\n| RD2-score08=3\n| RD3-seed01=1\n| RD3-team01=Florida State\n| RD3-score01a=4\n| RD3-score01b=9\n| RD3-seed02='''4'''\n| RD3-team02='''Wichita State'''\n| RD3-score02a='''7'''\n| RD3-score02b='''12'''\n| RD3-seed03='''2'''\n| RD3-team03='''Texas'''\n| RD3-score03a='''12'''\n| RD3-score03b=\u2014\n| RD3-seed04=6\n| RD3-team04=LSU\n| RD3-score04a=7\n| RD3-score04b=\u2014\n| RD4-seed01='''4'''\n| RD4-team01='''Wichita State'''\n| RD4-score01='''5'''\n| RD4-seed02=2\n| RD4-team02=Texas\n| RD4-score02=3\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n====Game results====\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- align=center style=\"background: #F2F2F2;\"\n!

For the first time since the College World Series in 1947, the series was not a true double elimination tournament. Instead, the winners of the two pools met in a single National Championship game. Texas came out of its pool with no losses. Wichita State came out of its pool with one loss. Wichita State defeated Texas in the Championship game. Because each team only had one loss, in the championships prior to 1989, the teams would have played a winner-take-all game for the championship. Therefore, when Texas lost the championship game, rather than play another game for the championship, Wichita State was crowned champion. This new format was adopted for television reasons for the final game. Later, the format was switched to a best of three series in 2003.\n\n====Bracket====\n<onlyinclude>{{SECBracket| \n| RD1-seed01='''1'''\n| RD1-team01='''{{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Florida State Seminoles|title=Florida State}}'''\n| RD1-score01='''4'''\n| RD1-seed02=8\n| RD1-team02={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=North Carolina Tar Heels|title=North Carolina}}\n| RD1-score02=2\n| RD1-seed03='''4'''\n| RD1-team03='''[[1989 Wichita State Shockers baseball team|Wichita State]]'''\n| RD1-score03='''3'''\n| RD1-seed04=5\n| RD1-team04={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Arkansas Razorbacks|title=Arkansas}}\n| RD1-score04=1\n| RD1-seed05=8\n| RD1-team05=North Carolina\n| RD1-score05=3\n| RD1-seed06='''5'''\n| RD1-team06='''Arkansas'''\n| RD1-score06='''7'''\n| RD1-seed09='''2'''\n| RD1-team09='''[[1989 Texas Longhorns baseball team|Texas]]'''\n| RD1-score09='''7'''\n| RD1-seed10=7\n| RD1-team10={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Long Beach State 49ers|title=Long Beach State}}\n| RD1-score10=1\n| RD1-seed11='''3'''\n| RD1-team11='''{{CBSB link|year=1989|team=Miami Hurricanes|title=Miami (FL)}}'''\n| RD1-score11='''5'''\n| RD1-seed12=6\n| RD1-team12={{CBSB link|year=1989|team=LSU Tigers|title=LSU}}\n| RD1-score12=2\n| RD1-seed13=7\n| RD1-team13=Long Beach State\n| RD1-score13=5\n| RD1-seed14='''6'''\n| RD1-team14='''LSU'''\n| RD1-score14='''8'''\n| RD2-seed01='''1'''\n| RD2-team01='''Florida State'''\n| RD2-score01='''4'''\n| RD2-seed02=4\n| RD2-team02=Wichita State\n| RD2-score02=2\n| RD2-seed03=5\n| RD2-team03=Arkansas\n| RD2-score03=4\n| RD2-seed04='''4'''\n| RD2-team04='''Wichita State'''\n| RD2-score04='''8'''\n| RD2-seed05='''2'''\n| RD2-team05='''Texas'''\n| RD2-score05='''12'''\n| RD2-seed06=3\n| RD2-team06=Miami (FL)\n| RD2-score06=2\n| RD2-seed07='''6'''\n| RD2-team07='''LSU'''\n| RD2-score07='''6'''\n| RD2-seed08=3\n| RD2-team08=Miami (FL)\n| RD2-score08=3\n| RD3-seed01=1\n| RD3-team01=Florida State\n| RD3-score01a=4\n| RD3-score01b=9\n| RD3-seed02='''4'''\n| RD3-team02='''Wichita State'''\n| RD3-score02a='''7'''\n| RD3-score02b='''12'''\n| RD3-seed03='''2'''\n| RD3-team03='''Texas'''\n| RD3-score03a='''12'''\n| RD3-score03b=\u2014\n| RD3-seed04=6\n| RD3-team04=LSU\n| RD3-score04a=7\n| RD3-score04b=\u2014\n| RD4-seed01='''4'''\n| RD4-team01='''Wichita State'''\n| RD4-score01='''5'''\n| RD4-seed02=2\n| RD4-team02=Texas\n| RD4-score02=3\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n====Game results====\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- align=center style=\"background: #F2F2F2;\"\n!

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R. I.|title=The Formation of a Persecuting Society|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts| edition=second|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-2964-0}}</ref>\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|date=July 2001|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought in the First to the Fourth Centuries==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|isbn=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The first official execution for heresy was ordered by the King of the Franks at Orleans in 1022 at popular insistence. In 1076, Pope Gregory VI excommunicated the residents of the entire town of Cambrai because a mob had seized and burned a \u2018heretic\u2019 there. In 1034, \"the nobles of Milan insisted that the heretics from Montforte must be burned, against the (formal?) protest of the Archbishop.\"<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|108}} In 1114 the Bishop of Soissons imprisoned some heretics, left to go ask the advice of the holy synod on what to do with them, and while he was gone, the town\u2019s folk, fearing what they termed the \u201chabitual soft-heartedness of ecclesiastics\u201d (clericalem verens mollitiem), stormed the prison, took the accused outside of town, and burned them alive. Of the two most famous and best-known heretics of that time, Peter of Bruys was burned at the stake as a victim of popular fury, and Arnold of Brescia died under the henchman's axe as a victim of his political enemies who used \u2018heresy\u2019 as their excuse.

The collection of ecclesiastical law from [[Burchard of Worms]] around 1002 did not include the concept of popular heresy at all.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|23}}. Clergy understood that ordinary people often had uninformed and mistaken beliefs. The official response to that was not to designate them heretics but to simply correct them through ''persuasio.''  If correction was rejected, the church had, by the end of the eleventh century, evolved a definition of heresy as the \"deliberate rejection of the truth.\"<ref name =\"Deane\">{{cite book|last=Deane|first = Jennifer Kolpacoff|title=A History of Medieval Heresy and Inquisition|year=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|ISBN=978-0-7425-5575-4}}</ref>{{rp|3-4}}.  \n\nWhile there were acts of violence in response to heresy undertaken by secular powers for their own reasons, Christian thought concerning response, at least at the beginning of the High Middle Ages, still tended to coincide with [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] who said reports of heresy should be investigated, true heretics excommunicated, and their teachings publicly rebuked.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|22,23}}  \"Through most of the previous millenium, instances of prosecution had been rare and spasmodic.

The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the individual inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century, and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. In his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n==Late Middle Ages (1200 ~ 1400)==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

Of the two most famous and best-known heretics of that time, Peter of Bruys was burned at the stake as a victim of popular fury, and Arnold of Brescia died under the henchman's axe as a victim of his political enemies who used \u2018heresy\u2019 as their excuse. Roger Moore disagrees saying that all these, and other instances like them, have in common is dispute over jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|109}}\n\nThe dissemination of popular heresy ''to the laity'' was a new problem for the bishops of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, since heresy had previously been an accusation made solely toward Bishops and other church leaders who knew and understood theology.  The collection of ecclesiastical law from [[Burchard of Worms]] around 1002 did not include the concept of popular heresy at all.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|23}}. Clergy understood that ordinary people often had uninformed and mistaken beliefs. The official response to that was not to designate them heretics but to simply correct them through ''persuasio.''  If correction was rejected, the church had, by the end of the eleventh century, evolved a definition of heresy as the \"deliberate rejection of the truth.\"<ref name =\"Deane\">{{cite book|last=Deane|first = Jennifer Kolpacoff|title=A History of Medieval Heresy and Inquisition|year=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|ISBN=978-0-7425-5575-4}}</ref>{{rp|3-4}}.  \n\nWhile there were acts of violence in response to heresy undertaken by secular powers for their own reasons, Christian thought concerning response, at least at the beginning of the High Middle Ages, still tended to coincide with [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] who said reports of heresy should be investigated, true heretics excommunicated, and their teachings publicly rebuked.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|22,23}}  \"Through most of the previous millenium, instances of prosecution had been rare and spasmodic.

As most Bishops thought this would be participation in shedding blood, it didn't happen until 1148 when the notorious and violent [[Eon de l'Etoile]] was so delivered. Eon was found mad, but a number of his followers were burned.  This marks a very clear watershed in the history of Christian thought.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|22,23}}\n\n====Inquisitions====\nIn 1184 Pope Lucius the third issued a decree establishing the Episcopal Inquisition through the papal bull ''Ad abolendam''. (It was called \"episcopal\" because it was administered by local bishops, which in Latin is episcopus.)  The label ''Inquisition'' is problematic as it implies \"an institutional coherence and official unity that never existed in the Middle Ages.\"<ref name =\"Deane\"/>{{rp|6}}  Church law was just developing at this time, and it was based on Roman law to the degree that it can be said the church reintroduced Roman law in Europe in the form of Inquisition when it seemed Germanic law had failed. <ref name=\"Monter\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Inquisition, The: The Inquisition In The Old World|author=William Monter|date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Encyclopedia.com| url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/inquisition-inquisition-old-world}}</ref>  In the Late Roman Empire, an inquisitorial system of justice had developed that allowed magistrates to investigate crimes in the absence of formal charges being brought. The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the individual inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century, and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. In his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n==Late Middle Ages (1200 ~ 1400)==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
