Organised for the first time in the 1999\u20132000 season as the '''IRB World Sevens Series''',<ref name=irb-sevens-1999/> the competition was formed to promote an elite-level of international rugby sevens and develop the game into a viable commercial product. The competition has been sponsored by banking group [[HSBC]] since 2014.<ref name=\"HSBC release\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2040495.html#hsbc+first+sevens+world+series+title+sponsor |title=HSBC first Sevens World Series title sponsor |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe season's circuit consists of 10 tournaments that generally begin in November or December and last until May. The venues are held across 10 countries, and visits five of the six populated continents. The [[United Arab Emirates]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[France]] and [[England]] each host one event. Each tournament has 16 teams \u2014 15 core teams that participate in each tournament and one regional qualifier.\n\nTeams compete for the World Rugby Series title by accumulating points based on their finishing position in each tournament. The lowest placed core team at the end of the season is dropped, and replaced by the winner of the [[Hong Kong Sevens]]. New Zealand had originally dominated the Series, winning each of the first six seasons from 1999\u20132000 to 2004\u201305, but since then, Fiji, [[South Africa at the World Rugby Sevens Series|South Africa]] and Samoa have each won season titles. England, Australia and the United States have placed in the top three for several seasons but have not won the series title.\n\nThe [[International Olympic Committee]]'s decision in 2009 to add rugby sevens to the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016 has added a boost to rugby sevens and to the [[World Sevens Series]]; this boost has led to increased exposure and revenues, leading several of the core teams to field fully professional squads.\n\n==History==\n\n===International sevens===\nThe first international [[rugby sevens]] tournament was held in 1973 in Scotland, which was celebrating a century of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Scotland.org \u2013 September 2007 ''Try and Try again''|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/entertainment-and-sport/features/culture/scottish-rugby.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019124148/http://www.scotland.org/about/entertainment-and-sport/features/culture/scottish-rugby.html|archivedate=19 October 2009|url-status=live|accessdate=2009-06-23|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Seven international teams took part, with [[England national rugby sevens team|England]] defeating Ireland 22\u201318 in the final to take the trophy.

sevens]] is a fast-paced version of [[rugby union]] with seven players each side on a full-sized rugby field. Games are much shorter, lasting seven minutes each half. The game is quicker and faster-scoring than 15-a-side rugby, which explains part of its appeal. It also gives players the space for superb feats of individual skill. Sevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. Currently, in a normal event, 16 teams are entered.\n\nWorld Rugby operates satellite tournaments in each continent alongside the Sevens World Series which serve as qualifiers for Series events;<ref name=\"2008-09 core\"/> in 2012\u201313 they also determined the entrants in the World Series Pre-Qualifier,<ref name=\"2012\u201313 qualifying\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/archive/tcode=1270/season=2012/news/newsid=2065481.html#pools+confimed+hong+kong+sevens |title=Pools confirmed for Hong Kong Sevens |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=21 February 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> and from 2013\u201314 determine the entrants in the Core Team Qualifier.<ref name=\"2013-14 promotion\"/>\n\nIn each tournament, the teams are divided into pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments\u20143 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss, 0 for a no-show.

In descending order of prestige, they are the Cup, whose winner is the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. Each trophy is awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.\n\nIn a normal event, the top two teams in each pool advance to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers drop into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl is contested by the third and fourth-place finishers in each pool, while the Shield is contested by the losing quarterfinalists of the Bowl.\n\nA third-place match is now conducted between the losing Cup semifinalists in all tournaments; this was introduced for the 2011\u201312 series.<ref name=\"New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series\">{{SA Rugby Article | id=1141551 | leagueid=1021 | title=New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=6 June 2016 | url=http://www.sarugby.co.za/article.aspx?id=1141551&leagueid=1021 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606094939/http://www.sarugby.co.za/article.aspx?id=1141551&leagueid=1021 | url-status=dead | archivedate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012\u201313, the season-ending London Sevens expanded to 20 teams, with 12 competing for series points and eight involved in the Core Team Qualifier.<ref name=\"2012\u201313 qualifying\"/> With the promotion place now determined at the Hong Kong Sevens, the London Sevens returned to the traditional 16-team format in 2013\u201314.\n\n===Hong Kong 7s===\nThe [[Hong Kong Sevens]] (an anomaly as a three-day event) is the most famous sevens tournament.\nThe Hong Kong Sevens had 24 teams through the 2011\u201312 series, but has featured 28 teams since 2012\u201313, with 15 core teams and the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series competing for series points.

The 12 core teams competed for the Cup, Plate and Bowl under a format similar to that of a regular event. The 12 invited teams all competed for the Shield, with the top three sides in that competition also earning core status for 2012\u201313.\n\nFrom 2013 on, the four trophies in Hong Kong will be contested under the same format used in regular 16-team tournaments. Only the 15 core teams, plus the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series, now compete in the main draw of that event although from 2017 the number of trophies was reduced to just the main Cup with the showpiece final being reduced from 20 minutes to 14 minutes and the Challenge Trophy which were in line with changes which began at the start of the [[2016-17 World Rugby Sevens Series]].\n\n=== Points schedule ===\nThe season championship is determined by points earned in each tournament. World Rugby introduced a new scoring system for the 2011\u201312 series, in which all teams participating in a tournament are guaranteed points. Initially, World Rugby announced the new points schedule only for the standard 16-team events; the allocations for the Hong Kong Sevens were announced later.<ref name=\"New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series\"/> A new scoring system was introduced in 2019-20 requiring teams to play for 7th, 11th and 15th places, previously teams had tied for 7th-8th 11th-12th and 15th-16th places.\n\nThe current points schedule used at each standard event is summarised below.\n\n:{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Organised for the first time in the 1999\u20132000 season as the '''IRB World Sevens Series''',<ref name=irb-sevens-1999/> the competition was formed to promote an elite-level of international rugby sevens and develop the game into a viable commercial product. The competition has been sponsored by banking group [[HSBC]] since 2014.<ref name=\"HSBC release\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2040495.html#hsbc+first+sevens+world+series+title+sponsor |title=HSBC first Sevens World Series title sponsor |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe season's circuit consists of 10 tournaments that generally begin in November or December and last until May. The venues are held across 10 countries, and visits five of the six populated continents. The [[United Arab Emirates]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[France]] and [[England]] each host one event. Each tournament has 16 teams \u2014 15 core teams that participate in each tournament and one regional qualifier.\n\nTeams compete for the World Rugby Series title by accumulating points based on their finishing position in each tournament. The lowest placed core team at the end of the season is dropped, and replaced by the winner of the [[Hong Kong Sevens]]. New Zealand had originally dominated the Series, winning each of the first six seasons from 1999\u20132000 to 2004\u201305, but since then, Fiji, [[South Africa at the World Rugby Sevens Series|South Africa]] and Samoa have each won season titles. England, Australia and the United States have placed in the top three for several seasons but have not won the series title.\n\nThe [[International Olympic Committee]]'s decision in 2009 to add rugby sevens to the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016 has added a boost to rugby sevens and to the [[World Sevens Series]]; this boost has led to increased exposure and revenues, leading several of the core teams to field fully professional squads.\n\n==History==\n\n===International sevens===\nThe first international [[rugby sevens]] tournament was held in 1973 in Scotland, which was celebrating a century of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Scotland.org \u2013 September 2007 ''Try and Try again''|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/entertainment-and-sport/features/culture/scottish-rugby.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019124148/http://www.scotland.org/about/entertainment-and-sport/features/culture/scottish-rugby.html|archivedate=19 October 2009|url-status=live|accessdate=2009-06-23|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Seven international teams took part, with [[England national rugby sevens team|England]] defeating Ireland 22\u201318 in the final to take the trophy.

sevens]] is a fast-paced version of [[rugby union]] with seven players each side on a full-sized rugby field. Games are much shorter, lasting seven minutes each half. The game is quicker and faster-scoring than 15-a-side rugby, which explains part of its appeal. It also gives players the space for superb feats of individual skill. Sevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. Currently, in a normal event, 16 teams are entered.\n\nWorld Rugby operates satellite tournaments in each continent alongside the Sevens World Series which serve as qualifiers for Series events;<ref name=\"2008-09 core\"/> in 2012\u201313 they also determined the entrants in the World Series Pre-Qualifier,<ref name=\"2012\u201313 qualifying\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/archive/tcode=1270/season=2012/news/newsid=2065481.html#pools+confimed+hong+kong+sevens |title=Pools confirmed for Hong Kong Sevens |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=21 February 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> and from 2013\u201314 determine the entrants in the Core Team Qualifier.<ref name=\"2013-14 promotion\"/>\n\nIn each tournament, the teams are divided into pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments\u20143 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss, 0 for a no-show.

In descending order of prestige, they are the Cup, whose winner is the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. Each trophy is awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.\n\nIn a normal event, the top two teams in each pool advance to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers drop into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl is contested by the third and fourth-place finishers in each pool, while the Shield is contested by the losing quarterfinalists of the Bowl.\n\nA third-place match is now conducted between the losing Cup semifinalists in all tournaments; this was introduced for the 2011\u201312 series.<ref name=\"New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series\">{{SA Rugby Article | id=1141551 | leagueid=1021 | title=New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=6 June 2016 | url=http://www.sarugby.co.za/article.aspx?id=1141551&leagueid=1021 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606094939/http://www.sarugby.co.za/article.aspx?id=1141551&leagueid=1021 | url-status=dead | archivedate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012\u201313, the season-ending London Sevens expanded to 20 teams, with 12 competing for series points and eight involved in the Core Team Qualifier.<ref name=\"2012\u201313 qualifying\"/> With the promotion place now determined at the Hong Kong Sevens, the London Sevens returned to the traditional 16-team format in 2013\u201314.\n\n===Hong Kong 7s===\nThe [[Hong Kong Sevens]] (an anomaly as a three-day event) is the most famous sevens tournament.\nThe Hong Kong Sevens had 24 teams through the 2011\u201312 series, but has featured 28 teams since 2012\u201313, with 15 core teams and the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series competing for series points.

The 12 core teams competed for the Cup, Plate and Bowl under a format similar to that of a regular event. The 12 invited teams all competed for the Shield, with the top three sides in that competition also earning core status for 2012\u201313.\n\nFrom 2013 on, the four trophies in Hong Kong will be contested under the same format used in regular 16-team tournaments. Only the 15 core teams, plus the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series, now compete in the main draw of that event although from 2017 the number of trophies was reduced to just the main Cup with the showpiece final being reduced from 20 minutes to 14 minutes and the Challenge Trophy which were in line with changes which began at the start of the [[2016-17 World Rugby Sevens Series]].\n\n=== Points schedule ===\nThe season championship is determined by points earned in each tournament. World Rugby introduced a new scoring system for the 2011\u201312 series, in which all teams participating in a tournament are guaranteed points. Initially, World Rugby announced the new points schedule only for the standard 16-team events; the allocations for the Hong Kong Sevens were announced later.<ref name=\"New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series\"/> A new scoring system was introduced in 2019-20 requiring teams to play for 7th, 11th and 15th places, previously teams had tied for 7th-8th 11th-12th and 15th-16th places.\n\nThe current points schedule used at each standard event is summarised below.\n\n:{|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

These annual salaries can range from \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac100,000. England offers among the more generous salaries, ranging from an estimated \u20ac25,000 to over \u20ac100,000. New Zealand has a graded system with salaries ranging from \u20ac23,000-plus to \u20ac29,000-plus, to \u20ac40,000-plus and about \u20ac52,500 for its four top earners. The basic salary for Scottish sevens players ranges from \u20ac22,500 to \u20ac40,000. The Australian sevens players are estimated to be on a basic salary of about \u20ac27,000-plus.

Despite also being the youngest member of the team, he is appointed the leader as he was chosen by the strongest Kiramai Stone, much to his initial dismay before he eventually settled into the role. When he first met the Kiramagers, Juru knew everyone except for Tametomo based on their fame. Due in part to his love of drawing, he gained the Kiramental to create virtually anything after becoming Kiramai Red, such as reformatting the Kiramai Stones into the Kiramai Mashin and granting them the ability to combine.\n: Juru Atsuta is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Rio Komiya]]|\u5c0f\u5bae \u7483\u592e|Komiya Rio}}.\n;{{nihongo|Tametomo Imizu|\u5c04\u6c34 \u70ba\u671d|Imizu Tametomo}}<ref>https://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/kiramager/character/yellow.html</ref>\n: An [[esports]] professional who excels in long range combat and transforms into {{nihongo|Kiramai Yellow|\u30ad\u30e9\u30e1\u30a4\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc|Kiramei Ier\u014d}}. He acts as an older brother figure and provides assistance when he's needed. However, he is also a selfish egotist, seeing himself as the Kiramagers' \"ace\" even when the others disagree. After Juru failed to recognize him, Tametomo developed an antagonistic relationship with him, questioning his every move and talking back to him every so often. This eventually culminated in Tametomo trying to take Juru's position away from him and prove he could be a better leader, only to botch a mission and be suspended for it. Though he quit out of anger, the girls helped Tametomo realize how selfish he was and that Juru is more qualified because of his caring personality. Once he reconciled with the others, Tametomo became Juru's second-in-command.\n: Tametomo Imizu is portrayed by {{nihongo|Rui Kihara|\u6728\u539f \u7460\u751f|Kihara Rui}}.

Despite being a popular stuntman, most of his fans are annoyed by his doll-like personality as he rarely shows emotion. While he likes to maintain an air of stoicism and coldness, he only does so to contain his true feelings and not be a burden to everyone around him as he believes a hero should suffer in silence. After Juru learned his secret, Shiguru learned to be more open about his feelings.\n: Shiguru Oshikiri is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Atom Mizuishi]]|\u6c34\u77f3 \u4e9c\u98db\u5922|Mizuishi Atomu}}.\n;{{nihongo|Sayo Oharu|\u5927\u6cbb \u5c0f\u591c|\u014charu Sayo}}<ref>https://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/kiramager/character/pink.html</ref>\n: A talented surgeon who excels in ''[[aikido]]'', serves as the team's healer, and transforms into {{nihongo|Kiramai Pink|\u30ad\u30e9\u30e1\u30a4\u30d4\u30f3\u30af|Kiramei Pinku}}.

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]].

With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record.

Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season.

A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms.

The Coliseum hosted 364 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance over the course of their first seven seasons. When they returned as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004\u201305 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena with a [[Rolling Stones]] concert.\nIn April 2008, the Bobcats reached a [[naming rights]] deal with [[Time Warner Cable]], North Carolina's largest [[cable television]] provider.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]]. WOLS switched its non-sports programming from [[oldies]] to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station's only non-Spanish language programming. [[WBT (radio station)|WBT]] was the Hornets' radio flagship during the original franchise's entire run.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Charlotte Hornets}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Charlotte Bobcats}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|Charlotte Hornets|border=2}}|list =\n{{Charlotte Bobcats seasons}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{North Carolina Sports}}\n{{Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports|United States}}\n\n[[Category:Charlotte Hornets| ]]\n[[Category:Charlotte Bobcats| ]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox basketball club\n| name = Charlotte Hornets\n| current = 2019\u201320 Charlotte Hornets season\n| logo = Charlotte Hornets (2014).svg\n| imagesize = 200px\n| conference = [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]]\n| division = [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast]]\n| founded = 1988\n| history = '''Charlotte Hornets'''<br />1988\u20132002, 2014\u2013present<br />'''Charlotte Bobcats'''<br />2004\u20132014\n<!-- Please DO NOT change the history in the infobox; it is official. --><ref name=hornets_name_returns>{{cite news|title=Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522200148/http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|archive-date=May 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NBA.com/Stats\u2013Charlotte Hornets seasons|url=http://stats.nba.com/team/#!/1610612766/seasons/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Stats.NBA.com|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History: Team by Team|url=https://cdn.nba.net/assets/pdfs/2018-19-NBA-Guide-10-8.pdf#page=105|publisher=NBA Properties, Inc.|work=2018-19 Official NBA Guide|date=October 8, 2018|access-date=June 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| arena = [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]\n| location = [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n| colors = Teal, dark purple, gray<ref name=\"HornetsColors2014\">{{cite news|title=Purple and Teal Color Palette to Re-Join Hornets Name in Charlotte|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/purple-and-teal-color-palette-re-join-hornets-name-charlotte/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=November 24, 2013|access-date=January 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|last=Wash|first=Quinton|title=NBA Unveils Logo For 2019 All-Star Weekend In Charlotte|url=https://www.nba.com/hornets/press-releases/nba-unveils-logo-2019-all-star-weekend-charlotte|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=January 31, 2018|access-date=February 18, 2019|quote=The NBA today unveiled the logo for NBA All-Star 2019, which will take place February 15\u201317, 2019, in Charlotte.

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1993.html|title=1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets Roster and Stats|publisher=Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], the Hornets finished with a 50\u201332 record, returning to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1995.html|title=Charlotte Hornets 1994\u20131995 Summary|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.com|access-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-04-9511040064-story.html|title=Mourning OFF To Miami|last=Smith|first=Sam|date=November 4, 1995|publisher=Chicago Tribune|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998: Glen Rice era====\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]], acquiring center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer [[Kobe Bryant]], whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/|title=Kobe Bryant and the draft day trade that changed NBA history|last=Harper|first=Zach|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=CBS Sports|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54\u201328, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n====1998\u20132002: Final years of original personnel====\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe next three seasons ([[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] and [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]]) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season.

A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange.

Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The '[[Hugo (mascot)|Hugo]]' logo was prominently featured on the shorts' beltline, beginning in early 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal.

Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.\n\n====Bobcats====\nThe Bobcats' first home [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] were white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming.

Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms.

The Coliseum hosted 364 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance over the course of their first seven seasons. When they returned as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004\u201305 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena with a [[Rolling Stones]] concert.\nIn April 2008, the Bobcats reached a [[naming rights]] deal with [[Time Warner Cable]], North Carolina's largest [[cable television]] provider. In exchange for the naming rights, Time Warner agreed to tear up the cable television deal that had limited the Bobcats' exposure over the team's first four years (see below).<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\">{{cite press release|title=Bobcats, Time Warner Cable, Fox Sports Strike Unprecedented Deal|url=http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|publisher=Charlotte Bobcats|date=April 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420070145/http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|archivedate=April 20, 2008|accessdate=June 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AP: Time Warner gets naming rights for Bobcats Arena|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/bobcats/2008-04-07-time-warner-rights_N.htm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref> When the Hornets returned to Charlotte, \"The Hive\" nickname also returned to the arena.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]].

Bruce and the trucking company owners who move the cash [[Skimming (fraud)|skim]] $8 million, which causes their cartel contact Del to kill Bruce, Bruce's fianc\u00e9e Liz, and the father-son trucking company owners. To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg. She follows his advice to leave Marty and take their two children and as much money as she can secure, which causes Del to have Silverberg killed as a warning to Wendy to keep the family together.\n |LineColor       = 00AAC0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Blue Cat\n |DirectedBy      = Jason Bateman\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Bill Dubuque & Mark Williams |t=Bill Dubuque}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|7|21}}\n |ShortSummary    = Wendy, Marty and their two children arrive in the Ozarks and begin to meet local residents, including several members of the Langmore family who work at the hotel where they are staying.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

The Byrdes are made aware that while skimming money, Bruce was also an FBI informant. Trevor sees that Roy is becoming obsessed, foretelling continued problems for the Byrdes. Charlotte and Jonah are told the real reason for their move to the Ozarks, and Jonah does online research to learn more about the cartel. Wendy gets a job as an advance person and \"stager\" for the real estate broker she dealt with when buying Buddy's house. Charlotte's job interview does not end well after she spots Wyatt outside the store and punches him in retaliation for his ruse at the hotel. Marty begins activities at the Blue Cat, despite the suspicions of Rachel, the primary owner.

Marty hires Ruth to break into the Lickety Splitz safe. Working undercover, Roy watches Marty at the Blue Cat, and develops an interest in Russ Langmore, Wyatt's father and Ruth's uncle. Bobby Dean, the owner of Lickety Splitz, is arrested because of Ruth's plan, and Marty gains access to the safe. He posts Bobby's bail and uses the information from the safe to force Bobby to sell the club. Jacob and Darlene Snell are revealed as major heroin dealers, for whom Bobby was laundering money.

Jacob Snell attempts to persuade Marty to launder money for him at Lickety Splitz. Marty sees Mason Young, the local pastor, holding boat-based Sunday services on the lake, and realizes that building Mason a church could present an opportunity to launder money. Marty asks Ruth to run the strip club over the Fourth of July weekend, which leads to him hiring her as the full time manager. She betters Bobby's management with actions, including hiring new staff, that turn Lickety Splitz into a moneymaker. Roy continues to use Russ as a fishing guide, and attempts to kiss him, provoking a violent reaction.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made. Charlotte works at the Blue Cat and declines Wyatt's \"anti-tourists\" party invitation to go with Zach, a tourist from Chicago. She loses her virginity, but Zach departs the next day without saying goodbye, prompting Wyatt to tell her tourists always leave, and she is now \"one of us\" \u2013 a permanent local resident.

Marty tells Mason the Snells are drug dealers, and want him to resume services on the lake. The Snells tell Mason Marty was only constructing the church so he could launder money. Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead. After returning home, Charlotte goes for a night swim. Ignoring Marty's advice to stay near the shore, she swims far into the lake.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty. This forces Russ to turn informant against Ruth, who Roy intends to turn informant on Marty. Instead, Russ and his brother Boyd plan to rob and kill Marty to finance a life on the run.

Rachel finds part of the $50 million, which she takes as she drives away. Del tortures Marty to find out where Garcia is. Marty explains a plan to use the cartel to distribute Snell heroin, while the Snells allow a casino on their property to launder cartel money.

Helen shows the Byrdes video of Ash using Del's credit card in Chicago. She will overlook Del's death (and Garcia's) in exchange for \"reparations\" from the Snells but does not tell Marty what will be satisfactory. At Darlene's insistence, the Snells refuse to offer money, but Jacob understands a life must be paid, so he kills Ash to save Darlene.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration.

Marty and Wendy previously convinced her employer, Sam's mother Eugenia, to deposit her savings in Marty's new \"investment fund\". Her $900,000 replaces the $700,000 Marty paid the Snells. With this influx, he completes laundering the $8 million on time. The cartel immediately delivers $50 million \u2013 the first of the $500 million Marty promised to wash. Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty.

Helen shows the Byrdes video of Ash using Del's credit card in Chicago. She will overlook Del's death (and Garcia's) in exchange for \"reparations\" from the Snells but does not tell Marty what will be satisfactory.

The causes of the violence included antisemitism and conflict over the restitution of property stolen from Jews during [[the Holocaust in Slovakia]].\n\nThe violence often took the form of rioting and occurred in waves: late 1945, mid-1946, early 1947, and mid-1948.

The causes of the violence included antisemitism and conflict over the restitution of property stolen from Jews during [[the Holocaust in Slovakia]].\n\nThe violence often took the form of rioting and occurred in waves: late 1945, mid-1946, early 1947, and mid-1948.

There were also conflicts regarding movable property that had been entrusted to non-Jewish individuals who refused to return it after the war. For many Slovaks, restitution meant returning property that they had paid for under the then-existing law, developed, and considered theirs.

The National Weather Service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its European counterpart did.
