{"title_page": "Spanish conquest of Nicaragua", "text_new": "{{History of Nicaragua}}\nThe '''Spanish conquest of Nicaragua''' was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'' against the [[indigenous peoples of Nicaragua|natives]] of the territory now incorporated into the modern [[Central America]]n republic of [[Nicaragua]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonisation of the Americas]]. Before European contact in the early 16th century, Nicargua was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples. In the west, these included Mesoamerican groups such as the [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]], the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]], and the [[Subtiaba people|Subtiaba]]. Other groups included the [[Matagalpa people|Matagalpa]] and the [[Tacacho people|Tacacho]].\n\n[[Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila]] first entered what is now Nicaragua in 1522, with the permission of [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]], governor of [[Castilla de Oro]] (modern [[Panama]]) but was driven back to his ships by the Chorotega. In 1524, a new expedition led by [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] founded the Spanish towns of [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. The western portions of Nicaragua along the Pacific littoral plain received the brunt of the Spanish activity in the territory for the next three decades.<ref>Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 231.</ref> Within a century of the conquest, the native inhabitants had been all but eliminated due to war, disease, and exportation as slaves.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nicaragua CIA map.gif|thumb|right|Map of Nicaragua]]\nNicaragua is the largest country in Central America, covering an area of {{convert|129494|km2|sqmi}} \u2013 or {{convert|120254|km2|sqmi}} without including the surface area of its two largest lakes. The country is bordered to the north by [[Honduras]], and to the south by [[Costa Rica]]; it is bordered to the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and to the east by the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=\"Merril1993a\">Merril 1993a.</ref> Nicaragua is divided into three broad regions, the Pacific Lowlands in the west, the Central Highlands, and the Caribbean Lowlands in the east.<ref name=\"Newson1982p261\">Newson 1982, p. 261.</ref> The Pacific lowlands are largely a coastal plain extending approximately {{convert|75|km|mi}} inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A chain of volcanoes extends from the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] southeast towards Lake Nicaragua; many of them are active. The volcanoes lie along the western edge of a [[rift valley]] running southeast from the Gulf to the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]], which forms a part of the border with Costa Rica. The two largest lakes in Central America dominate the rift valley: [[Lake Managua]] and [[Lake Nicaragua]]. Lake Managua measures {{convert|56|by|24|km|mi}}, and Lake Nicaragua measures {{convert|160|by|75|km|mi}}. The [[Tipitapa River]] flows south out of Lake Managua and into Lake Nicaragua, which empties into the Caribbean via the San Juan River.<ref name=\"Merril1993a\"/> The Central Highlands reach altitudes of up to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]], and consist of generally east-west running ranges that include the [[Cordillera Dariense]], [[Cordillera Dipilto and Jalapa Natural Reserve|Cordillera de Dipilto]], [[Cordillera Isabelia|Cordillera Isabella]], the [[Huap\u00ed Mountains]], and the [[Yolaina Natural Reserve|Yolaina Mountains]].<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p234\">Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 234.</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nIn central Nicaragua, the temperature varies between {{convert|20|and|25|C|F}}; rainfall averages {{convert|1000|to|2000|mm|in}} per year. There is a four-month dry season, with the rain season lasting throughout the rest of the year. Before the conquest, the Central Highlands were covered with [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|coniferous forest]].<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p234\"/> The Pacific coastal plain is classified as [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]], and features fertile volcanic soils. The Atlantic lowlands receive higher rainfall; the soils are less fertile, and the region is classified as [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]].<ref name=\"Salamanca2012p7\">Salamanca 2012, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Nicaragua before the conquest==\nWhen the Spanish first arrived in what is now Nicaragua there were three principal indigenous groups living in the western portions of the country; these were the [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (also known as the Mangue),<ref name=\"Fowler1985p38\"/> the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]], and the [[Matagalpa people|Matagalpa]] (also known as Chontal, from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] term for \"foreigner\").<ref>Staten 2010, pp. 14\u201315. Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 233.</ref> The Nicarao were a [[Nahuat]]-speaking [[Mesoamerica]]n people that had migrated southwards from central Mexico from the 8th century AD onwards. They broke off from the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] around the early 13th century and settled in pockets of western Nicaragua along the Pacific coast, with their heaviest concentration in what is now the [[Departments of Nicaragua|department]] of [[Rivas Department|Rivas]].<ref>Fowler 1985, pp. 37\u201338.</ref> The Chorotega were also a Mesoamerican people that had migrated from Mexico. The [[Subtiaba people|Subtiaba]] (also known as the Maribio) were another group of Mexican origin. The [[Tacacho people|Tacacho]] were a small group of unknown origin and language.<ref name=\"Fowler1985p38\">Fowler 1985, p. 38.</ref> The Matagalpa were a non-Mesoamerican people of the [[Intermediate Area]], belonging to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchoidean]] cultural region.<ref>Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 242.

The first century after Spanish contact witnessed the demographic collapse of the native populations, resulting principally from exposure to [[Old World]] diseases and their exportation as slaves, but also from a combination of war and mistreatment.<ref>Staten 2010, p. 15.</ref> \n99% of the Native population of western [[Nicaragua]] perished over the course of 60 years causing some modern scholars to refer to the Spanish conquest as a [[genocide]] or [[holocaust (disambiguation)|holocaust]].<ref>Grenke 2005, p. 142. Churchill 1999, p. 433.</ref>\n\n===Native weapons and tactics===\nThe Spanish described the Matagalpa as being well-organised, with ordered battle-lines. The Nicarao engaged in war with the Matagalpa, probably in order to capture slaves, and prisoners to be offered for [[Mesoamerica#Sacrifice|human sacrifice]].<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p236\"/>\n\n==Background to the conquest==\n[[File:16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean.png|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of Spanish expansion in the Caribbean during the 16th century]]\n[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the New World for the [[Kingdom of Castile and Leon]] in 1492.

Mounted conquistadors were armed with a {{convert|12|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} [[lance]], that also served as a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] for infantrymen. A variety of [[halberd]]s and [[Bill (weapon)|bills]] were also employed. As well as the one-handed broadsword, a {{convert|5.5|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} long two-handed version was also used.<ref name=\"Pohl&Hook2008p26\">Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 26.</ref> Crossbows had {{convert|2|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} arms stiffened with hardwoods, horn, bone and cane, and supplied with a stirrup to facilitate drawing the string with a crank and pulley.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in the humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 27.</ref>\n\nMetal armour was of limited use in the hot, wet tropical climate. It was heavy and had to be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. ''Conquistadores'' often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 23.</ref> They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this with the use of a simple metal [[war hat]].<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 16, 26.</ref> [[Shield]]s were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood.

In 1493, the Spanish [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued the [[Bulls of Donation]] that justified the colonisation of the New World for the express purpose of converting the native inhabitants to Christianity.<ref>Deagan 2003, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> The Spanish Crown and the Church insisted that the conquered peoples were human souls meriting legal rights and protection, while the colonists claimed they were subhuman, and a valid resource for forced labour. These opposing viewpoints led to conflict between the authorities in Spain and the colonists on the ground in the Americas.<ref>Deagan 2003, p. 5.</ref> There was religious participation in the conquest of Nicaragua from the first exploratory expeditions onwards; Father Diego de Ag\u00fcero accompanied Gil Gonz\u00e1lez on his 1519 expedition, and returned with Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba in 1524, with two religious companions.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 78\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 78.</ref> One of the first actions performed upon entering an indigenous settlement was to plant a cross on top of the local shrine, to symbolically replace the native religion with the authority of the Church.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 78\u201379.</ref> Fathers Contreras and Blas Hern\u00e1ndez established the first [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] presence in 1619.<ref>Sariego 2005, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Discovery of Nicaragua, 1519\u20131523==\nSpanish explorers first viewed the Pacific coast of Nicaragua in 1519, sailing up from Panama.<ref name=\"Stanislawski1983p1\">Stanislawski 1983, p. 1.</ref> That year, [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila|Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]] executed N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa and seized his ships on the Pacific coast of Panama.

He invited the Spaniards to lodge near the city plaza and the two leaders exchanged gifts; Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila wrote that he received the equivalent of 15,000 gold ''castellanos''. The Spanish captain gifted Nicarao with silk clothing and many other items brought from Spain. Over the course of the next few days, the Spanish instructed the natives in the basics of Christian religion. He claimed that after this, the natives wished to convert to the new religion, and that just over 9000 people were baptised in one day, including adults and children of both genders.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p57\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 57.</ref> After several days in the Nicarao capital, Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila learned of [[Lake Nicaragua]], and he sent a small detachment of soldiers to confirm its existence; he then travelled in person with 15 foot soldiers and 3 mounted soldiers. Among those who went with him to the lakeshore were the expedition's treasurer Andr\u00e9s de Cereceda, and friar Diego de Ag\u00fcero.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 59.</ref>  On 12 April 1523 they claimed the lake for the Spanish Crown under the name of ''Mar Dulce'' (\"sweet sea\").<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila sent out a canoe to scout the lake for a short distance, and questioned the natives as to whether it connected with the sea, without receiving any clear response; nonetheless, the Spanish were convinced that the lake must have an outlet to the Caribbean Sea, and that they had discovered a new route across the Central American isthmus.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A great many natives came to see newly arrived Europeans, driven by curiosity about their strange appearance and mode of dress, and horses, which the natives had never seen before.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p61\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 61.</ref>\n\n===Opposition and retreat===\nFrom Quauhcapolca, Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila advanced to the indigenous settlement of Coatega,<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p61\"/> near the [[Mombacho]] volcano,<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p63\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 63.</ref> where he was met by another powerful ruler, [[Diriangen|Diriang\u00e9n]], leader of the Chorotega.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 61.

He returned on 17 April at midday, arrayed for battle. The Spanish were alerted to the surprise attack by one of the local natives; even so a violent struggle ensued that resulted in the wounding of various Spanish defenders. The use of their small number of horses assisted them, since they struck fear into the enemy. The Chorotega attack was beaten off, and Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila immediately sent messengers to call back an advance party consisting of friar Ag\u00fcero accompanied by a number of soldiers, who had been advancing towards Diriang\u00e9n's territory. The violent opposition of the Chorotega convinced Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila and his officers to turn back with the gold they had already collected.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 62.</ref> They marched back south through Nicarao territory, by now suspicious of all indigenous activity. They took up a defensive formation, in a compact group with a single mounted soldier on each side. In the main group, sixty of the fittest soldiers went ready for battle, while the wounded travelled with the supplies, gold, and native porters in the centre.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p63\"/> They were met with passively hostile reactions from the natives they passed, until they finally met a number of Nicarao nobles, who apologised for the hostile reception.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 63\u201364.</ref> Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila accepted the apology, due to the vulnerability of his forces. They spent the next night in a state of alert upon a hilltop; the next day they continued their retreat in defensive formation, crossing lands abandoned by the Indians until they reached the safety of their ships on the Pacific coast. Andr\u00e9s Ni\u00f1o had returned to the anchorage a few days previously, but all the ships were in poor repair and the Spanish expedition was forced to make the arduous journey back to Panama in canoes.

The new expedition was a private enterprise under royal commission; the participants signed the two-year contract on 22 September 1523, with one third of the spoils to go to Pedrarias D\u00e1vila, and one sixth each to auditor Diego Marquez, treasurer Alonso de la Puente, lawyer Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Alarconcillo, and [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]].

Sandoval was under orders to either capture Rojas, or expel him from Honduras, but in the event was unable to do either.<ref name=\"Sarmiento1990,2006p21\"/> While the two groups were still gathered, Rojas received orders from Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba to return to Nicaragua to assist him against his rebellious captains.<ref name=\"Sarmiento1990,2006p22\">Sarmiento 1990, 2006, p. 22.</ref>\n\nHern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba sent a second expedition into Honduras, carrying letters to the [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|''Audiencia'' of Santo Domingo]] and to the Crown, searching for a good location for a port on the Caribbean coast, to provide a link to Nicaragua. The expedition was intercepted and captured by Sandoval, who sent some of the Nicaraguan party back to Cort\u00e9s at Trujillo.<ref name=\"Chamberlain1953,1966p18\"/> They informed Cort\u00e9s of a plan by Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba to set himself up in Nicaragua independently of Pedrarias in Panama.<ref>Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Cort\u00e9s responded courteously and offered supplies while the expedition was passing through Honduras, but sent letters advising Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba to remain loyal to Pedrarias.<ref name=\"Chamberlain1953,1966p19\">Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 19.</ref>\n\nHern\u00e1ndez was able to collect a substantial amount of gold in Nicaragua, collecting more than 100,000 ''pesos'' of gold in a single expedition; this was consequently seized by Pedrarias.<ref>Ibarra Rojas 2001, p. 95.</ref> In May 1524, Hern\u00e1ndez sent a brigantine back to Panama with the [[Royal fifth]], which amounted to 185,000 gold ''pesos''.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 83.</ref> By 1525, Spanish power had been consolidated in western Panama, and reinforcements had arrived from [[Nat\u00e1, Cocl\u00e9|Nat\u00e1]], in Panama, which had become a key port of call for shipping between Nicaragua and Panama.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 90, 92.</ref>\n\n===Intrigue in Nicaragua, late 1525===\nThe friendly contacts between Cort\u00e9s and Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba were viewed with deep suspicion by those in Le\u00f3n who were remained loyal to Pedrarias, such as Hernando de Soto, Francisco de Compa\u00f1\u00f3n, and Andr\u00e9s de Garabito. These officers may also have been motivated by ambition to view Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's contact with Cort\u00e9s as treachery against Pedrarias.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 106-107.</ref> Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's position in Nicaragua was consolidated by his foundation of three colonial towns there, although his contract for conquest specifically limited his license to two years from the day he sailed from Panama. Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's growing claim over the territory may also have caused Pedrarias to view his contacts with Cort\u00e9s with deep suspicion, and a threat to Pedrarias' own claim.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 108.</ref>\n\nRumours, encouraged by Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's enemies, spread quickly in the colony that he was plotting with Cort\u00e9s.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 108.

There he established a base of operations, and the indigenous inhabitants received him in peace; from these Pedrarias learned that Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba had evacuated Bruselas a few days previously.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p110\"/> Pedrarias waited in Chira for reinforcements led by Hernando de Soto, who marched overland from Panama with two units of infantry and cavalry.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p111\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 111.</ref> Pedrarias arrested his wayward lieutenant and ordered his execution.<ref name=\"Staten2010p16\"/>\n\nIn 1526, Pedrarias was replaced as governor of Castilla del Oro; [[Diego L\u00f3pez de Salcedo]], governor of Honduras, took advantage of the change in leadership to extend his jurisdiction to include Nicaragua. He marched to Nicaragua with 150 men to impose his authority. He arrived in Le\u00f3n in spring of 1527, and was accepted as governor by [[Mart\u00edn de Estete]], Pedrarias' lieutenant there. His poor government soured relations with the colonists, and provoked the restless natives of northern Nicaragua into open revolt against Spanish authority.<ref>Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 22.</ref> [[Pedro de los R\u00edos y Guti\u00e9rrez de Aguayo|Pedro de los R\u00edos]], the new governor in Panama, moved into Nicaragua to challenge L\u00f3pez de Salcedo, but was rejected by the colonists and was ordered back to Panama by the governor of Honduras.<ref>Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> Meanwhile, Pedrarias had vociferously protested to the Spanish crown over his loss of governorship of Castilla del Oro, and in recompense was given the governorship of Nicaragaua. L\u00f3pez de Salcedo prepared to retreat back to Honduras, but was prevented by Mart\u00edn de Estete and the Nicarguan colonists, who now pledged their allegiance to Pedrarias.

He immediately imprisoned L\u00f3pez de Salcedo and held him for almost a year, refusing to allow him to return to Honduras. Eventually his release was negotiated by intermediaries, and he renounced all claims to territory beyond a line from [[Cape Gracias a Dios]] to Le\u00f3n and the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. L\u00f3pez de Salcedo returned to Honduras as a broken man early in 1529. This agreement settled the jurisdictional disputes between Nicaragua and Honduras.<ref name=\"Chamberlain1953,1966p23\"/>\n\nHe introduced European farming methods and became infamous for his harsh treatment of the natives.<ref name=\"Staten2010p16\"/> In 1528 to 1529, friar [[Francisco de Bobadilla (Mercedarian friar)|Francisco de Bobadilla]] of the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian Order]] was very active, and baptised over 50,000 natives among the Subtiaba, [[Diria]], and Nicarao.<ref name=\"Newson1982p257\"/>\n\n==Central Highlands, 1530\u20131603==\nIn 1530, an alliance of Matagalpa tribes launched a concerted attack against the Spanish, with the intention of burning the colonial settlements.

Modern studies tend to use the term Taguzgalpa to refer to that part of the region that falls within the modern borders of Honduras, and Tologalpa to refer to that part that falls within Nicaragua.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> However, the distinction is not clear, and some Spanish documents referred to Taguzgalpa as including Tologalpa. From the second half of the 17th century, both regions were together referred to as ''[[La Mosquitia (Nicaragua)|Mosquitia]]'' or the [[Mosquito Coast]]. Very little is known about the original inhabitants of Mosquitia, beyond that they included the [[Jicaque people|Jicaque]], Miskito, and Paya.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn 1508, [[Diego de Nicuesa]] was given the governorship of [[Veragua]], a region stretching from the Gulf of Urab\u00e1 (in modern [[Colombia]]) to [[Cape Gracias a Dios]], on the current border between Nicaragua and Honduras.<ref name=\"Garc\u00edaA\u00f1overos1988p53\">Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 53.</ref> In 1534, a license to conquer and colonise the region was issued to [[Felipe Guti\u00e9rrez (conquistador)|Felipe Guti\u00e9rrez]], who abandoned his plans to settle the area.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, pp. 53\u201354.</ref> In 1545, governor of Guatemala [[Alonso de Maldonado]] wrote to the king of Spain, explaining that Taguzgalpa was still beyond Spanish control, and that its inhabitants were a threat to those Spanish living on the borders of the region. In 1562, a new license of conquest was issued to the governor of Honduras, [[Alonso Ortiz de Elgueta]], who sent pilot Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00edn to scout the coast from Trujillo as far as the mouth of the San Juan River. Mart\u00edn founded the settlement of Elgueta on the shore of [[Caratasca Lagoon]] (in Honduran Taguzgalpa), which was soon moved inland, to vanish from history. Around the same time, Juan D\u00e1vila launched several self-funded expeditions into the interior of Tologalpa, without success.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 54.</ref>\n\nIn 1641 or 1652, a shipwrecked [[slave ship]] gave rise to the [[Miskito Sambu]], when surviving Africans intermixed with the indigenous coastal groups. The Miskito Sambu developed strong ties to English colonists that settled in [[Jamaica]] from 1655 onwards, and with groups of English colonists that had settled along the Mosquito Coast. They became the dominant coastal group, allying or subjugating other groups in the region.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 52.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] declared itself independent of Spain in 1821, most of Mosquitia was still outside of Spanish control.<ref name=\"Garc\u00edaA\u00f1overos1988p53\"/>\n\n==Legacy of the conquest==\nWithin a century of the conquest, the Nicarao were effectively eliminated by a combination of the [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|slave trade]], disease, and warfare.<ref name=\"Fowler1985p38\"/> It is estimated that as many as half a million slaves were exported from Nicaragua before 1550, although some of these had originally come from other parts of Central America.<ref>Newson 1982, pp. 255\u2013256.</ref> Although Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila had initially recovered a significant amount of gold, Spanish hopes of extracting great quantities of gold from the province proved ephemeral.<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p239\">Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 239.</ref> Even when sources of gold were found, the collapse of native population levels meant that the Spanish were unable to work the mines.

Before European contact in the early 16th century, Nicargua was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples. In the west, these included Mesoamerican groups such as the [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]], the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]], and the [[Subtiaba people|Subtiaba]]. Other groups included the [[Matagalpa people|Matagalpa]] and the [[Tacacho people|Tacacho]].\n\n[[Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila]] first entered what is now Nicaragua in 1522, with the permission of [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]], governor of [[Castilla de Oro]] (modern [[Panama]]) but was driven back to his ships by the Chorotega. In 1524, a new expedition led by [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] founded the Spanish towns of [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. The western portions of Nicaragua along the Pacific littoral plain received the brunt of the Spanish activity in the territory for the next three decades.<ref>Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 231.</ref> Within a century of the conquest, the native inhabitants had been all but eliminated due to war, disease, and exportation as slaves.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nicaragua CIA map.gif|thumb|right|Map of Nicaragua]]\nNicaragua is the largest country in Central America, covering an area of {{convert|129494|km2|sqmi}} \u2013 or {{convert|120254|km2|sqmi}} without including the surface area of its two largest lakes. The country is bordered to the north by [[Honduras]], and to the south by [[Costa Rica]]; it is bordered to the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and to the east by the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=\"Merril1993a\">Merril 1993a.</ref> Nicaragua is divided into three broad regions, the Pacific Lowlands in the west, the Central Highlands, and the Caribbean Lowlands in the east.<ref name=\"Newson1982p261\">Newson 1982, p. 261.</ref> The Pacific lowlands are largely a coastal plain extending approximately {{convert|75|km|mi}} inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A chain of volcanoes extends from the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] southeast towards Lake Nicaragua; many of them are active. The volcanoes lie along the western edge of a [[rift valley]] running southeast from the Gulf to the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]], which forms a part of the border with Costa Rica. The two largest lakes in Central America dominate the rift valley: [[Lake Managua]] and [[Lake Nicaragua]]. Lake Managua measures {{convert|56|by|24|km|mi}}, and Lake Nicaragua measures {{convert|160|by|75|km|mi}}. The [[Tipitapa River]] flows south out of Lake Managua and into Lake Nicaragua, which empties into the Caribbean via the San Juan River.<ref name=\"Merril1993a\"/> The Central Highlands reach altitudes of up to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]], and consist of generally east-west running ranges that include the [[Cordillera Dariense]], [[Cordillera Dipilto and Jalapa Natural Reserve|Cordillera de Dipilto]], [[Cordillera Isabelia|Cordillera Isabella]], the [[Huap\u00ed Mountains]], and the [[Yolaina Natural Reserve|Yolaina Mountains]].<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p234\">Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 234.</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nIn central Nicaragua, the temperature varies between {{convert|20|and|25|C|F}}; rainfall averages {{convert|1000|to|2000|mm|in}} per year. There is a four-month dry season, with the rain season lasting throughout the rest of the year. Before the conquest, the Central Highlands were covered with [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|coniferous forest]].<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p234\"/> The Pacific coastal plain is classified as [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]], and features fertile volcanic soils. The Atlantic lowlands receive higher rainfall; the soils are less fertile, and the region is classified as [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forest]].<ref name=\"Salamanca2012p7\">Salamanca 2012, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Nicaragua before the conquest==\nWhen the Spanish first arrived in what is now Nicaragua there were three principal indigenous groups living in the western portions of the country; these were the [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (also known as the Mangue),<ref name=\"Fowler1985p38\"/> the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]], and the [[Matagalpa people|Matagalpa]] (also known as Chontal, from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] term for \"foreigner\").<ref>Staten 2010, pp. 14\u201315. Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 233.</ref> The Nicarao were a [[Nahuat]]-speaking [[Mesoamerica]]n people that had migrated southwards from central Mexico from the 8th century AD onwards. They broke off from the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] around the early 13th century and settled in pockets of western Nicaragua along the Pacific coast, with their heaviest concentration in what is now the [[Departments of Nicaragua|department]] of [[Rivas Department|Rivas]].<ref>Fowler 1985, pp. 37\u201338.</ref> The Chorotega were also a Mesoamerican people that had migrated from Mexico.

The first century after Spanish contact witnessed the demographic collapse of the native populations, resulting principally from exposure to [[Old World]] diseases and their exportation as slaves, but also from a combination of war and mistreatment.<ref>Staten 2010, p. 15.</ref> \n99% of the Native population of western [[Nicaragua]] perished over the course of 60 years causing some modern scholars to refer to the Spanish conquest as a [[genocide]] or [[holocaust (disambiguation)|holocaust]].<ref>Grenke 2005, p. 142. Churchill 1999, p. 433.</ref>\n\n===Native weapons and tactics===\nThe Spanish described the Matagalpa as being well-organised, with ordered battle-lines.

Mounted conquistadors were armed with a {{convert|12|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} [[lance]], that also served as a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] for infantrymen. A variety of [[halberd]]s and [[Bill (weapon)|bills]] were also employed. As well as the one-handed broadsword, a {{convert|5.5|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} long two-handed version was also used.<ref name=\"Pohl&Hook2008p26\">Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 26.</ref> Crossbows had {{convert|2|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} arms stiffened with hardwoods, horn, bone and cane, and supplied with a stirrup to facilitate drawing the string with a crank and pulley.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in the humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region.<ref>Pohl and Hook 2008, p. 27.</ref>\n\nMetal armour was of limited use in the hot, wet tropical climate.

He invited the Spaniards to lodge near the city plaza and the two leaders exchanged gifts; Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila wrote that he received the equivalent of 15,000 gold ''castellanos''. The Spanish captain gifted Nicarao with silk clothing and many other items brought from Spain. Over the course of the next few days, the Spanish instructed the natives in the basics of Christian religion. He claimed that after this, the natives wished to convert to the new religion, and that just over 9000 people were baptised in one day, including adults and children of both genders.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p57\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 57.</ref> After several days in the Nicarao capital, Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila learned of [[Lake Nicaragua]], and he sent a small detachment of soldiers to confirm its existence; he then travelled in person with 15 foot soldiers and 3 mounted soldiers. Among those who went with him to the lakeshore were the expedition's treasurer Andr\u00e9s de Cereceda, and friar Diego de Ag\u00fcero.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 59.</ref>  On 12 April 1523 they claimed the lake for the Spanish Crown under the name of ''Mar Dulce'' (\"sweet sea\").<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila sent out a canoe to scout the lake for a short distance, and questioned the natives as to whether it connected with the sea, without receiving any clear response; nonetheless, the Spanish were convinced that the lake must have an outlet to the Caribbean Sea, and that they had discovered a new route across the Central American isthmus.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A great many natives came to see newly arrived Europeans, driven by curiosity about their strange appearance and mode of dress, and horses, which the natives had never seen before.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p61\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 61.</ref>\n\n===Opposition and retreat===\nFrom Quauhcapolca, Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila advanced to the indigenous settlement of Coatega,<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p61\"/> near the [[Mombacho]] volcano,<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p63\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 63.</ref> where he was met by another powerful ruler, [[Diriangen|Diriang\u00e9n]], leader of the Chorotega.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 61.

He returned on 17 April at midday, arrayed for battle. The Spanish were alerted to the surprise attack by one of the local natives; even so a violent struggle ensued that resulted in the wounding of various Spanish defenders. The use of their small number of horses assisted them, since they struck fear into the enemy. The Chorotega attack was beaten off, and Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila immediately sent messengers to call back an advance party consisting of friar Ag\u00fcero accompanied by a number of soldiers, who had been advancing towards Diriang\u00e9n's territory. The violent opposition of the Chorotega convinced Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila and his officers to turn back with the gold they had already collected.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 62.</ref> They marched back south through Nicarao territory, by now suspicious of all indigenous activity. They took up a defensive formation, in a compact group with a single mounted soldier on each side. In the main group, sixty of the fittest soldiers went ready for battle, while the wounded travelled with the supplies, gold, and native porters in the centre.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p63\"/> They were met with passively hostile reactions from the natives they passed, until they finally met a number of Nicarao nobles, who apologised for the hostile reception.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 63\u201364.</ref> Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila accepted the apology, due to the vulnerability of his forces. They spent the next night in a state of alert upon a hilltop; the next day they continued their retreat in defensive formation, crossing lands abandoned by the Indians until they reached the safety of their ships on the Pacific coast. Andr\u00e9s Ni\u00f1o had returned to the anchorage a few days previously, but all the ships were in poor repair and the Spanish expedition was forced to make the arduous journey back to Panama in canoes.

The new expedition was a private enterprise under royal commission; the participants signed the two-year contract on 22 September 1523, with one third of the spoils to go to Pedrarias D\u00e1vila, and one sixth each to auditor Diego Marquez, treasurer Alonso de la Puente, lawyer Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Alarconcillo, and [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]].

The expedition was intercepted and captured by Sandoval, who sent some of the Nicaraguan party back to Cort\u00e9s at Trujillo.<ref name=\"Chamberlain1953,1966p18\"/> They informed Cort\u00e9s of a plan by Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba to set himself up in Nicaragua independently of Pedrarias in Panama.<ref>Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Cort\u00e9s responded courteously and offered supplies while the expedition was passing through Honduras, but sent letters advising Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba to remain loyal to Pedrarias.<ref name=\"Chamberlain1953,1966p19\">Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 19.</ref>\n\nHern\u00e1ndez was able to collect a substantial amount of gold in Nicaragua, collecting more than 100,000 ''pesos'' of gold in a single expedition; this was consequently seized by Pedrarias.<ref>Ibarra Rojas 2001, p. 95.</ref> In May 1524, Hern\u00e1ndez sent a brigantine back to Panama with the [[Royal fifth]], which amounted to 185,000 gold ''pesos''.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 83.</ref> By 1525, Spanish power had been consolidated in western Panama, and reinforcements had arrived from [[Nat\u00e1, Cocl\u00e9|Nat\u00e1]], in Panama, which had become a key port of call for shipping between Nicaragua and Panama.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 90, 92.</ref>\n\n===Intrigue in Nicaragua, late 1525===\nThe friendly contacts between Cort\u00e9s and Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba were viewed with deep suspicion by those in Le\u00f3n who were remained loyal to Pedrarias, such as Hernando de Soto, Francisco de Compa\u00f1\u00f3n, and Andr\u00e9s de Garabito. These officers may also have been motivated by ambition to view Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's contact with Cort\u00e9s as treachery against Pedrarias.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, pp. 106-107.</ref> Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's position in Nicaragua was consolidated by his foundation of three colonial towns there, although his contract for conquest specifically limited his license to two years from the day he sailed from Panama. Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's growing claim over the territory may also have caused Pedrarias to view his contacts with Cort\u00e9s with deep suspicion, and a threat to Pedrarias' own claim.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 108.</ref>\n\nRumours, encouraged by Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's enemies, spread quickly in the colony that he was plotting with Cort\u00e9s.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 108. Staten 2010, p. 16.</ref> About a dozen supporters of de Soto and Compa\u00f1\u00f3n secretly plotted against Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba; he responded by seizing de Soto and imprisoning him in Granada.<ref>Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 109.</ref> De Soto and Compa\u00f1\u00f3n fled Nicaragua with several companions, and took word to Pedrarias in Panama, arriving there in January 1526.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p110\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 110.</ref>\n\n==Pedrarias D\u00e1vila in western Nicaragua, 1526\u20131529==\nPedrarias set out from Nata by sea with soldiers and artillery, and landed on the island of [[Chira Island|Chira]], in the Gulf of Nicoya, opposite the colonial settlement of Bruselas on the mainland (then within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua, but now in Costa Rica). There he established a base of operations, and the indigenous inhabitants received him in peace; from these Pedrarias learned that Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba had evacuated Bruselas a few days previously.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p110\"/> Pedrarias waited in Chira for reinforcements led by Hernando de Soto, who marched overland from Panama with two units of infantry and cavalry.<ref name=\"Mel\u00e9ndez1976p111\">Mel\u00e9ndez 1976, p. 111.</ref> Pedrarias arrested his wayward lieutenant and ordered his execution.<ref name=\"Staten2010p16\"/>\n\nIn 1526, Pedrarias was replaced as governor of Castilla del Oro; [[Diego L\u00f3pez de Salcedo]], governor of Honduras, took advantage of the change in leadership to extend his jurisdiction to include Nicaragua. He marched to Nicaragua with 150 men to impose his authority. He arrived in Le\u00f3n in spring of 1527, and was accepted as governor by [[Mart\u00edn de Estete]], Pedrarias' lieutenant there. His poor government soured relations with the colonists, and provoked the restless natives of northern Nicaragua into open revolt against Spanish authority.<ref>Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 22.</ref> [[Pedro de los R\u00edos y Guti\u00e9rrez de Aguayo|Pedro de los R\u00edos]], the new governor in Panama, moved into Nicaragua to challenge L\u00f3pez de Salcedo, but was rejected by the colonists and was ordered back to Panama by the governor of Honduras.<ref>Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> Meanwhile, Pedrarias had vociferously protested to the Spanish crown over his loss of governorship of Castilla del Oro, and in recompense was given the governorship of Nicaragaua. L\u00f3pez de Salcedo prepared to retreat back to Honduras, but was prevented by Mart\u00edn de Estete and the Nicarguan colonists, who now pledged their allegiance to Pedrarias. L\u00f3pez de Salcedo's officials were arrested.<ref name=\"Chamberlain1953,1966p23\">Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 23.</ref>\n\nLe\u00f3n became the capital of the Nicaraguan colony, and Pedrarias transferred there as governor of the province in 1527.<ref name=\"Staten2010p16\"/> Pedrarias arrived in Le\u00f3n in March 1528, and was accepted everywhere as the rightful governor. He immediately imprisoned L\u00f3pez de Salcedo and held him for almost a year, refusing to allow him to return to Honduras. Eventually his release was negotiated by intermediaries, and he renounced all claims to territory beyond a line from [[Cape Gracias a Dios]] to Le\u00f3n and the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. L\u00f3pez de Salcedo returned to Honduras as a broken man early in 1529. This agreement settled the jurisdictional disputes between Nicaragua and Honduras.<ref name=\"Chamberlain1953,1966p23\"/>\n\nHe introduced European farming methods and became infamous for his harsh treatment of the natives.<ref name=\"Staten2010p16\"/> In 1528 to 1529, friar [[Francisco de Bobadilla (Mercedarian friar)|Francisco de Bobadilla]] of the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian Order]] was very active, and baptised over 50,000 natives among the Subtiaba, [[Diria]], and Nicarao.<ref name=\"Newson1982p257\"/>\n\n==Central Highlands, 1530\u20131603==\nIn 1530, an alliance of Matagalpa tribes launched a concerted attack against the Spanish, with the intention of burning the colonial settlements. In 1533, Pedrarias D\u00e1vila requested reinforcements to pursue the Matagalpa and punish their revolt, in order to discourage neighbouring peoples from allying with them against the Spanish.<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p236\">Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 236.</ref>\n\nBy 1543, Francisco de Casta\u00f1eda founded [[Ocotal|Nueva Segovia]] in north-central Nicaragua, some 30 leagues from Le\u00f3n.<ref name=\"CardozaS\u00e1nchez2017p56\">Cardoza S\u00e1nchez 2017, p. 56.</ref> By 1603, the Spanish had established their dominion over seventeen indigenous settlements in the north-central region that the Spanish named Segovia.

Modern studies tend to use the term Taguzgalpa to refer to that part of the region that falls within the modern borders of Honduras, and Tologalpa to refer to that part that falls within Nicaragua.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> However, the distinction is not clear, and some Spanish documents referred to Taguzgalpa as including Tologalpa. From the second half of the 17th century, both regions were together referred to as ''[[La Mosquitia|Mosquitia]]'' or the [[Mosquito Coast]]. Very little is known about the original inhabitants of Mosquitia, beyond that they included the [[Jicaque people|Jicaque]], Miskito, and Paya.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn 1508, [[Diego de Nicuesa]] was given the governorship of [[Veragua]], a region stretching from the Gulf of Urab\u00e1 (in modern [[Colombia]]) to [[Cape Gracias a Dios]], on the current border between Nicaragua and Honduras.<ref name=\"Garc\u00edaA\u00f1overos1988p53\">Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 53.</ref> In 1534, a license to conquer and colonise the region was issued to [[Felipe Guti\u00e9rrez (conquistador)|Felipe Guti\u00e9rrez]], who abandoned his plans to settle the area.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, pp. 53\u201354.</ref> In 1545, governor of Guatemala [[Alonso de Maldonado]] wrote to the king of Spain, explaining that Taguzgalpa was still beyond Spanish control, and that its inhabitants were a threat to those Spanish living on the borders of the region. In 1562, a new license of conquest was issued to the governor of Honduras, [[Alonso Ortiz de Elgueta]], who sent pilot Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00edn to scout the coast from Trujillo as far as the mouth of the San Juan River. Mart\u00edn founded the settlement of Elgueta on the shore of [[Caratasca Lagoon]] (in Honduran Taguzgalpa), which was soon moved inland, to vanish from history. Around the same time, Juan D\u00e1vila launched several self-funded expeditions into the interior of Tologalpa, without success.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 54.</ref>\n\nIn 1641 or 1652, a shipwrecked [[slave ship]] gave rise to the [[Miskito Sambu]], when surviving Africans intermixed with the indigenous coastal groups. The Miskito Sambu developed strong ties to English colonists that settled in [[Jamaica]] from 1655 onwards, and with groups of English colonists that had settled along the Mosquito Coast. They became the dominant coastal group, allying or subjugating other groups in the region.<ref>Garc\u00eda A\u00f1overos 1988, p. 52.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] declared itself independent of Spain in 1821, most of Mosquitia was still outside of Spanish control.<ref name=\"Garc\u00edaA\u00f1overos1988p53\"/>\n\n==Legacy of the conquest==\nWithin a century of the conquest, the Nicarao were effectively eliminated by a combination of the [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|slave trade]], disease, and warfare.<ref name=\"Fowler1985p38\"/> It is estimated that as many as half a million slaves were exported from Nicaragua before 1550, although some of these had originally come from other parts of Central America.<ref>Newson 1982, pp. 255\u2013256.</ref> Although Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila had initially recovered a significant amount of gold, Spanish hopes of extracting great quantities of gold from the province proved ephemeral.<ref name=\"IbarraRojas1994p239\">Ibarra Rojas 1994, p. 239.</ref> Even when sources of gold were found, the collapse of native population levels meant that the Spanish were unable to work the mines.

He was introduced to composition and performance in the theater at the university. With college friends, guitarist Mexico-American Eugene Rodr\u00edguez and Argentine Pablo Asl\u00e1n, he formed a bassist trio called \"Now\". This trio played traditional Latin American music and songs at college events, bars, and university spaces.<ref name=\"EnCaribe\"/> He graduated from Santa Cruz in 1986 and subsequently worked in theater with \"[[El Teatro De La Esperanza]]\" in San Francisco, California, and El Teatro Campesino with [[Luis Valdez]] (producer of [[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]). One of his most important experiences during this period was to perform in a bilingual theater for immigrant children, which resulted in his concert and album ''Para Los Chiquitos''.<ref name=\"m1\"/>\n\n== Honduras career ==\n\nIn 1987 Guillermo returned to Honduras. Guillermo first received widespread recognition with his acoustic guitar and two [[Garifuna]] drummers.<ref name=\"m4\">{{cite web| url = http://www.honduras.com/guillermo-anderson-honduran-singer-songwriter-world-famous-music-artist/|title = Guillermo Anderson \u2013 Honduran Singer, songwriter, World Famous Music Artist|date=October 3, 2011  | accessdate = October 10, 2017|publisher=Honduras.com |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref> He created La Ceiba COLECTIVARTES, an artist movement with other group of artists, and invited other artists from Europe and USA to perform different works on La Ceiba. The most popular of these works was \"Sabor A Sombra\", based on [[Nelson Merren]] poetry.\n\nAfter this, Guillermo started to make concerts and performances on festivals like \"Aires de Abril\" on Tegucigalpa and country sides of Honduras. During this era, Anderson made his first records of songs like; \"Retratos\" and \"En Mi Pa\u00eds\" that recorded on cassettes that sell at his concerts. He often traveled to forest areas of Honduras, among them, [[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]] a kind of Central American [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonia]] where he recovered their musical traditions.\n\n== Tours ==\n\nWhile performing in concerts in Tegucigalpa, Guillermo Anderson attracted the attention of foreign service officials from various countries and received invitations to festivals such as the \"Cervantino International Festival\" of Mexico and a concert at the \"Memorial for Latin America,\" in San Pablo, Brazil. These two festivals gave rise to other invitations that propelled his career as a singer-songwriter.\n\nThe first release that Anderson announced in Honduras was \"En Mi Pa\u00eds\", a song in which Anderson \"tries to come to terms with returning to a country like Honduras, so full of contradictions.\" Anderson launched his career from La Ceiba with a prediction that it would not be possible to do so from there. But what seemed a weakness became a strength in the sense that a good part of the appeal of his work and the invitations he received from elsewhere in the world were because he worked from his roots in a city by the sea, in the little known Honduran Caribbean.\n\nAnother theme, \"El Encarguito\", is a song that celebrates the culinary diversity of Honduras and comments on the nostalgia of Honduran immigrants for their traditional foods. This release describes the typical foods that relatives send to Central American immigrants, which sometimes end up seized at US and European Customs. The song has become very popular among Honduran immigrants abroad. It was inspired by Anderson's curiosity to test the diversity of food in Honduras and his experience living abroad and missing the culinary flavors of his homeland.\n\nWith a solid discography of 12 productions and an extensive career, Anderson was constantly touring in Honduras and abroad. His music was and continues to be heard in Panama Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, United States of America, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. In Europe he performed in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, England and Holland. In Asia he received applause in Japan where he made 2 tours of 30 cities. He also toured Taiwan and South Korea. The presentations were sometimes voice and guitar and other times an intense show that performed with his group.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Aguilar|first1=Wendy|title=Guillermo Anderson: \"Soy un hondure\u00f1o de La Ceiba que hace canciones y ama a su pa\u00eds\"|trans-title=Guillermo Anderson: \u201cI am a Honduran from La Ceiba who writes songs and loves his country\u201d |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/vida/772535-220/guillermo-anderson-soy-un-hondure\u00f1o-de-la-ceiba-que-hace-canciones-y|accessdate=December 27, 2017|work=El Heraldo|date=November 30, 2014|location=Tegucigalpa, Honduras|language=es}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Guillermo Anderson in Concert\">\nGuillermo Anderson en concierto.jpg\nOtro momento de sus conciertos.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Discography ==\nGuillermo Andersons performances merged diverse music styles including [[parranda]], [[punta]], [[reggae]], and [[Salsa music|salsa]] as well as [[latin jazz]] and rock,<ref name=\"m4\"/> resulting in a style that has been described as \"a combination of Afro-Caribbean percussions with contemporary sounds, local rhythms, and folklore of Honduras\u2019 coastal regions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusiccentral.org/2004/11/17/guillermo-anderson-will-play-costa-rica%C2%B4s-festival-internacional-de-las-artes/|title=Guillermo Anderson will Play at Costa Rica's Festival Internacional de las Artes|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=World Music Central.org|date=November 17, 2004|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}</ref> His songs are stories are about daily life and struggles of ordinary people in Honduras.<ref name=\"m5\"/> Guillermo Anderson's song ''En mi pa\u00eds'', released on the ''Pobre Marinero'' album in 2000, has become an alternative national anthem of Honduras, and his children's songs are sung throughout schools in Honduras.

Wallrafen settled in La Ceiba to capture historical moments of the city, reflecting in his photographs the development of the Honduran Caribbean, the banana industry, the railroad, and domestic and daily life. On these themes, Escoto wrote fifteen texts, full of humor, irony, and signs of identity. Guillermo Anderson was inspired by both materials to create a new compact disc with ambient sounds and songs, among them his first bolero. The design was by professor Luis Garc\u00eda Bueno.\n\nAn intensive collaboration carried out between 2001 and 2002 resulted in this literary work, containing 140 pages with 40 color photographs, hard bound in a wide format, with compact disc. The two bilingual editions, one Spanish-English edition and another Dutch-English edition, published by Koninklijk Instituut Voor De Tropen in 2002, were the first of their kind in Europe.<ref>{{cite book  |last1=Escoto|first1=Julio |last2=Anderson |first2=Guillermo|last3=Wallrafen|first3=Hannes |year=2002 |title=Del Tiempo Y El Tropico &ndash; Honduras of Time and the Tropics|publisher=Koninklijk Instituut Voor De Tropen |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9068325264|pages=128}}</ref>\n\n=== Bordeando La Costa ===\n\n''Bordeando La Costa'' (Bordering the Coast) contains stories of the sea and its characters: seagulls, dolphins, cayucos, mermaids, stars of the sky and of the water, birds that swim, fish that fly, winds that sing, storms whistling and turning away, children with light and dark eyes, incognito lights and bearded sailors who pipe human while holding the string with which they fish in the depth of hope.\n\nWhimsically written, this walk along the Honduran Caribbean coast is a sweet and ideal trip, in his beautiful words and beautiful drawings of Guillermo Anderson.

These are 18 instrumental and sung compositions that Anderson composed for the play ''Ese mortal llamado Moraz\u00e1n (That mortal called Moraz\u00e1n)'', a stage show presented in 1992 at the National Theater and Cultural Center Sampedrano, but not made again because Guillermo considered that the recording was of low quality and he would record it again in study. He never did.\n\nThe work is based on the novel \"General Moraz\u00e1n marches from the death\", by Julio Escoto, which the ballet master Flor Alvergue choreographed in 1992 a ballet of modern style for the celebration of the bicentenary of birth of [[Francisco Moraz\u00e1n]]. Those who know this artistic composition of Anderson think that it is a work of great intellectual depth, with much feeling and nostalgia, to such a degree that some of the songs that comprise it, such as Moraz\u00e1n's complaint that politics has distanced his love from Mary Josefa, his wife, caused tears in the auditorium, in 1992.\n\nOther titles deal with the popular march directed to save the Federal Republic in 1829 (\"Two thousand men marking Guatemala\"), the claim of the hero not to be considered only as a military man but as a statesman (\"Do not draw me with that sword \") And the most intense and final, which is the testament of the hero, where he claims the injustice of his execution in Costa Rica, urges the young people to save the republic and declare their love for Central America.\n\nAfter the technical cleaning of the audio system with modern systems, in February 2017 Costa Norte Records, in conjunction with Centro Editorial, offered Anderson's collectors and music lovers a limited edition of this unpublished disc, entitled \"That mortal called Moraz\u00e1n \", accompanied by a special edition of the book of Scotus, so that the listener can follow the sequence between literature and the lyrical and rhythmic creation of Guillermo.\n\n=== La fiesta en el bosque : gu\u00eda de trabajo con los ni\u00f1os ===\n\nA book of ideas for activities to be used in conjunction with the songs on the sound cassette ''La Fiesta en el Bosque''.<ref>{{cite book  |last1=Anderson|first1=Guillermo |last2=Sierra|first2=R\u00edgel |year=1992|title=La fiesta en el bosque : gu\u00eda de trabajo con los ni\u00f1os|trans-title=The party in the forest: guide to work with children|publisher=Editorial Guaymuras |location=Tegucigalpa|language=es}}</ref>\n\n== Tributes and achievements ==\n\nAs an artist, Guillermo Anderson participated in education, health, tourism, environment, and cultural heritage projects. Notably among these:\n\n* He participated in HIV prevention campaigns.\n* His work Mujer Canci\u00f3n Mujer (edited by the Instituto de La Mujer de Honduras in 2005) presents the role of women in songs that are used in self-esteem workshops women organize to generate discussion on the role of women in Honduran society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alwari.wordpress.com/2008/12/12/mujer-cancion-mujer-guillermo-anderson-honduras/|title=\"\u2026mujer canci\u00f3n mujer\u2026\" Guillermo Anderson \u2013 Honduras|trans-title=woman song woman|language=es|publisher=Alwari|date=December 12, 2008|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKnown in Honduras for his music for children, Anderson's work enjoys an important audience in elementary schools, many of which teach songs from his compact disc \"Para los chiquitos\". The disc presents in a pedagogical way fundamental concepts of ecology and familiarizes the children with species of the endangered tropical fauna.\n\nOver 10 years, Guillermo Anders often visited the region of La Mosquitia to pursue concerns about the ecology of the Rio Pl\u00e1tano. He made a complete production on this topic and from this work people and governments began to pay attention to the Rio Pl\u00e1tano environment.\n\nAmong last achievements was creation of the \"C\u00edrculo juvenil de tambores de La Ceiba\" project. The purpose of this project was to prevent violence among young people between 13 and 18 years who lived in vulnerable neighborhoods of the city. With the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the project brought together young men and women and trained them in traditional Gar\u00edfuna percussion. In addition to being an ensemble that participated in the cultural life of La Ceiba, this activity was accompanied by workshops of self-esteem, coexistence, gender and other personal and artistic expressions.

One of his most important experiences during this period was to perform in a bilingual theater for immigrant children, which resulted in his concert and album ''Para Los Chiquitos''.<ref name=\"m1\"/>\n\n== Honduras career ==\n\nIn 1987 Guillermo returned to Honduras. Guillermo first received widespread recognition with his acoustic guitar and two [[Garifuna]] drummers.<ref name=\"m4\">{{cite web| url = http://www.honduras.com/guillermo-anderson-honduran-singer-songwriter-world-famous-music-artist/|title = Guillermo Anderson \u2013 Honduran Singer, songwriter, World Famous Music Artist|date=October 3, 2011  | accessdate = October 10, 2017|publisher=Honduras.com |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref> He created La Ceiba COLECTIVARTES, an artist movement with other group of artists, and invited other artists from Europe and USA to perform different works on La Ceiba. The most popular of these works was \"Sabor A Sombra\", based on [[Nelson Merren]] poetry.\n\nAfter this, Guillermo started to make concerts and performances on festivals like \"Aires de Abril\" on Tegucigalpa and country sides of Honduras. During this era, Anderson made his first records of songs like; \"Retratos\" and \"En Mi Pa\u00eds\" that recorded on cassettes that sell at his concerts. He often traveled to forest areas of Honduras, among them, [[La Mosquitia]] a kind of Central American [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonia]] where he recovered their musical traditions.\n\n== Tours ==\n\nWhile performing in concerts in Tegucigalpa, Guillermo Anderson attracted the attention of foreign service officials from various countries and received invitations to festivals such as the \"Cervantino International Festival\" of Mexico and a concert at the \"Memorial for Latin America,\" in San Pablo, Brazil. These two festivals gave rise to other invitations that propelled his career as a singer-songwriter.\n\nThe first release that Anderson announced in Honduras was \"En Mi Pa\u00eds\", a song in which Anderson \"tries to come to terms with returning to a country like Honduras, so full of contradictions.\" Anderson launched his career from La Ceiba with a prediction that it would not be possible to do so from there. But what seemed a weakness became a strength in the sense that a good part of the appeal of his work and the invitations he received from elsewhere in the world were because he worked from his roots in a city by the sea, in the little known Honduran Caribbean.\n\nAnother theme, \"El Encarguito\", is a song that celebrates the culinary diversity of Honduras and comments on the nostalgia of Honduran immigrants for their traditional foods. This release describes the typical foods that relatives send to Central American immigrants, which sometimes end up seized at US and European Customs. The song has become very popular among Honduran immigrants abroad. It was inspired by Anderson's curiosity to test the diversity of food in Honduras and his experience living abroad and missing the culinary flavors of his homeland.\n\nWith a solid discography of 12 productions and an extensive career, Anderson was constantly touring in Honduras and abroad. His music was and continues to be heard in Panama Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, United States of America, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. In Europe he performed in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, England and Holland. In Asia he received applause in Japan where he made 2 tours of 30 cities. He also toured Taiwan and South Korea. The presentations were sometimes voice and guitar and other times an intense show that performed with his group.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Aguilar|first1=Wendy|title=Guillermo Anderson: \"Soy un hondure\u00f1o de La Ceiba que hace canciones y ama a su pa\u00eds\"|trans-title=Guillermo Anderson: \u201cI am a Honduran from La Ceiba who writes songs and loves his country\u201d |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/vida/772535-220/guillermo-anderson-soy-un-hondure\u00f1o-de-la-ceiba-que-hace-canciones-y|accessdate=December 27, 2017|work=El Heraldo|date=November 30, 2014|location=Tegucigalpa, Honduras|language=es}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Guillermo Anderson in Concert\">\nGuillermo Anderson en concierto.jpg\nOtro momento de sus conciertos.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Discography ==\nGuillermo Andersons performances merged diverse music styles including [[parranda]], [[punta]], [[reggae]], and [[Salsa music|salsa]] as well as [[latin jazz]] and rock,<ref name=\"m4\"/> resulting in a style that has been described as \"a combination of Afro-Caribbean percussions with contemporary sounds, local rhythms, and folklore of Honduras\u2019 coastal regions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusiccentral.org/2004/11/17/guillermo-anderson-will-play-costa-rica%C2%B4s-festival-internacional-de-las-artes/|title=Guillermo Anderson will Play at Costa Rica's Festival Internacional de las Artes|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=World Music Central.org|date=November 17, 2004|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}</ref> His songs are stories are about daily life and struggles of ordinary people in Honduras.<ref name=\"m5\"/> Guillermo Anderson's song ''En mi pa\u00eds'', released on the ''Pobre Marinero'' album in 2000, has become an alternative national anthem of Honduras, and his children's songs are sung throughout schools in Honduras.

Wallrafen settled in La Ceiba to capture historical moments of the city, reflecting in his photographs the development of the Honduran Caribbean, the banana industry, the railroad, and domestic and daily life. On these themes, Escoto wrote fifteen texts, full of humor, irony, and signs of identity. Guillermo Anderson was inspired by both materials to create a new compact disc with ambient sounds and songs, among them his first bolero. The design was by professor Luis Garc\u00eda Bueno.\n\nAn intensive collaboration carried out between 2001 and 2002 resulted in this literary work, containing 140 pages with 40 color photographs, hard bound in a wide format, with compact disc. The two bilingual editions, one Spanish-English edition and another Dutch-English edition, published by Koninklijk Instituut Voor De Tropen in 2002, were the first of their kind in Europe.<ref>{{cite book  |last1=Escoto|first1=Julio |last2=Anderson |first2=Guillermo|last3=Wallrafen|first3=Hannes |year=2002 |title=Del Tiempo Y El Tropico &ndash; Honduras of Time and the Tropics|publisher=Koninklijk Instituut Voor De Tropen |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9068325264|pages=128}}</ref>\n\n=== Bordeando La Costa ===\n\n''Bordeando La Costa'' (Bordering the Coast) contains stories of the sea and its characters: seagulls, dolphins, cayucos, mermaids, stars of the sky and of the water, birds that swim, fish that fly, winds that sing, storms whistling and turning away, children with light and dark eyes, incognito lights and bearded sailors who pipe human while holding the string with which they fish in the depth of hope.\n\nWhimsically written, this walk along the Honduran Caribbean coast is a sweet and ideal trip, in his beautiful words and beautiful drawings of Guillermo Anderson. Published in 2002 in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.<ref>{{cite web|title=BANPA\u00cdS reimprime libro de Guillermo Anderson Bordeando la Costa|trans-title=BANPA\u00cdS reprints Guillermo Anderson's book Bordering the Coast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gVQvfpcAWU|via=YouTube|publisher=Telenoticias Honduras|year=2002|language=es|medium=video|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book  |last=Anderson|first=Guillermo|year=2002 |title=Bordeando la costa|trans-title=Bordering the Coast|publisher=Centro Editorial|language=es|location=San Pedro Sula}}</ref>\n\n=== Ese mortal llamado Moraz\u00e1n ===\n\nCosta Norte Records published unpublished artistic material of Guillermo Anderson on the anniversary of his birthday, February 26, 2017. These are 18 instrumental and sung compositions that Anderson composed for the play ''Ese mortal llamado Moraz\u00e1n (That mortal called Moraz\u00e1n)'', a stage show presented in 1992 at the National Theater and Cultural Center Sampedrano, but not made again because Guillermo considered that the recording was of low quality and he would record it again in study. He never did.\n\nThe work is based on the novel \"General Moraz\u00e1n marches from the death\", by Julio Escoto, which the ballet master Flor Alvergue choreographed in 1992 a ballet of modern style for the celebration of the bicentenary of birth of [[Francisco Moraz\u00e1n]]. Those who know this artistic composition of Anderson think that it is a work of great intellectual depth, with much feeling and nostalgia, to such a degree that some of the songs that comprise it, such as Moraz\u00e1n's complaint that politics has distanced his love from Mary Josefa, his wife, caused tears in the auditorium, in 1992.\n\nOther titles deal with the popular march directed to save the Federal Republic in 1829 (\"Two thousand men marking Guatemala\"), the claim of the hero not to be considered only as a military man but as a statesman (\"Do not draw me with that sword \") And the most intense and final, which is the testament of the hero, where he claims the injustice of his execution in Costa Rica, urges the young people to save the republic and declare their love for Central America.\n\nAfter the technical cleaning of the audio system with modern systems, in February 2017 Costa Norte Records, in conjunction with Centro Editorial, offered Anderson's collectors and music lovers a limited edition of this unpublished disc, entitled \"That mortal called Moraz\u00e1n \", accompanied by a special edition of the book of Scotus, so that the listener can follow the sequence between literature and the lyrical and rhythmic creation of Guillermo.\n\n=== La fiesta en el bosque : gu\u00eda de trabajo con los ni\u00f1os ===\n\nA book of ideas for activities to be used in conjunction with the songs on the sound cassette ''La Fiesta en el Bosque''.<ref>{{cite book  |last1=Anderson|first1=Guillermo |last2=Sierra|first2=R\u00edgel |year=1992|title=La fiesta en el bosque : gu\u00eda de trabajo con los ni\u00f1os|trans-title=The party in the forest: guide to work with children|publisher=Editorial Guaymuras |location=Tegucigalpa|language=es}}</ref>\n\n== Tributes and achievements ==\n\nAs an artist, Guillermo Anderson participated in education, health, tourism, environment, and cultural heritage projects. Notably among these:\n\n* He participated in HIV prevention campaigns.\n* His work Mujer Canci\u00f3n Mujer (edited by the Instituto de La Mujer de Honduras in 2005) presents the role of women in songs that are used in self-esteem workshops women organize to generate discussion on the role of women in Honduran society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alwari.wordpress.com/2008/12/12/mujer-cancion-mujer-guillermo-anderson-honduras/|title=\"\u2026mujer canci\u00f3n mujer\u2026\" Guillermo Anderson \u2013 Honduras|trans-title=woman song woman|language=es|publisher=Alwari|date=December 12, 2008|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKnown in Honduras for his music for children, Anderson's work enjoys an important audience in elementary schools, many of which teach songs from his compact disc \"Para los chiquitos\". The disc presents in a pedagogical way fundamental concepts of ecology and familiarizes the children with species of the endangered tropical fauna.\n\nOver 10 years, Guillermo Anders often visited the region of La Mosquitia to pursue concerns about the ecology of the Rio Pl\u00e1tano. He made a complete production on this topic and from this work people and governments began to pay attention to the Rio Pl\u00e1tano environment.\n\nAmong last achievements was creation of the \"C\u00edrculo juvenil de tambores de La Ceiba\" project. The purpose of this project was to prevent violence among young people between 13 and 18 years who lived in vulnerable neighborhoods of the city. With the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the project brought together young men and women and trained them in traditional Gar\u00edfuna percussion. In addition to being an ensemble that participated in the cultural life of La Ceiba, this activity was accompanied by workshops of self-esteem, coexistence, gender and other personal and artistic expressions. The purpose was to create a creative space where ideas were respected and young people could learn tolerance and conflict resolution.\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* 2002&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;Anderson was named \"Embajador cultural de Honduras ante el mundo por el pueblo y gobierno de Honduras (Honduran cultural ambassador to the world for the people and government of Honduras)\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.revistaestilo.net/gente/987289-444/guillermo-anderson-el-hondure%C3%B1o-que-vino-del-mar|title=Guillermo Anderson el hondure\u00f1o que vino del mar|trans-title=Guillermo Anderson the Honduran who came from the sea|language=es|publisher=Estilo|last=Valladares|first=Ethel|date=August 6, 2016|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://redescritoresporlatierra.org/2015/05/galardonados-premis-ones-3-guillermo-anderson-el-cantautor-que-puso-musica-a-honduras/|title=Galardonados Premis Ones (3): Guillermo Anderson, el cantautor que puso m\u00fasica a Honduras|trans-title=Winners Premis Ones (3): Guillermo Anderson, the singer-songwriter who put music in Honduras|language=es|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=Red International de Escritores por la tierra|date=May 15, 2015|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* 2003&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;\"Premio Nacional de Arte (National Art Award)\" by the ''Ministry of Education of Honduras''.\n* 2003&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;\"Premio Cop\u00e1n de Turismo (Copan Tourism Award)\" by the ''C\u00e1mara Nacional de Turismo'' for promoting Honduras around the world.\n* 2005&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;\"Premio Identidad Nacional 2005 (National Identity Award 2005)\" by the ''Museo para la Identidad Nacional''.\n* 2008&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;The [[Secretary of State for Culture, Arts and Sports]] awarded Anderson with \"La Orden Laurel de Oro\" for his contribution to Honduran culture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://recorriendoamericanews.com/guillermo-anderson-cantautor-catracho-que-llevo-su-musica-por-el-mundo-fallecio/|title=Guillermo Anderson, Cantautor Hondure\u00f1o Que Llev\u00f3 Su M\u00fasica Por El Mundo Falleci\u00f3|trans-title=Guillermo Anderson, Honduran Songwriter Who Carried His Music Around the World Died|language=es|last=Valladares|first=Kenia|publisher=Recorriendo Am\u00e9rica news|date=August 8, 2016|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* 2008&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;\"Martin Luther King Jr Award\" from the ''Martin Luther King Jr Foundation''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laprensa.hn/vivir/694283-97/otro-premio-para-anderson|title=Otro Premio para Anderson: Guillermo Anderson recibe el garlard\u00f3n \"Martin Luther King\"|trans-title=Another Award for Anderson: Guillermo Anderson receives the Martin Luther King award|language=es|publisher=La Prensa|date=April 7, 2008|last=Rodr\u00edguez|first=Carlos}}</ref> \n* 2015&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;\"Premio Ones Mediterrania\" from the ''Fundaci\u00f3 Mediterr\u00e1nia''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/entretenimiento/898885-466/m%C3%BAsica-catracha-con-sello-de-exportaci%C3%B3n|title=M\u00fasica catracha con sello de exportaci\u00f3n|trans-title=Honduran music with export stamp|language=es|publisher=El Heraldo|date=August 11, 2015|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line-->|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref>{{efn|name=\"onemediterranean\"|The Fundaci\u00f3 Mediterr\u00e1nia is an organization headquartered in Tarragona Spain that is dedicated to promoting environmental and social actions at the international level.

These companies quickly made bananas the primary [[export]] of the country in return for large land grants from conservative politicians. Foreign [[capital (economics)|capital]], life in the [[banana plantation]]s, and conservatives determined the politics of Honduras from the mid-20th century to 1988.\n\n[[Manuel Bonilla]] came to the presidency of Honduras through a military operation. Once in power, he became an even better friend of the banana companies than his predecessor, [[Terencio Sierra]]. He gave the banana companies tax breaks and permission to build a variety of [[infrastructure]], including the [[Rail transport in Honduras|National Railway of Honduras]]. One of Bonilla's greater accomplishments was the delimitation of the border with Nicaragua, especially in the area of [[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]] where there had been a long dispute.<ref name=\"Monthly Bulletin, Honduras\">\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jp03AQAAIAAJ\n|title=United States Congressional serial set \n|via=Google Books\n|accessdate=2016-06-15\n|year=1907 \n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Miguel R.

However, from 1920 to 1923, there were seventeen uprisings or attempted [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coups d'\u00e9tat]] in Honduras. This contributed even more to the political instability of the country.\n\n[[Vicente Mej\u00eda Colindres]] assumed power in 1929 with big hopes for his administration and his nation. Honduras seemed to direct its course toward political and economic progress. But many of Mej\u00eda Colindres's hopes were dispelled with the start of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nDoctor and General [[Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]] governed Honduras as a [[dictator]] during the Great Depression, until 1948. Under his government, the fiscal situation of the country improved notably, the armed forces were modernized, and he slightly improved the education system and infrastructure of Honduras. He also brought order and a relative peace to Honduras, although he used repression to do so. Pressured by the government of the [[United States]], General Car\u00edas allowed free elections. Nevertheless, Car\u00edas found ways to use his influence and nominated lawyer [[Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]] as the candidate for the [[National Party of Honduras]].\n\nJuan Manuel G\u00e1lvez won election unopposed. During his term in office, G\u00e1lvez continued most of the fiscal policies of the Car\u00edas administration, reduced external debt and paid off the last of the British [[bond (finance)|bond]]s. The fruit companies continued to receive sweetheart deals from the G\u00e1lvez government. Additionally, education received more attention and a larger share of the national budget.\n\nIn the political arena, a considerable degree of [[freedom of press]] was restored. The Liberal Party was allowed to reorganise, along with other political groups. Likewise, workers also benefited during his administration.\n\n==Banana republic==\n\n===Grants and the 1902 election===\n[[File:La_ceiba.jpg|left|thumb|260x260px| Railway Station in El Ceiba at the beginning of the 20th century]]\n{{See also|Banana production in Honduras}}\nGeneral [[Terencio Sierra]] succeeded [[Policarpo Bonilla]] in 1899. His administration gave Honduras one of the more important historical factors in the economic life and politics of the country. Marvin Barahona in his book ''Honduras in the 20th century'' relates that \"the Vaccaro brothers, a family of Italian origin that traded bananas in [[New Orleans]], received land grants on the north coast. In return, they agreed to build railways over an extensive area.

This constitution stipulated that the presidential term of office would be six instead of four years, as Bonilla's circle hoped to govern without hindrance until 1912.<ref name=\"Presidentes de Honduras\"/> The new constitution went into effect on January 1, 1906.\n\n=== Government and attainments of Bonilla ===\n[[File:Manuel_Bonilla.jpg|right|thumb|242x242px|Manuel Bonilla]]\n[[Manuel Bonilla]], as president, turned out to be an even better friend to the banana companies than [[Terencio Sierra]]. During his term, the banana companies won exemptions from taxes and obtained permission to build docks, roads, and canals, to [[River engineering|canalize]] the Salado and El Porvenir rivers, and to construct a [[Rail transport in Honduras|new railway]].<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/ |title=Honduras |website=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref> Among Bonilla's accomplishments are infrastructure improvements, especially to roadways, and in particular to the road from [[Tegucigalpa]] to the Pacific coast. On the international front, Bonilla made pacts of friendship with Nicaragua, and later with Guatemala and El Salvador.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/> He reorganised the conservatives into a single political party. The current [[National Party of Honduras]] (PNH) has its origins in his administration.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nPerhaps the greatest of Bonilla's achievements was the delimitation of the border with [[Nicaragua]], especially in the zone of [[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]], where there had been a long dispute.<ref name=\"Monthly Bulletin, Honduras\"/> In 1894, a treaty provided for the creation of a boundary commission with members from both Honduras and Nicaragua to resolve the dispute. Before 1904, the commission had only agreed on the lower part of the border. In 1904, in order to reach an agreement about the upper part of the border, the representatives of the two nations turned to [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII of Spain]] as a neutral party to the dispute.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nHis decision, announced in 1906, gave the greater part of the territory in dispute to Honduras, establishing the upper border along the [[Coco River|River Coco]]. At the time, both governments accepted the decision, although in 1912, Nicaragua raised new objections which were resolved in 1960, in favor of King Alfonso's arbitration.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n=== Fall of Bonilla ===\n[[File:Chicago_(protected)._Port_bow,_1891_-_NARA_-_512893.tif|left|thumb|200x200px|USS ''Chicago'']]\nIn 1906, Manuel Bonilla successfully resisted an invasion from Guatemala, but this was his last big success. The pact of friendship that he signed in 1906 with Guatemala and El Salvador was interpreted as an anti-Nicaraguan alliance by President [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]] of [[Nicaragua]]. Zelaya began to offer support to the liberal exiles of Honduras in his country in an effort to overthrow Manuel Bonilla, who had become, in effect, a dictator. With the support of elements of the Army of Nicaragua, the exiles invaded Honduras in February 1907 and established a provisional government.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nBonilla tried to resist with the help of Salvadorian forces, but in March, his forces were defeated decisively. The battle was particularly notable as the introduction of machine guns to the civil conflicts of Central America. The [[United States]] disapproved of the role played by Nicaraguan president Zelaya in the internal affairs of Honduras. When the Nicaraguan army entered Honduras in 1907, the American government, thinking that Zelaya wanted to dominate the entire region, sent marines to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] to protect the banana businesses. Other naval units were sent to [[Amapala]] in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] to prevent attacks against the last-occupied positions of Manuel Bonilla, who took refuge on the {{USS|Chicago|1885|6}}. With this, the fight against Bonilla came to an end.\n\nThe [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in [[Tegucigalpa]] played an active role in the organisation of a peace treaty, which displeased Zelaya. The treaty installed a provisional government composed of [[Miguel Oquel\u00ed Bustillo]], M\u00e1ximo Rosales Betancourt and Juan Ignacio Castro, until the end of March 1907.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n== The Peace Treaty of 1907 ==\n\n=== Election of Miguel Rafael D\u00e1vila ===\n[[File:Central_American_Peace_Conference.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|The 1907 Central American Peace Conference]]\nOn April 28, 1907, the provisional government gave control to [[Miguel R. D\u00e1vila|Miguel Rafael D\u00e1vila Cu\u00e9llar]], who had been vice-president under [[Manuel Bonilla]]. D\u00e1vila summoned a [[constituent assembly]], which re-established the constitution of 1894 and called elections. D\u00e1vila was elected president for the 1908\u201312 term.<ref name=\"Conflict in Central America\">\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Conflict_in_Central_America.html?id=CaF6AAAAMAAJ \n|title=Conflict in Central America \n|author=Helen Schooley \n|date=1987-01-01 \n|accessdate=2016-06-15\n|isbn=9780582902749 \n}}\n</ref>\n\nMiguel R. D\u00e1vila did not have the confidence of Nicaraguan president [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]]. The prospect of new conflicts caught the attention of the American president, [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

Honduras proposed to reestablish the [[Union of Central American States]], but this was not accepted.{{who|date=May 2018}} However, other measures were adopted. The five presidents signed the [[General Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1907]] and established the [[Permanent Central American Court of Justice]], to resolve future disputes.\n\nThe treaty also committed the five countries to restrict the activities of exiles from neighbouring states and put in place a basis for legal [[extradition]]s. Of special interest was a clause, sponsored by the United States, which established the permanent neutrality of [[Honduras]] in future Central American conflicts.\n\nThe five states pledged to deny recognition to governments that came to power by revolutionary means. The United States and Mexico, who had acted as co-sponsors of the conference, also pledged to deny recognition to such governments. From the point of view of the US State Department, these agreements represented an important step in the stabilisation of Central America and of Honduras in particular.\n\nThe first challenge to this treaty came in Honduras in 1908; opponents of D\u00e1vila, with the support of Guatemala and El Salvador, invaded the country. Nicaragua supported the Honduran president, and war seemed imminent. But in fear of an American intervention, the parties involved agreed to subject the controversy to the new Central American Court. The court ultimately denied the complaints of Honduras and Nicaragua, and rebellion against of D\u00e1vila was controlled. With this, peace in Honduras briefly returned.\n\n=== D\u00e1vila and the external debt ===\n[[File:William_Howard_Taft.jpg|right|thumb|194x194px|William Howard Taft]]\nDuring his administration, Miguel D\u00e1vila tried to modernize the country, but in addition to struggling against the opposition, the president had the difficult task of leading at a time when the external debt of Honduras had reached US$120 million. According to the administration of US president [[William Howard Taft]], the debt was a factor that contributed to the political and social unsteadiness of the country. Because of this, D\u00e1vila initiated efforts to repay the debt, much of it owed to England.\n\nNegotiations were organised between the representatives of Honduras and the bankers of New York, led by [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan.]] At the end of 1909, an agreement was reached to reduce the debt and issue new bonds at 5% [[interest]]. In exchange, the bankers would control the railway of Honduras, and the government of United States would control customs revenue, while still guaranteeing the independence of the Honduran state.\n\nIn Honduras, great opposition to the terms proposed by the bankers weakened the government of D\u00e1vila even more. When he tried to carry out the terms of the agreement, this was seen by the Hondurans as a violation of national sovereignty. For this reason, in a rare show of independence, the [[National Congress of Honduras]] initially refused the proposals by a vote of thirty-three to five. But D\u00e1vila continued pressing the Congress until they approved.\n\n=== Renunciation of President D\u00e1vila ===\nIn the midst of all the problems facing D\u00e1vila's administration, he wanted to put an end to the generous concessions granted to fruit companies.<ref name=\"Honduras by International Bureau of the American Republics\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cl3UAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA157\n|title=Monthly Bulletin of the International Bureau of the American Republics ... \n|accessdate=2016-06-15|year=1908 \n}}</ref> This provoked the wrath of [[Sam Zemurray|Samuel Zemurray]], the owner of the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], who determined to fund a revolution against D\u00e1vila in order to overthrow him.

He immediately called on his forces to confront the forces of former President Bonilla, however, the US government offered to mediate in the conflict. From February 21 to March 15, 1911, representatives from both sides met on board the [[USS Tacoma (CL-20)|USS ''Tacoma'']] in the bay of [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]],.<ref name=\"Honduras: an area study in government.\">\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRwPAAAAYAAJ\n|title=Honduras: an Area Study in Government \n|author=William Sylvane Stokes |date=2007-10-11 \n|accessdate=2016-06-15|isbn=9780837158136 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Banana cultures: agriculture, consumption, & environmental change in Honduras & the United States\">\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIIX4WeSR8YC\n|title=Banana Cultures: Agriculture, Consumption, and Environmental Change in ... \n|author=John Soluri \n|date= 2009-03-06\n|accessdate=2016-06-15|isbn=9780292777873 \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe revolutionaries headed by ex-president Manuel Bonilla and the D\u00e1vila government agreed to a cease-fire, with the forced resignation of president D\u00e1vila and the installation of a provisional president.

Francisco Bertrand, who had been his vice-president, returned to the presidency and in 1916 won election for a term that lasted until 1920. The Bertrand government represented mostly the American interests on the national level, accepted the mediation of United States in the resolution of the border conflict with Guatemala and also in the back conflict by two regions adjoining with Nicaragua (The trojes and Potrerillos).<ref name=\"Partidos pol\u00edticos de Am\u00e9rica Latina:\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzQ3fJ3W8e4C&pg=PA250|title=Partidos pol\u00edticos de Am\u00e9rica Latina.

This contributed even more to the already increasing worry of the [[United States]] about the political unsteadiness in Central America. In August 1922, the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador gathered on the {{USS|Tacoma|CL-20|6}} in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]], under the attentive eye of the ambassadors of the United States to these countries. The presidents promised once again to prevent that their territories were used to promote revolutions against their neighbours. Likewise it did them a called to all the countries, to gather in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] at the end of the year.{{clarify|date=November 2016}} Apart from all this, in September 1920 the first national [[Strike action|strike]], the workers of the company \"Vaccaro Brother Company\" with headquarters in [[La Ceiba]] in the department of Atl\u00e1ntida organised to demand adjustment of wages.\n\nThe Washington conference concluded in February with the approval of the [[General Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1923]]. This treaty reorganised the Central American Court and ratified a lot of dispositions from the treaty of 1907. The clause of non-recognition of revolutionary governments was extended; Likewise, the rulers engaged once again not to intervene in the affairs of their neighbours.\n\nThis same meeting promoted agriculture and free trade. It limited arms and established a limit on the size of the military strengths of each country (2.500 men for Honduras). United States engaged to look for the foreign help for professionalization of the armed forces.\n\n=== Elections and American intervention ===\n[[File:USS_Denver.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|USS Denver]]\nPresidential elections in Honduras in October 1923 and subsequent political and military conflicts provided the first challenges for these new agreements. Under strong pressure from Washington, L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez allowed free elections. The very fragmented conservatives united under the flag of the [[National Party of Honduras]] (PNH). These chose the governor of Cort\u00e9s, [[Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]] as their candidate. Whereas the liberal party (PLH) was divided in two currents: one supported ex-president [[Policarpo Bonilla]], and others the candidacy of [[Juan \u00c1ngel Arias Boqu\u00edn]]. When carrying out the elections, Car\u00edas received the most votes (49,953). Bonilla (35,474 votes) was second and Arias (20,839 votes) remained in a distant third place. But nobody got the majority required by the Constitution of Honduras. Then it fell to the Congress to convene and take a decision. But the members did not reach agreement.\n\nIn January 1924, L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez announced his intention to remain in charge until new elections could be held, but never gave a specific date. Facing this situation, Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino, apparently with the support of the [[United Fruit Company]], proclaimed himself president, and a new armed conflict burst. In February the government of United States warned that any person getting power by revolutionary means would not be recognized. At the same time it suspended relations with L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez for not carrying out the elections.\n\nConditions deteriorated quickly in the first months of 1924. On 28 February, a battle took place in [[La Ceiba]] between government troops and the rebels. Even the presence of the [[S.S. Denver]] and the landing of a force of U.S. [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] were unable to prevent looting and arson that made more than US$2 million in property damage. Fifty people, among them a US citizen, died in the fighting. In the following weeks, additional ships of the United States Navy concentrated in Honduran waters, to protect American interests.\n\n=== General Vicente Tosta ===\n[[File:St_Charles_Ave_CBD_Fidelity_Fruit_Co_Bldg.JPG|right|thumb|240x240px|Former building of the United Fruit Co.]]\nA marine force and sailors were sent all the way to the interior to [[Tegucigalpa]] to offer additional protection to the delegation of the United States. Shortly before their arrival, [[Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez]] died, and control of the country fell to the cabinet.<ref name=\"Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.historiadehonduras.hn/presidentes/rafaellopezgutierrez.htm \n|title=Gobernantes de Honduras: Rafael Lopez Gutierrez \n|website=Historiadehonduras.hn \n|date= \n|accessdate=2016-06-15\n}}\n</ref> General Car\u00edas and other rebel leaders controlled the greater part of the battlefield, but did not coordinate their activities with sufficient efficiency to seize the capital.\n\nIn an effort to put an end to the fighting, the government of United States sent [[Sumner Welles]] to the port of [[Amapala]]. Welles had instructions to produce a satisfactory agreement according to the treaty of 1923, and convey power to somebody that could be recognized legally. The negotiations, once again held on board the ''USS Milwaukee'', lasted from 23 to 28 April. In the end they came to the agreement to set up a provisional government headed by the general [[Vicente Tosta|Vicente Tosta Carrasco]], who agreed to appoint a cabinet representing all the political factions and to summon a Constituent Assembly within ninety days in order to restore constitutional order. The constitution of 1924 was promulgated during the reign of this government.\n\nThe presidential elections had to be held as soon as possible. Tosta himself promised to refrain from running. Once in office, Tosta showed signs of not wanting to fulfill some of his promises. But under strong pressure from the US delegation, he had to comply in the end with the provisions of the peace agreement.\n\nKeeping the elections to a clear-cut date proved to be a difficult task. To exert pressure on Tosta, the United States set an arms embargo on Honduras and forbade the government to give him access to the credit - that included a loan of US$75.000 from the Bank Atl\u00e1ntida S.A.. Also, the United States convinced El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua to keep the treaty of 1923 and not to recognize any revolutionary leader as president.\n\nThese pressures finally helped persuade Car\u00edas to withdraw his candidacy. It also helped to ensure the defeat of an uprising headed by the General Gregorio Ferrera of the PNH.<ref name=\"The banana empire: a case study of economic imperialism\">\n{{cite book\n|title=The banana empire: a case study of economic imperialism\n|author=Kepner, Charles David\n|date=1935\n|publisher=Russell & Russell\n|location=New York\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Miguel Paz Barahona ===\nThe National Party (PNH) nominated [[Miguel Paz Barahona]] to the presidency.

He also supported granting family plots to the peasant sector. He also promoted public education, for which he used prisons and barracks. Nevertheless, the alliance with US interests remained intact. His government persecuted journalists and citizens opposed to the United States.<ref name=\"Partidos pol\u00edticos de Am\u00e9rica Latina:\"/> In spite of a new minor uprising led by the general Ferrera in 1925, the administration of Paz Barahona was relatively calm.<ref name=\"The banana empire: a case study of economic imperialism\"/>\n\nMoreover, in March 1925 the workers of the ''Wit Azucarero'' in the municipality of [[La Lima]], in the department of Cort\u00e9s began to take to the streets, followed by other workers from the North coast and seconded by the employees of the \"Cuyamel Fruit Company\". The workers requested: weekly payments, working days of 8 hours and increases of wage.\n\nIn 1928 fears of new riots returned, as the end of the mandate of Paz Barahona approached. The PNH designated Tiburcio Car\u00edas as its presidential candidate, whereas the PLH appointed [[Vicente Mej\u00eda Colindres]], after the death of Dr. [[Policarpo Bonilla|Polycarp Bonilla.]] To the surprise of many observers, the electoral campaign as well as the elections were carried out with minimal acts of violence and intimidation.\n\n=== Vicente Mej\u00eda Colindres ===\nMej\u00eda Colindres obtained a decisive victory, winning 62,000 of the votes compared to the 47,000 gained by Car\u00edas.

Banana exports peaked in 1930, but afterwards diminished quickly. Thousands of workers were sacked, and the wages of those who remained were reduced, just as the prices paid to the independent banana producers by the giant banana companies. As the depression sharpened, the financial situation of the government deteriorated, and in 1931 Colindres Mej\u00eda was forced to borrow $250,000 from the fruit companies to ensure the army payroll.\n\n==The dictatorship of Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino==\n\n===Election of Car\u00edas===\n[[File:Fuerzas_Navales_de_Honduras.jpg|right|thumb|260x260px|The president Car\u00edas took special interest in the Armed forces of Honduras]]\n[[File:TiburcioCarias.JPG|left|thumb|255x255px|Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]]\nIn spite of increasing unrest and grave economic tensions, the elections of 1932 were relatively peaceful and just. In February 1932, the [[National Party of Honduras]] (PNH) nominated Car\u00edas as its presidential candidate; initially Venancio Alleys was nominated as vice-president but when he declined, Abraham Williams was appointed.<ref name=\"Tiburcio Car\u00edas: anatom\u00eda de una \u00e9poca, 1923-1948\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAqYWYMLiDEC&pg=PA6 |title=Tiburcio Car\u00edas: anatom\u00eda de una \u00e9poca |author=Mario Argueta |page=6 |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref> The liberals for their part appointed {{ILL|\u00c1ngel Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Huete|es}} as their candidate.

The General assumed power on 16 November 1932, in what would become the longest period of a single government, in the history of Honduras.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nInitially it was thought that the government of Car\u00edas, like that of his predecessors, would not survive for long. Shortly before his inauguration, liberal dissidents rose in rebellion. As Car\u00edas took control of the government forces, he obtained weapons in El Salvador and in quickly crushed the uprising.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nDuring the first part of his administration, Car\u00edas focused on avoiding financial collapse, improving the armed forces and building roads. At the same time he established the foundations to help him prolong his stay in the power.\n\nHonduras economy continued to be bad through the decade of the 1930s. In addition to the drastic fall in banana exports caused by the reduced consumer demand from The Great Depression<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LATKDLYKav4C&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=banana+exports+depression#v=onepage&q=banana%20exports%20depression&f=false|title=The Banana: Empires, Trade Wars, and Globalization|last=Wiley|first=James|date=2008|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-1637-2|language=en}}</ref>, the banana industry was threatened in 1935, by epidemics like the [[Black sigatoka|Black Sigatoka]]. In a year, extensive areas including those in the zone of Trujillo, were abandoned, and thousands of Hondurans remained without work. By 1937 the plague was under control but a lot of zones affected remained without production. Because of this, Honduras lost a big part of the international market.\n\nCar\u00edas had made an effort to improve the armed forces, even before he became president. Once in power, his motivation to continue his work increased. He gave special attention to the decadent Air Force by founding the Military School of Aviation (1934) with an American colonel in command.<ref name=\"Bananas, labor, and politics in Honduras, 1954-1963\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXIsAAAAMAAJ\n|title=Bananas, Labor, and Politics in Honduras: 1954-1963 \n|author=Robert MacCameron |date= \n|accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the passage of time, Car\u00edas moved slowly but without pause, to reinforce his power. He won the support of the banana companies through opposition to strikes and other labor riots. He strengthened his position in the national financial circles and with foreigners through conservative economic politics. Even at the peak the depression, he continued making regular payments on the external debt, adhering strictly to the terms of the agreement with the shareholders of British Bonds. Likewise, he satisfied the other creditors. Two small loans were paid completely in 1935.\n\n=== Repression ===\nPolitical controls were slowly initiated under the government of Car\u00edas. The [[Communist Party of Honduras]] (PCH) was declared illegal. But the [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (PLH) was still active. Even the leaders of a small uprising in 1935 were offered free aerial transport if they wished to return to Honduras.{{clarify|date=November 2016}}\n\nBy the end of 1935, emphasizing the need for internal order and peace, Car\u00edas began to [[Censorship in Honduras|repress the press]] and the political activities against him.<ref name=\"Bananas, labor, and politics in Honduras, 1954-1963\"/>\n[[File:Per\u00f3n_y_Somoza.JPG|right|thumb|247x247px|The relations between Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda and Car\u00edas were taut, because of border disputes]]\nOn the other hand, the PNH began a publishing campaign doing upsetting in the continuity of Car\u00edas so that it continued the peace and the order in the country. However the Constitution of 1924 like the one of 1894 forbade the reelection. Car\u00edas presented his plan of reelection in front of the delegation of the United States in Tegucigalpa. The Americans concluded that if similar governments had been established in Guatemala, The Saviour and Nicaragua, did not see why Car\u00edas could not extend his mandate. In this way United States threw by embroiders it{{clarify|date=November 2016}} the 'Treaty of 1923'.<ref name=\"Tiburcio Car\u00edas: portrait of a Honduran political leader\"/>\n\nThe General Car\u00edas then summoned to a national constituent assembly to modify the constitution. This assembly chosen to the 'dedazo' incorporated 30 articles of the Constitution of 1924 in the new constitution. The main changes were the elimination of the prohibition on the immediate reelection of the president and the vice-president and the extension of the presidential term from four to six years. Other changes included restoration of the death penalty, the reduction of the powers of legislature, and the denial of the citizenship and the right to the vote of women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/ho/hondurascountrys00merr_0/hondurascountrys00merr_0.pdf|title=Honduras: a country study|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe opposition Liberal Party (PLH) and other sectors reacted to these changes, treating to overthrow to Car\u00edas. Numerous efforts did in 1936 and 1937, but without success. For finals of the decade of 1930, the National Party was the only political organisation recognised in the nation. Numerous leaders opposition leaders were imprisoned, and some were chained and forced to work in the streets of [[Tegucigalpa]]. Others, including the leader of the PLH, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Huete, had exiled .\n\nDuring his presidency, Car\u00edas cultivated a narrow relation with his fellow dictators of Central America, generals: [[Jorge Ubico]] of Guatemala, [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]] of [[El Salvador]], and [[Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda]] of Nicaragua. His narrower relation was with the dictator Ubico, who helped to Car\u00edas to reorganise his secret police, and also captured and shot the leader of an uprising in Honduras who had committed the error of crossing into Guatemalan territory. The relations with Nicaragua were somewhat tenser in consequence of the border dispute. But Car\u00edas and Somoza succeeded in keeping under control this dispute along the years 1930 and 1940.\n\n=== Last period of Car\u00edas ===\nWhen winning the second period of six years, ratified the Article of the Constitution that prorrog\u00f3 the presidential period to said six years and the Presidency in the General headlines Car\u00edas and Williams until 31 December 1948.<ref name=\"Agresi\u00f3n y represi\u00f3n en contra de la ciudadan\u00eda\">{{cite web|url=http://histounahblog.wordpress.com/ |title=Histounahblog's Blog &#124; Por una Historia insclusiva, critica y revolucionaria |website=Histounahblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944 the bonds of Car\u00edas with these dictators turned into something not wanted, once that popular uprisings deposed to Situate of Guatemala and to the Salvadorian Mart\u00ednez Hern\u00e1ndez. During a time, seemed as if the revolutionary contagion extended to Honduras.\n\nA plot of civilians and military with the purpose to overthrow to Car\u00edas was discovered, but crushed by the government in 1943. In May 1944, a group of women began to protest out of the Presidential Palace of Tegucigalpa, to demand the release of the political prisoners. In spite of the strong measures taken by the government, the tension grew and Car\u00edas saw forced finally to free to some prisoners. This gesture did not satisfy to the opposition, and the demonstrations against the government followed extending.\n\nIn July several demonstrators were murdered by governmental troops in San Pedro Sula. In October, a group of exiled invaded to Honduras from The Saviour, but did not succeed in his efforts for overthrowing to the government. The soldiers remained loyal, and Car\u00edas continued in the charge.\n\n== Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez ==\n\n=== Election and exert of G\u00e1lvez ===\n[[File:Juan_Manuel_Galvez.jpg|right|thumb|197x197px|President, Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]]\nThe government of United States wanted to be done with problems in Central America. Therefore, it urged Car\u00edas to allow free elections once his current term ended. For that then, Car\u00edas, had more than seventy years. The general yielded to pressure and announced elections for October 1948, in which it would abstain to present as candidate. Nevertheless, Car\u00edas found ways to use his power.\n\nGeneral Carias nominated his ex-minister of war (1933), [[Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]] as a presidential candidate for the National Party. On the other hand, exiled opposition figures were authorised to return to Honduras. Of this form, the PLH, treating to surpass years of inactivity and division, nominated to \u00c1ngel Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Huete as its presidential candidate.\n\nBut the liberals, quickly convinced that they did not have any possibility of winning and, accusing to the government of manipulation of the electoral process, boycotted the elections. This gave to G\u00e1lvez a victory without opposition and in January 1949 he assumed the presidency.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nOnce president, G\u00e1lvez showed to be an independent person. Much more of what had anticipated . The president G\u00e1lvez adopted some policies of Car\u00edas, such as the construction of roads and the development of the exports of coffee. In 1953 almost a fourth part of the budget of the government devoted to the construction of roads.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nG\u00e1lvez also followed the greater part of the fiscal politics of the previous administration, the reduction of the external debt and paying off the last of the British bonds. The fruit companies followed receiving a good deal by part of G\u00e1lvez. For example, in 1949, United Fruit received a favourable agreement of twenty-five years.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nIn addition, G\u00e1lvez established some remarkable changes in comparison to the last fifteen years. The education that received greater attention and began to perceive a greater part of the national budget. The congress approved a law of income tax, although its application was sporadic at best.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThe most evident change was in the political sand. A considerable degree of freedom of press was restored. The Liberal Party was allowed to reorganise, as well as other political groups. The workers also benefited during this period. He established the working time of 8 hours, paid holidays paid, and responsibility of the employer for workplace safety and regulations of the employment of women and boys.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n=== The strike of 1954 ===\nThe relative peace that Honduras had enjoyed for almost two decades was destroyed by a series of events during the last year (1954) of G\u00e1lvez' term. Tension in the entire Central American region increased with a confrontation developed between the left-leaning government of President [[Jacobo \u00c1rbenz|Jacobo Arbenz Guzm\u00e1n]] of [[Guatemala]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nPart of this confrontation was due to the expropriation of land from the United Fruit Company by the Guatemalan government. Likewise United States accused the government of Arbenz Guzm\u00e1n of boosting the agitation among the workers of the Fruit Company.\nIn 1952 United States had considered taking action to overthrow the Guatemalan president. But the government of G\u00e1lvez, which had given asylum to opponents to this government between them [[Carlos Castillo Armas]], that did not wanted to cooperate in the direct actions against of Guatemala, and the plans were not activated.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThis was until principles of 1954, when a big covert operation developed in Honduran territory against the Guatemalan president. The government of Honduras had showed worry, because of the tensions between the workers of the banana industry and United Fruit. The administration of G\u00e1lvez concluded that this was due to the influence that the left-handed government of Guatemala had on the Honduran workers.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nFor principles of May 1954, the tensions had increased. In the first place, they gave a series of strikes against the operations of the [[United Fruit Company]] in the coast north of Honduras. To the few days, the strike extended and included the operations of the Standard Fruit Company, with which the banana sector of the country arrived to a deadlock.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThe strikers presented a wide range of complaints. Between which include : The increase of wage, better conditions of work, medical profits, payment of extra hours, and the right to the collective negotiation. The initial efforts of the government to put end to the strike failed and the unemployment began to extend to other industries. On 21 May, the number of strikers approached to 30.000, and the economy of the country was under a strong pressure.\n\nIn addition to having to deal with the strike, the government was increasingly involved in the movement to overthrow to the government of Arbenz in Guatemala. To finals of May, an agreement of military assistance subscribed between United States and Honduras, and big quantities of American arms were sent quickly to Honduras.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nBig part of this help received send to the rebellious anti-Arbenz headed by Castle Arm. In June these strengths crossed the border of Guatemala and after several days of political manoeuvres, and little armed fight, Arbenz escaped to the exile and Castle Arm took the power in this country.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nWith the overthrow of Arbenz finished the foreign influence between the Honduran workers. The strike finished in July of this year, the sindical leaders that had been accused to have bonds with Guatemala were imprisoned, but the banana companies yielded to some demands of the workers. This marked the beginning of a labour strength more organized and the decrease in the power of the companies fruteras.\n\n=== The constitutional crisis of 1954 ===\n[[File:Julio_Lozano_400.jpg|left|thumb|258x258px|Julio Lozano D\u00edaz]]\nIn the midst of these conflicts, campaigning for the elections of 1954 continued. Dissatisfied with some of G\u00e1lvez's policies towards liberalization, Car\u00edas decided to run for president despite his advanced age, ensuring the nomination of the PNH. This move, however, divided the party. The most moderate members separated from the party and formed the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR). Its candidate was ex-vice president [[Abraham Williams Calder\u00f3n]]. This division among the nationalists moved the Liberals to unite behind the candidacy of Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales, a doctor from Tegucigalpa.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/> The campaign as well as the elections were very free and honest<!-- Citation Needed -->. On 10 October 1954, roughly 260,000 of the more than 400,000 voters voted. Villeda Moral won the elections with 121,213 votes, Car\u00edas received 77,041, and Williams carried 53,041.\n\nThe Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH) also obtained the majority in the legislative body. But under the Constitution, Villeda did not obtain the necessary majority of votes to be president (-8000 votes). Something similar took place in 1924. This situation left  the decision to choose to the new president in the hands of the legislative body. To complicate things more, G\u00e1lvez went to Miami, purportedly to receive medical treatment, although some sources say that he simply fled the country, leaving the government in the hands of vice-president [[Julio Lozano D\u00edaz]].<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThe National Party (PNH) and the National Revolutionary Movement  (MNR) did not accept the election of Villeda and boycotted the legislative assembly, producing a constitutional crisis. According to the constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice had to choose the president. As the court was dominated by Car\u00edas appointees, the Liberal Party of Honduras was opposed to such a course of action. In this conjuncture, Lozano D\u00edaz suddenly suspended the legislative body and proclaimed himself president until new elections can take place.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of Honduras (1900-54)}}\n[[Category:History of Honduras]]\n[[Category:20th century in Honduras]]\n", "text_old": "{{mergeto|History of Honduras (1838\u20131932)|History of Honduras (1932\u201382)|discuss=Talk:History of Honduras (1900-1954)#Merge with History of Honduras (1838\u20131932) and History of Honduras (1932\u201382)|date=March 2020}}\n{{orphan|date=June 2016}}\n{{History of Honduras}}\n{{rough translation|1=Spanish|listed=yes|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Steamtrain2.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The National Railway of Honduras was an important part in the development of Honduras at the beginning of the 20th century]]\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the economy of [[Honduras]] was dominated by American companies such as the [[United Fruit Company]], the [[Standard Fruit Company]] and the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], which established enormous [[banana plantations]] along the north coast.

Once in power, he became an even better friend of the banana companies than his predecessor, [[Terencio Sierra]]. He gave the banana companies tax breaks and permission to build a variety of [[infrastructure]], including the [[Rail transport in Honduras|National Railway of Honduras]]. One of Bonilla's greater accomplishments was the delimitation of the border with Nicaragua, especially in the area of [[La Mosquitia]] where there had been a long dispute.<ref name=\"Monthly Bulletin, Honduras\">\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jp03AQAAIAAJ\n|title=United States Congressional serial set \n|via=Google Books\n|accessdate=2016-06-15\n|year=1907 \n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Miguel R.

However, from 1920 to 1923, there were seventeen uprisings or attempted [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coups d'\u00e9tat]] in Honduras. This contributed even more to the political instability of the country.\n\n[[Vicente Mej\u00eda Colindres]] assumed power in 1929 with big hopes for his administration and his nation. Honduras seemed to direct its course toward political and economic progress. But many of Mej\u00eda Colindres's hopes were dispelled with the start of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nDoctor and General [[Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]] governed Honduras as a [[dictator]] during the Great Depression, until 1948. Under his government, the fiscal situation of the country improved notably, the armed forces were modernized, and he slightly improved the education system and infrastructure of Honduras. He also brought order and a relative peace to Honduras, although he used repression to do so. Pressured by the government of the [[United States]], General Car\u00edas allowed free elections. Nevertheless, Car\u00edas found ways to use his influence and nominated lawyer [[Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]] as the candidate for the [[National Party of Honduras]].\n\nJuan Manuel G\u00e1lvez won election unopposed. During his term in office, G\u00e1lvez continued most of the fiscal policies of the Car\u00edas administration, reduced external debt and paid off the last of the British [[bond (finance)|bond]]s. The fruit companies continued to receive sweetheart deals from the G\u00e1lvez government. Additionally, education received more attention and a larger share of the national budget.\n\nIn the political arena, a considerable degree of [[freedom of press]] was restored. The Liberal Party was allowed to reorganise, along with other political groups. Likewise, workers also benefited during his administration.\n\n==Banana republic==\n\n===Grants and the 1902 election===\n[[File:La_ceiba.jpg|left|thumb|260x260px| Railway Station in El Ceiba at the beginning of the 20th century]]\n{{See also|Banana production in Honduras}}\nGeneral [[Terencio Sierra]] succeeded [[Policarpo Bonilla]] in 1899.

During his term, the banana companies won exemptions from taxes and obtained permission to build docks, roads, and canals, to [[River engineering|canalize]] the Salado and El Porvenir rivers, and to construct a [[Rail transport in Honduras|new railway]].<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/ |title=Honduras |website=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref> Among Bonilla's accomplishments are infrastructure improvements, especially to roadways, and in particular to the road from [[Tegucigalpa]] to the Pacific coast.

At the time, both governments accepted the decision, although in 1912, Nicaragua raised new objections which were resolved in 1960, in favor of King Alfonso's arbitration.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n=== Fall of Bonilla ===\n[[File:Chicago_(protected)._Port_bow,_1891_-_NARA_-_512893.tif|left|thumb|200x200px|USS ''Chicago'']]\nIn 1906, Manuel Bonilla successfully resisted an invasion from Guatemala, but this was his last big success. The pact of friendship that he signed in 1906 with Guatemala and El Salvador was interpreted as an anti-Nicaraguan alliance by President [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]] of [[Nicaragua]]. Zelaya began to offer support to the liberal exiles of Honduras in his country in an effort to overthrow Manuel Bonilla, who had become, in effect, a dictator. With the support of elements of the Army of Nicaragua, the exiles invaded Honduras in February 1907 and established a provisional government.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nBonilla tried to resist with the help of Salvadorian forces, but in March, his forces were defeated decisively. The battle was particularly notable as the introduction of machine guns to the civil conflicts of Central America. The [[United States]] disapproved of the role played by Nicaraguan president Zelaya in the internal affairs of Honduras. When the Nicaraguan army entered Honduras in 1907, the American government, thinking that Zelaya wanted to dominate the entire region, sent marines to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] to protect the banana businesses. Other naval units were sent to [[Amapala]] in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] to prevent attacks against the last-occupied positions of Manuel Bonilla, who took refuge on the {{USS|Chicago|1885|6}}. With this, the fight against Bonilla came to an end.\n\nThe [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in [[Tegucigalpa]] played an active role in the organisation of a peace treaty, which displeased Zelaya. The treaty installed a provisional government composed of [[Miguel Oquel\u00ed Bustillo]], M\u00e1ximo Rosales Betancourt and Juan Ignacio Castro, until the end of March 1907.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n== The Peace Treaty of 1907 ==\n\n=== Election of Miguel Rafael D\u00e1vila ===\n[[File:Central_American_Peace_Conference.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|The 1907 Central American Peace Conference]]\nOn April 28, 1907, the provisional government gave control to [[Miguel R. D\u00e1vila|Miguel Rafael D\u00e1vila Cu\u00e9llar]], who had been vice-president under [[Manuel Bonilla]]. D\u00e1vila summoned a [[constituent assembly]], which re-established the constitution of 1894 and called elections. D\u00e1vila was elected president for the 1908\u201312 term.<ref name=\"Conflict in Central America\">\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Conflict_in_Central_America.html?id=CaF6AAAAMAAJ \n|title=Conflict in Central America \n|author=Helen Schooley \n|date=1987-01-01 \n|accessdate=2016-06-15\n|isbn=9780582902749 \n}}\n</ref>\n\nMiguel R. D\u00e1vila did not have the confidence of Nicaraguan president [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]]. The prospect of new conflicts caught the attention of the American president, [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

Honduras proposed to reestablish the [[Union of Central American States]], but this was not accepted.{{who|date=May 2018}} However, other measures were adopted. The five presidents signed the [[General Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1907]] and established the [[Permanent Central American Court of Justice]], to resolve future disputes.\n\nThe treaty also committed the five countries to restrict the activities of exiles from neighbouring states and put in place a basis for legal [[extradition]]s. Of special interest was a clause, sponsored by the United States, which established the permanent neutrality of [[Honduras]] in future Central American conflicts.\n\nThe five states pledged to deny recognition to governments that came to power by revolutionary means. The United States and Mexico, who had acted as co-sponsors of the conference, also pledged to deny recognition to such governments. From the point of view of the US State Department, these agreements represented an important step in the stabilisation of Central America and of Honduras in particular.\n\nThe first challenge to this treaty came in Honduras in 1908; opponents of D\u00e1vila, with the support of Guatemala and El Salvador, invaded the country. Nicaragua supported the Honduran president, and war seemed imminent. But in fear of an American intervention, the parties involved agreed to subject the controversy to the new Central American Court. The court ultimately denied the complaints of Honduras and Nicaragua, and rebellion against of D\u00e1vila was controlled. With this, peace in Honduras briefly returned.\n\n=== D\u00e1vila and the external debt ===\n[[File:William_Howard_Taft.jpg|right|thumb|194x194px|William Howard Taft]]\nDuring his administration, Miguel D\u00e1vila tried to modernize the country, but in addition to struggling against the opposition, the president had the difficult task of leading at a time when the external debt of Honduras had reached US$120 million. According to the administration of US president [[William Howard Taft]], the debt was a factor that contributed to the political and social unsteadiness of the country. Because of this, D\u00e1vila initiated efforts to repay the debt, much of it owed to England.\n\nNegotiations were organised between the representatives of Honduras and the bankers of New York, led by [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan.]] At the end of 1909, an agreement was reached to reduce the debt and issue new bonds at 5% [[interest]]. In exchange, the bankers would control the railway of Honduras, and the government of United States would control customs revenue, while still guaranteeing the independence of the Honduran state.\n\nIn Honduras, great opposition to the terms proposed by the bankers weakened the government of D\u00e1vila even more. When he tried to carry out the terms of the agreement, this was seen by the Hondurans as a violation of national sovereignty. For this reason, in a rare show of independence, the [[National Congress of Honduras]] initially refused the proposals by a vote of thirty-three to five. But D\u00e1vila continued pressing the Congress until they approved.\n\n=== Renunciation of President D\u00e1vila ===\nIn the midst of all the problems facing D\u00e1vila's administration, he wanted to put an end to the generous concessions granted to fruit companies.<ref name=\"Honduras by International Bureau of the American Republics\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cl3UAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA157\n|title=Monthly Bulletin of the International Bureau of the American Republics ... \n|accessdate=2016-06-15|year=1908 \n}}</ref> This provoked the wrath of [[Sam Zemurray|Samuel Zemurray]], the owner of the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], who determined to fund a revolution against D\u00e1vila in order to overthrow him.

He immediately called on his forces to confront the forces of former President Bonilla, however, the US government offered to mediate in the conflict. From February 21 to March 15, 1911, representatives from both sides met on board the [[USS Tacoma (CL-20)|USS ''Tacoma'']] in the bay of [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]],.<ref name=\"Honduras: an area study in government.\">\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRwPAAAAYAAJ\n|title=Honduras: an Area Study in Government \n|author=William Sylvane Stokes |date=2007-10-11 \n|accessdate=2016-06-15|isbn=9780837158136 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Banana cultures: agriculture, consumption, & environmental change in Honduras & the United States\">\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIIX4WeSR8YC\n|title=Banana Cultures: Agriculture, Consumption, and Environmental Change in ... \n|author=John Soluri \n|date= 2009-03-06\n|accessdate=2016-06-15|isbn=9780292777873 \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe revolutionaries headed by ex-president Manuel Bonilla and the D\u00e1vila government agreed to a cease-fire, with the forced resignation of president D\u00e1vila and the installation of a provisional president.

Francisco Bertrand, who had been his vice-president, returned to the presidency and in 1916 won election for a term that lasted until 1920. The Bertrand government represented mostly the American interests on the national level, accepted the mediation of United States in the resolution of the border conflict with Guatemala and also in the back conflict by two regions adjoining with Nicaragua (The trojes and Potrerillos).<ref name=\"Partidos pol\u00edticos de Am\u00e9rica Latina:\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzQ3fJ3W8e4C&pg=PA250|title=Partidos pol\u00edticos de Am\u00e9rica Latina.

This contributed even more to the already increasing worry of the [[United States]] about the political unsteadiness in Central America. In August 1922, the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador gathered on the {{USS|Tacoma|CL-20|6}} in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]], under the attentive eye of the ambassadors of the United States to these countries. The presidents promised once again to prevent that their territories were used to promote revolutions against their neighbours. Likewise it did them a called to all the countries, to gather in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] at the end of the year.{{clarify|date=November 2016}} Apart from all this, in September 1920 the first national [[Strike action|strike]], the workers of the company \"Vaccaro Brother Company\" with headquarters in [[La Ceiba]] in the department of Atl\u00e1ntida organised to demand adjustment of wages.\n\nThe Washington conference concluded in February with the approval of the [[General Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1923]]. This treaty reorganised the Central American Court and ratified a lot of dispositions from the treaty of 1907. The clause of non-recognition of revolutionary governments was extended; Likewise, the rulers engaged once again not to intervene in the affairs of their neighbours.\n\nThis same meeting promoted agriculture and free trade. It limited arms and established a limit on the size of the military strengths of each country (2.500 men for Honduras). United States engaged to look for the foreign help for professionalization of the armed forces.\n\n=== Elections and American intervention ===\n[[File:USS_Denver.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|USS Denver]]\nPresidential elections in Honduras in October 1923 and subsequent political and military conflicts provided the first challenges for these new agreements. Under strong pressure from Washington, L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez allowed free elections. The very fragmented conservatives united under the flag of the [[National Party of Honduras]] (PNH). These chose the governor of Cort\u00e9s, [[Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]] as their candidate. Whereas the liberal party (PLH) was divided in two currents: one supported ex-president [[Policarpo Bonilla]], and others the candidacy of [[Juan \u00c1ngel Arias Boqu\u00edn]]. When carrying out the elections, Car\u00edas received the most votes (49,953). Bonilla (35,474 votes) was second and Arias (20,839 votes) remained in a distant third place. But nobody got the majority required by the Constitution of Honduras. Then it fell to the Congress to convene and take a decision. But the members did not reach agreement.\n\nIn January 1924, L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez announced his intention to remain in charge until new elections could be held, but never gave a specific date. Facing this situation, Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino, apparently with the support of the [[United Fruit Company]], proclaimed himself president, and a new armed conflict burst. In February the government of United States warned that any person getting power by revolutionary means would not be recognized. At the same time it suspended relations with L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez for not carrying out the elections.\n\nConditions deteriorated quickly in the first months of 1924. On 28 February, a battle took place in [[La Ceiba]] between government troops and the rebels. Even the presence of the [[S.S. Denver]] and the landing of a force of U.S. [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] were unable to prevent looting and arson that made more than US$2 million in property damage. Fifty people, among them a US citizen, died in the fighting. In the following weeks, additional ships of the United States Navy concentrated in Honduran waters, to protect American interests.\n\n=== General Vicente Tosta ===\n[[File:St_Charles_Ave_CBD_Fidelity_Fruit_Co_Bldg.JPG|right|thumb|240x240px|Former building of the United Fruit Co.]]\nA marine force and sailors were sent all the way to the interior to [[Tegucigalpa]] to offer additional protection to the delegation of the United States. Shortly before their arrival, [[Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez]] died, and control of the country fell to the cabinet.<ref name=\"Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.historiadehonduras.hn/presidentes/rafaellopezgutierrez.htm \n|title=Gobernantes de Honduras: Rafael Lopez Gutierrez \n|website=Historiadehonduras.hn \n|date= \n|accessdate=2016-06-15\n}}\n</ref> General Car\u00edas and other rebel leaders controlled the greater part of the battlefield, but did not coordinate their activities with sufficient efficiency to seize the capital.\n\nIn an effort to put an end to the fighting, the government of United States sent [[Sumner Welles]] to the port of [[Amapala]]. Welles had instructions to produce a satisfactory agreement according to the treaty of 1923, and convey power to somebody that could be recognized legally. The negotiations, once again held on board the ''USS Milwaukee'', lasted from 23 to 28 April. In the end they came to the agreement to set up a provisional government headed by the general [[Vicente Tosta|Vicente Tosta Carrasco]], who agreed to appoint a cabinet representing all the political factions and to summon a Constituent Assembly within ninety days in order to restore constitutional order. The constitution of 1924 was promulgated during the reign of this government.\n\nThe presidential elections had to be held as soon as possible. Tosta himself promised to refrain from running. Once in office, Tosta showed signs of not wanting to fulfill some of his promises. But under strong pressure from the US delegation, he had to comply in the end with the provisions of the peace agreement.\n\nKeeping the elections to a clear-cut date proved to be a difficult task. To exert pressure on Tosta, the United States set an arms embargo on Honduras and forbade the government to give him access to the credit - that included a loan of US$75.000 from the Bank Atl\u00e1ntida S.A.. Also, the United States convinced El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua to keep the treaty of 1923 and not to recognize any revolutionary leader as president.\n\nThese pressures finally helped persuade Car\u00edas to withdraw his candidacy. It also helped to ensure the defeat of an uprising headed by the General Gregorio Ferrera of the PNH.<ref name=\"The banana empire: a case study of economic imperialism\">\n{{cite book\n|title=The banana empire: a case study of economic imperialism\n|author=Kepner, Charles David\n|date=1935\n|publisher=Russell & Russell\n|location=New York\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Miguel Paz Barahona ===\nThe National Party (PNH) nominated [[Miguel Paz Barahona]] to the presidency.

He also supported granting family plots to the peasant sector. He also promoted public education, for which he used prisons and barracks. Nevertheless, the alliance with US interests remained intact. His government persecuted journalists and citizens opposed to the United States.<ref name=\"Partidos pol\u00edticos de Am\u00e9rica Latina:\"/> In spite of a new minor uprising led by the general Ferrera in 1925, the administration of Paz Barahona was relatively calm.<ref name=\"The banana empire: a case study of economic imperialism\"/>\n\nMoreover, in March 1925 the workers of the ''Wit Azucarero'' in the municipality of [[La Lima]], in the department of Cort\u00e9s began to take to the streets, followed by other workers from the North coast and seconded by the employees of the \"Cuyamel Fruit Company\". The workers requested: weekly payments, working days of 8 hours and increases of wage.\n\nIn 1928 fears of new riots returned, as the end of the mandate of Paz Barahona approached. The PNH designated Tiburcio Car\u00edas as its presidential candidate, whereas the PLH appointed [[Vicente Mej\u00eda Colindres]], after the death of Dr. [[Policarpo Bonilla|Polycarp Bonilla.]] To the surprise of many observers, the electoral campaign as well as the elections were carried out with minimal acts of violence and intimidation.\n\n=== Vicente Mej\u00eda Colindres ===\nMej\u00eda Colindres obtained a decisive victory, winning 62,000 of the votes compared to the 47,000 gained by Car\u00edas.

Banana exports peaked in 1930, but afterwards diminished quickly. Thousands of workers were sacked, and the wages of those who remained were reduced, just as the prices paid to the independent banana producers by the giant banana companies. As the depression sharpened, the financial situation of the government deteriorated, and in 1931 Colindres Mej\u00eda was forced to borrow $250,000 from the fruit companies to ensure the army payroll.\n\n==The dictatorship of Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino==\n\n===Election of Car\u00edas===\n[[File:Fuerzas_Navales_de_Honduras.jpg|right|thumb|260x260px|The president Car\u00edas took special interest in the Armed forces of Honduras]]\n[[File:TiburcioCarias.JPG|left|thumb|255x255px|Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]]\nIn spite of increasing unrest and grave economic tensions, the elections of 1932 were relatively peaceful and just. In February 1932, the [[National Party of Honduras]] (PNH) nominated Car\u00edas as its presidential candidate; initially Venancio Alleys was nominated as vice-president but when he declined, Abraham Williams was appointed.<ref name=\"Tiburcio Car\u00edas: anatom\u00eda de una \u00e9poca, 1923-1948\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAqYWYMLiDEC&pg=PA6 |title=Tiburcio Car\u00edas: anatom\u00eda de una \u00e9poca |author=Mario Argueta |page=6 |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref> The liberals for their part appointed {{ILL|\u00c1ngel Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Huete|es}} as their candidate.

Shortly before his inauguration, liberal dissidents rose in rebellion. As Car\u00edas took control of the government forces, he obtained weapons in El Salvador and in quickly crushed the uprising.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nDuring the first part of his administration, Car\u00edas focused on avoiding financial collapse, improving the armed forces and building roads. At the same time he established the foundations to help him prolong his stay in the power.\n\nHonduras economy continued to be bad through the decade of the 1930s. In addition to the drastic fall in banana exports caused by the reduced consumer demand from The Great Depression<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LATKDLYKav4C&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=banana+exports+depression#v=onepage&q=banana%20exports%20depression&f=false|title=The Banana: Empires, Trade Wars, and Globalization|last=Wiley|first=James|date=2008|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-1637-2|language=en}}</ref>, the banana industry was threatened in 1935, by epidemics like the [[Black sigatoka|Black Sigatoka]]. In a year, extensive areas including those in the zone of Trujillo, were abandoned, and thousands of Hondurans remained without work. By 1937 the plague was under control but a lot of zones affected remained without production. Because of this, Honduras lost a big part of the international market.\n\nCar\u00edas had made an effort to improve the armed forces, even before he became president. Once in power, his motivation to continue his work increased. He gave special attention to the decadent Air Force by founding the Military School of Aviation (1934) with an American colonel in command.<ref name=\"Bananas, labor, and politics in Honduras, 1954-1963\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXIsAAAAMAAJ\n|title=Bananas, Labor, and Politics in Honduras: 1954-1963 \n|author=Robert MacCameron |date= \n|accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the passage of time, Car\u00edas moved slowly but without pause, to reinforce his power. He won the support of the banana companies through opposition to strikes and other labor riots. He strengthened his position in the national financial circles and with foreigners through conservative economic politics. Even at the peak the depression, he continued making regular payments on the external debt, adhering strictly to the terms of the agreement with the shareholders of British Bonds. Likewise, he satisfied the other creditors. Two small loans were paid completely in 1935.\n\n=== Repression ===\nPolitical controls were slowly initiated under the government of Car\u00edas. The [[Communist Party of Honduras]] (PCH) was declared illegal. But the [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (PLH) was still active. Even the leaders of a small uprising in 1935 were offered free aerial transport if they wished to return to Honduras.{{clarify|date=November 2016}}\n\nBy the end of 1935, emphasizing the need for internal order and peace, Car\u00edas began to [[Censorship in Honduras|repress the press]] and the political activities against him.<ref name=\"Bananas, labor, and politics in Honduras, 1954-1963\"/>\n[[File:Per\u00f3n_y_Somoza.JPG|right|thumb|247x247px|The relations between Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda and Car\u00edas were taut, because of border disputes]]\nOn the other hand, the PNH began a publishing campaign doing upsetting in the continuity of Car\u00edas so that it continued the peace and the order in the country. However the Constitution of 1924 like the one of 1894 forbade the reelection. Car\u00edas presented his plan of reelection in front of the delegation of the United States in Tegucigalpa. The Americans concluded that if similar governments had been established in Guatemala, The Saviour and Nicaragua, did not see why Car\u00edas could not extend his mandate. In this way United States threw by embroiders it{{clarify|date=November 2016}} the 'Treaty of 1923'.<ref name=\"Tiburcio Car\u00edas: portrait of a Honduran political leader\"/>\n\nThe General Car\u00edas then summoned to a national constituent assembly to modify the constitution. This assembly chosen to the 'dedazo' incorporated 30 articles of the Constitution of 1924 in the new constitution. The main changes were the elimination of the prohibition on the immediate reelection of the president and the vice-president and the extension of the presidential term from four to six years. Other changes included restoration of the death penalty, the reduction of the powers of legislature, and the denial of the citizenship and the right to the vote of women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/ho/hondurascountrys00merr_0/hondurascountrys00merr_0.pdf|title=Honduras: a country study|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe opposition Liberal Party (PLH) and other sectors reacted to these changes, treating to overthrow to Car\u00edas. Numerous efforts did in 1936 and 1937, but without success. For finals of the decade of 1930, the National Party was the only political organisation recognised in the nation. Numerous leaders opposition leaders were imprisoned, and some were chained and forced to work in the streets of [[Tegucigalpa]]. Others, including the leader of the PLH, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Huete, had exiled .\n\nDuring his presidency, Car\u00edas cultivated a narrow relation with his fellow dictators of Central America, generals: [[Jorge Ubico]] of Guatemala, [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]] of [[El Salvador]], and [[Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda]] of Nicaragua. His narrower relation was with the dictator Ubico, who helped to Car\u00edas to reorganise his secret police, and also captured and shot the leader of an uprising in Honduras who had committed the error of crossing into Guatemalan territory. The relations with Nicaragua were somewhat tenser in consequence of the border dispute. But Car\u00edas and Somoza succeeded in keeping under control this dispute along the years 1930 and 1940.\n\n=== Last period of Car\u00edas ===\nWhen winning the second period of six years, ratified the Article of the Constitution that prorrog\u00f3 the presidential period to said six years and the Presidency in the General headlines Car\u00edas and Williams until 31 December 1948.<ref name=\"Agresi\u00f3n y represi\u00f3n en contra de la ciudadan\u00eda\">{{cite web|url=http://histounahblog.wordpress.com/ |title=Histounahblog's Blog &#124; Por una Historia insclusiva, critica y revolucionaria |website=Histounahblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944 the bonds of Car\u00edas with these dictators turned into something not wanted, once that popular uprisings deposed to Situate of Guatemala and to the Salvadorian Mart\u00ednez Hern\u00e1ndez. During a time, seemed as if the revolutionary contagion extended to Honduras.\n\nA plot of civilians and military with the purpose to overthrow to Car\u00edas was discovered, but crushed by the government in 1943. In May 1944, a group of women began to protest out of the Presidential Palace of Tegucigalpa, to demand the release of the political prisoners. In spite of the strong measures taken by the government, the tension grew and Car\u00edas saw forced finally to free to some prisoners. This gesture did not satisfy to the opposition, and the demonstrations against the government followed extending.\n\nIn July several demonstrators were murdered by governmental troops in San Pedro Sula. In October, a group of exiled invaded to Honduras from The Saviour, but did not succeed in his efforts for overthrowing to the government. The soldiers remained loyal, and Car\u00edas continued in the charge.\n\n== Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez ==\n\n=== Election and exert of G\u00e1lvez ===\n[[File:Juan_Manuel_Galvez.jpg|right|thumb|197x197px|President, Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]]\nThe government of United States wanted to be done with problems in Central America. Therefore, it urged Car\u00edas to allow free elections once his current term ended. For that then, Car\u00edas, had more than seventy years. The general yielded to pressure and announced elections for October 1948, in which it would abstain to present as candidate. Nevertheless, Car\u00edas found ways to use his power.\n\nGeneral Carias nominated his ex-minister of war (1933), [[Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez]] as a presidential candidate for the National Party. On the other hand, exiled opposition figures were authorised to return to Honduras. Of this form, the PLH, treating to surpass years of inactivity and division, nominated to \u00c1ngel Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Huete as its presidential candidate.\n\nBut the liberals, quickly convinced that they did not have any possibility of winning and, accusing to the government of manipulation of the electoral process, boycotted the elections. This gave to G\u00e1lvez a victory without opposition and in January 1949 he assumed the presidency.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nOnce president, G\u00e1lvez showed to be an independent person. Much more of what had anticipated . The president G\u00e1lvez adopted some policies of Car\u00edas, such as the construction of roads and the development of the exports of coffee. In 1953 almost a fourth part of the budget of the government devoted to the construction of roads.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nG\u00e1lvez also followed the greater part of the fiscal politics of the previous administration, the reduction of the external debt and paying off the last of the British bonds. The fruit companies followed receiving a good deal by part of G\u00e1lvez. For example, in 1949, United Fruit received a favourable agreement of twenty-five years.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nIn addition, G\u00e1lvez established some remarkable changes in comparison to the last fifteen years. The education that received greater attention and began to perceive a greater part of the national budget. The congress approved a law of income tax, although its application was sporadic at best.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThe most evident change was in the political sand. A considerable degree of freedom of press was restored. The Liberal Party was allowed to reorganise, as well as other political groups. The workers also benefited during this period. He established the working time of 8 hours, paid holidays paid, and responsibility of the employer for workplace safety and regulations of the employment of women and boys.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n=== The strike of 1954 ===\nThe relative peace that Honduras had enjoyed for almost two decades was destroyed by a series of events during the last year (1954) of G\u00e1lvez' term. Tension in the entire Central American region increased with a confrontation developed between the left-leaning government of President [[Jacobo \u00c1rbenz|Jacobo Arbenz Guzm\u00e1n]] of [[Guatemala]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nPart of this confrontation was due to the expropriation of land from the United Fruit Company by the Guatemalan government. Likewise United States accused the government of Arbenz Guzm\u00e1n of boosting the agitation among the workers of the Fruit Company.\nIn 1952 United States had considered taking action to overthrow the Guatemalan president. But the government of G\u00e1lvez, which had given asylum to opponents to this government between them [[Carlos Castillo Armas]], that did not wanted to cooperate in the direct actions against of Guatemala, and the plans were not activated.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThis was until principles of 1954, when a big covert operation developed in Honduran territory against the Guatemalan president. The government of Honduras had showed worry, because of the tensions between the workers of the banana industry and United Fruit. The administration of G\u00e1lvez concluded that this was due to the influence that the left-handed government of Guatemala had on the Honduran workers.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nFor principles of May 1954, the tensions had increased. In the first place, they gave a series of strikes against the operations of the [[United Fruit Company]] in the coast north of Honduras. To the few days, the strike extended and included the operations of the Standard Fruit Company, with which the banana sector of the country arrived to a deadlock.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThe strikers presented a wide range of complaints. Between which include : The increase of wage, better conditions of work, medical profits, payment of extra hours, and the right to the collective negotiation. The initial efforts of the government to put end to the strike failed and the unemployment began to extend to other industries. On 21 May, the number of strikers approached to 30.000, and the economy of the country was under a strong pressure.\n\nIn addition to having to deal with the strike, the government was increasingly involved in the movement to overthrow to the government of Arbenz in Guatemala. To finals of May, an agreement of military assistance subscribed between United States and Honduras, and big quantities of American arms were sent quickly to Honduras.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nBig part of this help received send to the rebellious anti-Arbenz headed by Castle Arm. In June these strengths crossed the border of Guatemala and after several days of political manoeuvres, and little armed fight, Arbenz escaped to the exile and Castle Arm took the power in this country.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nWith the overthrow of Arbenz finished the foreign influence between the Honduran workers. The strike finished in July of this year, the sindical leaders that had been accused to have bonds with Guatemala were imprisoned, but the banana companies yielded to some demands of the workers. This marked the beginning of a labour strength more organized and the decrease in the power of the companies fruteras.\n\n=== The constitutional crisis of 1954 ===\n[[File:Julio_Lozano_400.jpg|left|thumb|258x258px|Julio Lozano D\u00edaz]]\nIn the midst of these conflicts, campaigning for the elections of 1954 continued. Dissatisfied with some of G\u00e1lvez's policies towards liberalization, Car\u00edas decided to run for president despite his advanced age, ensuring the nomination of the PNH. This move, however, divided the party. The most moderate members separated from the party and formed the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR). Its candidate was ex-vice president [[Abraham Williams Calder\u00f3n]]. This division among the nationalists moved the Liberals to unite behind the candidacy of Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales, a doctor from Tegucigalpa.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/> The campaign as well as the elections were very free and honest<!-- Citation Needed -->. On 10 October 1954, roughly 260,000 of the more than 400,000 voters voted. Villeda Moral won the elections with 121,213 votes, Car\u00edas received 77,041, and Williams carried 53,041.\n\nThe Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH) also obtained the majority in the legislative body. But under the Constitution, Villeda did not obtain the necessary majority of votes to be president (-8000 votes). Something similar took place in 1924. This situation left  the decision to choose to the new president in the hands of the legislative body. To complicate things more, G\u00e1lvez went to Miami, purportedly to receive medical treatment, although some sources say that he simply fled the country, leaving the government in the hands of vice-president [[Julio Lozano D\u00edaz]].<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nThe National Party (PNH) and the National Revolutionary Movement  (MNR) did not accept the election of Villeda and boycotted the legislative assembly, producing a constitutional crisis. According to the constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice had to choose the president. As the court was dominated by Car\u00edas appointees, the Liberal Party of Honduras was opposed to such a course of action. In this conjuncture, Lozano D\u00edaz suddenly suspended the legislative body and proclaimed himself president until new elections can take place.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of Honduras (1900-54)}}\n[[Category:History of Honduras]]\n[[Category:20th century in Honduras]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toLa Mosquitia(link changed toLa Mosquitia (Honduras); link changed toLa Mosquitia (Honduras)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Honduras_(1900%E2%80%931954)"}

This has posed the Honduran government, offices and nature organizations to look after the protection of the local environment, like the creation of [[nature reserve]]s.\n\n== Flora ==\nThe [[flora]] of Honduras is very varied.\nPluvioselva, classified a [[tropical rain forest]], is one of its most impressive vegetal populations. Ecologists designated it \"Hygrophilous Megat\u00e9rmic formation\", for corresponding to regions of high humidity and constant high temperatures, with a single dominant species, like pines or firs, covering big areas. \n\nThe eastern part of the country, ''[[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]]'', has many plants trepadoras or enredaderas, like the lianes and many epifitas, most strikingly the orchids. Adapted to the humid environment, trees are enormous and do not possess deep roots sustaining thanks to the big spurs, while the leaves are large and many. The tree trunks are straight and smooth and their first branches are high above the forest floor. The rainforest corresponds to parts of the northern region below 600 meters in elevation; there is not dry station entirely clear-cut and covers 29% of the total of the surface of the country.
