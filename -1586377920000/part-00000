His half-brother [[Frank Gavan Duffy|Sir Frank Gavan Duffy]] (1852\u20131936) was the fourth Chief Justice of the [[High Court of Australia]], sitting on the bench of the High Court from 1913\u201335.\n\nHis sister [[Louise Gavan Duffy]] came to Ireland in 1907, he taught in [[Patrick Pearse]]'s St Ita's school for girls ''Scoil \u00cdde'', was, with [[Mary Colum]] first Secretary of ''Cumann na mBan'', was out in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, in the GPO and Jacob's garrisons. She founded and ran ''Scoil Bhr\u00edde'', a bilingual school in [[Dublin]], which is still in operation. Louise came originally to Dublin, as her mother died in 1889.  George was raised by three half-sisters travelling from [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], at Guilloy, [[Nice]], [[France]]. He spoke fluent Italian and French received education from ''Petit Seminaire''. From there he was sent to [[Stonyhurst College]].\n\nHe qualified with a solicitor's firm in London in 1907. He married Margaret Sullivan, on 13 December 1908. They had two children, a son (Colum) and a daughter (M\u00e1ire). Colum Duffy was a legal scholar and law librarian at the [[Law Society of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Early career==\nGavan Duffy qualified as a solicitor and practised in London. He defended [[Roger Casement|Sir Roger Casement]] at his trial for [[high treason]] after the Easter Rising. Although the case was unsuccessful and Casement executed, the trial had an enormous effect on Gavan Duffy and in 1917, when he was called to the [[Irish Bar]], he came to live in [[King's Inns]], Dublin, where he became immersed in Irish political life.\n\n==Political life==\n\n===Recognition efforts===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2016}}\nDuring the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 Westminster election]], he was elected as a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[South Dublin (UK Parliament constituency)|South County Dublin]].<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1000|title=George Gavan Duffy|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe was sent to Paris to join [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]], as an envoy of the newly declared [[Irish Republic]]. Gavan Duffy published articles and pamphlets urging recognition of Ireland as a sovereign nation at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], which caused increasing embarrassment to the French establishment, who believed his publications were damaging Anglo-French relations.\n\nGavan Duffy and O'Kelly sought France's help against Britain when the treaties ending the [[First World War]] had not yet been signed; Britain had been France's main ally for most of the war, in which France had suffered enormous losses. In January 1919, the Sinn F\u00e9in-affiliated [[Irish Republican Army]] had also started the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]] against Britain, and the new [[D\u00e1il]] had [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from the United Kingdom.\n\nFurther, the British position was that it was preparing a revised system of Irish Home Rule which would be effected after the Peace Conference, and that it had tried to solve the Irish Question at the [[Irish Convention]] in 1917, which Sinn F\u00e9in had boycotted. Sinn F\u00e9in had joined in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|campaign against conscription]] in 1918.\n\nIn consequence all the [[Allies of World War I]] saw the Sinn F\u00e9in movement as more or less hostile. A final letter of June 1919 demanding recognition and addressed to the French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]], the chairman of the Peace Conference, was not replied to.<ref>See [[National Archives of Ireland|NAI]] file DFA ES Paris 1919; Official Memorandum in support of Ireland's demand for recognition as a sovereign independent state. Presented to Georges Clemenceau and the members of the Paris Peace Conference by Sean T. O'Ceallaigh and George Gavan Duffy.</ref>\n\nFinally, after publishing a letter he had sent to Clemenceau in protest against the former mistreatment of [[Terence MacSwiney]] in prison in 1917, Gavan Duffy was banished from Paris. He was declared ''persona non grata'' in December 1920. He then went to Rome and from there travelled through Europe on behalf of the Ministry of the Irish Republic, without securing its recognition.\n\n===Anglo-Irish Treaty===\n[[File:The peacemakers- George Gavan Duffy, Erskine Childers, Robert Barton and Arthur Griffith in a group (28455606301).jpg|thumb|Duffy together with other members of the negotiation team (including Childers, Griffith, and Barton) in December 1921]]\nWhen [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] chose his plenipotentiaries to negotiate the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921; Gavan Duffy was chosen due mainly to his legal expertise. He protested against signing the Treaty but did so reluctantly, becoming the last person to sign. During the debates which followed in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], Gavan Duffy stated that he would recommend the Treaty reluctantly but sincerely as he saw no alternative for the desired aim of independence.\n\n<blockquote>I do not love this treaty now any more than I loved it when I signed it, that I do not think that...is an adequate motive for rejection to point out that some of us signed the Treaty under duress, not to say that this treaty will not lead to permanent peace.  It is necessary before you reject the Treaty to go further than that and to produce to the people of Ireland a rational alternative.  My heart is with those who are against the Treaty, but my reason is against them, because I can see no rational alternative.<ref>D\u00e1il Debates, 21 December 1921</ref></blockquote>\n\nGavan Duffy placed the onus on the people who were responsible for drafting the Constitution of the Irish Free State to frame it in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. He disagreed, however, with Griffith's decision to show the draft constitution to [[British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] who immediately ordered that references to the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]] had to be inserted as well as an Oath of Allegiance. Lloyd George threatened to start a war if the Irish refused to sign; but Gavan Duffy did not believe it.\n\nOn 21 December 1921, he gave his main reason for supporting the treaty in the Dail, the impact of a potentially renewed war on the people, concluding:\n<blockquote>You may gamble on the prospects of a renewal of that horrible war, which I for one have only seen from afar, but which I know those who have so nobly withstood do not wish to see begun again without a clear prospect of getting further than they are to-day. We are told that this is a surrender of principle. If that be so, we must be asked to believe that every one of those who have gone before us in previous fights, and who in the end have had to lay down their arms or surrender to avert a greater evil to the people, have likewise been guilty of a breach of principle. I do not think an argument of that kind will get you much further. No! The solid principle, the solid basis upon which every honest man ought to make up his mind on this issue, may be summed up in the principle that we all claimed when it was first enunciated by the President, the principle of government by the [[consent of the governed]]. I say that no serious person here, whatever his feelings, knowing as he must what the people of this country think of the matter, will be doing his duty if, under these circumstances, he refuses to ratify the Treaty. Ratify it with the most dignified protest you can, ratify because you cannot do otherwise, but ratify it in the interests of the people you must.</blockquote>\n\n===Resignations===\nThis prompted him to resign but he was compelled to remain in office, serving as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] from January 1922 to July 1922. On the outbreak of the [[Irish Civil War]] he resigned when the Provisional Government refused to effect a court order for [[habeas corpus]] in favour of [[George Plunkett (Irish Republican)|George Plunkett]] (a son of [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]]), who was detained without charge with other republicans.\n\nHis tenure in office was cut short by his decision to resign again when the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] abolished the Republican Courts and executed his good friend [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]].\n\nHe stood in the [[1923 Irish general election|1923 general election]] as an independent candidate but failed to be re-elected.\n\n==Barrister and judge==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\nGavan Duffy returned to the [[Irish Bar]] and built up a large practice and was engaged in some notable constitutional cases such as the Land Annuities controversy in which he claimed that the [[Irish Free State]] could not be bound either in honour or in law to hand over annuities to Britain. He was appointed [[Senior Counsel]] in 1930 and Judge of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] in 1936. He acted as an unofficial legal advisor to [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] during the drafting of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] and was consulted on many issues pertaining to it.

His half-brother [[Frank Gavan Duffy|Sir Frank Gavan Duffy]] (1852\u20131936) was the fourth Chief Justice of the [[High Court of Australia]], sitting on the bench of the High Court from 1913-35.\n\nHis sister [[Louise Gavan Duffy]] came to Ireland in 1907, he taught in [[Patrick Pearse]]'s St Ita's school for girls ''Scoil \u00cdde'', was, with [[Mary Colum]] first Secretary of ''Cumann na mBan'', was out in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, in the GPO and Jacob's garrisons. She founded and ran ''Scoil Bhr\u00edde'', a bilingual school in [[Dublin]], which is still in operation. Louise came originally to Dublin, as her mother died in 1889.  George was raised by three half-sisters travelling from [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], at Guilloy, [[Nice]], [[France]]. He spoke fluent Italian and French received education from ''Petit Seminaire''. From there he was sent to [[Stonyhurst College]].\n\nHe qualified with a solicitor's firm in London in 1907. He married Margaret Sullivan, on 13 December 1908. They had two children, a son (Colum) and a daughter (M\u00e1ire). Colum Duffy was a legal scholar and law librarian at the [[Law Society of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Early career==\nGavan Duffy qualified as a solicitor and practised in London. He defended [[Roger Casement|Sir Roger Casement]] at his trial for [[high treason]] after the Easter Rising. Although the case was unsuccessful and Casement executed, the trial had an enormous effect on Gavan Duffy and in 1917, when he was called to the [[Irish Bar]], he came to live in [[King's Inns]], Dublin, where he became immersed in Irish political life.\n\n==Political life==\n\n===Recognition efforts===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2016}}\nDuring the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 Westminster election]], he was elected as a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[South Dublin (UK Parliament constituency)|South County Dublin]].<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1000|title=George Gavan Duffy|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe was sent to Paris to join [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]], as an envoy of the newly declared [[Irish Republic]]. Gavan Duffy published articles and pamphlets urging recognition of Ireland as a sovereign nation at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], which caused increasing embarrassment to the French establishment, who believed his publications were damaging Anglo-French relations.\n\nGavan Duffy and O'Kelly sought France's help against Britain when the treaties ending the [[First World War]] had not yet been signed; Britain had been France's main ally for most of the war, in which France had suffered enormous losses. In January 1919, the Sinn F\u00e9in-affiliated [[Irish Republican Army]] had also started the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]] against Britain, and the new [[D\u00e1il]] had [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from the United Kingdom.\n\nFurther, the British position was that it was preparing a revised system of Irish Home Rule which would be effected after the Peace Conference, and that it had tried to solve the Irish Question at the [[Irish Convention]] in 1917, which Sinn F\u00e9in had boycotted. Sinn F\u00e9in had joined in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|campaign against conscription]] in 1918.\n\nIn consequence all the [[Allies of World War I]] saw the Sinn F\u00e9in movement as more or less hostile. A final letter of June 1919 demanding recognition and addressed to the French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]], the chairman of the Peace Conference, was not replied to.<ref>See [[National Archives of Ireland|NAI]] file DFA ES Paris 1919; Official Memorandum in support of Ireland's demand for recognition as a sovereign independent state. Presented to Georges Clemenceau and the members of the Paris Peace Conference by Sean T. O'Ceallaigh and George Gavan Duffy.</ref>\n\nFinally, after publishing a letter he had sent to Clemenceau in protest against the former mistreatment of [[Terence MacSwiney]] in prison in 1917, Gavan Duffy was banished from Paris. He was declared ''persona non grata'' in December 1920. He then went to Rome and from there travelled through Europe on behalf of the Ministry of the Irish Republic, without securing its recognition.\n\n===Anglo-Irish Treaty===\n[[File:The peacemakers- George Gavan Duffy, Erskine Childers, Robert Barton and Arthur Griffith in a group (28455606301).jpg|thumb|Duffy together with other members of the negotiation team (including Childers, Griffith, and Barton) in December 1921]]\nWhen [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] chose his plenipotentiaries to negotiate the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921; Gavan Duffy was chosen due mainly to his legal expertise. He protested against signing the Treaty but did so reluctantly, becoming the last person to sign. During the debates which followed in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], Gavan Duffy stated that he would recommend the Treaty reluctantly but sincerely as he saw no alternative for the desired aim of independence.\n\n<blockquote>I do not love this treaty now any more than I loved it when I signed it, that I do not think that...is an adequate motive for rejection to point out that some of us signed the Treaty under duress, not to say that this treaty will not lead to permanent peace.  It is necessary before you reject the Treaty to go further than that and to produce to the people of Ireland a rational alternative.  My heart is with those who are against the Treaty, but my reason is against them, because I can see no rational alternative.<ref>D\u00e1il Debates, 21 December 1921</ref></blockquote>\n\nGavan Duffy placed the onus on the people who were responsible for drafting the Constitution of the Irish Free State to frame it in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. He disagreed, however, with Griffith's decision to show the draft constitution to [[British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] who immediately ordered that references to the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]] had to be inserted as well as an Oath of Allegiance. Lloyd George threatened to start a war if the Irish refused to sign; but Gavan Duffy did not believe it.\n\nOn 21 December 1921, he gave his main reason for supporting the treaty in the Dail, the impact of a potentially renewed war on the people, concluding:\n<blockquote>You may gamble on the prospects of a renewal of that horrible war, which I for one have only seen from afar, but which I know those who have so nobly withstood do not wish to see begun again without a clear prospect of getting further than they are to-day. We are told that this is a surrender of principle. If that be so, we must be asked to believe that every one of those who have gone before us in previous fights, and who in the end have had to lay down their arms or surrender to avert a greater evil to the people, have likewise been guilty of a breach of principle. I do not think an argument of that kind will get you much further. No! The solid principle, the solid basis upon which every honest man ought to make up his mind on this issue, may be summed up in the principle that we all claimed when it was first enunciated by the President, the principle of government by the [[consent of the governed]]. I say that no serious person here, whatever his feelings, knowing as he must what the people of this country think of the matter, will be doing his duty if, under these circumstances, he refuses to ratify the Treaty. Ratify it with the most dignified protest you can, ratify because you cannot do otherwise, but ratify it in the interests of the people you must.</blockquote>\n\n===Resignations===\nThis prompted him to resign but he was compelled to remain in office, serving as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] from January 1922 to July 1922. On the outbreak of the [[Irish Civil War]] he resigned when the Provisional Government refused to effect a court order for [[habeas corpus]] in favour of [[George Plunkett (Irish Republican)|George Plunkett]] (a son of [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]]), who was detained without charge with other republicans.\n\nHis tenure in office was cut short by his decision to resign again when the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] abolished the Republican Courts and executed his good friend [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]].\n\nHe stood in the [[1923 Irish general election|1923 general election]] as an independent candidate but failed to be re-elected.\n\n==Barrister and judge==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\nGavan Duffy returned to the [[Irish Bar]] and built up a large practice and was engaged in some notable constitutional cases such as the Land Annuities controversy in which he claimed that the [[Irish Free State]] could not be bound either in honour or in law to hand over annuities to Britain. He was appointed [[Senior Counsel]] in 1930 and Judge of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] in 1936. He acted as an unofficial legal advisor to [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] during the drafting of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] and was consulted on many issues pertaining to it. He was also a member of the commission to set up the second house of the [[Oireachtas]], [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]], in 1937. As president of the High Court he issues the ruling in [[State (Burke) v.

The [[Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice]], dated to 29,000\u201325,000 BCE, together with a few others from nearby locations, is the oldest known [[ceramic]] artifact in the world.\n\nIn the [[classical era]], as a result of the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, Bohemia became associated with the [[Boii]]. The Boii founded a city on the site of modern Prague; some of its ancient ruins are now a tourist attraction. According to a 2000 study by Semino, 35.6% of Czech males have y-chromosome haplogroup [[R1b]],  which is common among Celts but rare among Slavs. Some modern Czechs claim that the people are as much descendants of the Boii as they are from the later Slavic invaders (as well as the historical Germanic peoples of Czech lands).\n\nLater in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. Their king [[Maroboduus]] is the first documented ruler of Bohemia. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe. Most of the names of Czech rivers are  Celtic or old Germanic in origin, dating from usage in those years.\n\n[[Slavs]] from the [[Black Sea]]\u2013[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (their migration was pushed by an invasion of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe into their area: [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). In the sixth century, they <!-- which invaders? -->moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia, and some of present-day Austria and Germany.\n\nDuring the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], became the ruler of the first known Slavic state in Central Europe, [[Samo's Empire]]. The principality of [[Great Moravia]], controlled by [[House of Mojmir|Moymir dynasty]], arose in the 8th century. It reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]]), holding off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a crucial role being played by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mission of [[Cyril and Methodius]]. They created the artificial language [[Old Church Slavonic]], the first literary and liturgical language of the [[Slavs]], and the [[Glagolitic alphabet]].\n\n=== Bohemia ===\n{{Main|Bohemia}}\n[[File:Duchy of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire in 11th century.svg|thumb|left|The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 11th century]]\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]]. In 10th century [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]] and expanded farther to the east. The Duchy of Bohemia, raised to the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1198, was from 1002 until 1806 an [[Imperial State]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] alongside the [[Kingdom of Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and numerous other territories such as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and various [[Papal States]]. The kingdom was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" from 1198) extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. The bull declared that the King of Bohemia would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in imperial councils. German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. Germans populated towns and mining districts and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of Bohemia. In 1235, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]]. After the [[Battle of Legnica]] in Poland, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia, but were defensively defeated at the fortified town of [[Olomouc]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grousset |first1=Ren\u00e9 |title=The Empire of the Steppes |date=1970 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou/page/266 266] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou |url-access=registration |access-date=26 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Mongols subsequently invaded and defeated Hungary.<ref>Jan Dugosz, Maurice Michael (1997) ''The Annals of Jan Dlugosz'', IM Publications, {{ISBN|1-901019-00-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VaclavGelnhausenovekodexu.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I]], [[List of Bohemian monarchs|King of Bohemia]] (1230\u20131253) of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], [[Gelnhausen Codex]]]]\nKing [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Otakar II]] earned the nickname ''Iron and Golden King'' because of his military power and wealth.

The most famous figure of the nascent [[Bohemian Reformation]] became [[Jan Hus]]. Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in [[Konstanz|Constance]] in 1415, his followers (led by warlords [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]] and [[Prokop the Great]]) seceded from some practices of the Roman Church and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419\u20131434) defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemian and Moravian lands were considered [[Hussites]]. Hussite [[George of Podebrady]] was even a king. Another great thinker of the Bohemian Reformation, [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]], inspired the movement of the [[Unity of the Brethren|Bohemian Brethren]] that completely separated from the Catholic Church (unlike the Hussites). Hus's thoughts were a major influence on the later [[Lutheranism]]. [[Martin Luther]] himself said \"we are all Hussites, without having been aware of it\" and considered himself as Hus's direct successor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/|title=Mentor and precursor of the Reformation|access-date=29 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404211907/http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/|archive-date=4 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Husit\u00e9 - Jensk\u00fd kodex.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=Painting of battle between mounted knights|Battle between [[Bohemian Reformation|Protestant]] [[Hussites]] and Catholic [[crusade]]rs during the [[Hussite Wars]]; Jena Codex, 15th century]]\nAfter 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia.

[[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkono\u0161e]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder]] River ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).\n\nWater from the Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|sp=us|adj=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Western European broadleaf forests]], [[Central European mixed forests]], Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.\n\nThere are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is [[Krkono\u0161e National Park]] ([[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]]), and the others are [[\u0160umava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyj\u00ed National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].\n\nThe three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly the core countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond almost perfectly with the river basins of the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).\n\n{{multiple image\n | align  = center\n | total_width = 1000\n | width1 = 1300\n | height1 = 867\n | image1 = K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko - Podzimn\u00ed bu\u010dina.JPG\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = [[Temperate deciduous forest]] in [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko Protected Landscape Area]]\n | width2 = 1600\n | height2 = 1022\n | image2 = Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = Rolling hills of [[Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk]] in northern Czech Republic\n | width3 = 3010\n | height3 = 2000\n | image3 = Podzim na Ka\u0161perku.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | caption3 = [[Bohemian Forest]] foothills and [[Ka\u0161perk]] castle, southern Bohemia\n | width4 = 5184\n | height4 = 3888\n | image4 = Berounka, z Kra\u0161ova k v\u00fdchodu.jpg\n | caption4 = [[Berounka]] river valley in western Bohemia\n | width5 = 1280\n | height5 = 960\n | image5 = \u010celadenka (CZE) - the river.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids|Beskids]] mountains in eastern Moravia\n}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Czech Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] types of the Czech Republic\n{{legend|#3dc6fa|[[Humid continental climate]]}}\n{{legend|#63fd32|[[Oceanic climate]]}}\n{{legend|#007e7e|[[Subarctic climate]]}}\n]]\n\nThe Czech Republic mostly has a temperate [[oceanic climate]], with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters.

The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[B\u00edl\u00fd Potok (Liberec District)|B\u00edl\u00fd Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.\n\nAt the highest peak of [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] ({{convert|1603|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, Prague, has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.\n\nThe coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December.

The research based on cooperation between [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|universities]], [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Sciences]] and specialized research centers brings new inventions and impulses in this area. Important inventions include the modern [[contact lens]], the separation of modern [[blood type]]s, the modern genetics, many inventions in nanotechnologies and the production of [[Semtex]] [[plastic explosive]].\n\n==== Humanities ====\n[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jan Hus]] (1369\u20131415) is a key figure of the [[Bohemian Reformation]] and inspired the pre-[[Protestant]] [[Hussite movement]].]]\n[[Cyril and Methodius]] laid the foundations of education and the Czech theological thinking in the 9th century. Original theological and philosophical stream \u2013 [[Hussitism]] \u2013 originated in the Middle Ages. It was represented by [[Jan Hus]], [[Jerome of Prague]] or [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]. At the end of the Middle Ages, [[Jan Amos Comenius]] substantially contributed to the development of modern pedagogy. Jewish philosophy in the Czech lands was represented mainly by [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (known for the legend of the [[Golem]] of Prague). [[Bernard Bolzano]] was the personality of German-speaking philosophy in the Czech lands. [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] was a key Czech philosopher and historian of the Baroque era. He also started the struggle for rescuing the Czech language. This culminated in the [[Czech national revival]] in the first half of the 19th century. Linguistics ([[Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd]], [[Pavel Jozef \u0160afa\u0159\u00edk]], [[Josef Jungmann]]), ethnography ([[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Franti\u0161ek Ladislav \u010celakovsk\u00fd]]) and history ([[Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd]]) played a big role in revival. Palack\u00fd was the eminent personality. He wrote the first synthetic history of the Czech nation. He was also the first Czech modern politician and geopolitician (see also [[Austro-Slavism]]). He is often called \"The Father of the Nation\".\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century there was a huge development of social sciences. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] laid the foundations of Czech sociology. [[Konstantin Jire\u010dek]] founded Byzantology (see also [[Jire\u010dek Line]]). [[Alois Musil]] was a prominent orientalist, [[Emil Holub]] ethnographer. [[Lubor Niederle]] was a founder of modern Czech archeology. [[Sigmund Freud]] established psychoanalysis. [[Edmund Husserl]] defined a new philosophical doctrine \u2013 phenomenology. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] brought genuine economic ideas of \"creative destruction\" of capitalism. [[Hans Kelsen]] was significant legal theorist. [[Karl Kautsky]] influenced the history of Marxism. On the contrary, economist [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]] led a campaign against Marxism. [[Max Wertheimer]] was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology. Musicologists [[Eduard Hanslick]] and [[Guido Adler]] influenced debates on the development of classical music in Vienna.\n\nThe new Czechoslovak republic (1918\u20131938) wanted to develop sciences. Significant linguistic school was established in Prague \u2013 [[Prague Linguistic Circle]] ([[Vil\u00e9m Mathesius]], [[Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd]], [[Ren\u00e9 Wellek]]), moreover linguist [[Bed\u0159ich Hrozn\u00fd]] deciphered the ancient Hittite language and linguist [[Julius Pokorny]] deepened knowledge about Celtic languages. Philosopher [[Herbert Feigl]] was a member of the Vienna Circle. [[Ladislav Kl\u00edma]] has developed a special version of Nietzschean philosophy. In the second half of the 20th century can be mentioned philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]] who is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism. Also Czech historian [[Miroslav Hroch]] analyzed modern nationalism. [[Vil\u00e9m Flusser]] developed the philosophy of technology and image. Marxist [[Karel Kos\u00edk]] was a major philosopher in the background of the Prague Spring 1968. [[Jan Pato\u010dka]] and [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] were the main ideologists of the Charter 77. [[Egon Bondy]] was a major philosophical spokesman of the Czech underground in the 1970s and 1980s. Czech Egyptology has scored some successes, its main representative is [[Miroslav Verner]]. Czech psychologist [[Stanislav Grof]] developed a method of \"Holotropic Breathwork\". Experimental archaeologist [[Pavel Pavel]] made several attempts, they had to answer the question how ancient civilizations transported heavy weights.\n\n==== Science and technology ====\n{{Prose|section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Gregor Mendel portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gregor Mendel]], founder of [[genetics]]]]\n[[File:Jan Evangelista Purkyne 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b]]]]\nFamous scientists who were born on the territory of the current Czech Republic:\n* [[Friedrich von Berchtold]] (1781\u20131876), botanist, an avid worker for Czech national revival.\n* [[Wenceslas Bojer]] (1795\u20131856), naturalist and botanist.\n* [[Ignaz von Born]] (1742\u20131791), mineralogist and metallurgist, one of founders of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences.\n* [[Stanislav Brebera]] (1925\u20132012), inventor of the [[plastic explosive]] [[Semtex]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web | title=Velik\u00e1ni \u010desk\u00e9 v\u011bdy | url=http://www.velikani-ceske-vedy.estranky.cz/clanky/biografie/stanislav-brebera |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Josef \u010capek]] (1887\u20131945) and [[Karel \u010capek]] (1890\u20131938), brothers who originated the word [[robot]], for drama [[R.U.R.]]\n* [[Eduard \u010cech]] (1893\u20131960), mathematician with significant contributions in topology.\n* [[V\u00e1clav Prokop Divi\u0161]] (1698\u20131765), inventor of the first grounded [[lightning rod]].\n* [[Karel Domin]] (1882\u20131953), botanist, specialist in Australian taxonomy\n* [[Franti\u0161ek Josef Gerstner]] (1756\u20131832), physicist and engineer, built the first iron works and the first steam engine in Czech lands.\n* [[Gerty Cori|Gerty]] and [[Carl Cori]] \u2013 Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine 1947.\n* [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] (1906\u20131978) logician and mathematician, who became famous for his two incompleteness theorems.\n* [[Peter Gr\u00fcnberg]] (born 1939) Nobel Prize laureate in Physics 2007.\n* [[Jaroslav Heyrovsk\u00fd]] (1890\u20131967), inventor of [[polarography]], [[Analytical chemistry|electroanalytical chemistry]] and recipient of the Nobel Prize.<ref name=\"science1\" />\n*[[Josef Hlavka]] (15 February 1831 \u2013 11 March 1908), was a Czech architect, builder, philanthropist and founder of the oldest Czech foundation for sciences and arts.\n* [[Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd]] (1936\u20132012), scientist and chemist, in 2009 was involved in creation of the most effective drug in the treatment of AIDS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2009.cz/en/czech-presidency/presidency-faces/faces-of-the-presidency-3642/ |title=Faces of the Presidency |accessdate=8 January 2009 |work=eu2009.cz |publisher=EU2009.cz |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119103222/http://www.eu2009.cz/en/czech-presidency/presidency-faces/faces-of-the-presidency-3642/ |archive-date=19 January 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Jakub Husn\u00edk]] (1837\u20131916), improved the process of [[photolithography]].\n* [[Jan Jansk\u00fd]] (1873\u20131921), serologist and neurologist, discovered the [[ABO blood groups]].\n* [[Georg Joseph Kamel]] (1661\u20131706), Czech Jesuit, pharmacist and naturalist known for producing first comprehensive accounts of the Philippine flora;  genus of flowering plants Camellia is named in his honor.\n* [[Karel Kl\u00ed\u010d]] (1841\u20131926), painter and photographer, inventor of the [[photogravure]].\n* [[Franti\u0161ek K\u0159i\u017e\u00edk]] (1847\u20131941), electrical engineer, inventor of the [[arc lamp]].\n* [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz]] (1782\u20131843), biologist, founder of the great tradition of Czech mycology.* [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] (1821\u20131895), chemist, performed ground-breaking work in crystal forms.\n* [[Ernst Mach]] (1838\u20131916) physicist and critic of Newton's theories of space and time, foreshadowing Einstein's theory of relativity.\n* [[Jan Marek Marci]] (1595\u20131667), mathematician, physicist and imperial physician, one of the founders of [[spectroscopy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Thorburn|editor1-last=Burgess|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Mielenz|editor2-first=K.

After the [[Reformation]], some Bohemians went with the [[Lutheranism|teachings of Martin Luther]], especially [[Sudeten Germans]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly [[anti-Catholic]] stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions (notably Taborites) were revived. After the [[Habsburgs]] regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism\u2014even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A long history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing [[secularization]]. Protestantism never recovered after the [[Counter-Reformation]] was introduced by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] in 1620.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% was Catholic, 0.8% was [[Protestant]] (0.5% [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren|Czech Brethren]] and 0.4% [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Hussite]]<ref>The [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] contains mixed Protestant, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and national elements.

At the end of the century came a wave of [[Art Nouveau]]. Alfons Mucha became the main representative. He is today the most famous Czech painter.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He is mainly known for [[Art Nouveau]] posters and his cycle of 20 large canvases named [[the Slav Epic]], which depicts the history of Czechs and other [[Slavs]].\n\n{{As of|2012}}, [[the Slav Epic]] can be seen in the Veletr\u017en\u00ed Palace of the [[National Gallery in Prague]], which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic. [[Max \u0160vabinsk\u00fd]] was another important Art nouveau painter. The 20th century brought avant-garde revolution. In the Czech lands mainly expressionist and cubist: [[Josef \u010capek]], [[Emil Filla]], [[Bohumil Kubi\u0161ta]], [[Jan Zrzav\u00fd]].

In the world, however, he pushed mainly [[Franti\u0161ek Kupka]], a pioneer of abstract painting.

Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] ([[St. George's Basilica, Prague|St. George's Basilica]], [[St. Procopius Basilica in T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]]). During the 13th century it was replaced by the [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] ([[Charles Bridge]], [[Bethlehem Chapel]], [[Old New Synagogue]], [[Sedlec Ossuary]], [[Old Town Hall (Prague)|Old Town Hall]] with [[Prague astronomical clock]], [[Church of Our Lady before T\u00fdn]]). In the 14th century Emperor Charles IV invited to his court in Prague talented architects from France and Germany, [[Matthias of Arras]] and [[Peter Parler]] ([[Karl\u0161tejn]], [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[St. Barbara's Church, Kutn\u00e1 Hora|St. Barbara's Church in Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]). During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as many monasteries ([[Strahov Monastery]], [[\u0160pilberk]], [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1t Castle]], [[Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod Monastery]]). During the [[Hussite wars]], many of them were damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be slowly mixed with Renaissance elements (architects [[Mat\u011bj Rejsek]], [[Benedikt Rejt]] and their [[Powder Tower]]). An outstanding example of the pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the [[Royal Summer Palace]], which was situated in a newly established garden of [[Prague Castle]]. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving a massive influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious ch\u00e2teaux with elegant arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens ([[Litomy\u0161l Castle]], [[Hlubok\u00e1 Castle]]).<ref name=architecture>{{cite web|title=History of Czech Architecture|url=http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|website=eu2009.cz|publisher=Czech Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=20 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015211407/http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.<ref name=czecharchitecture>{{cite web|title=The History of Architecture|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|website=www.czech.cz|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212429/http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia. Very outstanding are the architectural projects of the Czech nobleman and imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] from the 1620s ([[Wallenstein Palace]]). His architects Andrea Spezza and [[Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni|Giovanni Pieroni]] reflected the most recent Italian production and were very innovative at the same time. [[Czech Baroque architecture]] is considered to be a unique part of the European cultural heritage thanks to its extensiveness and extraordinariness ([[Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e Castle]], [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church at Mal\u00e1 Strana]], [[Karlova Koruna Chateau]]). In the first third of the 18th century the Bohemian lands were one of the leading artistic centers of the Baroque style. In Bohemia there was completed the development of the Radical Baroque style created in Italy by [[Francesco Borromini]] and [[Guarino Guarini]] in a very original way.<ref name=kotalik>{{cite book|last=Kotal\u00edk|first=Ji\u0159\u00ed|title=Architektura barokn\u00ed|year=2002|publisher=Spr\u00e1va Pra\u017esk\u00e9ho hradu a DaDa|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-86161-38-9|page=13|edition=Deset stolet\u00ed architektury|language=Czech}}</ref> Leading architects of the Bohemian Baroque were [[Jean Baptiste Mathey|Jean-Baptiste Mathey]], [[Franti\u0161ek Maxmili\u00e1n Ka\u0148ka]], [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]], and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]].\n\nIn the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity \u2013 the ''Baroque Gothic style'', a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles. This was not a simple return to Gothic details, but rather an original Baroque transformation. The main representative and originator of this style was [[Jan Bla\u017eej Santini-Aichel]], who used this style in renovating medieval monastic buildings or in [[Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk]].<ref name=architecture />\n\nDuring the 19th century, the [[Revival architecture|revival architectural styles]] were very popular in the Bohemian monarchy. Many churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed many new buildings in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] styles ([[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], [[Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape]], [[Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno|Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Brno]]). At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the new art style appeared in the Czech lands \u2013 [[Art Nouveau]]. The best-known representatives of Czech Art Nouveau architecture were [[Osvald Pol\u00edvka]], who designed the [[Municipal House]] in Prague, [[Josef Fanta]], the architect of the [[Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed|Prague Main Railway Station]], [[Jan Letzel]], [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Jan Kot\u011bra]].\n\nBohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the [[Cubism]] of painting and sculpture into architecture ([[House of the Black Madonna]]). During the first years of the independent Czechoslovakia (after 1918), a specifically Czech architectural style, called ''Rondo-Cubism'', came into existence. Together with the pre-war [[Cubism#Czech Cubist architecture|Czech Cubist architecture]] it is unparalleled elsewhere in the world. The first Czechoslovak president [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] invited the prominent [[Slovenia|Slovene]] architect [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]] to Prague, where he modernized the [[Prague Castle|Castle]] and built some other buildings ([[Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord]]).\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style in the newly established Czechoslovak Republic. In the city of Brno, one of the most impressive functionalist works has been preserved \u2013 [[Villa Tugendhat]], designed by the architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=architecture /> The most significant Czech architects of this era were [[Adolf Loos]], [[Pavel Jan\u00e1k]] and [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]].\n\nAfter World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became strongly Soviet influenced. [[Hotel International Prague|Hotel International]] in Prague is a brilliant example of the so-called [[Socialist realism]], the Stalinistic art style of the 1950s. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement known as the ''[[Brussels style]]'' (named after the Brussels World's Fair [[Expo 58]]) became popular in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. [[Brutalism]] dominated in the 1970s and 1980s ([[Kotva Department Store]], [[Ostravar Ar\u00e9na]], [[Barrandov Bridge]], [[Transgas (building)|Transgas building]]).\n\nEven today, the Czech Republic is not shying away from the most modern trends of international architecture. This fact is attested to by a number of projects by world-renowned architects ([[Frank Gehry]] and his [[Dancing House]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Ricardo Bofill]], and [[John Pawson]]). There are also contemporary Czech architects whose works can be found all over the world ([[Vlado Miluni\u0107]], [[Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Jan Kaplick\u00fd]]).<ref name=architecture />\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Czech literature}}\n[[File:Kafka1906 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Kafka]]]]\n\nIn a strict sense, [[Czech literature]] is the literature written in the [[Czech language]]. A more liberal definition incorporates all literary works written in the Czech lands regardless of language. The literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in [[Latin]] and German or even [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Thus [[Franz Kafka]], who\u2014while bilingual in Czech and German{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164\u2013210}}\u2014wrote his works (''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'') in German, during the era of Austrian rule, can represent the [[Czech literature|Czech]], German or [[Austrian literature]] depending on the point of view.\n\nInfluential Czech authors who wrote in Latin include [[Cosmas of Prague]] (\u2020 1125), [[Martin of Opava]] (\u2020 1278), [[Peter of Zittau]] (\u2020 1339), [[Jan Hus|John Hus]] (\u2020 1415), [[Bohuslav Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (1461\u20131510), [[Jan Dubravius]] (1486\u20131553), [[Tade\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1jek]] (1525\u20131600), [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]] (1572\u20131622), [[John Amos Comenius]] (1592\u20131670), and [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] (1621\u20131688).\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of the German [[Minnesang]] and courtly literature ([[Reinmar von Zweter]], [[Heinrich von Freiberg]], Ulrich von Etzenbach, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]). The most famous Czech medieval German-language work is the ''Ploughman of Bohemia'' (''[[Der Ackermann aus B\u00f6hmen]]''), written around 1401 by [[Johannes von Tepl]]. The heyday of Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century, which is represented by the well-known names of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Egon Kisch|Egon Erwin Kisch]], and others.\n\n[[File:Jaroslav Seifert 1981 foto Hana Hamplov\u00e1.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Jaroslav Seifert]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\n[[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translations]] played an important role in the development of Czech literature and the standard Czech language. The oldest Czech translation of the [[Psalms]] originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488 ([[Prague Bible]]). The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593 and is known as the [[Bible of Kralice]]. The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.\n\nCzech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages ([[Chronicle of Dalimil]]); the Hussite period ([[Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160t\u00edtn\u00fd ze \u0160t\u00edtn\u00e9ho]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]); the [[Renaissance humanism]] ([[Henry the Younger of Pod\u011bbrady]], [[Luke of Prague]], [[Wenceslaus Hajek]], [[Jan Blahoslav]], [[Daniel Adam z Veleslav\u00edna]]); the Baroque period ([[John Amos Comenius]], [[Adam V\u00e1clav Michna z Otradovic]], [[Bed\u0159ich Bridel]], [[Jan Franti\u0161ek Beckovsk\u00fd]]); the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century ([[V\u00e1clav Mat\u011bj Kramerius]], [[Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha]], [[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd]], [[Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1]], [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]], [[Josef Kajet\u00e1n Tyl]]), modern literature in second half of the 19th century ([[Jan Neruda]], [[Alois Jir\u00e1sek]], [[Viktor Dyk]], [[Jaroslav Vrchlick\u00fd]], [[Julius Zeyer]], [[Svatopluk \u010cech]]); the avant-garde of the interwar period ([[Karel \u010capek]], [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]], [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], [[Jaroslav Seifert]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Wolker]], [[Vladim\u00edr Holan]]); the years under Communism and the Prague Spring ([[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]], [[Bohumil Hrabal]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Arno\u0161t Lustig]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], [[Pavel Kohout]], [[Ivan Kl\u00edma]]); and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic ([[Ivan Martin Jirous]], [[Michal Viewegh]], [[J\u00e1chym Topol]], [[Patrik Ou\u0159edn\u00edk]], [[Kate\u0159ina Tu\u010dkov\u00e1]]).\n[[File:Karel \u010capek 30.l\u00e9ta.jpg|thumb|203x203px|Czech writer [[Karel \u010capek]]]]\nNoted journalists include [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (journalist)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]], [[Milena Jesensk\u00e1]], and [[Ferdinand Peroutka]].\n\n[[Jaroslav Seifert]] was the only Czech writer awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

The [[Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice]], dated to 29,000\u201325,000 BCE, together with a few others from nearby locations, is the oldest known [[ceramic]] artifact in the world.\n\nIn the [[classical era]], as a result of the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, Bohemia became associated with the [[Boii]]. The Boii founded a city on the site of modern Prague; some of its ancient ruins are now a tourist attraction. According to a 2000 study by Semino, 35.6% of Czech males have y-chromosome haplogroup [[R1b]],  which is common among Celts but rare among Slavs. Some modern Czechs claim that the people are as much descendants of the Boii as they are from the later Slavic invaders (as well as the historical Germanic peoples of Czech lands).\n\nLater in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. Their king [[Maroboduus]] is the first documented ruler of Bohemia. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe. Most of the names of Czech rivers are  Celtic or old Germanic in origin, dating from usage in those years.\n\n[[Slavs]] from the [[Black Sea]]\u2013[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (their migration was pushed by an invasion of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe into their area: [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). In the sixth century, they <!-- which invaders? -->moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia, and some of present-day Austria and Germany.\n\nDuring the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], became the ruler of the first known Slavic state in Central Europe, [[Samo's Empire]]. The principality of [[Great Moravia]], controlled by [[House of Mojmir|Moymir dynasty]], arose in the 8th century. It reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]]), holding off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a crucial role being played by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mission of [[Cyril and Methodius]]. They created the artificial language [[Old Church Slavonic]], the first literary and liturgical language of the [[Slavs]], and the [[Glagolitic alphabet]].\n\n=== Bohemia ===\n{{Main|Bohemia}}\n[[File:Duchy of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire in 11th century.svg|thumb|left|The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 11th century]]\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]]. In 10th century [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]] and expanded farther to the east. The Duchy of Bohemia, raised to the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1198, was from 1002 until 1806 an [[Imperial State]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] alongside the [[Kingdom of Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and numerous other territories such as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and various [[Papal States]]. The kingdom was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" from 1198) extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. The bull declared that the King of Bohemia would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in imperial councils. German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. Germans populated towns and mining districts and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of Bohemia. In 1235, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]]. After the [[Battle of Legnica]] in Poland, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia, but were defensively defeated at the fortified town of [[Olomouc]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grousset |first1=Ren\u00e9 |title=The Empire of the Steppes |date=1970 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou/page/266 266] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou |url-access=registration |access-date=26 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Mongols subsequently invaded and defeated Hungary.<ref>Jan Dugosz, Maurice Michael (1997) ''The Annals of Jan Dlugosz'', IM Publications, {{ISBN|1-901019-00-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VaclavGelnhausenovekodexu.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I]], [[List of Bohemian monarchs|King of Bohemia]] (1230\u20131253) of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], [[Gelnhausen Codex]]]]\nKing [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Otakar II]] earned the nickname ''Iron and Golden King'' because of his military power and wealth.

The most famous figure of the nascent [[Bohemian Reformation]] became [[Jan Hus]]. Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in [[Konstanz|Constance]] in 1415, his followers (led by warlords [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]] and [[Prokop the Great]]) seceded from some practices of the Roman Church and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419\u20131434) defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemian and Moravian lands were considered [[Hussites]]. Hussite [[George of Podebrady]] was even a king. Another great thinker of the Bohemian Reformation, [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]], inspired the movement of the [[Unity of the Brethren|Bohemian Brethren]] that completely separated from the Catholic Church (unlike the Hussites). Hus's thoughts were a major influence on the later [[Lutheranism]]. [[Martin Luther]] himself said \"we are all Hussites, without having been aware of it\" and considered himself as Hus's direct successor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/|title=Mentor and precursor of the Reformation|access-date=29 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404211907/http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/|archive-date=4 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Husit\u00e9 - Jensk\u00fd kodex.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=Painting of battle between mounted knights|Battle between [[Bohemian Reformation|Protestant]] [[Hussites]] and Catholic [[crusade]]rs during the [[Hussite Wars]]; Jena Codex, 15th century]]\nAfter 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia.

[[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkono\u0161e]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder]] River ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).\n\nWater from the Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|sp=us|adj=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Western European broadleaf forests]], [[Central European mixed forests]], Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.\n\nThere are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is [[Krkono\u0161e National Park]] ([[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]]), and the others are [[\u0160umava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyj\u00ed National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].\n\nThe three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly the core countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond almost perfectly with the river basins of the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).\n\n{{multiple image\n | align  = center\n | total_width = 1000\n | width1 = 1300\n | height1 = 867\n | image1 = K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko - Podzimn\u00ed bu\u010dina.JPG\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = [[Temperate deciduous forest]] in [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko Protected Landscape Area]]\n | width2 = 1600\n | height2 = 1022\n | image2 = Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = Rolling hills of [[Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk]] in northern Czech Republic\n | width3 = 3010\n | height3 = 2000\n | image3 = Podzim na Ka\u0161perku.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | caption3 = [[Bohemian Forest]] foothills and [[Ka\u0161perk]] castle, southern Bohemia\n | width4 = 5184\n | height4 = 3888\n | image4 = Berounka, z Kra\u0161ova k v\u00fdchodu.jpg\n | caption4 = [[Berounka]] river valley in western Bohemia\n | width5 = 1280\n | height5 = 960\n | image5 = \u010celadenka (CZE) - the river.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids|Beskids]] mountains in eastern Moravia\n}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Czech Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] types of the Czech Republic\n{{legend|#3dc6fa|[[Humid continental climate]]}}\n{{legend|#63fd32|[[Oceanic climate]]}}\n{{legend|#007e7e|[[Subarctic climate]]}}\n]]\n\nThe Czech Republic mostly has a temperate [[oceanic climate]], with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters.

The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[B\u00edl\u00fd Potok (Liberec District)|B\u00edl\u00fd Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.\n\nAt the highest peak of [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] ({{convert|1603|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, Prague, has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.\n\nThe coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December.

The research based on cooperation between [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|universities]], [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Sciences]] and specialized research centers brings new inventions and impulses in this area. Important inventions include the modern [[contact lens]], the separation of modern [[blood type]]s, the modern genetics, many inventions in nanotechnologies and the production of [[Semtex]] [[plastic explosive]].\n\n==== Humanities ====\n[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jan Hus]] (1369\u20131415) is a key figure of the [[Bohemian Reformation]] and inspired the pre-[[Protestant]] [[Hussite movement]].]]\n[[Cyril and Methodius]] laid the foundations of education and the Czech theological thinking in the 9th century. Original theological and philosophical stream \u2013 [[Hussitism]] \u2013 originated in the Middle Ages. It was represented by [[Jan Hus]], [[Jerome of Prague]] or [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]. At the end of the Middle Ages, [[Jan Amos Comenius]] substantially contributed to the development of modern pedagogy. Jewish philosophy in the Czech lands was represented mainly by [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (known for the legend of the [[Golem]] of Prague). [[Bernard Bolzano]] was the personality of German-speaking philosophy in the Czech lands. [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] was a key Czech philosopher and historian of the Baroque era. He also started the struggle for rescuing the Czech language. This culminated in the [[Czech national revival]] in the first half of the 19th century. Linguistics ([[Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd]], [[Pavel Jozef \u0160afa\u0159\u00edk]], [[Josef Jungmann]]), ethnography ([[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Franti\u0161ek Ladislav \u010celakovsk\u00fd]]) and history ([[Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd]]) played a big role in revival. Palack\u00fd was the eminent personality. He wrote the first synthetic history of the Czech nation. He was also the first Czech modern politician and geopolitician (see also [[Austro-Slavism]]). He is often called \"The Father of the Nation\".\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century there was a huge development of social sciences. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] laid the foundations of Czech sociology. [[Konstantin Jire\u010dek]] founded Byzantology (see also [[Jire\u010dek Line]]). [[Alois Musil]] was a prominent orientalist, [[Emil Holub]] ethnographer. [[Lubor Niederle]] was a founder of modern Czech archeology. [[Sigmund Freud]] established psychoanalysis. [[Edmund Husserl]] defined a new philosophical doctrine \u2013 phenomenology. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] brought genuine economic ideas of \"creative destruction\" of capitalism. [[Hans Kelsen]] was significant legal theorist. [[Karl Kautsky]] influenced the history of Marxism. On the contrary, economist [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]] led a campaign against Marxism. [[Max Wertheimer]] was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology. Musicologists [[Eduard Hanslick]] and [[Guido Adler]] influenced debates on the development of classical music in Vienna.\n\nThe new Czechoslovak republic (1918\u20131938) wanted to develop sciences. Significant linguistic school was established in Prague \u2013 [[Prague Linguistic Circle]] ([[Vil\u00e9m Mathesius]], [[Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd]], [[Ren\u00e9 Wellek]]), moreover linguist [[Bed\u0159ich Hrozn\u00fd]] deciphered the ancient Hittite language and linguist [[Julius Pokorny]] deepened knowledge about Celtic languages. Philosopher [[Herbert Feigl]] was a member of the Vienna Circle. [[Ladislav Kl\u00edma]] has developed a special version of Nietzschean philosophy. In the second half of the 20th century can be mentioned philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]] who is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism. Also Czech historian [[Miroslav Hroch]] analyzed modern nationalism. [[Vil\u00e9m Flusser]] developed the philosophy of technology and image. Marxist [[Karel Kos\u00edk]] was a major philosopher in the background of the Prague Spring 1968. [[Jan Pato\u010dka]] and [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] were the main ideologists of the Charter 77. [[Egon Bondy]] was a major philosophical spokesman of the Czech underground in the 1970s and 1980s. Czech Egyptology has scored some successes, its main representative is [[Miroslav Verner]]. Czech psychologist [[Stanislav Grof]] developed a method of \"Holotropic Breathwork\". Experimental archaeologist [[Pavel Pavel]] made several attempts, they had to answer the question how ancient civilizations transported heavy weights.\n\n==== Science and technology ====\n{{Prose|section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Gregor Mendel portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gregor Mendel]], founder of [[genetics]]]]\n[[File:Jan Evangelista Purkyne 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b]]]]\nFamous scientists who were born on the territory of the current Czech Republic:\n* [[Friedrich von Berchtold]] (1781\u20131876), botanist, an avid worker for Czech national revival.\n* [[Wenceslas Bojer]] (1795\u20131856), naturalist and botanist.\n* [[Ignaz von Born]] (1742\u20131791), mineralogist and metallurgist, one of founders of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences.\n* [[Stanislav Brebera]] (1925\u20132012), inventor of the [[plastic explosive]] [[Semtex]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web | title=Velik\u00e1ni \u010desk\u00e9 v\u011bdy | url=http://www.velikani-ceske-vedy.estranky.cz/clanky/biografie/stanislav-brebera |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Josef \u010capek]] (1887\u20131945) and [[Karel \u010capek]] (1890\u20131938), brothers who originated the word [[robot]], for drama [[R.U.R.]]\n* [[Eduard \u010cech]] (1893\u20131960), mathematician with significant contributions in topology.\n* [[V\u00e1clav Prokop Divi\u0161]] (1698\u20131765), inventor of the first grounded [[lightning rod]].\n* [[Karel Domin]] (1882\u20131953), botanist, specialist in Australian taxonomy\n* [[Franti\u0161ek Josef Gerstner]] (1756\u20131832), physicist and engineer, built the first iron works and the first steam engine in Czech lands.\n* [[Gerty Cori|Gerty]] and [[Carl Cori]] \u2013 Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine 1947.\n* [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] (1906\u20131978) logician and mathematician, who became famous for his two incompleteness theorems.\n* [[Peter Gr\u00fcnberg]] (born 1939) Nobel Prize laureate in Physics 2007.\n* [[Jaroslav Heyrovsk\u00fd]] (1890\u20131967), inventor of [[polarography]], [[Analytical chemistry|electroanalytical chemistry]] and recipient of the Nobel Prize.<ref name=\"science1\" />\n*[[Josef Hlavka]] (15 February 1831 \u2013 11 March 1908), was a Czech architect, builder, philanthropist and founder of the oldest Czech foundation for sciences and arts.\n* [[Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd]] (1936\u20132012), scientist and chemist, in 2009 was involved in creation of the most effective drug in the treatment of AIDS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2009.cz/en/czech-presidency/presidency-faces/faces-of-the-presidency-3642/ |title=Faces of the Presidency |accessdate=8 January 2009 |work=eu2009.cz |publisher=EU2009.cz |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119103222/http://www.eu2009.cz/en/czech-presidency/presidency-faces/faces-of-the-presidency-3642/ |archive-date=19 January 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Jakub Husn\u00edk]] (1837\u20131916), improved the process of [[photolithography]].\n* [[Jan Jansk\u00fd]] (1873\u20131921), serologist and neurologist, discovered the [[ABO blood groups]].\n* [[Georg Joseph Kamel]] (1661\u20131706), Czech Jesuit, pharmacist and naturalist known for producing first comprehensive accounts of the Philippine flora;  genus of flowering plants Camellia is named in his honor.\n* [[Karel Kl\u00ed\u010d]] (1841\u20131926), painter and photographer, inventor of the [[photogravure]].\n* [[Franti\u0161ek K\u0159i\u017e\u00edk]] (1847\u20131941), electrical engineer, inventor of the [[arc lamp]].\n* [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz]] (1782\u20131843), biologist, founder of the great tradition of Czech mycology.* [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] (1821\u20131895), chemist, performed ground-breaking work in crystal forms.\n* [[Ernst Mach]] (1838\u20131916) physicist and critic of Newton's theories of space and time, foreshadowing Einstein's theory of relativity.\n* [[Jan Marek Marci]] (1595\u20131667), mathematician, physicist and imperial physician, one of the founders of [[spectroscopy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Thorburn|editor1-last=Burgess|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Mielenz|editor2-first=K.

After the [[Reformation]], some Bohemians went with the [[Lutheranism|teachings of Martin Luther]], especially [[Sudeten Germans]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly [[anti-Catholic]] stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions (notably Taborites) were revived. After the [[Habsburgs]] regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism\u2014even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A long history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing [[secularization]]. Protestantism never recovered after the [[Counter-Reformation]] was introduced by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] in 1620.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% was Catholic, 0.8% was [[Protestant]] (0.5% [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren|Czech Brethren]] and 0.4% [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Hussite]]<ref>The [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] contains mixed Protestant, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and national elements.

At the end of the century came a wave of [[Art Nouveau]]. Alfons Mucha became the main representative. He is today the most famous Czech painter.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He is mainly known for [[Art Nouveau]] posters and his cycle of 20 large canvases named [[the Slav Epic]], which depicts the history of Czechs and other [[Slavs]].\n\n{{As of|2012}}, [[the Slav Epic]] can be seen in the Veletr\u017en\u00ed Palace of the [[National Gallery in Prague]], which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic. [[Max \u0160vabinsk\u00fd]] was another important Art nouveau painter. The 20th century brought avant-garde revolution. In the Czech lands mainly expressionist and cubist: [[Josef \u010capek]], [[Emil Filla]], [[Bohumil Kubi\u0161ta]], [[Jan Zrzav\u00fd]].

In the world, however, he pushed mainly [[Franti\u0161ek Kupka]], a pioneer of abstract painting.

Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] ([[St. George's Basilica, Prague|St. George's Basilica]], [[St. Procopius Basilica in T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]]). During the 13th century it was replaced by the [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] ([[Charles Bridge]], [[Bethlehem Chapel]], [[Old New Synagogue]], [[Sedlec Ossuary]], [[Old Town Hall (Prague)|Old Town Hall]] with [[Prague astronomical clock]], [[Church of Our Lady before T\u00fdn]]). In the 14th century Emperor Charles IV invited to his court in Prague talented architects from France and Germany, [[Matthias of Arras]] and [[Peter Parler]] ([[Karl\u0161tejn]], [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[St. Barbara's Church, Kutn\u00e1 Hora|St. Barbara's Church in Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]). During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as many monasteries ([[Strahov Monastery]], [[\u0160pilberk]], [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1t Castle]], [[Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod Monastery]]). During the [[Hussite wars]], many of them were damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be slowly mixed with Renaissance elements (architects [[Mat\u011bj Rejsek]], [[Benedikt Rejt]] and their [[Powder Tower]]). An outstanding example of the pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the [[Royal Summer Palace]], which was situated in a newly established garden of [[Prague Castle]]. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving a massive influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious ch\u00e2teaux with elegant arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens ([[Litomy\u0161l Castle]], [[Hlubok\u00e1 Castle]]).<ref name=architecture>{{cite web|title=History of Czech Architecture|url=http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|website=eu2009.cz|publisher=Czech Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=20 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015211407/http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.<ref name=czecharchitecture>{{cite web|title=The History of Architecture|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|website=www.czech.cz|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212429/http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia. Very outstanding are the architectural projects of the Czech nobleman and imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] from the 1620s ([[Wallenstein Palace]]). His architects Andrea Spezza and [[Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni|Giovanni Pieroni]] reflected the most recent Italian production and were very innovative at the same time. [[Czech Baroque architecture]] is considered to be a unique part of the European cultural heritage thanks to its extensiveness and extraordinariness ([[Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e Castle]], [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church at Mal\u00e1 Strana]], [[Karlova Koruna Chateau]]). In the first third of the 18th century the Bohemian lands were one of the leading artistic centers of the Baroque style. In Bohemia there was completed the development of the Radical Baroque style created in Italy by [[Francesco Borromini]] and [[Guarino Guarini]] in a very original way.<ref name=kotalik>{{cite book|last=Kotal\u00edk|first=Ji\u0159\u00ed|title=Architektura barokn\u00ed|year=2002|publisher=Spr\u00e1va Pra\u017esk\u00e9ho hradu a DaDa|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-86161-38-9|page=13|edition=Deset stolet\u00ed architektury|language=Czech}}</ref> Leading architects of the Bohemian Baroque were [[Jean Baptiste Mathey|Jean-Baptiste Mathey]], [[Franti\u0161ek Maxmili\u00e1n Ka\u0148ka]], [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]], and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]].\n\nIn the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity \u2013 the ''Baroque Gothic style'', a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles. This was not a simple return to Gothic details, but rather an original Baroque transformation. The main representative and originator of this style was [[Jan Bla\u017eej Santini-Aichel]], who used this style in renovating medieval monastic buildings or in [[Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk]].<ref name=architecture />\n\nDuring the 19th century, the [[Revival architecture|revival architectural styles]] were very popular in the Bohemian monarchy. Many churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed many new buildings in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] styles ([[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], [[Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape]], [[Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno|Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Brno]]). At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the new art style appeared in the Czech lands \u2013 [[Art Nouveau]]. The best-known representatives of Czech Art Nouveau architecture were [[Osvald Pol\u00edvka]], who designed the [[Municipal House]] in Prague, [[Josef Fanta]], the architect of the [[Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed|Prague Main Railway Station]], [[Jan Letzel]], [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Jan Kot\u011bra]].\n\nBohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the [[Cubism]] of painting and sculpture into architecture ([[House of the Black Madonna]]). During the first years of the independent Czechoslovakia (after 1918), a specifically Czech architectural style, called ''Rondo-Cubism'', came into existence. Together with the pre-war [[Cubism#Czech Cubist architecture|Czech Cubist architecture]] it is unparalleled elsewhere in the world. The first Czechoslovak president [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] invited the prominent [[Slovenia|Slovene]] architect [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]] to Prague, where he modernized the [[Prague Castle|Castle]] and built some other buildings ([[Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord]]).\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style in the newly established Czechoslovak Republic. In the city of Brno, one of the most impressive functionalist works has been preserved \u2013 [[Villa Tugendhat]], designed by the architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=architecture /> The most significant Czech architects of this era were [[Adolf Loos]], [[Pavel Jan\u00e1k]] and [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]].\n\nAfter World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became strongly Soviet influenced. [[Hotel International Prague|Hotel International]] in Prague is a brilliant example of the so-called [[Socialist realism]], the Stalinistic art style of the 1950s. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement known as the ''[[Brussels style]]'' (named after the Brussels World's Fair [[Expo 58]]) became popular in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. [[Brutalism]] dominated in the 1970s and 1980s ([[Kotva Department Store]], [[Ostravar Ar\u00e9na]], [[Barrandov Bridge]], [[Transgas (building)|Transgas building]]).\n\nEven today, the Czech Republic is not shying away from the most modern trends of international architecture. This fact is attested to by a number of projects by world-renowned architects ([[Frank Gehry]] and his [[Dancing House]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Ricardo Bofill]], and [[John Pawson]]). There are also contemporary Czech architects whose works can be found all over the world ([[Vlado Miluni\u0107]], [[Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Jan Kaplick\u00fd]]).<ref name=architecture />\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Czech literature}}\n[[File:Kafka1906 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Kafka]]]]\n\nIn a strict sense, [[Czech literature]] is the literature written in the [[Czech language]]. A more liberal definition incorporates all literary works written in the Czech lands regardless of language. The literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in [[Latin]] and German or even [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Thus [[Franz Kafka]], who\u2014while bilingual in Czech and German{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164\u2013210}}\u2014wrote his works (''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'') in German, during the era of Austrian rule, can represent the [[Czech literature|Czech]], German or [[Austrian literature]] depending on the point of view.\n\nInfluential Czech authors who wrote in Latin include [[Cosmas of Prague]] (\u2020 1125), [[Martin of Opava]] (\u2020 1278), [[Peter of Zittau]] (\u2020 1339), [[Jan Hus|John Hus]] (\u2020 1415), [[Bohuslav Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (1461\u20131510), [[Jan Dubravius]] (1486\u20131553), [[Tade\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1jek]] (1525\u20131600), [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]] (1572\u20131622), [[John Amos Comenius]] (1592\u20131670), and [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] (1621\u20131688).\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of the German [[Minnesang]] and courtly literature ([[Reinmar von Zweter]], [[Heinrich von Freiberg]], Ulrich von Etzenbach, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]). The most famous Czech medieval German-language work is the ''Ploughman of Bohemia'' (''[[Der Ackermann aus B\u00f6hmen]]''), written around 1401 by [[Johannes von Tepl]]. The heyday of Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century, which is represented by the well-known names of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Egon Kisch|Egon Erwin Kisch]], and others.\n\n[[File:Jaroslav Seifert 1981 foto Hana Hamplov\u00e1.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Jaroslav Seifert]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\n[[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translations]] played an important role in the development of Czech literature and the standard Czech language. The oldest Czech translation of the [[Psalms]] originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488 ([[Prague Bible]]). The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593 and is known as the [[Bible of Kralice]]. The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.\n\nCzech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages ([[Chronicle of Dalimil]]); the Hussite period ([[Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160t\u00edtn\u00fd ze \u0160t\u00edtn\u00e9ho]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]); the [[Renaissance humanism]] ([[Henry the Younger of Pod\u011bbrady]], [[Luke of Prague]], [[Wenceslaus Hajek]], [[Jan Blahoslav]], [[Daniel Adam z Veleslav\u00edna]]); the Baroque period ([[John Amos Comenius]], [[Adam V\u00e1clav Michna z Otradovic]], [[Bed\u0159ich Bridel]], [[Jan Franti\u0161ek Beckovsk\u00fd]]); the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century ([[V\u00e1clav Mat\u011bj Kramerius]], [[Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha]], [[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd]], [[Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1]], [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]], [[Josef Kajet\u00e1n Tyl]]), modern literature in second half of the 19th century ([[Jan Neruda]], [[Alois Jir\u00e1sek]], [[Viktor Dyk]], [[Jaroslav Vrchlick\u00fd]], [[Julius Zeyer]], [[Svatopluk \u010cech]]); the avant-garde of the interwar period ([[Karel \u010capek]], [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]], [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], [[Jaroslav Seifert]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Wolker]], [[Vladim\u00edr Holan]]); the years under Communism and the Prague Spring ([[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]], [[Bohumil Hrabal]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Arno\u0161t Lustig]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], [[Pavel Kohout]], [[Ivan Kl\u00edma]]); and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic ([[Ivan Martin Jirous]], [[Michal Viewegh]], [[J\u00e1chym Topol]], [[Patrik Ou\u0159edn\u00edk]], [[Kate\u0159ina Tu\u010dkov\u00e1]]).\n[[File:Karel \u010capek 30.l\u00e9ta.jpg|thumb|203x203px|Czech writer [[Karel \u010capek]]]]\nNoted journalists include [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (journalist)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]], [[Milena Jesensk\u00e1]], and [[Ferdinand Peroutka]].\n\n[[Jaroslav Seifert]] was the only Czech writer awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107. Those expectations were not fulfilled and Bandi\u0107 later used his Herzegovinian background as an advantage, broadening his support among the ordinary citizens of Zagreb.\n\nThe HDZ under Bandi\u0107 eventually lost power in the Croatian capital in 2000.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\n==={{anchor|First and second term (2000\u20132002)}}First and second terms (2000\u20132002)===\n{{see also|2000 Zagreb local elections|2001 Zagreb local elections}}\n\nBandi\u0107 was elected [[mayor]] of Zagreb in 2000<ref name=izbori>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | title = Izbori odr\u017eani 7. svibnja 2000.\n | work = Gradski zavod za automatsku obradu podataka\n | accessdate = 2008-07-27\n | language = Croatian\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100129103926/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | archive-date = 2010-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> and re-elected in the city election in 2001.<ref name=izbori_2001>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| title = Izbori odr\u017eani 20. svibnja 2001.\n| work = City Bureau for Automatic Data Processing\n| accessdate = 2008-08-04\n| language = Croatian\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316190322/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| archive-date = 2008-03-16\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> His rise in influence among SDP politicians and on the Zagreb political scene created a backlash by the [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), the other left-of-center party led by [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]], who did not trust his nationalist populism and his occasional run-ins with the courts.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107.

The HNS campaigned against the SDP in the 2000 elections. However, the HNS entered into a coalition with the SDP in 2001.

The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.\n\nSince 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognised only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.\n[[File:Nicos Anastasiades at EPP HQ.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Nicos Anastasiades]], President of Cyprus since 2013.]]\nThe House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964.

Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] and Italian [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191\u20131571).\n\nA well known traditional art that dates at least from the 14th century is the [[Lefkara lace|Lefkara Lace]] (also known as \"Lefkaratika\", which originates from the village [[Pano Lefkara|Lefkara]]. Lefkara lace is recognised as an [[Intangible cultural heritage|intangible cultural heritage (ICH)]] by Unesco, and it is characterised by distinct design patterns, and its intricate, time-consuming production process. A genuine Lefkara lace with full embroidery can take typically hundreds of hours to be made, and that is why it is usually priced quite high. Another local form of art the originated from Lefkara is the production of Cypriot Filigree (locally known as ''Trifourenio''), a type of jewellery that is made with twisted threads of silver. In Lefkara village there is government funded center named Lefkara Handicraft Center the mission of which is to educate and teach the art of making the embroidery and silver jewellery. There's also the Museum of Traditional Embroidery an Silversmithing located in the village which has large collection of local handmade art.\n\nIn modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883\u20131958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.<ref>Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.</ref> Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900\u20131994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924\u20131968) who also studied in London, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]].<ref>Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)</ref> In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day.

The Lusignan kings were known for importing Syrian cooks to Cyprus, and it has been suggested that one of the key routes for the importation of Middle Eastern recipes into France and other Western European countries, such as blancmange, was via the Lusignan Kingdom of Cyprus. These recipes became known in the West as ''Vyands de Chypre,'' or Foods of Cyprus, and the food historian William Woys Weaver has identified over one hundred of them in English, French, Italian and German recipe books of the Middle Ages. One that became particularly popular across Europe in the medieval and early modern periods was a stew made with chicken or fish called ''malmonia,'' which in English became mawmeny.<ref>William Woys Weaver, 'Poland in the Middle Ages' in Maria Dembinska (ed.)

[[Ambelopoulia]], which is today highly controversial, and illegal, was exported in vast quantities from Cyprus during the Lusignan and Venetian periods, particularly to Italy and France.

The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.\n\nSince 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognised only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.\n[[File:Nicos Anastasiades at EPP HQ.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Nicos Anastasiades]], President of Cyprus since 2013.]]\nThe House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964.

Lefkara lace is recognised as an [[Intangible cultural heritage|intangible cultural heritage (ICH)]] by Unesco, and it is characterised by distinct design patterns, and its intricate, time-consuming production process. A genuine Lefkara lace with full embroidery can take typically hundreds of hours to be made, and that is why it is usually priced quite high. Another local form of art the originated from Lefkara is the production of Cypriot Filigree (locally known as ''Trifourenio''), a type of jewellery that is made with twisted threads of silver. In Lefkara village there is government funded center named Lefkara Handicraft Center the mission of which is to educate and teach the art of making the embroidery and silver jewellery. There's also the Museum of Traditional Embroidery an Silversmithing located in the village which has large collection of local handmade art.\n\nIn modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883\u20131958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.<ref>Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.</ref> Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900\u20131994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924\u20131968) who also studied in London, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]].<ref>Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)</ref> In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day.

In addition on the Greek side of the island there are the private channels ANT1 Cyprus, Plus TV, Mega Channel, Sigma TV, Nimonia TV (NTV) and New Extra. In Northern Cyprus, the local channels are [[Bayrak|BRT]], the Turkish Cypriot equivalent to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, and a number of private channels. The majority of local arts and cultural programming is produced by the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation and BRT, with local arts documentaries, review programmes and filmed drama series.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of Cyprus}}\nThe most worldwide known Cypriot director, to have worked abroad, is [[Michael Cacoyannis]].\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, George Filis produced and directed ''Gregoris Afxentiou'', ''Etsi Prodothike i Kypros'', and ''The Mega Document''. In 1994, Cypriot film production received a boost with the establishment of the Cinema Advisory Committee. In 2000, the annual amount set aside for filmmaking in the national budget was [[Cypriot pound|CYP\u00a3]]500,000 (about \u20ac850,000). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Eurimages]] Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature films on which a Cypriot was an executive producer have received funding from Eurimages. The first was ''I Sphagi tou Kokora'' (1996), followed by ''Hellados'' (unreleased), ''To Tama'' (1999), and ''O Dromos gia tin Ithaki'' (2000).<ref>\"[http://www.filmbirth.com/cyprus.html Film Birth \u2013 History of Cinema \u2013 Cyprus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012748/http://www.filmbirth.com/cyprus.html |date=24 September 2015 }}\".</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Greek filmmaker [[Vassilis Mazomenos]] shot the drama film [[Guilt (movie)|''Guilt'']] in Cyprus. The film was awarded the Best Screenwriting and Best Photography award at the [[London Greek Film Festival]], and was an official selection in the [[Montreal World Film Festival]], [[Cairo International Film Festival]], [[India International Film Festival]], [[Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival]], and [[Fantasporto]]. It was also the opening film in the Panorama of European Cinema in [[Athens]]. In 2010, the film was nominated for the best film from the [[Hellenic Film Academy]].\n\nOnly a small number of foreign films have been made in Cyprus. This includes ''[[Incense for the Damned]]'' (1970), [[The Beloved (1970 film)|''The Beloved'']] (1970), and ''[[Ghost in the Noonday Sun]]'' (1973).<ref>Roger Lewis, ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'' (London: Arrow, 1995) p.130</ref> Parts of the [[John Wayne]] film ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962) were also filmed in Cyprus.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Cypriot cuisine}}\n[[File:Vin et gastronomie chypriotes.jpg|thumb|left|Cypriot ''meze'']]\n\nDuring the medieval period, under the French Lusignan monarchs of Cyprus an elaborate form of courtly cuisine developed, fusing French, Byzantine and Middle Eastern forms. The Lusignan kings were known for importing Syrian cooks to Cyprus, and it has been suggested that one of the key routes for the importation of Middle Eastern recipes into France and other Western European countries, such as blancmange, was via the Lusignan Kingdom of Cyprus. These recipes became known in the West as ''Vyands de Chypre,'' or Foods of Cyprus, and the food historian William Woys Weaver has identified over one hundred of them in English, French, Italian and German recipe books of the Middle Ages. One that became particularly popular across Europe in the medieval and early modern periods was a stew made with chicken or fish called ''malmonia,'' which in English became mawmeny.<ref>William Woys Weaver, 'Poland in the Middle Ages' in Maria Dembinska (ed.) ''Food and Drink in Medieval Poland: Rediscovering a Cuisine of the Past''(Philadelphia: University of University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999) pp.41\u201346</ref>\n\nAnother example of a Cypriot food ingredient entering the Western European canon is the cauliflower, still popular and used in a variety of ways on the island today, which was associated with Cyprus from the early Middle Ages. Writing in the 12th and 13th centuries the Arab botanists [[Ibn al-'Awwam]] and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] claimed the vegetable had its origins were Cyprus,<ref name=AggieHorticulture>{{cite web|title=Cabbage Flowers for Food|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/broccoli.html|website=Aggie Horticulture|publisher=Texas AgriLife Extension Service, Texas A&M System|accessdate=12 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812232947/http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu//archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/broccoli.html|archive-date=12 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fenwick|first=G.

[[Ambelopoulia]], which is today highly controversial, and illegal, was exported in vast quantities from Cyprus during the Lusignan and Venetian periods, particularly to Italy and France. In 1533 the English traveller to Cyprus, John Locke, claimed to have seen the pickled wild birds packed into large jars, or which 1200 jars were exported from Cyprus annually.<ref>David Bannerman and Mary Bannerman ''Birds of Cyprus'' (London: Oliver and Boyd, 1958) p.384</ref>\n\nAlso familiar to the Lusignans would have been [[Halloumi]] cheese, which some food writers today claim originated in Cyprus during the Byzantine period<ref>{{cite book |author1=Goldstein, Darra |author2=Merkle, Kathrin |author3=Parasecoli, Fabio |author4=Mennell, Stephen |author5=Council of Europe |title=Culinary cultures of Europe: identity, diversity and dialogue |publisher=Council of Europe |year=2005 |page=121 |isbn=978-92-871-5744-7 |quote=Most culinary innovations in the Cypriot cuisine occurred during the Byzantine era&nbsp;...

Cucumber and tomato are used widely in salads. Common vegetable preparations include potatoes in olive oil and parsley, pickled cauliflower and beets, asparagus and [[taro]]. Other traditional delicacies are meat marinated in dried coriander seeds and wine, and eventually dried and smoked, such as ''lountza'' (smoked [[pork loin]]), charcoal-grilled lamb, [[souvlaki]] (pork and chicken cooked over charcoal), and [[sheftalia]] (minced meat wrapped in [[mesentery]]). ''Pourgouri'' ([[bulgur]], cracked wheat) is the traditional source of carbohydrate other than bread, and is used to make the delicacy [[Kibbeh|koubes]].\n\nFresh vegetables and fruits are common ingredients. Frequently used vegetables include courgettes, green peppers, [[okra]], green beans, artichokes, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and grape leaves, and pulses such as beans, broad beans, peas, black-eyed beans, chick-peas and lentils. The most common fruits and nuts are pears, apples, grapes, oranges, [[mandarin orange|mandarines]], nectarines, [[medlar]], blackberries, cherry, strawberries, figs, watermelon, melon, avocado, lemon, pistachio, almond, chestnut, walnut, and hazelnut.\n\nCyprus is also well known for its desserts, including ''lokum'' (also known as [[Turkish Delight]]) and [[Soutzoukos]].<ref name=giant>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3753928.stm Cyprus villagers make giant sweet]\", ''BBC News'', 18 October 2004</ref> This island has [[Protected geographical indications in the European Union#General regime|protected geographical indication (PGI)]] for its ''lokum'' produced in the village of [[Geroskipou]].<ref name=PGI>{{cite news | title=Turks riled as Cyprus set to win EU trademark on Turkish Delight | date=13 December 2007 | agency=Associated Press | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/13/europe/EU-GEN-Cyprus-Turkish-Delight.php | work =International Herald Tribune | accessdate =14 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202125809/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/13/europe/EU-GEN-Cyprus-Turkish-Delight.php |archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/07/04/agros-rose-preserve-included-protected-geographical-indication-list/|title=Agros rose preserve included in protected geographical indication list|last=Andreou|first=Evie|date=4 July 2016|work=Cyprus Mail|access-date=19 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120070241/http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/07/04/agros-rose-preserve-included-protected-geographical-indication-list/|archive-date=20 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center 11.JPG|thumb|[[Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center]] in [[Limassol]]]]\nSport governing bodies include the [[Cyprus Football Association]], [[Cyprus Basketball Federation]], [[Cyprus Volleyball Federation]], [[Cyprus Automobile Association]], Cyprus Badminton Federation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyprusbadminton.com |title=Cyprus Badminton Federation |publisher=Cyprusbadminton.com |accessdate=27 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403054924/http://www.cyprusbadminton.com/ |archivedate=3 April 2009}}</ref> [[Cyprus Cricket Association]], [[Cyprus Rugby Federation]] and the Cyprus Pool Association.\n\nNotable sports teams in the Cyprus leagues include [[APOEL FC]], [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]], [[AC Omonia]], [[AEL Lemesos]], [[Apollon Limassol|Apollon FC]], [[Nea Salamis Famagusta FC]], [[AEK Larnaca FC]], [[AEL Limassol B.C.]], [[Keravnos B.C.]] and [[Apollon Limassol B.C.]].

It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nCroatia has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into [[Duchy of Croatia|two duchies]] by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Stuart Foster and Keith Crawford, \u2018Introduction: The Critical Importance of History Textbook Research\u2019, in: What Shall We Tell the Children? : International Perspectives on School History Textbooks, eds.

In response,  a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] developed. This led to the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]], which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nA [[sovereign state]], Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\nCroatia is classified by the World Bank as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] country and ranked 46th on the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2019 |publisher=UNDP|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The [[Croatia's economy|economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]], [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture. [[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] is a significant source of revenue, with Croatia ranked among the top 20 most popular tourist destinations in the world.

It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nCroatia has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into [[Duchy of Croatia|two duchies]] by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Stuart Foster and Keith Crawford, \u2018Introduction: The Critical Importance of History Textbook Research\u2019, in: What Shall We Tell the Children? : International Perspectives on School History Textbooks, eds.

In response,  a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] developed. This led to the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]], which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nA [[sovereign state]], Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\nCroatia is classified by the World Bank as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] country and ranked 46th on the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2019 |publisher=UNDP|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The [[Croatia's economy|economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]], [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture.

The age requirement is 17\u201327 as of 2011, though the upper age was previously up to 25. While there has been other Miss Hong Kong pageants in prior years producing notable titleholders such as Judy Dann (1951), Virginia June Lee (1954), Michelle Mok (1958), Laura da Costa (1967) and Mabel Hawkett (1970), the current annual TVB pageant began in 1973. Apart from the top prize winner, first runner-up and second runner-up prizes, the pageant also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Many Miss Hong Kong contestants have gone on to have movie careers as it is quite typical for the top contestants to garner television contracts from TVB.\n*Overseas Recruitment: Applications are available in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, any TVB rental store in the US, Fairchild TV station, Ontario, Richmond, British Columbia, and any TVB rental store in Canada. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. TVB, organizers of the pageant travel to cities in the US and Canada. They include: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. TVB would choose a certain amount of delegates to interview and would call them to interview. Besides personal interviews, delegates have to wear swimsuits chosen by themselves and walk around in it. Delegates are chosen and return to Hong Kong in late May to compete.\n* Local Recruitment: Hong Kong. Applications are available in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, and Europe. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. Weeks later, primary and secondary interviews are conducted. Top interviewed finalists are chosen and they record a reality TV show (like 2006) to choose the deserving semifinalists to compete. They joined the overseas delegates to form the top event finalists.\n\nThe pageant is traditionally televised into two events, although this is not always necessarily the case in recent years. First, a preliminary event is held where 12 finalists are selected from a group of candidates, the number of which is usually around 20\u201325 (with 30 being the maximum). Then a final event is held, culminating in the announcement of the winner and the first and second runners-up from the 12 finalists. In some years, the field is narrowed down to a final 5, from which the runners-up and winner are chosen. Often several contestants dropped out of the pageant before the televised preliminary, thus there would be a candidate with #30 assigned to her, but only 25 or so contestants.\n\n== Summary of winners

They include [[Toronto]], Vancouver, New York, Los Angeles, [[Seattle]], and San Francisco. Local contestants coming from [[Malaysia]], Australia, [[New Zealand]], London, and more enter at Hong Kong. In 2006, there was a top 16 contestant from the [[Netherlands]]. The overseas delegates wait for the notification of their regional sponsors of TVB and if they are chosen, they fly to Hong Kong to compete.

The age requirement is 17\u201327 as of 2011, though the upper age was previously up to 25. While there has been other Miss Hong Kong pageants in prior years producing notable titleholders such as Judy Dann (1951), Virginia June Lee (1954), Michelle Mok (1958), Laura da Costa (1967) and Mabel Hawkett (1970), the current annual TVB pageant began in 1973. Apart from the top prize winner, first runner-up and second runner-up prizes, the pageant also has other consolation prizes that vary slightly from year to year. Many Miss Hong Kong contestants have gone on to have movie careers as it is quite typical for the top contestants to garner television contracts from TVB.\n*Overseas Recruitment: Applications are available in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, any TVB rental store in the US, Fairchild TV station, Ontario, Richmond, British Columbia, and any TVB rental store in Canada. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. TVB, organizers of the pageant travel to cities in the US and Canada. They include: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver. TVB would choose a certain amount of delegates to interview and would call them to interview. Besides personal interviews, delegates have to wear swimsuits chosen by themselves and walk around in it. Delegates are chosen and return to Hong Kong in late May to compete.\n* Local Recruitment: Hong Kong. Applications are available in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, and Europe. Delegates have to send in their applications before the deadline. Weeks later, primary and secondary interviews are conducted. Top interviewed finalists are chosen and they record a reality TV show (like 2006) to choose the deserving semifinalists to compete. They joined the overseas delegates to form the top event finalists.\n\nThe pageant is traditionally televised into two events, although this is not always necessarily the case in recent years. First, a preliminary event is held where 12 finalists are selected from a group of candidates, the number of which is usually around 20\u201325 (with 30 being the maximum). Then a final event is held, culminating in the announcement of the winner and the first and second runners-up from the 12 finalists. In some years, the field is narrowed down to a final 5, from which the runners-up and winner are chosen. Often several contestants dropped out of the pageant before the televised preliminary, thus there would be a candidate with #30 assigned to her, but only 25 or so contestants.\n\n== Summary of winners

They include [[Toronto]], Vancouver, New York, Los Angeles, [[Seattle]], and San Francisco. Local contestants coming from [[Malaysia]], Australia, [[New Zealand]], London, and more enter at Hong Kong. In 2006, there was a top 16 contestant from the [[Netherlands]]. The overseas delegates wait for the notification of their regional sponsors of TVB and if they are chosen, they fly to Hong Kong to compete.

Even though the 2007 pageant had the top 3 all from the US and Canada but Grace Wong and Lorretta Chow travelled to Hong Kong to compete in the pageant, so they are recognised by TVB to be local delegates not overseas delegates.

In 1895, at Bristol, he married Alice Maud Denning and they had two sons, William (b. 1896) and Gerald (b. 1900)<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~publicbenefit/biogeh.html ''The Public Benefit Boot Company'']</ref> Gange went into trade and is usually described as a merchant.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP, 2007</ref> He also had interests in property and was Director of Lennards, a Bristol property company.<ref>The Times, 1 November 1920 p19</ref>\n\n==Political and public life==\nGange was drawn into politics, his [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] religion and his commercial interests attracting him to the Liberal Party. He was a co-opted member of Bristol Town Council and was he Chairman of Bristol North Liberal Association during the time [[Augustine Birrell]] (also a Baptist) was [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for the constituency.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1919''; Politico\u2019s Publishing, 2004 p27</ref> He involved himself in the public life of Bristol, serving as a [[Justice of the Peace]] and in 1931\u201332, he was [[High Sheriff of Bristol|Sheriff of Bristol]].<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP, 2007</ref>\n\nAfter a long Parliamentary and ministerial career, but one which ended in comparative failure with his resignation as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] in the aftermath of the [[Easter Rising]], Augustine Birrell decided not to contest the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. Bristol Liberals selected Gange as his successor and he fought [[Bristol North (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol North]] as a [[Coalition government 1916-1922|Coalition Liberal]]. He was not opposed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionists]] and he was presumably awarded the [[Coalition coupon]]. In a three cornered fight with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[National Party (UK, 1917)|National Party]] candidates he won over 60% of the vote, with a majority of 6,393 over Labour.
