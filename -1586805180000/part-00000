She became a teacher, and was widowed when her husband Bedford Russell was killed in World War II. She remarried in 1946, with one son; her 1950 marriage to Art Wilkin, Jr. was her third.\n\nHer father, a baker, had been a fiddle player. From 1955 she toured with [[Red Foley]], and in 1956 her songs were recorded by [[Mitchell Torok]] and [[Wanda Jackson]]. In 1958, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and had major hits, written with [[John D. Loudermilk]], for [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] (the number one country hit \"[[Waterloo (Stonewall Jackson song)|Waterloo]]\", which made the pop top ten) and [[Jimmy C. Newman]].\n\nWilkin also wrote \"[[The Long Black Veil]]\" for [[Lefty Frizzell]] (with [[Danny Dill]]), \"[[Cut Across Shorty]]\" for [[Eddie Cochran]] (with Wayne P. Walker), and \"[[I Just Don't Understand]]\" which became a pop hit for  [[Ann-Margret]] and was covered by [[The Beatles]]. Although she was primarily a country songwriter, her songs have been recorded by several pop and rock acts, including [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Mick Jagger]]. Wilkin also recorded occasionally for [[Columbia Records]] and [[Dot Records]] in the 1960s and at times worked as a background vocalist.  he is billed simply as Marijohn on a few of her recordings. On DOT records, she recorded under the name Romi Spain.\n\nMarijohn Wilkin may be most famous for \"[[One Day at a Time (song)|One Day at a Time]]\", often considered the biggest gospel song of the 1970s. Wilkin wrote the song in 1973 with some assistance by her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Kris Kristofferson]]. The song won a [[Dove Award]] from the [[Gospel Music Association]] in 1975 (see also: [[Dove Award for Song of the Year]]). The song was a top 20 country single for [[Marilyn Sellars]] in 1974 and hit No. 37 on [[Billboard's Hot 100]] pop chart. It also launched a career as a gospel recording artist for Wilkin, who released several albums on [[Word Records]].  A remake became a No. 1 country hit for [[Cristy Lane]] in 1980 and has since been recorded more than 200 times.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=95996&messages=3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522071224/http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=95996&messages=3 |archive-date=2011-05-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Even though written as a personal worship song, it has also been recognized as \"One of the Top 50 Southern Gospel Songs.\" <ref name=CBN>{{cite book|last1=Terry|first1=Lindsay|title=Stories Behind 50 Southern Gospel Favorites|date=2005|publisher=Kregel Publications|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=9780825438851|pages=63\u201367|edition=First|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/devotions/terry_one_day.aspx|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Johnny Duncan (country singer)|Johnny Duncan]] and [[Ed Bruce]] were among the many songwriters she helped get a foothold in the music business.

''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W.

Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />.  \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991).

They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  \n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.''

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />.
