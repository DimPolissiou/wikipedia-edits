His father was a street cop with the Gentilly police station and his mother was a factory receptionist. He learned to read in primary school in the Arcueil public school system and continued his schooling in nearby Bagneux, where he discovered his passion for books and reading.  This passion would clearly define the rest of his professional life.  After a brief stint at the prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV in Paris, he decides to leave school early with the goal of gaining entry into the publishing world by any means necessary.  His only degree is the ''Certificat d\u2019\u00e9tudes primaries''.\n\nYears later, he is pleased to discover that he learned to read with the same schoolteacher, Madame Tap, as French writer [[Jean Teul\u00e9]] (''The Suicide Shop'') and fashion designer [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]].\n\n=== Career===\n\n==== 1960-1969 : Hachette ====\nA [[self-made man]], he starts to work at the age of 17 in the stock room at [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] for three years.  After completing his military service, he spends two years as a sales representative for Hachette's mass market paperback division, ''[[Le Livre de Poche]]'' and another two for the [[Gallimard]] account.\n\n==== 1969-1978 : Gallimard ====\nIn 1969, he leaves Hachette to become an independent sales representative.  That same year, Editions Gallimard splits from the Hachette Group and offers him a position as a sales executive, which he accepts.\n\nAt age 27, he becomes sales manager and then sales director of the Gallimard Group (Editions Gallimard, [[Deno\u00ebl]], [[Mercure de France]]). There, he oversees the creation of Gallimard's sales force and takes part in the launch of mass market imprint Folio as well as the creation of the Children's division ''[[Gallimard Jeunesse]]'' with Pierre Marchard and Jean-Olivier H\u00e9ron. He leaves the company after seven years, once Gallimard's sales and distribution are autonomous and successful.\n\n==== 1978-1987 : Hachette ====\n\n===== 1978 : Editions N\u00b01 =====\nIn 1978, the [[Hachette Group]], then run by Jacques Marchandise and G\u00e9rard Worms, ask him to restructure Hachette Livres' sales department and to create Editions n\u00b01, the first publishing house in France to combine a traditional publisher (Hachette) with a media group ([[Europe 1]] radio station); he accepts on condition that he be able to create his own publishing house two years later, shared 50/50% with Hachette.\n\nEdition n\u00b01's major successes are ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', ''The World Book of Inventions'' by Val\u00e9rie-Anne Giscard d\u2019Estaing, who would become Fixot's wife, and the works of [[Pierre Bellemare]] and [[Paul-Loup Sulitzer]].\n\n===== 1980 : Editions BFB =====\nIn 1980, alongside Editions n\u00b01, he creates with Hachette as intended ''Editions BFB'', which he shares with his friend Bernard Barrault.  This publishing house, quite literary in nature, publishes authors such as [[Philippe Djian]] and [[Sylvie Caster]] as well as ''Histoires br\u00e8ves'', several collections of previously unpublished short stories written by well-known French authors.\n\n===== 1983 : Hachette Group Mass Market =====\nIn 1983, [[Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re]] purchases the Hachette Group and asks Bernard Fixot to become Branch Director of the mass market division, including the paperback (''Le Livre de Poche'') and children's (''Hachette Jeunesse'') departments, while continuing to run his own two publishing houses.\n\nHe organizes a contest for all the graphic designers in France to modernise ''Le Livre de Poche''\u2019s covers.  The winner is a young drafted soldier.  His design is used to create the \u201cBiblio\u201d collection. At the same time, he revives the \u201cBiblioth\u00e8que Rose\u201d and \u201cBiblioth\u00e8que Verte\u201d children's collections.\n\n===== 1984 : \u201cGreat Writers\u201d =====\nIn 1984, he creates the \u201cGreat Writers\u201d collection, coedited with the Filipacchi Press Group, more particularly with Roger Th\u00e9rond of [[Paris Match]] and radio station [[Europe 1]]. The concept, meant to encourage the general public, including non-readers, to take interest in literature, was a magazine about the life of an author packaged with a novel by that same author and distributed by the press.  There were 100 issues of the magazine-book package, which earned the support and cooperation of the [[Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt]]. More that 10 million copies were sold in just two years.\n\nAt his friend Pierre Barret's (Chairman of Europe 1) request, he also becomes the Managing Director of Publicity and Shows for Europe 1.  He hosts, with [[Michel Drucker]]'s participation, a one-hour weekly show during which he talks about the life of a writer.\nThree years after the success of the \u201cGreat Writer\u2019s\u201d collection, Bernard Fixot creates the \u201cGreat Painters\u201d collection with the same partners.  Sales rise to 5 million copies after a very memorable launch: a contest for which first prize is an original [[Renoir]] painting.\n\n==== 1987 : Editions Fixot ====\nIn 1987, after a disagreement with Jean-Claude Latt\u00e8s, Managing Director of Hachette Livre, Bernard Fixot decides to leave the group to create his own publishing house, Editions Fixot.<ref>[http://www.sne.fr/adherent/les-editeurs.html Les \u00e9diteurs du SNE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529145733/http://www.sne.fr/adherent/les-editeurs.html |date=May 29, 2013 }}</ref> The two months following is the only period in his career that he stops working!\n\nEditions Fixot is a trade publisher with a catalogue of mainly non-fiction.  His team is made up of Antoine Audouard (Managing Director), Anne Gallimard (Editorial Director), Edith Leblond (Financial Director) and Susanna Lea (Foreign Rights Manager).\n\nThe house's first major success is ''[[Not Without My Daughter (book)|Not without My Daughter]]'' by [[Betty Mahmoody]], acquired on the last day of the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] after it had been refused by publishers throughout the world.  It would later become a success in many countries (Germany, Sweden, etc.) and adapted into a movie directed by [[Brian Gilbert (director)|Brian Gilbert]] starring [[Sally Field]] in the role of Betty Mahmoody.  Bernard Fixot sells over 3.5 million copies of the book in France.\n\nEditions Fixot publishes non-fiction narratives, stories of the extraordinary lives of ordinary people, such as:\n* ''The Swan Dive '' by Maud Marin<ref>[http://zagria.blogspot.fr/2010_06_01_archive.html A Gender Variance Who's Who]</ref> (the first autobiography in France of a transsexual)\n* ''Seule tout en haut \u00e0 droite'' by Yann Piat (autobiography of the first female deputy of France's National Front party)\n* ''J\u2019avais 12 ans'' by Nathalie Schweighoffer (the first major French narrative about incest)\nBernard Fixot also seeks out people throughout the world with amazing stories to tell:\n* ''Sold: Story of Modern-day Slavery '' by [[Zana Muhsen]], a young British woman from Birmingham sold into marriage in Yemen by her father.  Bernard Fixot spends 2 days in Yemen with [[Jean-Pierre Foucault]] to try and free her. \n* ''My Feudal Lord '' by [[Tehmina Durrani]] (Pakistan)\n* ''I was Born with Sand in my Eyes'' by [[Mano Dayak]] (autobiography of a Touareg tribal leader)\nHe publishes numerous biographies and autobiographies, notably on: \n* King of Spain [[Juan Carlos]], ''The King'', written by [[Jos\u00e9 Luis de Vilallonga]]\n* ''Passions'' by [[Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber]]\n* ''It Snowed on Mount Vitocha'' by Eddie Vartan.\n\nHe also publishes books by [[Roger Vadim]] ([[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Jane Fonda]]) and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand]], who would become French Minister of Culture.\n\nAlongside these very commercial titles, Bernard Fixot launches a collection of young writers called \u201cNight Blue\u201d featuring debut novelists such as Americans [[Jonathan Franzen]] with ''[[The Twenty-Seventh City]]'' and [[Michael Chabon]] with ''[[The Mysteries of Pittsburgh]]'' and French women Yolaine Destremau (''A l\u2019ombre des jacarandas''), Pascale Gautier (''Moribondes'') or Marie-Ange Guillaume's ''Ils s\u2019en allaient faire des enfants ailleurs''.  He also publishes [[Patrick Besson]]'s plays.\n\nHe continues on the path of the \u201cGreat Writers\u201d collection: making people read who usually don not. In 1992, he creates a \u201cLibrary\u201d collection.  The first three publications are of [[Baudelaire]], [[\u00c9mile Zola|Zola]] and [[Stendhal]], prefaced by prominent French writers of the time.\n\nThe concept of this new collection is to provide non-readers with condensed versions of great French literary works, in the spirit of Reader's Digest but somewhat different. For example, Stendhal's ''[[The Red and the Black]]'' has 45 chapters.  The \u201cLibrary\u201d edition has only 19 and the remaining chapters are summarized, allowing less-avid readers to get excited about the story. Fixot was lambasted by the press for having dared alter such a classic work and the collection was a failure.\n\nYet, five years later, another French publisher, Marabout, successfully developed the same idea.  Times had changed.\n\n===== 1988 : TF1 Editions =====\nIn 1988, he founds a new publishing house, TF1 Editions (the number one French television station), with which he publishes books linked to the eponymous television station: books on health related to the show ''Sant\u00e9 \u00e0 la une'' (the [[Mayo Clinic]]\u2019s ''Family Health Book'' for example), cook books by chef [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]], host of the show \u201cCuisinez comme un grand chef\u201d, novelizations of soap operas, illustrated books about major sporting events, etc.\n\n===== 1990 : Berlitz =====\nIn 1990, he launches a highly-successful foreign language collection with [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz]]: ''Yes, I can'' for English, ''Si yo puedo'' for Spanish and ''Si io posso'' for Italian.\n\n==== 1993-1999 : Editions Robert Laffont ====\nIn 1993, Christian Br\u00e9gou, Chairman of the CEP media group (that would become [[Editis]]), asks him to take over the prestigious publishing house, [[Editions Robert Laffont]]. Robert Laffont, who founded the house in 1941, had been obliged to step down a few years earlier for health reasons and the house had been ailing ever since. Bernard Fixot accepts with great enthusiasm and merges Editions Fixot with Editions Robert Laffont.  He thus becomes chairman of Robert Laffont, Seghers, Julliard and Fixot.  He restructures the house with Antoine Audouard and entrusts Julliard to Bernard Barrault who makes this imprint shine again.\n\nIn six years, the Robert Laffont group reclaims its spot as one of the major French trade publishers.  These years are particularly marked by the resurgence of the historical novel:\n* [[Christian Jacq]] publishes 5 volumes of his ''Ramses'' series and sells over 13 million copies throughout the world (the series is translated in more than 30 languages)\n* [[Max Gallo]] publishes a series on ''Napoleon'' in 4 volumes, which is adapted into a successful TV series in 2002 (a mini-series with 4 100-minute episodes, produced by Jean-Pierre Gu\u00e9rin, directed by [[Yves Simoneau]] and starring [[Christian Clavier]] as [[Napoleon]], [[Isabella Rosselini]] as [[Josephine de Beauharnais]], [[G\u00e9rard D\u00e9pardieu]] as [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]] and [[John Malkovich]] as [[Talleyrand]]).\n\nMany \u201cFixot\u201d style testimonies are also published during this time:\n* ''At Age 17, We are Carefree'' by [[Barbara Samson]] (the first account from a French person with AIDS)\n* ''Zlata\u2019s Diary'' by [[Zlata Filipovic]], a 12-year-old Croatian girl.  Bernard Fixot succeeded in helping her and her parents escape war-torn Sarajevo.

His father was a street cop with the Gentilly police station and his mother was a factory receptionist. He learned to read in primary school in the Arcueil public school system and continued his schooling in nearby Bagneux, where he discovered his passion for books and reading.  This passion would clearly define the rest of his professional life.  After a brief stint at the prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV in Paris, he decides to leave school early with the goal of gaining entry into the publishing world by any means necessary.  His only degree is the ''Certificat d\u2019\u00e9tudes primaries''.\n\nYears later, he is pleased to discover that he learned to read with the same schoolteacher, Madame Tap, as French writer [[Jean Teul\u00e9]] (''The Suicide Shop'') and fashion designer [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]].\n\n=== Career===\n\n==== 1960-1969 : Hachette ====\nA [[self-made man]], he starts to work at the age of 17 in the stock room at [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] for three years.  After completing his military service, he spends two years as a sales representative for Hachette's mass market paperback division, ''[[Le Livre de Poche]]'' and another two for the [[Gallimard]] account.\n\n==== 1969-1978 : Gallimard ====\nIn 1969, he leaves Hachette to become an independent sales representative.  That same year, Editions Gallimard splits from the Hachette Group and offers him a position as a sales executive, which he accepts.\n\nAt age 27, he becomes sales manager and then sales director of the Gallimard Group (Editions Gallimard, [[Deno\u00ebl]], [[Mercure de France]]). There, he oversees the creation of Gallimard's sales force and takes part in the launch of mass market imprint Folio as well as the creation of the Children's division ''[[Gallimard Jeunesse]]'' with Pierre Marchard and Jean-Olivier H\u00e9ron. He leaves the company after seven years, once Gallimard's sales and distribution are autonomous and successful.\n\n==== 1978-1987 : Hachette ====\n\n===== 1978 : Editions N\u00b01 =====\nIn 1978, the [[Hachette Group]], then run by Jacques Marchandise and G\u00e9rard Worms, ask him to restructure Hachette Livres' sales department and to create Editions n\u00b01, the first publishing house in France to combine a traditional publisher (Hachette) with a media group ([[Europe 1]] radio station); he accepts on condition that he be able to create his own publishing house two years later, shared 50/50% with Hachette.\n\nEdition n\u00b01's major successes are ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', ''The World Book of Inventions'' by Val\u00e9rie-Anne Giscard d\u2019Estaing, who would become Fixot's wife, and the works of [[Pierre Bellemare]] and [[Paul-Loup Sulitzer]].\n\n===== 1980 : Editions BFB =====\nIn 1980, alongside Editions n\u00b01, he creates with Hachette as intended ''Editions BFB'', which he shares with his friend Bernard Barrault.  This publishing house, quite literary in nature, publishes authors such as [[Philippe Djian]] and [[Sylvie Caster]] as well as ''Histoires br\u00e8ves'', several collections of previously unpublished short stories written by well-known French authors.\n\n===== 1983 : Hachette Group Mass Market =====\nIn 1983, [[Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re]] purchases the Hachette Group and asks Bernard Fixot to become Branch Director of the mass market division, including the paperback (''Le Livre de Poche'') and children's (''Hachette Jeunesse'') departments, while continuing to run his own two publishing houses.\n\nHe organizes a contest for all the graphic designers in France to modernise ''Le Livre de Poche''\u2019s covers.  The winner is a young drafted soldier.  His design is used to create the \u201cBiblio\u201d collection. At the same time, he revives the \u201cBiblioth\u00e8que Rose\u201d and \u201cBiblioth\u00e8que Verte\u201d children's collections.\n\n===== 1984 : \u201cGreat Writers\u201d =====\nIn 1984, he creates the \u201cGreat Writers\u201d collection, coedited with the Filipacchi Press Group, more particularly with Roger Th\u00e9rond of [[Paris Match]] and radio station [[Europe 1]]. The concept, meant to encourage the general public, including non-readers, to take interest in literature, was a magazine about the life of an author packaged with a novel by that same author and distributed by the press.  There were 100 issues of the magazine-book package, which earned the support and cooperation of the [[Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt]]. More that 10 million copies were sold in just two years.\n\nAt his friend Pierre Barret's (Chairman of Europe 1) request, he also becomes the Managing Director of Publicity and Shows for Europe 1.  He hosts, with [[Michel Drucker]]'s participation, a one-hour weekly show during which he talks about the life of a writer.\nThree years after the success of the \u201cGreat Writer\u2019s\u201d collection, Bernard Fixot creates the \u201cGreat Painters\u201d collection with the same partners.  Sales rise to 5 million copies after a very memorable launch: a contest for which first prize is an original [[Renoir]] painting.\n\n==== 1987 : Editions Fixot ====\nIn 1987, after a disagreement with Jean-Claude Latt\u00e8s, Managing Director of Hachette Livre, Bernard Fixot decides to leave the group to create his own publishing house, Editions Fixot.<ref>[http://www.sne.fr/adherent/les-editeurs.html Les \u00e9diteurs du SNE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529145733/http://www.sne.fr/adherent/les-editeurs.html |date=May 29, 2013 }}</ref> The two months following is the only period in his career that he stops working!\n\nEditions Fixot is a trade publisher with a catalogue of mainly non-fiction.  His team is made up of Antoine Audouard (Managing Director), Anne Gallimard (Editorial Director), Edith Leblond (Financial Director) and Susanna Lea (Foreign Rights Manager).\n\nThe house's first major success is ''[[Not Without My Daughter (book)|Not without My Daughter]]'' by [[Betty Mahmoody]], acquired on the last day of the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] after it had been refused by publishers throughout the world.  It would later become a success in many countries (Germany, Sweden, etc.) and adapted into a movie directed by [[Brian Gilbert (director)|Brian Gilbert]] starring [[Sally Field]] in the role of Betty Mahmoody.  Bernard Fixot sells over 3.5 million copies of the book in France.\n\nEditions Fixot publishes non-fiction narratives, stories of the extraordinary lives of ordinary people, such as:\n* ''The Swan Dive '' by Maud Marin<ref>[http://zagria.blogspot.fr/2010_06_01_archive.html A Gender Variance Who's Who]</ref> (the first autobiography in France of a transsexual)\n* ''Seule tout en haut \u00e0 droite'' by Yann Piat (autobiography of the first female deputy of France's National Front party)\n* ''J\u2019avais 12 ans'' by Nathalie Schweighoffer (the first major French narrative about incest)\nBernard Fixot also seeks out people throughout the world with amazing stories to tell:\n* ''Sold: Story of Modern-day Slavery '' by [[Zana Muhsen]], a young British woman from Birmingham sold into marriage in Yemen by her father.  Bernard Fixot spends 2 days in Yemen with [[Jean-Pierre Foucault]] to try and free her. \n* ''My Feudal Lord '' by [[Tehmina Durrani]] (Pakistan)\n* ''I was Born with Sand in my Eyes'' by [[Mano Dayak]] (autobiography of a Touareg tribal leader)\nHe publishes numerous biographies and autobiographies, notably on: \n* King of Spain [[Juan Carlos]], ''The King'', written by [[Jos\u00e9 Luis de Vilallonga]]\n* ''Passions'' by [[Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber]]\n* ''It Snowed on Mount Vitocha'' by Eddie Vartan.\n\nHe also publishes books by [[Roger Vadim]] ([[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Jane Fonda]]) and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand]], who would become French Minister of Culture.\n\nAlongside these very commercial titles, Bernard Fixot launches a collection of young writers called \u201cNight Blue\u201d featuring debut novelists such as Americans [[Jonathan Franzen]] with ''[[The Twenty-Seventh City]]'' and [[Michael Chabon]] with ''[[The Mysteries of Pittsburgh]]'' and French women Yolaine Destremau (''A l\u2019ombre des jacarandas''), Pascale Gautier (''Moribondes'') or Marie-Ange Guillaume's ''Ils s\u2019en allaient faire des enfants ailleurs''.  He also publishes [[Patrick Besson]]'s plays.\n\nHe continues on the path of the \u201cGreat Writers\u201d collection: making people read who usually don not. In 1992, he creates a \u201cLibrary\u201d collection.  The first three publications are of [[Baudelaire]], [[\u00c9mile Zola|Zola]] and [[Stendhal]], prefaced by prominent French writers of the time.\n\nThe concept of this new collection is to provide non-readers with condensed versions of great French literary works, in the spirit of Reader's Digest but somewhat different. For example, Stendhal's ''[[The Red and the Black]]'' has 45 chapters.  The \u201cLibrary\u201d edition has only 19 and the remaining chapters are summarized, allowing less-avid readers to get excited about the story. Fixot was lambasted by the press for having dared alter such a classic work and the collection was a failure.\n\nYet, five years later, another French publisher, Marabout, successfully developed the same idea.  Times had changed.\n\n===== 1988 : TF1 Editions =====\nIn 1988, he founds a new publishing house, TF1 Editions (the number one French television station), with which he publishes books linked to the eponymous television station: books on health related to the show ''Sant\u00e9 \u00e0 la une'' (the [[Mayo Clinic]]\u2019s ''Family Health Book'' for example), cook books by chef [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]], host of the show \u201cCuisinez comme un grand chef\u201d, novelizations of soap operas, illustrated books about major sporting events, etc.\n\n===== 1990 : Berlitz =====\nIn 1990, he launches a highly-successful foreign language collection with [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz]]: ''Yes, I can'' for English, ''Si yo puedo'' for Spanish and ''Si io posso'' for Italian.\n\n==== 1993-1999 : Editions Robert Laffont ====\nIn 1993, Christian Br\u00e9gou, Chairman of the CEP media group (that would become [[Editis]]), asks him to take over the prestigious publishing house, [[Editions Robert Laffont]]. Robert Laffont, who founded the house in 1941, had been obliged to step down a few years earlier for health reasons and the house had been ailing ever since. Bernard Fixot accepts with great enthusiasm and merges Editions Fixot with Editions Robert Laffont.  He thus becomes chairman of Robert Laffont, Seghers, Julliard and Fixot.  He restructures the house with Antoine Audouard and entrusts Julliard to Bernard Barrault who makes this imprint shine again.\n\nIn six years, the Robert Laffont group reclaims its spot as one of the major French trade publishers.  These years are particularly marked by the resurgence of the historical novel:\n* [[Christian Jacq]] publishes 5 volumes of his ''Ramses'' series and sells over 13 million copies throughout the world (the series is translated in more than 30 languages)\n* [[Max Gallo]] publishes a series on ''Napoleon'' in 4 volumes, which is adapted into a successful TV series in 2002 (a mini-series with 4 100-minute episodes, produced by Jean-Pierre Gu\u00e9rin, directed by [[Yves Simoneau]] and starring [[Christian Clavier]] as [[Napoleon]], [[Isabella Rosselini]] as [[Josephine de Beauharnais]], [[G\u00e9rard D\u00e9pardieu]] as [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]] and [[John Malkovich]] as [[Talleyrand]]).\n\nMany \u201cFixot\u201d style testimonies are also published during this time:\n* ''At Age 17, We are Carefree'' by [[Barbara Samson]] (the first account from a French person with AIDS)\n* ''Zlata\u2019s Diary'' by [[Zlata Filipovic]], a 12-year-old Croatian girl.  Bernard Fixot succeeded in helping her and her parents escape war-torn Sarajevo.  Her account was translated into 32 languages, was a No. 1 best-seller in the United States and movie rights were licensed to [[Universal Studios|Universal]].\n* Noa Rabin's account following the assassination of her grandfather, [[Yitzhak Rabin]]<ref>[http://www.bookmarket.com/1001edit.htm The First Step in Book Marketing]</ref>\n* ''The Bandit Queen of India'' by [[Phoolan Devi]]\n* Former US schoolteacher Marie Letourneau's account of the relationship with 13-year-old Vili Fualaau that put her in jail<ref>[http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Mary-Kay-Letourneau-147743 \"Mary Letourneau, la prisonni\u00e8re de l'amour\"], ''Paris Match''</ref>\n\n...as well as biographies and autobiographies on [[Jimmy Goldsmith]] and [[Olivier de Kersauson]] and some impressive new fiction bestsellers such as [[Nicholas Sparks]], [[Douglas Preston]] & [[Lincoln Child]], [[Kathy Reichs]] and [[Daniel Silva (novelist)|Daniel Silva]].

The first group of interfaces combined various user input modes beyond the traditional [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] [[input/output]], such as speech, pen, touch, manual gestures,<ref>Kettebekov, Sanshzar, and Rajeev Sharma (2001). \"[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-45348-2_20.pdf Toward Natural Gesture/Speech Control of a Large Display].\" ProceedingsEHCI '01 Proceedings of the 8th IFIP International Conference on Engineering for Human-Computer Interaction Pages 221-234</ref> gaze and head and body movements.<ref>Marius Vassiliou, V.

Cockpit Displays VII: Displays for Defense Applications (Proc. SPIE . 4022), 106-115. {{ISBN|0-8194-3648-8}}</ref> The most common such interface combines a visual modality (e.g. a display, keyboard, and mouse) with a voice modality ([[speech recognition]] for input, [[speech synthesis]] and recorded audio for output). However other modalities, such as pen-based input or [[Haptic technology|haptic]] input/output may be used. Multimodal user interfaces are a research area in [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI).\n\nThe advantage of multiple input [[Modality (human-computer interaction)|modalities]] is increased [[usability]]: the weaknesses of one modality are offset by the strengths of another. On a mobile device with a small visual interface and keypad, a word may be quite difficult to type but very easy to say (e.g. [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]]).  Consider how you would access and search through [[digital media]] catalogs from these same devices or set top boxes. And in one real-world example, patient information in an operating room environment is accessed verbally by members of the surgical team to maintain an antiseptic environment, and presented in near realtime aurally and visually to maximize comprehension.\n\nMultimodal input user interfaces have implications for [[accessibility]].<ref>{{cite conference |first1=H.S. |last1=Vitense |first2=J.A. |last2=Jacko |first3=V.K. |last3=Emery |title=Multimodal feedback: establishing a performance baseline for improved access by individuals with visual impairments |booktitle=ACM Conf. on Assistive Technologies |year=2002}}</ref> A well-designed multimodal application can be used by people with a wide variety of impairments. Visually impaired users rely on the voice modality with some keypad input.  Hearing-impaired users rely on the visual modality with some speech input. Other users will be \"situationally impaired\" (e.g. wearing gloves in a very noisy environment, driving, or needing to enter a credit card number in a public place) and will simply use the appropriate modalities as desired. On the other hand, a multimodal application that requires users to be able to operate all modalities is very poorly designed.\n\nThe most common form of input multimodality in the market makes use of the [[XHTML+Voice]] (aka X+V) Web markup language, an open [[specification]] developed by [[IBM]], [[Motorola]], and [[Opera Software]]. [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] is currently under consideration by the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] and combines several [[W3C Recommendation]]s including [[Extensible HyperText Markup Language|XHTML]] for visual markup, [[VoiceXML]] for voice markup, and [[XML Events]], a standard for integrating [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] languages.  [[Multimodal browser]]s supporting [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] include IBM WebSphere Everyplace Multimodal Environment, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] for [[embedded system|Embedded]] [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[ACCESS Systems]] [[NetFront]] for [[Windows Mobile]]. To develop multimodal applications, [[software developer]]s may use a [[software development kit]], such as IBM WebSphere Multimodal Toolkit, based on the [[open source]] [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] [[Software framework|framework]], which includes an [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] [[debugger]], [[source code editor|editor]], and [[simulator]].\n\n== Multimodal output ==\nThe second group of multimodal systems presents users with multimedia displays and multimodal output, primarily in the form of visual and auditory cues. Interface designers have also started to make use of other modalities, such as touch and olfaction. Proposed benefits of multimodal output system include synergy and redundancy. The information that is presented via several modalities is merged and refers to various aspects of the same process. The use of several modalities for processing exactly the same information provides an increased bandwidth of information transfer \n.<ref>{{Citation |first=S. |last=Oviatt |contribution=Multimodal interfaces |editor1-first=J. |editor1-last=Jacko |editor2-first=A |editor2-last=Sears |title=The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook |year=2002 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |url=https://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2004-2005/Oviatt/Multimodel%20Interfaces.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first1=C. |last1=Bauckhage |first2=J. |last2=Fritsch |first3=K.J. |last3=Rohlfing |first4=S. |last4=Wachsmuth |first5=G. |last5=Sagerer |title=Evaluating integrated speech-and image understanding |booktitle=Int.

The auditory channel differs from vision in several aspects. It is omnidirectional, transient and is always reserved.<ref name=sarter/> Speech output, one form of auditory information, received considerable attention. Several guidelines have been developed for the use of speech. Michaelis and Wiggins (1982) suggested that speech output should be used for simple short messages that will not be referred to later. It was also recommended that speech should be generated in time and require an immediate response.\n\nThe sense of touch was first utilized as a medium for communication in the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.A |last=Geldar |title=Adventures in tactile literacy |journal=American Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013124 |year=1957 |doi=10.1037/h0040416}}</ref> It is not only a promising but also a unique communication channel. In contrast to vision and hearing, the two traditional senses employed in HCI, the sense of touch is proximal: it senses objects that are in contact with the body, and it is bidirectional in that it supports both perception and acting on the environment.\n\nExamples of auditory feedback include auditory icons in computer operating systems indicating users' actions (e.g. deleting a file, open a folder, error), speech output for presenting navigational guidance in vehicles, and speech output for warning pilots on modern airplane cockpits. Examples of tactile signals include vibrations of the turn-signal lever to warn drivers of a car in their blind spot, the vibration of auto seat as a warning to drivers, and the [[stick shaker]] on modern aircraft alerting pilots to an impending stall.<ref name=sarter/>\n\nInvisible interface spaces became available using sensor technology.

Cockpit Displays VII: Displays for Defense Applications (Proc. SPIE . 4022), 106-115. {{ISBN|0-8194-3648-8}}</ref> The most common such interface combines a visual modality (e.g. a display, keyboard, and mouse) with a voice [[Modality (human-computer interaction)|modality]] ([[speech recognition]] for input, [[speech synthesis]] and recorded audio for output). However other modalities, such as pen-based input or [[Haptic technology|haptic]] input/output may be used. Multimodal user interfaces are a research area in [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI).\n\nThe advantage of multiple input [[Modality (human-computer interaction)|modalities]] is increased [[usability]]: the weaknesses of one modality are offset by the strengths of another. On a mobile device with a small visual interface and keypad, a word may be quite difficult to type but very easy to say (e.g. [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]]).  Consider how you would access and search through [[digital media]] catalogs from these same devices or set top boxes. And in one real-world example, patient information in an operating room environment is accessed verbally by members of the surgical team to maintain an antiseptic environment, and presented in near realtime aurally and visually to maximize comprehension.\n\nMultimodal input user interfaces have implications for [[accessibility]].<ref>{{cite conference |first1=H.S. |last1=Vitense |first2=J.A. |last2=Jacko |first3=V.K. |last3=Emery |title=Multimodal feedback: establishing a performance baseline for improved access by individuals with visual impairments |booktitle=ACM Conf. on Assistive Technologies |year=2002}}</ref> A well-designed multimodal application can be used by people with a wide variety of impairments. Visually impaired users rely on the voice modality with some keypad input.  Hearing-impaired users rely on the visual modality with some speech input. Other users will be \"situationally impaired\" (e.g. wearing gloves in a very noisy environment, driving, or needing to enter a credit card number in a public place) and will simply use the appropriate modalities as desired. On the other hand, a multimodal application that requires users to be able to operate all modalities is very poorly designed.\n\nThe most common form of input multimodality in the market makes use of the [[XHTML+Voice]] (aka X+V) Web markup language, an open [[specification]] developed by [[IBM]], [[Motorola]], and [[Opera Software]]. [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] is currently under consideration by the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] and combines several [[W3C Recommendation]]s including [[Extensible HyperText Markup Language|XHTML]] for visual markup, [[VoiceXML]] for voice markup, and [[XML Events]], a standard for integrating [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] languages.  [[Multimodal browser]]s supporting [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] include IBM WebSphere Everyplace Multimodal Environment, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] for [[embedded system|Embedded]] [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[ACCESS Systems]] [[NetFront]] for [[Windows Mobile]]. To develop multimodal applications, [[software developer]]s may use a [[software development kit]], such as IBM WebSphere Multimodal Toolkit, based on the [[open source]] [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] [[Software framework|framework]], which includes an [[XHTML+Voice|X+V]] [[debugger]], [[source code editor|editor]], and [[simulator]].\n\n== Multimodal output ==\nThe second group of multimodal systems presents users with multimedia displays and multimodal output, primarily in the form of visual and auditory cues. Interface designers have also started to make use of other modalities, such as touch and olfaction. Proposed benefits of multimodal output system include synergy and redundancy. The information that is presented via several modalities is merged and refers to various aspects of the same process. The use of several modalities for processing exactly the same information provides an increased bandwidth of information transfer \n.<ref>{{Citation |first=S. |last=Oviatt |contribution=Multimodal interfaces |editor1-first=J. |editor1-last=Jacko |editor2-first=A |editor2-last=Sears |title=The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook |year=2002 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |url=https://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2004-2005/Oviatt/Multimodel%20Interfaces.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first1=C. |last1=Bauckhage |first2=J. |last2=Fritsch |first3=K.J. |last3=Rohlfing |first4=S. |last4=Wachsmuth |first5=G. |last5=Sagerer |title=Evaluating integrated speech-and image understanding |booktitle=Int.

The auditory channel differs from vision in several aspects. It is omnidirectional, transient and is always reserved.<ref name=sarter/> Speech output, one form of auditory information, received considerable attention. Several guidelines have been developed for the use of speech. Michaelis and Wiggins (1982) suggested that speech output should be used for simple short messages that will not be referred to later. It was also recommended that speech should be generated in time and require an immediate response.\n\nThe sense of touch was first utilized as a medium for communication in the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.A |last=Geldar |title=Adventures in tactile literacy |journal=American Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013124 |year=1957 |doi=10.1037/h0040416}}</ref> It is not only a promising but also a unique communication channel. In contrast to vision and hearing, the two traditional senses employed in HCI, the sense of touch is proximal: it senses objects that are in contact with the body, and it is bidirectional in that it supports both perception and acting on the environment.\n\nExamples of auditory feedback include auditory icons in computer operating systems indicating users' actions (e.g. deleting a file, open a folder, error), speech output for presenting navigational guidance in vehicles, and speech output for warning pilots on modern airplane cockpits. Examples of tactile signals include vibrations of the turn-signal lever to warn drivers of a car in their blind spot, the vibration of auto seat as a warning to drivers, and the [[stick shaker]] on modern aircraft alerting pilots to an impending stall.<ref name=sarter/>\n\nInvisible interface spaces became available using sensor technology.

A multimodal ambiguity<ref name=Caschera5 />  arises both, if an element, which is provided by one modality, has more than one interpretation (i.e. ambiguities are propagated at the multimodal level), and/or if elements, connected with each modality, are univocally interpreted, but information referred to different modalities are incoherent at the syntactic or the semantic level (i.e. a multimodal sentence having different meanings or different  syntactic structure).\n\nIn \"The Management of Ambiguities\",<ref name=\"Caschera3\" /> the methods for solving ambiguities and for providing the correct interpretation of the user's input are organized in three main classes: prevention, a-posterior resolution and approximation resolution methods.<ref name=\"Caschera2\" /><ref name=\"Chai\" />\n\nPrevention methods impose users to follow predefined interaction behaviour according to a set of transitions between different allowed states of the interaction process. Example of prevention methods are: procedural method,<ref>Lee, Y.C.; Chin, F. (1995). \"An Iconic Query Language for Topological Relationship in GIS\".

The Canadiens are the oldest professional hockey franchise in the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kay|2009|p=139}}</ref> Created as a founding member of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) with the aim of appealing to Montreal's [[francophone]] population, the Canadiens played their first game on January 5, 1910, and captured their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1916. The team left the NHA and helped found the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in 1917. They returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 1919, but their series against the [[Seattle Metropolitans]] was canceled without a winner due to the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic that killed defenceman [[Joe Hall]]. The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times: once while part of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), and 23 times as members of the NHL. With 25 NHL titles overall, they are the most successful team in league history.\n\nThe Canadiens' home rink, the [[Montreal Arena]], was destroyed by fire in January 1918. The team moved into the [[Jubilee Arena]], which subsequently burned down in 1919. After spending seven seasons in the [[Mount Royal Arena]], the Canadiens moved into the [[Montreal Forum]] in 1926, sharing it with the rival [[Montreal Maroons]] until 1938. After 72 years in the Forum, they moved to the [[Bell Centre]] in 1996. The club struggled during the [[Great Depression]], nearly relocating to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in 1935 and contemplated suspending operations in 1939. Their fortunes rebounded following World War II as they reached the Stanley Cup finals each year from 1951 to 1960, winning six championships, including a record five consecutive titles from 1956 to 1960.\n\n[[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard]] emerged as the team's star in the 1940s, and during the [[1944\u201345 NHL season|1944\u201345 season]] became the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in a single season. Richard sparked the [[Richard Riot]] in March 1955 when he was suspended for attacking a linesman. The incident highlighted growing tensions between French Quebec and English Canada, and is regarded as one of the first manifestations of Quebec's [[Quiet Revolution]]. In 1959, [[Jacques Plante]] revolutionized the game when he became the first [[goaltender]] to consistently wear a mask during play. Under general manager [[Sam Pollock]], the Canadiens won nine championships between 1964 and 1978. The 1976\u201377 team, often regarded as the greatest in NHL history,<ref name=\"pincus138\" /><ref name=\"Montreal76-77\" /><ref name=\"THN107\" /> won 60 games while losing only 8, a record for fewest losses in an 80-game season. With the entry of the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Quebec Nordiques]] to the NHL in 1979, a rivalry grew between the Canadiens and the Nordiques, peaking in 1984 when the Canadiens eliminated the Nordiques in six games, but not before the [[Good Friday Massacre]] made headlines.\n\nLed by goaltender [[Patrick Roy]], the Canadiens won their 23rd Stanley Cup in 1986 and their 24th in 1993. Roy won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the playoffs' most valuable player both times. The 1993 team set an NHL record with 10 consecutive overtime victories in one playoff year and is the most recent Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup. In 2003, Montreal participated in the first regular season outdoor game in NHL history, defeating the Edmonton Oilers in the [[2003 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]].\n\nThe [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] has inducted over 50 former Canadiens players, as well as ten executives. The team has retired 15 numbers, representing 17 players, and has honoured ten off-ice personnel in its Builder's Row.\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:MontrealCanadiens19121913.jpg|right|thumb|280px|The Montreal Canadiens pose for a team photo, 1912\u201313|alt=A group photograph of ten hockey players wearing horizontally striped jerseys with a maple leaf logo surrounding the letters \"CAC\", along with their coach]]\nIn November 1909, industrialist [[Ambrose O'Brien]] of [[Renfrew, Ontario|Renfrew]], Ontario, was in Montreal to purchase supplies for a railway contract.

At the meeting, the ECHA team owners rejected Renfrew's application.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jenish|2009|p=8}}</ref> Later that day the ECHA's owners chose to disband their league and form the [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909-1910)|Canadian Hockey Association]] (CHA) in a bid to exclude the [[Montreal Wanderers]], who had upset the other owners when they moved into a smaller arena that would reduce the visiting team's share of [[gate receipts]].<ref name=\"McKinley54\">{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=54}}</ref> In the lobby of the hotel, O'Brien met [[Jimmy Gardner (ice hockey)|Jimmy Gardner]], manager of the Wanderers, and discussed forming a new league which would include Renfrew, the Wanderers, and two teams that O'Brien owned in the Ontario mining towns of [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]] and [[Haileybury, Ontario|Haileybury]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Jenish|2009|pp=9\u201310}}</ref> Gardner suggested that O'Brien start a team of [[francophone]] players based in Montreal, forming a rivalry with the Wanderers.<ref name=\"McKinley54\" /> As a result, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was founded on December 2, 1909,<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Brien|1971|p=12}}</ref> and Les Canadiens were created two days later, initially financed by O'Brien with the intent of transferring ownership to francophone sportsmen in Montreal as soon as possible.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Brien|1971|pp=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, francophone teams were not considered to be good enough to play with the top [[English Canadian|anglophone]] teams: the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' warned potential fans of the new team not to get too excited, as \"French-Canadian players of class are not numerous\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=55}}</ref> The Canadiens stocked their team with francophone stars including [[Newsy Lalonde]], [[Georges Poulin]] and [[Didier Pitre]].

They nominally remained members of the NHA and had enough votes to suspend the league's operations, effectively leaving Livingstone in a one-team league.

The season was successful due to a strong performance by goaltender [[Carey Price]], who won the [[Vezina Trophy]], the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and the [[Ted Lindsay Award]], in addition to sharing the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for the fewest goals allowed during the regular season.<ref name=\"CBC-2015-Price-awards\">{{cite web\n |agency=Associated Press \n |title=NHL awards: Carey Price tops big night with Hart trophy \n |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada \n |date=2015-06-24 \n |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-awards-carey-price-tops-big-night-with-hart-trophy-1.3126667 \n |url-status=live \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627150648/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-awards-carey-price-tops-big-night-with-hart-trophy-1.3126667 \n |archivedate=2015-06-27 \n}}</ref>\n\nThe Habs started the [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2015\u201316 season]] with a nine-game winning streak, and posted an 18\u20134\u20133 record in the first two months of the season. However, after winning 19 of their first 26 games, the team struggled offensively and lost many players, including Price, to injuries. The Canadiens ultimately finished sixth in the Atlantic Division and did not qualify for the playoffs for the first time since the 2011\u201312 season. The team participated for the first time in the [[NHL Winter Classic]], defeating the Boston Bruins.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, goaltender [[Al Montoya]] allowed 10 goals in a 10-0 Canadiens road loss to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]]; the Habs later scored 10 goals in a 10\u20131 home win over the Colorado Avalanche on December 10, 2016. While the team started the [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2016\u201317 season]] with a record of 13\u20131\u20131 in their first 15 games, they only went 18\u201318\u20137 in next 41 games but would remain in first place in the Atlantic Division through the first 56 games of the season. As a result, the Habs fired Therrien and replaced him with Claude Julien on February 14, 2017; this was the second time that Julien (who was fired by the Bruins on February 7) replaced Therrien as head coach in the history of the Canadiens franchise.  On March 30, 2017, the Canadiens qualified for the [[2017 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]] after a 6\u20132 home victory against the [[Florida Panthers]]; they would clinch the Atlantic Division title a few days later. Despite winning their second division title in the past three seasons, the Habs would ultimately lose their first round playoff series to the Rangers in six games.\n\n==Retired numbers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:1em; float:right\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Player\n!Date retired\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''1'''|| [[Jacques Plante]]|| October 7, 1995\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''2'''|| [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]]|| October 26, 1985\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''3'''|| [[Emile Bouchard]]|| December 4, 2009\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''4'''|| [[Jean B\u00e9liveau|Jean Beliveau]]|| October 9, 1971\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''5'''|| [[Bernie Geoffrion]]|| March 11, 2006\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''5'''|| [[Guy Lapointe]]|| November 8, 2014\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''7'''|| [[Howie Morenz]]|| November 2, 1937\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''9'''|| [[Maurice Richard]]|| October 6, 1960\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''10'''|| [[Guy Lafleur]]|| February 16, 1985\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''12'''|| [[Dickie Moore (ice hockey)|Dickie Moore]]|| November 12, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''12'''|| [[Yvan Cournoyer]]|| November 12, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''16'''|| [[Henri Richard]]|| December 10, 1975\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''16'''|| [[Elmer Lach]]|| December 4, 2009\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''18'''|| [[Serge Savard]]|| November 18, 2006\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''19'''|| [[Larry Robinson]]|| November 19, 2007\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''23'''|| [[Bob Gainey]]|| February 23, 2008\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''29'''|| [[Ken Dryden]]|| January 29, 2007\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''33'''|| [[Patrick Roy]]|| November 22, 2008\n|}\n\n[[File:Chandails r\u00e9tir\u00e9s CH, Plante, Moore, Harvey, M.Richard, Bouchard, Lach, Morenz.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the Canadiens' retired numbers and Stanley Cup championship banners atop the [[Bell Centre]].]]\nThe Canadiens have [[retired number|retired]] 15 numbers, honouring 18 players.<ref name=\"Canadiens-RetiredNumbers\">{{citation|title=Dashboard \u2013 Players |url=http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/index/retired-jerseys |publisher=Montreal Canadiens Hockey Club |accessdate=2009-09-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015060706/http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/index/retired-jerseys |archivedate=2013-10-15 }}</ref> Howie Morenz's number 7 was the first jersey to be retired, shortly after his death in 1937.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kay|2009|p=27}}</ref> Maurice Richard's number 9 followed in 1960; his 544 career goals are a franchise record.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kay|2009|p=31}}</ref> Henri Richard, brother of Maurice, was honoured in 1975 with the retirement of his number 16, after 21 seasons and 11 Stanley Cups with the Canadiens.

1909\u201310\"]]\nThe [[Montreal Canadiens]] [[ice hockey]] club, formally {{lang|fr|Le Club de Hockey Canadien}}, was founded on December 4, 1909. The Canadiens are the oldest professional hockey franchise in the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kay|2009|p=139}}</ref> Created as a founding member of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) with the aim of appealing to Montreal's [[francophone]] population, the Canadiens played their first game on January 5, 1910, and captured their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1916. The team left the NHA and helped found the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in 1917. They returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 1919, but their series against the [[Seattle Metropolitans]] was canceled without a winner due to the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic that killed defenceman [[Joe Hall]]. The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times: once while part of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), and 23 times as members of the NHL. With 25 NHL titles overall, they are the most successful team in league history.\n\nThe Canadiens' home rink, the [[Montreal Arena]], was destroyed by fire in January 1918. The team moved into the [[Jubilee Arena]], which subsequently burned down in 1919. After spending seven seasons in the [[Mount Royal Arena]], the Canadiens moved into the [[Montreal Forum]] in 1926, sharing it with the rival [[Montreal Maroons]] until 1938. After 72 years in the Forum, they moved to the [[Bell Centre]] in 1996. The club struggled during the [[Great Depression]], nearly relocating to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in 1935 and contemplated suspending operations in 1939. Their fortunes rebounded following World War II as they reached the Stanley Cup finals each year from 1951 to 1960, winning six championships, including a record five consecutive titles from 1956 to 1960.\n\n[[Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard]] emerged as the team's star in the 1940s, and during the [[1944\u201345 NHL season|1944\u201345 season]] became the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in a single season. Richard sparked the [[Richard Riot]] in March 1955 when he was suspended for attacking a linesman. The incident highlighted growing tensions between French Quebec and English Canada, and is regarded as one of the first manifestations of Quebec's [[Quiet Revolution]]. In 1959, [[Jacques Plante]] revolutionized the game when he became the first [[goaltender]] to consistently wear a mask during play. Under general manager [[Sam Pollock]], the Canadiens won nine championships between 1964 and 1978. The 1976\u201377 team, often regarded as the greatest in NHL history,<ref name=\"pincus138\" /><ref name=\"Montreal76-77\" /><ref name=\"THN107\" /> won 60 games while losing only 8, a record for fewest losses in an 80-game season. With the entry of the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Quebec Nordiques]] to the NHL in 1979, a rivalry grew between the Canadiens and the Nordiques, peaking in 1984 when the Canadiens eliminated the Nordiques in six games, but not before the [[Good Friday Massacre]] made headlines.\n\nLed by goaltender [[Patrick Roy]], the Canadiens won their 23rd Stanley Cup in 1986 and their 24th in 1993. Roy won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the playoffs' most valuable player both times. The 1993 team set an NHL record with 10 consecutive overtime victories in one playoff year and is the most recent Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup. In 2003, Montreal participated in the first regular season outdoor game in NHL history, defeating the Edmonton Oilers in the [[2003 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]].\n\nThe [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] has inducted over 50 former Canadiens players, as well as ten executives. The team has retired 15 numbers, representing 17 players, and has honoured ten off-ice personnel in its Builder's Row.\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:MontrealCanadiens19121913.jpg|right|thumb|280px|The Montreal Canadiens pose for a team photo, 1912\u201313|alt=A group photograph of ten hockey players wearing horizontally striped jerseys with a maple leaf logo surrounding the letters \"CAC\", along with their coach]]\nIn November 1909, industrialist [[Ambrose O'Brien]] of [[Renfrew, Ontario|Renfrew]], Ontario, was in Montreal to purchase supplies for a railway contract. At the request of the [[Renfrew Creamery Kings]] hockey team, he attended the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association|Eastern Canada Hockey Association]] (ECHA) meetings, held at the [[Windsor Hotel (Montreal)|Windsor Hotel]], to represent Renfrew in its application to join the league. At the meeting, the ECHA team owners rejected Renfrew's application.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jenish|2009|p=8}}</ref> Later that day the ECHA's owners chose to disband their league and form the [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909-1910)|Canadian Hockey Association]] (CHA) in a bid to exclude the [[Montreal Wanderers]], who had upset the other owners when they moved into a smaller arena that would reduce the visiting team's share of [[gate receipts]].<ref name=\"McKinley54\">{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=54}}</ref> In the lobby of the hotel, O'Brien met [[Jimmy Gardner (ice hockey)|Jimmy Gardner]], manager of the Wanderers, and discussed forming a new league which would include Renfrew, the Wanderers, and two teams that O'Brien owned in the Ontario mining towns of [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]] and [[Haileybury, Ontario|Haileybury]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Jenish|2009|pp=9\u201310}}</ref> Gardner suggested that O'Brien start a team of [[francophone]] players based in Montreal, forming a rivalry with the Wanderers.<ref name=\"McKinley54\" /> As a result, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was founded on December 2, 1909,<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Brien|1971|p=12}}</ref> and Les Canadiens were created two days later, initially financed by O'Brien with the intent of transferring ownership to francophone sportsmen in Montreal as soon as possible.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Brien|1971|pp=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, francophone teams were not considered to be good enough to play with the top [[English Canadian|anglophone]] teams: the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' warned potential fans of the new team not to get too excited, as \"French-Canadian players of class are not numerous\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=55}}</ref> The Canadiens stocked their team with francophone stars including [[Newsy Lalonde]], [[Georges Poulin]] and [[Didier Pitre]].

To solve this problem, on November 26 they created a new league, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and didn't invite Livingstone to join them.  They nominally remained members of the NHA and had enough votes to suspend the league's operations, effectively leaving Livingstone in a one-team league. Kennedy was the dominant force in the new league; he not only owned the Canadiens, but had loaned [[Tommy Gorman]] the money he used to buy the Senators.<ref name=\"Champions\">{{Citation |title=Champions: The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Triumph Books |location=[[Chicago]] |isbn=1-57243-213-6}}</ref> However, the four teams still desired to have a team from Toronto in their league.

The season was successful due to a strong performance by goaltender [[Carey Price]], who won the [[Vezina Trophy]], the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and the [[Ted Lindsay Award]], in addition to sharing the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for the fewest goals allowed during the regular season.<ref name=\"CBC-2015-Price-awards\">{{cite web\n |agency=Associated Press \n |title=NHL awards: Carey Price tops big night with Hart trophy \n |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada \n |date=2015-06-24 \n |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-awards-carey-price-tops-big-night-with-hart-trophy-1.3126667 \n |url-status=live \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627150648/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-awards-carey-price-tops-big-night-with-hart-trophy-1.3126667 \n |archivedate=2015-06-27 \n}}</ref>\n\nThe Habs started the [[2015\u201316 NHL season|2015\u201316 season]] with a nine-game winning streak, and posted an 18\u20134\u20133 record in the first two months of the season. However, after winning 19 of their first 26 games, the team struggled offensively and lost many players, including Price, to injuries. The Canadiens ultimately finished sixth in the Atlantic Division and did not qualify for the playoffs for the first time since the 2011\u201312 season. The team participated for the first time in the [[NHL Winter Classic]], defeating the Boston Bruins.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, goaltender [[Al Montoya]] allowed 10 goals in a 10-0 Canadiens road loss to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]]; the Habs later scored 10 goals in a 10\u20131 home win over the Colorado Avalanche on December 10, 2016. While the team started the [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2016\u201317 season]] with a record of 13\u20131\u20131 in their first 15 games, they only went 18\u201318\u20137 in next 41 games but would remain in first place in the Atlantic Division through the first 56 games of the season. As a result, the Habs fired Therrien and replaced him with Claude Julien on February 14, 2017; this was the second time that Julien (who was fired by the Bruins on February 7) replaced Therrien as head coach in the history of the Canadiens franchise.  On March 30, 2017, the Canadiens qualified for the [[2017 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]] after a 6\u20132 home victory against the [[Florida Panthers]]; they would clinch the Atlantic Division title a few days later. Despite winning their second division title in the past three seasons, the Habs would ultimately lose their first round playoff series to the Rangers in six games.\n\n==Retired numbers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:1em; float:right\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Player\n!Date retired\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''1'''|| [[Jacques Plante]]|| October 7, 1995\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''2'''|| [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]]|| October 26, 1985\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''3'''|| [[Emile Bouchard]]|| December 4, 2009\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''4'''|| [[Jean B\u00e9liveau|Jean Beliveau]]|| October 9, 1971\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''5'''|| [[Bernie Geoffrion]]|| March 11, 2006\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''5'''|| [[Guy Lapointe]]|| November 8, 2014\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''7'''|| [[Howie Morenz]]|| November 2, 1937\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''9'''|| [[Maurice Richard]]|| October 6, 1960\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''10'''|| [[Guy Lafleur]]|| February 16, 1985\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''12'''|| [[Dickie Moore (ice hockey)|Dickie Moore]]|| November 12, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''12'''|| [[Yvan Cournoyer]]|| November 12, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''16'''|| [[Henri Richard]]|| December 10, 1975\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''16'''|| [[Elmer Lach]]|| December 4, 2009\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''18'''|| [[Serge Savard]]|| November 18, 2006\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''19'''|| [[Larry Robinson]]|| November 19, 2007\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''23'''|| [[Bob Gainey]]|| February 23, 2008\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''29'''|| [[Ken Dryden]]|| January 29, 2007\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| '''33'''|| [[Patrick Roy]]|| November 22, 2008\n|}\n\n[[File:Chandails r\u00e9tir\u00e9s CH, Plante, Moore, Harvey, M.Richard, Bouchard, Lach, Morenz.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the Canadiens' retired numbers and Stanley Cup championship banners atop the [[Bell Centre]].]]\nThe Canadiens have [[retired number|retired]] 15 numbers, honouring 18 players.<ref name=\"Canadiens-RetiredNumbers\">{{citation|title=Dashboard \u2013 Players |url=http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/index/retired-jerseys |publisher=Montreal Canadiens Hockey Club |accessdate=2009-09-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015060706/http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/index/retired-jerseys |archivedate=2013-10-15 }}</ref> Howie Morenz's number 7 was the first jersey to be retired, shortly after his death in 1937.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kay|2009|p=27}}</ref> Maurice Richard's number 9 followed in 1960; his 544 career goals are a franchise record.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kay|2009|p=31}}</ref> Henri Richard, brother of Maurice, was honoured in 1975 with the retirement of his number 16, after 21 seasons and 11 Stanley Cups with the Canadiens.

A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Brewer is the fourth woman, and was the third consecutive woman, to serve as Governor of Arizona. Brewer became governor of Arizona as part of the [[line of succession]], as determined by the [[Arizona Constitution]], when Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] resigned to become [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|secretary of Homeland Security]]. Brewer had served as [[Secretary of State of Arizona|secretary of state of Arizona]] from January 2003 to January 2009.\n\nBorn in [[California]], Brewer attended [[Glendale Community College (Arizona)|Glendale Community College]], from where she received a radiological technologist certificate; she has never earned a college degree. She served as a State Representative and State Senator for Arizona from 1983 to 1996. Brewer also served as Chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors before running for Arizona Secretary of State in 2002.\n\nAs governor, Brewer signed the [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]]. The act makes it a state [[misdemeanor]] crime for an immigrant to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, authorizes state and local law enforcement of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[immigration law]]s, and cracks down on those sheltering, hiring and transporting undocumented immigrants.

Brewer would go on to serve in the [[Arizona House of Representatives]] for three years, from 1983 to 1987, before deciding to run for the [[Arizona Senate]], where she would serve from 1987 to 1996. As state senator, Brewer sought legislation with the intention of creating an office of lieutenant governor in the state, arguing that holding the office of Secretary of State does not make a candidate qualified for governor, and that the office should be filled by a member of the same party, should a vacancy arise.<ref name=\"about\"/> During her last three years as a state senator, she held the senior leadership position of [[majority whip]].<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn 1996 Brewer ran for chairman of the [[Maricopa County]] Board of Supervisors, defeating incumbent Ed King, and served for six years on the board. She inherited a debt of $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===Secretary of State of Arizona===\n[[File:Jan Brewer 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|Secretary of State]]\nIn early 2002, Brewer created a campaign committee to run for the office of [[Secretary of State of Arizona]], to replace outgoing Arizona Secretary of State [[Betsey Bayless]]. Brewer ran against Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio in the primary race. Brewer won by a narrow margin of just 23,000 votes.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nAs Secretary of State, Brewer instituted a vote-by-fax program for overseas military troops, which would later be adopted by other municipalities, including [[San Francisco]]. Brewer also helped marshal changes brought about by [[Arizona Proposition 200 (2004)|Arizona Proposition 200]], which required citizens in the state to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote or applying for public benefits.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===Governor of Arizona===\n\nGovernor [[Janet Napolitano]] was selected by President [[Barack Obama]] to serve as the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] in the [[United States Cabinet]]. Since Arizona has no lieutenant governor, the Secretary of State stands first in the line of succession if he or she holds that post as a result of an election. Despite her earlier quarrels with the line of succession while serving in the State Senate, Brewer was sworn in as governor after Napolitano resigned from her position on January 21, 2009. She became Arizona's fourth [[List of female state governors in the United States|female governor]] and its third consecutive female governor.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn her inaugural address, Brewer promised to keep taxes low in Arizona, in an attempt to attract business from other states, including [[California]].

The act makes it a state [[misdemeanor]] crime for an immigrant to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, authorizes state and local law enforcement of [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[immigration law]]s, and cracks down on those sheltering, hiring and transporting undocumented immigrants.

Brewer would go on to serve in the [[Arizona House of Representatives]] for three years, from 1983 to 1987, before deciding to run for the [[Arizona Senate]], where she would serve from 1987 to 1996. As state senator, Brewer sought legislation with the intention of creating an office of lieutenant governor in the state, arguing that holding the office of Secretary of State does not make a candidate qualified for governor, and that the office should be filled by a member of the same party, should a vacancy arise.<ref name=\"about\"/> During her last three years as a state senator, she held the senior leadership position of [[majority whip]].<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn 1996 Brewer ran for chairman of the [[Maricopa County]] Board of Supervisors, defeating incumbent Ed King, and served for six years on the board.

Brewer ran against Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio in the primary race. Brewer won by a narrow margin of just 23,000 votes.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nAs Secretary of State, Brewer instituted a vote-by-fax program for overseas military troops, which would later be adopted by other municipalities, including [[San Francisco]]. Brewer also helped marshal changes brought about by [[Arizona Proposition 200 (2004)|Arizona Proposition 200]], which required citizens in the state to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote or applying for public benefits.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===Governor of Arizona===\n\nGovernor [[Janet Napolitano]] was selected by President [[Barack Obama]] to serve as the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] in the [[United States Cabinet]]. Since Arizona has no lieutenant governor, the Secretary of State stands first in the line of succession if he or she holds that post as a result of an election. Despite her earlier quarrels with the line of succession while serving in the State Senate, Brewer was sworn in as governor after Napolitano resigned from her position on January 21, 2009. She became Arizona's fourth [[List of female state governors in the United States|female governor]] and its third consecutive female governor.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nIn her inaugural address, Brewer promised to keep taxes low in Arizona, in an attempt to attract business from other states, including [[California]].

One example is the [[rabbit]].

This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or [[Ctenomys]], is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of disuse. (Charles Darwin, [[The Origin of Species]]<ref>Charles Darwin, [[The Origin of Species]], [[s:The Origin of Species/Chapter V|Laws of Variation]]</ref>)</blockquote>\n\n===Research===\n\nThe blind forms of the [[Mexican tetra]] have proven popular subjects for scientists studying [[evolution]]: A recent study suggests that there are at least two distinct genetic lineages among the blind populations, arguing that these represent a case of [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=\"dowling_et_al\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Dowling, T.

This is called [[economical adaptation]]. However, studies have shown that blind cave fish embryos begin to grow eyes during development but then something actively stops this process and flesh grows over the partially grown eyes. Another theory is that some Mexican tetra randomly don't develop eyes (which is represented by broken genes in the fish's genome), and this lack of eyes spreads to the rest of the population despite having no advantage or disadvantage. This is called the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].\n\nIn one experiment studying eye development, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] scientists transplanted [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]es from the eyes of sighted surface-form [[embryo]]s into blind cave-form embryos, and vice versa.  In the cave form, lens development begins within the first 24 hours of embryonic development, but quickly aborts, the lens cells dying; most of the rest of the eye structures never develop.  Researchers found that the lens seemed to control the development of the rest of the eye, as the surface-form tetras which received cave-form lenses failed to develop eyes, while cave-form tetras which received surface-form lenses grew eyes with [[pupil]]s, [[cornea]]s, and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es.

This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or [[Ctenomys]], is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would aid the effects of disuse.

This is called [[economical adaptation]]. However, studies have shown that blind cave fish embryos begin to grow eyes during development but then something actively stops this process and flesh grows over the partially grown eyes. Another theory is that some Mexican tetra randomly don't develop eyes (which is represented by broken genes in the fish's genome), and this lack of eyes spreads to the rest of the population despite having no advantage or disadvantage. This is called the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].\n\nIn one experiment studying eye development, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] scientists transplanted [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]es from the eyes of sighted surface-form [[embryo]]s into blind cave-form embryos, and vice versa.  In the cave form, lens development begins within the first 24 hours of embryonic development, but quickly aborts, the lens cells dying; most of the rest of the eye structures never develop.  Researchers found that the lens seemed to control the development of the rest of the eye, as the surface-form tetras which received cave-form lenses failed to develop eyes, while cave-form tetras which received surface-form lenses grew eyes with [[pupil]]s, [[cornea]]s, and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es.

To make this transition  from war to \"peace\" but without the advantage of an early return to the UK required a very special understanding of both men and material and again Captain Black showed outstanding leadership qualities in maintaining momentum.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49134 |date=8 October 1982|page=12832 |supp=y }}</ref>}}\n* 31 December 1986 \u2013  Vice Admiral John Jeremy Black, DSO, MBE is appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=50764 |date=30 December 1986|page=2 |supp=y }}</ref>\n* 15 June 1991 \u2013 Admiral Sir (John) Jeremy Black, KCB, DSO, MBE, ADC is appointed a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] (GBE)<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=52563 |date=14 June 1991 |page=5 |supp=y }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80013161 Imperial War Museum Interview]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-mil}}\n{{s-new}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff]]|years=1985\u20131986}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Michael Livesay]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Donald Hall (RAF officer)|Sir Donald Hall]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff|Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Systems)]]|years=1986\u20131989}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Anthony Mullens|Sir Anthony Mullens]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Sandy Woodward|Sir John Woodward]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command (Royal Navy)|Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command]]|years=1989\u20131991}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[John Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Kerr]]}}\n|-\n{{s-hon}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Nicholas Hunt|Sir Nicholas Hunt]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom]] |years=1997\u20132001}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Kenneth Eaton|Sir Kenneth Eaton]]}}\n|-\n{{s-bef|before=[[Nicholas Hunt|Sir Nicholas Hunt]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom]] |years=2001\u20132005}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[James Burnell-Nugent|Sir James Burnell-Nugent]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black, Jeremy}}\n[[Category:1932 births]]\n[[Category:2015 deaths]]\n[[Category:British military personnel of the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order]]\n[[Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath]]\n[[Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:People from Tavistock]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy admirals]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Falklands War]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Korean War]]\n", "name_user": "Hammersfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Black_(Royal_Navy_officer)"}

However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]], as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the [[Iberian lynx]] and the [[Spanish imperial eagle]]. It is known as an [[invasive species]] because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and has caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. [[Rabbits in Australia|Feral European rabbits in Australia]] have had a devastating impact, due in part to the lack of natural predators there.\n\nThe European rabbit is well known for digging networks of [[burrow]]s, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related [[hare]]s (''Lepus'' spp.), rabbits are [[altricial]], the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist [[Ronald Lockley]], who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in [[Orielton, Pembrokeshire]]. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book ''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', which is credited by [[Richard Adams]] as having played a key role in his gaining \"a knowledge of rabbits and their ways\" that informed his novel ''[[Watership Down]]''. The other group was the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in [[Australia]], where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of myxomatosis, and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood.\n\n==Naming and etymology==\nBecause of its non-British origin, the species does not have native names in [[English language|English]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], with the usual terms \"cony\" and \"rabbit\" being foreign [[loanword]]s. \"Rabbit\" is also pronounced as ''rabbidge'', ''rabbert'' ([[North Devon]]) and ''rappit'' ([[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]). More archaic pronunciations include ''rabbette'' (15th-16th centuries), ''rabet'' (15th-17th centuries), ''rabbet'' (16th-18th centuries), ''rabatte'' (16th century), ''rabytt'' (17th century) and ''rabit'' (18th century). The [[root word]] is the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] ''rabett'', which was once commonly used in [[Li\u00e8ge]]. ''Rabett'' itself is derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''robbe'', with the addition of the [[suffix]] ''-ett''.<ref name=\"b177\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"cony\" or \"coney\" predates \"rabbit\", and first occurred during the 13th century to refer to the animal's pelt. Later, \"cony\" referred to the adult animal, while \"rabbit\" referred to the young. The root of \"cony\" is the [[old French]] ''connil'' or ''counil'', of which the [[Norman French|Norman]] plural was ''coniz'', and later ''conis''. Its forerunner is the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, from which the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''cuniculus'' is derived. The origin of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 itself is unclear: [[Claudius Aelianus|\u00c6lian]], who lived during the 3rd century, linked the word to the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''unchi'', while [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varo]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] connected it to ''cuneus'', which refers to a wedge, thus making reference to the animal's digging ability.<ref name=\"b177\"/>\n\nThe species' dwelling place is termed a warren or cony-garth. \"Warren\" comes from the Old English ''wareine'', itself derived from the Old French ''warenne'', ''varenne'', or ''garenne''. The root word is the [[Low Latin]] ''warenna'', which originally signified a preserve in general, only to be later used to refer specifically to an enclosure set apart for rabbits and hares.<ref name=\"hart51\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> \"Cony-garth\" derives from the [[Middle English]] ''conygerthe'', which may be a [[compound word|compound]] of ''connynge''+''erthe'' (cony+earth). The term stems from the Old French ''conniniere'' or ''coninyere'', and later ''conilliere''. The root word is the Low Latin ''cunicularia'', the feminine form of the [[adjective]] ''cunicularius'', which pertains to the rabbit.<ref name=\"b177\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:History of British Mammals - Lepus vs Oryctolagus.png|150 px|thumb|Skulls of [[European hare|brown hare]] (top), [[mountain hare]] (middle) and European rabbit (bottom).]]\nThough originally assigned to the [[genus]] ''[[Lepus]]'', the European rabbit was consigned to its own genus in 1874, on account of its [[altricial]] young, burrowing habits, and numerous skeletal characters.<ref name=\"h203\"/> The European rabbit is superficially similar to the [[North America]]n [[Cottontail rabbit|cottontail]]s, as both ''Oryctolagus'' and ''Sylvilagus'' are born blind and naked, have white flesh, and little [[sexual dimorphism]].

The [[guard hair]]s are banded brown and black, or grey, while the [[nape]] of the neck and [[scrotum]] are reddish. The chest patch is brown, while the rest of the underparts are white or grey. A white star shape is often present on kits' foreheads, but rarely occurs in adults. The [[whiskers]] are long and black, and the feet are fully furred and buff-coloured.<ref name=\"h203\"/> The tail has a white underside, which becomes prominent when escaping danger. This may act as a signal for other rabbits to run.<ref name=\"hart13\"/>\n\n[[Moulting]] occurs once a year, beginning in March on the face and spreading over the back. The underfur is completely replaced by October\u2013November.<ref name=\"h203\"/> The European rabbit exhibits great variation in colour, from light sandy, to dark grey and completely black. Such variation depends largely on the amount of guard hairs relative to regular pelage. [[Melanism|Melanist]]s are not uncommon in [[mainland Europe]], though [[albinism|albino]]es are rare.<ref name=\"h204-5\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=204\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n==Life history and behaviour==\n===Social and territorial behaviours===\n[[File:NSG Alter Flugplatz Karlsruhe (2014) 11.JPG|thumb|right|Group of rabbits grazing]]\nThe European rabbit lives in warrens that contain 2-10 other individuals living in smaller groups to ensure greater breeding success.<ref>Daly, J.

L. Dudzinski (1972). \"Aggressive and Protective Behaviour of Adult Rabbits ''Oryctolagus cuniculus'' (L.) Towards Rabbits.\" ''Behaviour'' 43: 97-120.</ref> The size of the species' [[home range]] varies according to habitat, food, shelter, cover from predators, and breeding sites, though it is generally small, encompassing about 0.3-0.7 [[hectare]]s. Except during times of low rabbit density and abundance of high-quality food, male ranges tend to be larger than those held by females. The European rabbit rarely strays far from its burrow: when feeding on cultivated fields, it typically only moves 25 metres away from its burrow, and rarely 50 metres. It may however move as far as 500 metres after an abrupt change in environment, such as a [[harvest]]. This behaviour may be an anti-predator adaptation, as rabbits in areas where predators are under rigorous control may move three times further from their burrows than those in areas without predator management.<ref name=\"h206-207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\nThe European rabbit is a gregarious animal, which lives in stable social groups centred around females sharing access to one or more burrow systems. However, social structures tend to be looser in areas where burrow construction is relatively easy. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance hierarchies]] exist in parallel for both bucks and does. Among bucks, status is determined through access to does, with dominant bucks siring the majority of the colony's offspring. The dominant does have priority access to the best nesting sites, with competition over such sites often leading to serious injury or death. Subordinate does, particularly in large colonies, typically resort to using single-entrance breeding spots far from the main warren, thus making themselves vulnerable to [[Red fox|fox]] or [[European badger|badger]] predation.<ref name=\"h206-207\"/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:The Rabbit (1898) 'Maternal instinct'.png|thumb|''Maternal Instinct'' (c.1898), [[George Edward Lodge|G. E. Lodge]].]]\nIn the European rabbit's [[mating system]], dominant bucks exhibit [[polygyny]], whereas lower-status individuals (both bucks and does) often form [[monogamy|monogamous]] breeding relationships<!-- the second part of the sentence can trivially be deduced by the fact that mammals produce approximately equal number of offsprings in both genders -->. Rabbits signal their readiness to copulate by marking other animals and inanimate objects with an odoriferous substance secreted though a chin gland, in a process known as \"chinning\".<ref>Gonzalez-Mariscal, G., M. E. Albonetti, et al. (1997). \"Transitory inhibition of scent marking by copulation in male and female rabbits.\" ''Animal Behavior'' 53:323-333.</ref> Though male European rabbits may sometimes be amicable with one another, fierce fights can erupt among bucks during the [[breeding season]],<ref name=\"l97\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=97}}</ref> typically January to August. A succession of litters (usually 3-7 kittens each) are produced, but in overpopulated areas, pregnant does may lose all their [[embryo]]s through intrauterine resorption.<ref name=\"h207-209\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=207\u2013209}}</ref> Shortly before giving birth, the doe will construct a separate burrow known as a \"stop\" or \"stab\", generally in an open field away from the main warren. These breeding burrows are typically a few feet long and are lined with grass and moss as well as fur plucked from the doe's belly. The breeding burrow protects the kittens from adult bucks as well as from predators.<ref name=\"b214\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=214}}</ref>\n\nThe [[gestation period]] of the European rabbit is 30 days,<ref name=\"b210\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=210\u2013212}}</ref> with the [[sex ratio]] of male to female kittens tending to be 1:1. Greater maternal investment over male offspring may result in higher [[birth weight]]s for bucks.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/> Kittens born to the dominant buck and doe&mdash;who enjoy better nesting and feeding grounds&mdash;tend to grow larger and stronger and to become more dominant than kittens born to subordinate rabbits.<ref name=\"l100\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=100}}</ref> It is not uncommon for European rabbits to mate again immediately after giving birth, with some specimens having been observed to nurse previous young whilst pregnant.<ref name=\"b210\"/>\n\nFemale European rabbits nurse their kittens once a night, for only a few minutes. After suckling is complete, the doe seals the entrance to the stop with soil and vegetation. In its native Iberian and southern French range, European rabbit kittens have a [[growth rate (biology)|growth rate]] of {{convert|5|g|oz}} per day, though such kittens in non-native ranges may grow {{convert|10|g|oz}} per day. Weight at birth is {{convert|30|-|35|g|oz}} and increases to {{convert|150|-|200|g|oz}} by 21\u201325 days, during the [[weaning]] period.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/> European rabbit kittens are born blind, deaf, and nearly naked. The ears do not gain the power of motion until 10 days of age, and can be erected after 13. The eyes open 11 days after birth.<ref name=\"b210\"/> At 18 days, the kittens begin to leave the burrow. [[Sexual maturity]] in bucks is attained at four months, while does can begin to breed at three to five months.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/>\n\n===Burrowing behaviour===\n[[File:20150202Hockenheim6.jpg|thumb|right|Entrances to a rabbit warren]]\nThe European rabbit's burrows occur mostly on slopes and banks, where [[drainage]] is more efficient. The burrow entrances are typically 10\u201350&nbsp;cm in diameter,<ref name=\"h202\"/> and are easily recognisable by the bare earth at their mouths. Vegetation growth is prevented by the constant passing and repassing of the resident rabbits. Big burrows are complex excavations which may descend to depths of several feet. They are not constructed on any specified plan, and appear to be enlarged or improved as a result of the promiscuous activity of several generations. Digging is done by pulling the soil backwards with the forefeet and throwing it between the hind legs, which scatter the material with kicking motions. While most burrows are dug from the outside, some warrens feature holes dug from the inside which act as emergency exits when escaping from predators below ground. These holes usually descend perpendicularly to 3\u20134 feet, and their mouths lack the bare earth characteristic of burrow entrances. While kittens sleep in chambers lined with grass and fur, adults sleep on the bare earth, likely in order to prevent [[damp]], with warmth being secured by [[huddling]].<ref name=\"b202\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=202\u2013205}}</ref> Although both sexes dig, does do so more skillfully, and for longer periods.<ref name=\"l58\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=58}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\nThe European rabbit is usually a silent animal, though it has at least two vocalisations. The most well known is a high treble scream or squeal.<ref name=\"l23\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=23}}</ref> This distress call has been likened to the cry of a piglet.<ref name=\"b227\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=227}}</ref> This sound is uttered when in extreme distress, such as being caught by a predator or trap.<ref name=\"l23\"/> During the spring, bucks express contentment by emitting grunting sounds when approaching other rabbits. These grunts are similar to shrill [[hiccup]]s, and are emitted with the mouth closed. Aggression is expressed with a low growl.<ref name=\"b227\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Habitat===\nThe European rabbit's ideal habitat consists of short grasslands with secure refuge (such as burrows, boulders, hedgerows, scrub and woodland) near feeding areas. It may dwell up to [[treeline]], as long as the land is well drained and shelter is available. The size and distribution of its burrow systems depend on the type of [[soil]] present: in areas with loose soil, it selects sites with supporting structures, such as tree roots or shrubs in order to prevent burrow collapse. Warrens tend to be larger and have more interconnected tunnels in areas with [[chalk]] than those in sand. In large coniferous plantations, the species only occurs on peripheral areas and along fire breaks and rides.<ref name=\"h206\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:European Rabbit, Lake District, UK - August 2011.jpg|thumb|right|European rabbit [[meow, meow,\nThe European rabbit eats a wide variety of [[Herbs|herbage]], especially [[grass]]es, favouring the young, succulent leaves and shoots of the most nutritious species, particularly [[fescue]]s. In mixed cultivated areas, [[winter wheat]] is preferred over [[maize]] and [[dicotyledon]]s. During the summer period, the European rabbit feeds on the shortest, and therefore less nutritious grass swards, thus indicating that grazing grounds are selected through anti-predator considerations rather than maximising food intake. In times of scarcity, the rabbit increases its food intake, selecting the parts of the plant with the highest [[nitrogen]] content.<ref name=\"h207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=207}}</ref> Hungry rabbits in winter may resort to eating [[tree bark]].

In Helsinki region freed pet rabbits are considered pests.]]\nRecent research has shown that all European rabbits carry common genetic markers and descend from one of two maternal lines. These lines originated between 12,000 and 6.5 million years ago when glaciers isolated two herds; one on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the other in [[Southern France]]. It can be surmised that humans began hunting rabbits as a food source, but further research needs to be done to verify this. Little comprehensive evidence of the relationship of humans with European rabbits is documented until the medieval period.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Rabbit Domestication -- Western Europe |url= http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015632/http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |archivedate=2011-07-11}}</ref>\n\nHumans' relationship with the European rabbit was first recorded by the Phoenicians prior to 1000 [[Before Christ|BC]], when they termed the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'' (literally, the land of the [[hyraxes]]). This phrase closely resembles related [[modern Hebrew]]: ''I'' (\u05d0\u05d9) meaning island and ''shafan'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05df) meaning hyrax, plural ''shfan\u00edm'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd). Phoenicians called the local rabbits 'hyraxes' because rabbits resemble hyraxes in some ways, and hyraxes are native to [[Phoenicia]], unlike rabbits. Hyraxes, like rabbits, are not rodents. One theory states that the Romans converted the phrase ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'', with influence from the Greek ''Spania'', to its Latin form, ''[[Hispania]]'', which evolved in all the Iberian languages: into Castilian ''Espa\u00f1a'', Portuguese ''Espanha'', Catalan ''Espanya'' (English \"Spain\"), and such other variations in modern languages. The precise meaning of ''shafan'' remains unclear, but the balance of opinion appears to indicate that the hyrax is indeed the intended meaning.<ref name=\"shafan\">{{cite web |title=The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax, chapter 6 |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nLike the Phoenicians, neither the later [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] nor [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] colonizers had a specific name for the rabbit, because the species is not native to [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] (though it is present there nowadays). They commonly called it \"small hare\" and \"small digging hare\", in contrast to the [[European hare]], which is larger and doesn't make burrows. [[Catullus]] used the name ''cuniculus'' (a latinization of the [[Iberian culture|Iberian]] word ''kiniklos''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studylib.es/doc/5811443/origen-ib%C3%A9rico-del-conejo.|title=ORIGEN IB\u00c9RICO DEL CONEJO.|website=studylib.es}}</ref> and the etymological origin of the Castilian name ''conejo'', Portuguese ''coelho'' and Catalan ''conill'',<ref>Corominas, Joan & Jos\u00e9 A.

Rabbits are an example of an animal that can be treated as a food, a pet, or a pest by different members of the same culture. In some urban areas, infestations of feral European rabbits (descended from pets) have become a problem. [[Helsinki]], for example, host to one of the northernmost populations of the species, had an estimated 2,500 European rabbits at the end of 2006, doubling to 5,000 by autumn 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kemppainen |first=Jouni K. |date=October 2007 |title=Kanit keskuudessamme (''The rabbits among us'') |journal=[[Suomen Kuvalehti]]| pages=76\u201383| language=Finnish}}</ref> In Iceland, populations of ''O. cuniculus'' are found in urban [[Reykjavik]] as well as in the [[Vestmannaeyjar]] archipelago.

The first known mention of the rabbit as an invasive species (and possibly the first documented instance of an invasive species ever) was made in regard to the introduction of the rabbit to the [[Balearic Islands]] after the [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus|Roman conquest]] of the 1st century BCE. According to both [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], the multiplying rabbits caused famines by destroying crop yields and even collapsed trees and houses with their burrowing. The inhabitants petitioned [[Augustus]] for help, who sent troops to curb the rabbit population with the help of [[ferret]]s.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOther locations where the European rabbit was introduced include: [[Great Britain]] (by the Romans following their invasion in AD 43<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4439339.stm|title=Norfolk - Remains of Roman rabbit uncovered|work=BBC News|date=2005-04-13}}</ref>); the Hawaiian Islands of [[Laysan Island]] (in 1903) and [[Lisianski Island]]; Oceania's [[Macquarie Island]]; Washington state's [[Smith Island (Washington)|Smith Island]] and [[San Juan Island]] (around 1900 and later spreading to the other San Juan Islands); several islands off the coast of [[Southern Africa]] (including [[Robben Island]]); as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n[[File:Wild rabbit in grass.jpg|thumb|A feral rabbit on a farm in [[Victoria (Australia)]]]]\nTwenty-four specimens of the European rabbit were [[Rabbits in Australia|introduced to Australia]] in 1859 by estate owner [[Thomas Austin]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Their descendants multiplied and spread throughout the country thanks to the lack of natural predators, a conducive habitat (provided by widespread farming), and the mild Australian winters that allowed year-round breeding. Australia's native equivalent, the [[bilby]], was quickly pushed out by the invasive rabbit. (The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection.) Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense \"[[rabbit-proof fence]]\" to halt the westward expansion of the infestation. The European rabbit, however, can not only jump very high but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, the intentional introduction of a virus, ''[[Myxomatosis|Myxomatosis cuniiculi]]'', provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s necessary for the spread of the disease were not present. Myxomatosis can also infect pet rabbits (the same species). Today's remaining feral rabbits in Australia are largely immune to myxomatosis. A second deadly rabbit virus, [[rabbit hemorrhagic disease]] (RHD), has been cleared in Australia as a [[biological control]] agent and has already killed millions of the European rabbits there. RHD was also introduced&mdash;illegally&mdash; in New Zealand.\n[[File:Okunojima-rabbit.JPG|thumb|right|Feral rabbits on the island of [[\u014ckunoshima]].

It was first widely kept in [[ancient Rome]], where fetal rabbits were known as ''[[laurices]]'' and considered a delicacy, and has been refined into a [[List of rabbit breeds|wide variety of breeds]] during and since the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nDomesticated rabbits have mostly been bred to be much larger than wild rabbits, though [[selective breeding]] has produced a range sizes from \"dwarf\" to \"giant\", which are kept as food animals and pets across the world. They have as much color variation among themselves as other livestock and pet animals. Their fur is prized for its softness; today, [[Angora rabbits]] are raised for their long, soft fur, which is often spun into yarn. Other breeds are raised for the fur industry, particularly the [[Rex rabbit|Rex]], which has a smooth, [[velvet]]-like coat and comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes.\n\n===Conservation status===\n{{anchor|Status|reason=This subsection's name was changed from \"Status\" to \"Conservation status\" on 29 March 2018}} \nThough the European rabbit thrives in many of the locations where it was introduced, in its native Iberia, populations are dwindling.

However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]], as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the [[Iberian lynx]] and the [[Spanish imperial eagle]]. It is known as an [[invasive species]] because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and has caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. [[Rabbits in Australia|Feral European rabbits in Australia]] have had a devastating impact, due in part to the lack of natural predators there.\n\nThe European rabbit is well known for digging networks of [[burrow]]s, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related [[hare]]s (''Lepus'' spp.), rabbits are [[altricial]], the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist [[Ronald Lockley]], who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in [[Orielton, Pembrokeshire]]. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book ''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', which is credited by [[Richard Adams]] as having played a key role in his gaining \"a knowledge of rabbits and their ways\" that informed his novel ''[[Watership Down]]''. The other group was the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in [[Australia]], where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of myxomatosis, and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood.\n\n==Naming and etymology==\nBecause of its non-British origin, the species does not have native names in [[English language|English]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], with the usual terms \"cony\" and \"rabbit\" being foreign [[loanword]]s. \"Rabbit\" is also pronounced as ''rabbidge'', ''rabbert'' ([[North Devon]]) and ''rappit'' ([[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]). More archaic pronunciations include ''rabbette'' (15th-16th centuries), ''rabet'' (15th-17th centuries), ''rabbet'' (16th-18th centuries), ''rabatte'' (16th century), ''rabytt'' (17th century) and ''rabit'' (18th century). The [[root word]] is the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] ''rabett'', which was once commonly used in [[Li\u00e8ge]]. ''Rabett'' itself is derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''robbe'', with the addition of the [[suffix]] ''-ett''.<ref name=\"b177\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"cony\" or \"coney\" predates \"rabbit\", and first occurred during the 13th century to refer to the animal's pelt. Later, \"cony\" referred to the adult animal, while \"rabbit\" referred to the young. The root of \"cony\" is the [[old French]] ''connil'' or ''counil'', of which the [[Norman French|Norman]] plural was ''coniz'', and later ''conis''. Its forerunner is the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, from which the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''cuniculus'' is derived. The origin of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 itself is unclear: [[Claudius Aelianus|\u00c6lian]], who lived during the 3rd century, linked the word to the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''unchi'', while [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varo]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] connected it to ''cuneus'', which refers to a wedge, thus making reference to the animal's digging ability.<ref name=\"b177\"/>\n\nThe species' dwelling place is termed a warren or cony-garth. \"Warren\" comes from the Old English ''wareine'', itself derived from the Old French ''warenne'', ''varenne'', or ''garenne''. The root word is the [[Low Latin]] ''warenna'', which originally signified a preserve in general, only to be later used to refer specifically to an enclosure set apart for rabbits and hares.<ref name=\"hart51\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> \"Cony-garth\" derives from the [[Middle English]] ''conygerthe'', which may be a [[compound word|compound]] of ''connynge''+''erthe'' (cony+earth).

L. Dudzinski (1972). \"Aggressive and Protective Behaviour of Adult Rabbits ''Oryctolagus cuniculus'' (L.) Towards Rabbits.\" ''Behaviour'' 43: 97-120.</ref> The size of the species' [[home range]] varies according to habitat, food, shelter, cover from predators, and breeding sites, though it is generally small, encompassing about 0.3-0.7 [[hectare]]s. Except during times of low rabbit density and abundance of high-quality food, male ranges tend to be larger than those held by females. The European rabbit rarely strays far from its burrow: when feeding on cultivated fields, it typically only moves 25 metres away from its burrow, and rarely 50 metres. It may however move as far as 500 metres after an abrupt change in environment, such as a [[harvest]]. This behaviour may be an anti-predator adaptation, as rabbits in areas where predators are under rigorous control may move three times further from their burrows than those in areas without predator management.<ref name=\"h206-207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\nThe European rabbit is a gregarious animal, which lives in stable social groups centred around females sharing access to one or more burrow systems. However, social structures tend to be looser in areas where burrow construction is relatively easy. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance hierarchies]] exist in parallel for both bucks and does. Among bucks, status is determined through access to does, with dominant bucks siring the majority of the colony's offspring. The dominant does have priority access to the best nesting sites, with competition over such sites often leading to serious injury or death. Subordinate does, particularly in large colonies, typically resort to using single-entrance breeding spots far from the main warren, thus making themselves vulnerable to [[Red fox|fox]] or [[European badger|badger]] predation.<ref name=\"h206-207\"/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:The Rabbit (1898) 'Maternal instinct'.png|thumb|''Maternal Instinct'' (c.1898), [[George Edward Lodge|G. E. Lodge]].]]\nIn the European rabbit's [[mating system]], dominant bucks exhibit [[polygyny]], whereas lower-status individuals (both bucks and does) often form [[monogamy|monogamous]] breeding relationships<!-- the second part of the sentence can trivially be deduced by the fact that mammals produce approximately equal number of offsprings in both genders -->. Rabbits signal their readiness to copulate by marking other animals and inanimate objects with an odoriferous substance secreted though a chin gland, in a process known as \"chinning\".<ref>Gonzalez-Mariscal, G., M. E. Albonetti, et al. (1997). \"Transitory inhibition of scent marking by copulation in male and female rabbits.\" ''Animal Behavior'' 53:323-333.</ref> Though male European rabbits may sometimes be amicable with one another, fierce fights can erupt among bucks during the [[breeding season]],<ref name=\"l97\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=97}}</ref> typically January to August. A succession of litters (usually 3-7 kittens each) are produced, but in overpopulated areas, pregnant does may lose all their [[embryo]]s through intrauterine resorption.<ref name=\"h207-209\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=207\u2013209}}</ref> Shortly before giving birth, the doe will construct a separate burrow known as a \"stop\" or \"stab\", generally in an open field away from the main warren. These breeding burrows are typically a few feet long and are lined with grass and moss as well as fur plucked from the doe's belly. The breeding burrow protects the kittens from adult bucks as well as from predators.<ref name=\"b214\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=214}}</ref>\n\nThe [[gestation period]] of the European rabbit is 30 days,<ref name=\"b210\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=210\u2013212}}</ref> with the [[sex ratio]] of male to female kittens tending to be 1:1. Greater maternal investment over male offspring may result in higher [[birth weight]]s for bucks.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/> Kittens born to the dominant buck and doe&mdash;who enjoy better nesting and feeding grounds&mdash;tend to grow larger and stronger and to become more dominant than kittens born to subordinate rabbits.<ref name=\"l100\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=100}}</ref> It is not uncommon for European rabbits to mate again immediately after giving birth, with some specimens having been observed to nurse previous young whilst pregnant.<ref name=\"b210\"/>\n\nFemale European rabbits nurse their kittens once a night, for only a few minutes. After suckling is complete, the doe seals the entrance to the stop with soil and vegetation. In its native Iberian and southern French range, European rabbit kittens have a [[growth rate (biology)|growth rate]] of {{convert|5|g|oz}} per day, though such kittens in non-native ranges may grow {{convert|10|g|oz}} per day. Weight at birth is {{convert|30|-|35|g|oz}} and increases to {{convert|150|-|200|g|oz}} by 21\u201325 days, during the [[weaning]] period.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/> European rabbit kittens are born blind, deaf, and nearly naked. The ears do not gain the power of motion until 10 days of age, and can be erected after 13. The eyes open 11 days after birth.<ref name=\"b210\"/> At 18 days, the kittens begin to leave the burrow. [[Sexual maturity]] in bucks is attained at four months, while does can begin to breed at three to five months.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/>\n\n===Burrowing behaviour===\n[[File:20150202Hockenheim6.jpg|thumb|right|Entrances to a rabbit warren]]\nThe European rabbit's burrows occur mostly on slopes and banks, where [[drainage]] is more efficient. The burrow entrances are typically 10\u201350&nbsp;cm in diameter,<ref name=\"h202\"/> and are easily recognisable by the bare earth at their mouths. Vegetation growth is prevented by the constant passing and repassing of the resident rabbits. Big burrows are complex excavations which may descend to depths of several feet. They are not constructed on any specified plan, and appear to be enlarged or improved as a result of the promiscuous activity of several generations. Digging is done by pulling the soil backwards with the forefeet and throwing it between the hind legs, which scatter the material with kicking motions. While most burrows are dug from the outside, some warrens feature holes dug from the inside which act as emergency exits when escaping from predators below ground. These holes usually descend perpendicularly to 3\u20134 feet, and their mouths lack the bare earth characteristic of burrow entrances. While kittens sleep in chambers lined with grass and fur, adults sleep on the bare earth, likely in order to prevent [[damp]], with warmth being secured by [[huddling]].<ref name=\"b202\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=202\u2013205}}</ref> Although both sexes dig, does do so more skillfully, and for longer periods.<ref name=\"l58\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=58}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\nThe European rabbit is usually a silent animal, though it has at least two vocalisations. The most well known is a high treble scream or squeal.<ref name=\"l23\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=23}}</ref> This distress call has been likened to the cry of a piglet.<ref name=\"b227\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=227}}</ref> This sound is uttered when in extreme distress, such as being caught by a predator or trap.<ref name=\"l23\"/> During the spring, bucks express contentment by emitting grunting sounds when approaching other rabbits. These grunts are similar to shrill [[hiccup]]s, and are emitted with the mouth closed. Aggression is expressed with a low growl.<ref name=\"b227\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Habitat===\nThe European rabbit's ideal habitat consists of short grasslands with secure refuge (such as burrows, boulders, hedgerows, scrub and woodland) near feeding areas. It may dwell up to [[treeline]], as long as the land is well drained and shelter is available. The size and distribution of its burrow systems depend on the type of [[soil]] present: in areas with loose soil, it selects sites with supporting structures, such as tree roots or shrubs in order to prevent burrow collapse. Warrens tend to be larger and have more interconnected tunnels in areas with [[chalk]] than those in sand. In large coniferous plantations, the species only occurs on peripheral areas and along fire breaks and rides.<ref name=\"h206\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:European Rabbit, Lake District, UK - August 2011.jpg|thumb|right|European rabbit [[grazing]], [[Lake District]], [[UK]].]]\nThe European rabbit eats a wide variety of [[Herbs|herbage]], especially [[grass]]es, favouring the young, succulent leaves and shoots of the most nutritious species, particularly [[fescue]]s. In mixed cultivated areas, [[winter wheat]] is preferred over [[maize]] and [[dicotyledon]]s. During the summer period, the European rabbit feeds on the shortest, and therefore less nutritious grass swards, thus indicating that grazing grounds are selected through anti-predator considerations rather than maximising food intake. In times of scarcity, the rabbit increases its food intake, selecting the parts of the plant with the highest [[nitrogen]] content.<ref name=\"h207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=207}}</ref> Hungry rabbits in winter may resort to eating [[tree bark]]. [[Blackberry|Blackberries]] are also eaten, and captive-bred European rabbits have been fed on [[fodder]] consisting of [[furze]] and [[acorn]]s, which can lead to considerable weight gain.<ref name=\"b225\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=225}}</ref> The European rabbit is a less fussy eater than the brown hare: when eating [[root vegetable]]s, the rabbit eats them whole, while the hare tends to leave the peel.<ref name=\"hart6\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=6}}</ref> Depending on the body's fat and protein reserves, the species can survive without food in winter for about 2\u20138 days.<ref name=\"h207\"/> Although [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], cases are known of rabbits eating [[snail]]s.<ref name=\"b225\"/>\n\nLike other leporids, the European rabbit produces soft, mucus-covered faecal pellets, which are ingested directly from the [[anus]].<ref name=\"h207\"/> The soft pellets are produced posterior to the [[Large intestine|colon]] in the [[hind-gut]] soon after the excretion of hard pellets and the stomach begins to fill with newly-grazed food. The soft pellets are filled with [[protein]]-rich [[bacteria]], and pass down to the rectum in glossy clusters. The rabbit swallows them whole, without perforating the enveloping membrane.<ref name=\"l104\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref>\n\n===Predators===\n[[File:Stoat killing a rabbit.jpg|thumb|European rabbit attacked by a [[stoat]], [[Northumberland]], UK.]]\nThe European rabbit is prey to many different predatory species. [[Red fox|Fox]]es, [[dingo]]es, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[lynx]]es, [[wolverine]]s and [[dog]]s kill both adult and young rabbits by stalking and surprising them in the open. However, relatively few rabbits are caught this way, as rabbits can quickly rush back to cover with a burst of speed. Further, evidence from a study in Spain suggests they may avoid areas where the recent [[Feces|scat]] of predators which have eaten rabbit is detected.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Acta Ethologica|date=18 July 2018|pages=163\u2013168|title=European rabbits recognise conspecifics in their predators' diets|volume=21|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s10211-018-0295-6|last1=Prada|first1=Laura M.|last2=Guerrero-Casado|first2=Jos\u00e9|last3=Tortosa|first3=Francisco S.}}</ref> Both foxes and [[European badger|badger]]s will dig out kittens from shallow burrows, with the latter predators being too slow to catch adult rabbits.

In Helsinki region freed pet rabbits are considered pests.]]\nRecent research has shown that all European rabbits carry common genetic markers and descend from one of two maternal lines. These lines originated between 12,000 and 6.5 million years ago when glaciers isolated two herds; one on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the other in [[Southern France]]. It can be surmised that humans began hunting rabbits as a food source, but further research needs to be done to verify this. Little comprehensive evidence of the relationship of humans with European rabbits is documented until the medieval period.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Rabbit Domestication -- Western Europe |url= http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015632/http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |archivedate=2011-07-11}}</ref>\n\nHumans' relationship with the European rabbit was first recorded by the Phoenicians prior to 1000 [[Before Christ|BC]], when they termed the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'' (literally, the land of the [[hyraxes]]). This phrase closely resembles related [[modern Hebrew]]: ''I'' (\u05d0\u05d9) meaning island and ''shafan'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05df) meaning hyrax, plural ''shfan\u00edm'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd). Phoenicians called the local rabbits 'hyraxes' because rabbits resemble hyraxes in some ways, and hyraxes are native to [[Phoenicia]], unlike rabbits. Hyraxes, like rabbits, are not rodents. One theory states that the Romans converted the phrase ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'', with influence from the Greek ''Spania'', to its Latin form, ''[[Hispania]]'', which evolved in all the Iberian languages: into Castilian ''Espa\u00f1a'', Portuguese ''Espanha'', Catalan ''Espanya'' (English \"Spain\"), and such other variations in modern languages. The precise meaning of ''shafan'' remains unclear, but the balance of opinion appears to indicate that the hyrax is indeed the intended meaning.<ref name=\"shafan\">{{cite web |title=The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax, chapter 6 |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nLike the Phoenicians, neither the later [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] nor [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] colonizers had a specific name for the rabbit, because the species is not native to [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] (though it is present there nowadays). They commonly called it \"small hare\" and \"small digging hare\", in contrast to the [[European hare]], which is larger and doesn't make burrows. [[Catullus]] used the name ''cuniculus'' (a latinization of the [[Iberian culture|Iberian]] word ''kiniklos''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studylib.es/doc/5811443/origen-ib%C3%A9rico-del-conejo.|title=ORIGEN IB\u00c9RICO DEL CONEJO.|website=studylib.es}}</ref> and the etymological origin of the Castilian name ''conejo'', Portuguese ''coelho'' and Catalan ''conill'',<ref>Corominas, Joan & Jos\u00e9 A.

The first known mention of the rabbit as an invasive species (and possibly the first documented instance of an invasive species ever) was made in regard to the introduction of the rabbit to the [[Balearic Islands]] after the [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus|Roman conquest]] of the 1st century BCE. According to both [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], the multiplying rabbits caused famines by destroying crop yields and even collapsed trees and houses with their burrowing. The inhabitants petitioned [[Augustus]] for help, who sent troops to curb the rabbit population with the help of [[ferret]]s.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOther locations where the European rabbit was introduced include: [[Great Britain]] (by the Romans following their invasion in AD 43<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4439339.stm|title=Norfolk - Remains of Roman rabbit uncovered|work=BBC News|date=2005-04-13}}</ref>); the Hawaiian Islands of [[Laysan Island]] (in 1903) and [[Lisianski Island]]; Oceania's [[Macquarie Island]]; Washington state's [[Smith Island (Washington)|Smith Island]] and [[San Juan Island]] (around 1900 and later spreading to the other San Juan Islands); several islands off the coast of [[Southern Africa]] (including [[Robben Island]]); as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n[[File:Wild rabbit in grass.jpg|thumb|A feral rabbit on a farm in [[Victoria (Australia)]]]]\nTwenty-four specimens of the European rabbit were [[Rabbits in Australia|introduced to Australia]] in 1859 by estate owner [[Thomas Austin]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Their descendants multiplied and spread throughout the country thanks to the lack of natural predators, a conducive habitat (provided by widespread farming), and the mild Australian winters that allowed year-round breeding. Australia's native equivalent, the [[bilby]], was quickly pushed out by the invasive rabbit. (The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection.) Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense \"[[rabbit-proof fence]]\" to halt the westward expansion of the infestation. The European rabbit, however, can not only jump very high but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, the intentional introduction of a virus, ''[[Myxomatosis|Myxomatosis cuniiculi]]'', provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s necessary for the spread of the disease were not present. Myxomatosis can also infect pet rabbits (the same species). Today's remaining feral rabbits in Australia are largely immune to myxomatosis. A second deadly rabbit virus, [[rabbit hemorrhagic disease]] (RHD), has been cleared in Australia as a [[biological control]] agent and has already killed millions of the European rabbits there. RHD was also introduced&mdash;illegally&mdash; in New Zealand.\n[[File:Okunojima-rabbit.JPG|thumb|right|Feral rabbits on the island of [[\u014ckunoshima]]. A non-native species, rabbits were introduced to the island following [[World War II]] as part of the development of a park. The rabbits established a self-sustaining population on \u014ckunoshima in the latter half of the 20th century.]]\n\n===Domesticated rabbits===\n{{main|Domestic rabbit}}\nThe only rabbit to be widely [[domesticated]] is the European rabbit, which has been extensively domesticated for food or as a [[pet]]. It was first widely kept in [[ancient Rome]], where fetal rabbits were known as ''[[laurices]]'' and considered a delicacy, and has been refined into a [[List of rabbit breeds|wide variety of breeds]] during and since the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nDomesticated rabbits have mostly been bred to be much larger than wild rabbits, though [[selective breeding]] has produced a range sizes from \"dwarf\" to \"giant\", which are kept as food animals and pets across the world. They have as much color variation among themselves as other livestock and pet animals. Their fur is prized for its softness; today, [[Angora rabbits]] are raised for their long, soft fur, which is often spun into yarn. Other breeds are raised for the fur industry, particularly the [[Rex rabbit|Rex]], which has a smooth, [[velvet]]-like coat and comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes.\n\n===Conservation status===\n{{anchor|Status|reason=This subsection's name was changed from \"Status\" to \"Conservation status\" on 29 March 2018}} \nThough the European rabbit thrives in many of the locations where it was introduced, in its native Iberia, populations are dwindling.
