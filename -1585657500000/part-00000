The villains he encounters typically threaten his home of {{nihongo|Dream Land|\u30d7\u30d7\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9|Pupupu Rando|Pupupu Land}} on {{nihongo|Planet Popstar|\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Poppusut\u0101|Pop Star}}, most often the greedy King Dedede or the mysterious Meta Knight. The main games always have Kirby with the same basic abilities; he can walk, run, jump, float, and inhale and spit out or swallow his enemies. Following ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'', Kirby can gain the abilities of the enemies he swallowed, such as Fire, Sword, Fighter, and Cutter.\n\n===King Dedede===\n{{main|King Dedede}}\n{{nihongo|'''King Dedede'''|\u30c7\u30c7\u30c7{{ruby-ja|\u5927\u738b|\u3060\u3044\u304a\u3046}}|Dedede Dai\u014d}} is the [[archenemy]] of Kirby. He is a large [[penguin]]-like bird who serves as the monarch of Dream Land, carrying a large wooden mallet and is known to be self-centered; furthermore, Dedede causes many problems for the inhabitants of Dream Land through selfish mischief. Other times, his villainous acts are usually under the corrupting influences of other, more dangerous evils. Despite this, he is not truly evil, and has allied with Kirby several times to defeat a common enemy. Dedede has many of the same abilities as Kirby himself does, such as being able to inhale objects and spit them back out with tremendous force, and the ability to suck in air and fly.\n\nThe \"Revenge of the King\" game of ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'' introduces a harder version of King Dedede known as {{nihongo|'''Masked Dedede'''|\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30fb\u30c7\u30c7\u30c7|Masukudo Dedede}}, wearing a distinctive combat mask and wielding a giant mechanical hammer filled with multiple weapons. This version of Dedede returns in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'' after Dedede is brainwashed by the villain Taranza; and also appears as Dedede's Final Smash in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n===Meta Knight===\n{{main|Meta Knight}}\n{{nihongo|'''Meta Knight'''|\u30e1\u30bf\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Metanaito}} is an [[antihero]] character referred to as Kirby's rival, who sometimes fights with him for varying reasons, though they often arrive to the same goal. He always wears a grey-silver mask with only eye holes to see his two yellow glowing eyes, and under it, he looks almost exactly like Kirby, though with a blue body and white eyes, which appear yellow in ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'' and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. He wears a navy blue cloak that can transform into a set of wings, and he usually wields a special sword called the Galaxia Sword. Meta Knight is voiced by [[Atsushi Kisaichi]] in Japan, [[Eric Stuart]] in the English dub of the anime, and Eric Newsome in the English version of the [[Super Smash Bros. series|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]].\n\n===Bandana Waddle Dee===\n{{nihongo|'''Bandana Waddle Dee'''|\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30ca\u30ef\u30c9\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3|Bandana Wadorudi}}, sometimes simply called {{nihongo|'''Waddle Dee'''|\u30ef\u30c9\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3|Wadorudi}}, is a Waddle Dee who wears a blue bandana and is frequently seen wielding a spear. He first appeared in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' as the first opponent in the \"Megaton Punch\" minigame. In ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', he appears in the \"Revenge of the King\" game mode as King Dedede's right-hand man. Bandana Waddle Dee also appears in ''Kirby Super Star Ultra''{{'}}s \"The Arena\" mode as a joke boss. Beginning with ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', Bandana Waddle Dee transitioned into being an ally of Kirby and one of the game's four playable characters. He also assists Kirby in both ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'' and ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'' by providing him with items. In the side series, however, Bandana Waddle Dee appears as a playable character in ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'', in the single player mode of ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]'' (using a parasol instead of a spear), and as a Dream Friend in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\nIt is implied<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Kirby_JP/status/938241598281826305|title=\u30ab\u30d3\u30aa\u30b1\u901f\u5831\u3063\uff01 \u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u697d\u66f2\u516c\u958b\u3001\u7b2c\uff13\u5f3e\uff01\uff01 \u306a\u3093\u3068\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u300e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\uff01\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u306e\uff22\uff27\uff2d\u304c\u6b4c\u306b\u2026\uff1f\uff01 \u305d\u306e\u4ed6\u697d\u66f2\u3084\u9ad8\u97f3\u8cea\u306e\u8a66\u8074\u306f\u3001\u4e0b\u8a18\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3063\uff01 http://www.kirby.jp/25th/cd/\u00a0pic.twitter.com/vznEMaY5qU|last=\u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3|date=2017-12-05|website=[[Twitter]]|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> that \"The Apple Juice Song\" (a special arrangement of the Apple Scramble theme from ''Kirby Battle Royale'' made for the 25th anniversary of the series) is being sung by Bandana Waddle Dee in-universe. A rough translation of the song indicates that he is singing about getting stronger to be on par with Kirby in terms of power and skill (likely because of his defeat at his hands in \"Revenge of the King,\" or just out of admiration for him).\n\n==Main antagonists==\n===Nightmare===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nightmare kirby.png|thumb|right|150px|Nightmare, as seen in ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]''.]]  -->{{nihongo|'''Nightmare'''|\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2|Naitomea}}, also known as '''Cloaked Nightmare''',<ref name=\"Melee\">{{cite video game|title=Super Smash Bros. Melee|developer=HAL Laboratory|publisher=Nintendo|date=2001-12-03|platform=Nintendo GameCube}}</ref> is the final boss of ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'' and its remake, ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Rereleases|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]''. After Nightmare invades the miraculous Fountain of Dreams, [[List of Kirby characters#King Dedede|King Dedede]] splits up the Star Rod into seven pieces and gives them to his friends, preventing Nightmare from spreading bad dreams. Kirby, not knowing this, finds the pieces and reunites them. Nightmare is inadvertently freed, but Kirby ends up using it to defeat him. {{nihongo|'''Nightmare's Power Orb'''|\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6|Naitomea Paw\u0101 \u014cbu}} is his initial form that shoots stars, and he eventually transforms into a humanoid, vampire-like being with a tornado-like cloak for a body known as {{nihongo|'''Nightmare Wizard'''|\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2\u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9|Naitomea Wiz\u0101do}}.<ref name=\"Adventure\">{{cite video game|title=Kirby's Adventure|developer=HAL Laboratory|publisher=Nintendo|date=1993-05-01|platform=Nintendo Entertainment System}}</ref>\n\nNightmare is also the main villain of the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' anime. He runs '''NightMare Enterprises'''. He is given the name of '''eNeMeE''' in the English version. Depicted as having a more threatening persona than in the game, he is instead bent on conquering the universe, and dominates much of the universe from the series' beginning. He uses his ability to create an endless number of monsters to conquer civilizations. He also sells them to unsuspecting customers for a profit, via a transportation network. His only opposition are the Star Warriors and Galaxy Soldier Army, though they are wiped out before the series begins. He is an embodiment of life's fear and suffering, and so he strives to bring more pain to increase his power, and will always exist as long as people hold fear in their hearts. In the finale, he was destroyed by Kirby using the Star Rod.\n\nNightmare is voiced by [[Banjo Ginga]] in the Japanese version of the anime and by [[Andrew Rannells]] in the English dub.\n\nNightmare appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as an assist trophy, voiced by [[Hisao Egawa]].\n\nAn Another Dimension counterpart of Nightmare known as {{nihongo|'''Parallel Nightmare'''|\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2|Anaz\u0101 Naitomea|Another Nightmare}} appears as the main antagonist in the game ''Super Kirby Clash''. Parallel Nightmare is again voiced by [[Banjo Ginga]].\n\n===Dark Matter===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DarkMatterKirby.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dark Matter, as seen in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]''.]] -->\n{{nihongo|'''Dark Matter'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30bf\u30fc|D\u0101ku Mat\u0101}} is a cloud-like creature commonly appearing as a black orb covered in orange petal-like extensions and possessing a single red eye. It has been depicted as both a character and a species, the latter of which is generally known in Japanese as \u300c{{ruby-ja|\u9ed2|\u304f\u308d}}\u3044{{ruby-ja|\u96f2|\u304f\u3082}}\u300d (meaning \"black cloud\"). It is a force of negative energy that lives a lonely existence, and initially attacked Pop Star out of jealousy for Dream Land's lifestyle, seeking to recreate it into a dark world where no one can be happy. Dark Matter can possess other beings, putting them under its control.\n\nDark Matter makes its debut in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'' and possesses King Dedede. The Rainbow Drops extract it and reveal its form as a masked, robed being wielding a magical sword. After being defeated, it assumes its small orb form as it faces Kirby. In ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', a massive cloud of Dark Matter appears in the Pop Star sky and possesses many of its inhabitants. After aiding various creatures in need, Kirby eventually obtains the Love-Love Stick and enters the center of the cloud known as the Hyper Zone, and defeats Dark Matter once again. After its defeat, Kirby faces the leader of Dark Matter, a giant white creature with a single red eye known as {{nihongo|'''Zero'''|\u30bc\u30ed}}.\n\nDark Matter clouds return once more in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', where they invade Ripple Star for its Crystal. When the Crystal is shattered, Kirby sets out to reassemble the pieces on five other planets before confronting a Dark Matter creature called {{nihongo|'''Miracle Matter'''|\u30df\u30e9\u30af\u30eb\u30de\u30bf\u30fc|Mirakuru Mat\u0101}}. Its defeat repels Dark Matter from Ripple Star, but the Crystal detects and expels a powerful presence of Dark Matter from the queen, which goes on to form a new planet. In the core of this last world is {{nihongo|'''0\u00b2'''|\u30bc\u30ed\u30c4\u30fc|Zero Ts\u016b|Zero Two}}, presumably Zero's successor or a reincarnated version of it. It an angelic-looking form of Zero with a halo, a band-aid (confirming that Zero's eye shell from Dream Land 3 was a last-ditch effort and effectively hurt him in the process), segmented wings, and a green spiked tail.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', a Dark Matter-related being known as {{nihongo|'''Dark Nebula'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30bc\u30ed|D\u0101ku Zero|Dark Zero}} is the prisoner of a treasure chest which was originally in King Dedede's possession. Meta Knight realizes what is truly inside the treasure chest and suddenly steals it to prevent his release. Kirby, thinking his cake is inside, chases him to the ruins of the Halberd under the Secret Sea. Aboard the operational Halberd, the leader of the Squeaks, Daroach, manages to open the chest and releases him. However, Dark Nebula takes over his body and escapes to Gamble Galaxy. Kirby eventually fights Daroach again and Dark Nebula is forced out. Daroach relinquishes the Triple Star, a mystical rod. With his help, Dark Nebula is banished. Dark Nebula has two cameos in the base version of ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', where he appears as a transformation of the Stone ability, and as a [[Jack-in-the-box]] in one of Daroach's attacks; in the 4.0.0 update, it also appears in the \"\"Bad Boss Brothers\", where it is shown opposite 0\u00b2 and Zero among other final bosses.\n\nDark Matter makes small cameo appearances in ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'' and ''[[Kirby: Mass Attack]]''. A clone of Dark Matter in its ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'' form, dubbed {{nihongo|'''Dark Matter Clone'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u5263\u58eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30bf\u30fc|Kur\u014dn Kenshi D\u0101ku Mat\u0101|Clone Swordsman Dark Matter}} or '''Dark Matter Blade''', appears as an extra boss in ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''. It was created from an unknown source by the [[supercomputer]] Star Dream; however, it is noted that Star Dream was unable to fully replicate Dark Matter's powers, as he is unable to turn into his second form.\n\n===Marx===\n{{nihongo|'''Marx'''|\u30de\u30eb\u30af|Maruku}} is the final boss in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' and its remake. He is a round, lavender creature, similar to Kirby, but having no arms, wearing a jester hat, a bow tie, and brown shoes. He is frequently seen bouncing on a ball.\n\nIn the beginning of the sixth and final chapter, \"Milky Way Wishes\", Marx tells Kirby about how the Sun and Moon are fighting and that only the power of a giant mechanical creature called Nova can make them stop, sending Kirby on the adventure. Once Nova appears, Marx suddenly pushes Kirby out of the way and wishes for control over Pop Star. Explaining that he was the one who started the fight between the Sun and Moon in the first place, Marx then turns into a more powerful form of himself, which has fangs and strange yellow wings, before sending Nova on a collision course with Pop Star. As the Sun and Moon hold Nova back, Kirby rides a magical shooting Starship into Nova and disables its heart, then defeats Marx and sends him crashing into Nova to destroy them both. In ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', pieces of Nova fuse with Marx's dead body and revives him as the more powerful {{nihongo|'''Marx Soul'''|\u30de\u30eb\u30af\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb|Maruku Souru}}, the final boss of the new and most difficult mode \"The True Arena\" with a new design and improved attacks.\n\nHe makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', in an unlockable picture with other series villains. In ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', an arrangement of the music when Kirby is battling Marx in ''Kirby Super Star'' can be played on the Halberd stage. The final boss from this game, Tabuu, also shares some similar moves and pattern with Marx (both of them created by [[Masahiro Sakurai]]) In ''Kirby: Mass Attack'', he appears as the big boss of the \"Kirby Brawlball\" sub-game. In ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'', he makes a brief appearance in the crowd of the final Kirby Master 100% video, and if Kirby uses the Stone ability in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'', he will occasionally turn into a stone statue of Marx in his original form bouncing on his striped ball.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' as a playable Dream Friend, added through update 1.0.\n\nHe makes an appearance of the Kirby representative of the boss fights in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', through [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]'s, the [[Inkling (character)|Inkling]]'s, and [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina and Luma]]'s Classic Modes and also appears in World of Light.<br />\n\n===Dark Mind===\n{{nihongo|'''Dark Mind'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9|D\u0101ku Maindo}} is the main villain of ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', with Dark Meta Knight as his right-hand man. At the intro of the game, after Meta Knight rushes into the mirror world, Dark Meta Knight slices Kirby into four, unintentionally giving Kirby backup against the corrupted Mirror World. Throughout the game, Dark Meta Knight masquerades as the real deal and a timid \"Shadow Kirby\" also makes its appearance. Towards the end of the game, the original Meta Knight exposes the copy during the final confrontation. After Dark Meta Knight is shattered, the way to Dark Mind is open and sucks Kirby and Meta Knight's Master Sword. After Dark Mind is defeated, it is learned that he intended to make the Mirror World be overrun with a person's worst reflection of themselves; Shadow Kirby is actually an honest reflection of the real Kirby with no such qualities, and stays behind as the guardian of the Mirror World as Meta Knight lays his Master Sword to rest. In ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'' and ''Super Kirby Clash'', Dark Mind assumes the form of King Dedede as the game's final boss, named {{nihongo|'''King D-Mind'''|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0D\u30fb\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9|Kingu D-Maindo}}. Although he is the final boss in ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'', he is not in ''Super Kirby Clash''.\n\nDark Meta Knight is also a playable Dream Friend in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' update 3.0.0.\n\n===Drawcia===\n{{nihongo|'''Drawcia'''|\u30c9\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2|Doroshia}} is the villain of ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]''. She is an evil paint-[[Witchcraft|witch]] and a dangerous sorceress. She curses Kirby into a ball at the start of the game and turns Pop Star into paint. She has two forms: Drawcia Sorceress and Drawcia Soul. Her first, humanoid form, can shoot balls of energy at Kirby and summon enemies to damage him. Her second form resembles a blob of paint, and she has many paint-related techniques. When she is defeated, her curse is lifted and Pop Star and Kirby return to normal.\n\n===Yin-Yarn the Sorcerer===\n{{nihongo|'''Yin-Yarn'''|\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30dc\u30fb\u30a2\u30e2\u30fc\u30ec|Am\u012bbo Am\u014dre|Amiibo Amore}} is the main villain of ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'' and the remake, ''Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn''. He is an evil sorcerer who wreaks chaos and havoc in Dream Land and Patch Land. When Kirby tries to eat his Metatomato (thinking it's a Maxim Tomato), Yin-Yarn traps Kirby inside a sock that sends him to Patch Land, where Kirby's body transforms into yarn. A bit later, Kirby realizes that air goes through yarn, which forces him to use the yarn whip and transformations with yarn instead of his normal inhalation-based power. Later, Kirby learns about Yin-Yarn tearing Patch Land into seven pieces and stealing the magic yarn. In the game, Kirby must retrieve the magic yarn by defeating a boss. Yin-Yarn, after tearing Patch Land into seven pieces, he travels to Dream Land to wreak havoc there. So, to save both of their worlds, Kirby and Prince Fluff set off to recover seven pieces of yarn, defeat Yin-Yarn, and bring peace back to both Dream Land and Patch Land. Yin-Yarn is the boss of Dream Land and is fought in two forms: first, he attacks Kirby and Prince Fluff in his normal form. Secondly, he attacks them as Mega Yin-Yarn, leaving Kirby and Prince Fluff hopeless. Suddenly, Meta Knight flies by, dropping a Tankbot Metamortex, turning them into a Tankbot to fight and defeat this evil incarnation. Yin-Yarn's name is a pun on [[yin yang]]. Yin Yarn, like all of Patch Land's creatures, is made from yarn (considering the name, Yin-''Yarn''), and a button for a nose. He uses knitting needles for his evil schemes (which are mostly creating giant monsters and fake Waddle Dees to beat up King Dedede).\n\n===Necrodeus===\n{{nihongo|'''Necrodeus'''|\u30cd\u30af\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30b9|Nekurodiasu}} is the primary antagonist of ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]''. He is the leader of a group of [[demon]]s known as the Skull Gang. Upon appearing at the beginning of the game, Necrodeus casts a spell that splits Kirby into ten pieces and defeats all but one Kirby. Necrodeus has the ultimate goal of shrouding Popstar in darkness, but is defeated by Kirby in the final scenes. His name means \"Deathgod\" in Latin, a name that accurately describes his appearance and nature. As the final boss of ''Kirby Mass Attack'', he faces Kirby in two forms: first, Kirby must defeat his hands (similar to the Wham Bam Rock fight from ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''), next, Kirby must defeat him. Upon death, Necrodeus drops his magic staff, the source of his power, which Kirby uses to restore himself to normal.\n\n===Magolor===\n{{nihongo|'''Magolor'''|\u30de\u30db\u30ed\u30a2|Mahoroa}} appears in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', initially as a friendly character. He travels to Dream Land on an inter-dimensional ship called the Lor Starcutter. When the ship crash lands in Dream Land, Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Waddle Dee offer to help repair the Lor Starcutter so that he can return to a realm known as Halcandra - and as a reward for their efforts, Magolor brings Kirby and the group to Halcandra for a visit. When the group arrives, a large four-headed dragon known as Landia attacks and shoots down the Lor Starcutter for an unknown reason. Angry that they have been trapped, Magolor sends Kirby and the group to defeat Landia.\n\nIn truth, Magolor is a power-hungry villain who is secretly using the four to defeat Landia for him, so that he could obtain the Master Crown. The Master Crown grants limitless power to the wearer, and Landia is currently in possession of this crown. Magolor wishes to become the universe's ruling overlord, but he must gain the power to do so from the Master Crown. It is revealed that Magolor had fought and lost to Landia before, and in his escape attempt, he landed in Dream Land. After Landia is defeated by Kirby and the group, Magolor puts on the Master Crown and transforms into a giant floating entity with enormous power, then announces that he will conquer Planet Popstar as his \"reward\" to Kirby and his friends for their help. With help from Landia, Kirby chases Magolor into another dimension and sinks the Lor Starcutter, then battles Magolor himself. After his first defeat, Magolor is seemed to been destroyed. But, during a cutscene, it's revealed that the Master Crown took control of Magolor's body, and turned himself into Magolor Soul. After the second defeat, the crown is broken, and Magolor is taken into a portal, seeming to end his tyranny. \n\nMagolor returns in ''[[Kirby's Dream Collection]]'', revealed to be alive and reformed, where he builds Kirby a new playground as an apology for his actions in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]''.  Here, Kirby can play through new challenge stages, some of which he races against Magolor. During the races, he uses magic to summon enemies, as well as attack Kirby. His rivalry with Kirby still exists, albeit more friendly.\n\nAfter his appearance in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'', Magolor also has made cameo appearances in other games, including ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]] (as an 8 bit keychain)'', ''Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe'' (as an enemy, although he doesn't deal damage), ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'' (as a trophy), ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'' (as a sticker), and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' (as a spirit).\n\nHe appears as a playable character in the third update for ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n===Queen Sectonia===\n{{nihongo|'''Queen Sectonia'''|\u30af\u30a3\u30f3\u30fb\u30bb\u30af\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2|Kin Sekutonia|Queen Sectnia}} is the main villain of ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]''. She claims to be the ruler of the heavens, calling Dream Land the \"lower world\". Sectonia ruled over her land, Floralia, with an iron fist, resulting in the people of the sky to send out the Dreamstalk, which they hope would bring Kirby to their rescue. However, Queen Sectonia sent her trusted servant, Taranza, to intercept this plan by kidnapping the Hero of Dream Land. Taranza accidentally mistakes King Dedede for Kirby and kidnaps him. Kirby then pursues Taranza in an effort to rescue Dedede. Finally, Kirby corners Taranza in Royal Road, Queen Sectonia's palace. After defeating a possessed King Dedede, Taranza calls forth Queen Sectonia in an effort to save himself, but Queen Sectonia instead shoots him, calling him a \"pitiful fool.\" Kirby and Queen Sectonia do battle, with Kirby reigning victorious.\n\nIn a last ditch effort, the queen fuses herself with the Dreamstalk, with the intent of warping Popstar into her perfect vision. Kirby once again battles Sectonia, but ends up being captured. As the queen begins to strangle Kirby, Taranza returns with King Dedede. King Dedede frees Kirby, while Taranza gives Kirby a Miracle Fruit, allowing Kirby to become Hypernova Kirby. Kirby then inhales Queen Sectonia's laser blast before spitting it back at her, destroying her. In the extra mode Dededetour, she returns as {{nihongo|'''Queen Sectonia DX'''|\u30af\u30a3\u30f3\u30fb\u30bb\u30af\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2DX|Kin Sekutonia DX|Queen Sectnia DX}} and is fought by King Dedede.\n\nShe later returns in \"The True Arena\" where she consumes four Miracle Fruits turning her into {{nihongo|'''Soul of Sectonia'''|\u30bb\u30af\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2 \u30bd\u30a6\u30eb|Sekutonia Souru|Sectnia Soul}} and once again battles Kirby. After her defeat, however, she rips herself out of the Dreamstalk to battle Kirby one last time. After her defeat, she bursts into a shower of flower petals. One petal, which glowed larger than the others, fell slowly, giving note of the usage of how Star Dream was able to clone her.\n\nA clone of Sectonia appears in ''Kirby: Planet Robobot'' as an extra boss, created by Star Dream using a sample from Sectonia's flower form. It is more zombie-like in appearance than the original Sectonia, and upon defeat briefly shrinks down into a spider-like form similar to Taranza (possibly Sectonia's original form) before dying.\n\n===Dark Crafter===\n{{nihongo|'''Dark Crafter'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc|D\u0101ku Kurafut\u0101}} is the main antagonist of ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]''. He is a multicolored cloud-like creature with the strange urge to steal color from places, and possessed Claycia to fulfill these plans. But after Claycia was freed from his control, Dark Crafter became furious and decided to steal the colors himself. With help from Claycia, Kirby and Elline destroyed Dark Crafter causing him to explode.\n\n===President Haltmann===\n{{nihongo|'''President Haltmann'''|\u30d7\u30ec\u30b8\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Purejidento Harutoman|President Hartmann}}, full name {{nihongo|'''Max Profitt Haltmann'''|\u30b2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u30e0\u30fb\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Geinzu Inkamu Harutoman|Gains Income Hartmann}}, is an antagonist in ''Kirby: Planet Robobot''. As the President of Haltmann Works Company (HWC), Haltmann cares only about the prosperity of his company. To this end, he travels the galaxy in his giant spaceship, the Access Ark, and terraforms planets by stripping away their resources and converting them to giant mechanical fortresses. The plight of the natives do not interest Haltmann, whom he cruelly dismisses as \"savages\". At the end of the game, Kirby confronts Haltmann, who fights him in a custom-built Robobot Armor made of solid gold. After his defeat, Haltmann summons the Mother Computer, Star Dream, in his attempt to destroy Kirby, but Susie interrupts and tries to steal Star Dream. This backfires when Star Dream wakes up and uploads itself into Haltmann, possessing him and driving Star Dream to grant his wish of eternal prosperity for HWC by erasing everything else in existence. In \"The True Arena\", Star Dream's control over Haltmann becomes even stronger when Kirby fights its Core OS, erasing every last trace of Haltmann from its programming as Kirby disables and eventually destroys the rampaging computer.\n\nIn the \"Meta Knightmare Returns\" mode, he is faced by Meta Knight under the name {{nihongo|'''President Haltmann 2.0'''|Re:\u30d7\u30ec\u30b8\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Re:Purejidento Harutoman|Re:President Hartmann}}, once defeated, Star Dream awakens and tests Meta Knight who it acknowledges as the new admin.\n\nPause screen descriptions in \"Meta Knightmare Returns\" and \"The True Arena\" shed additional light on Haltmann's backstory. He originally built Star Dream from ancient technology and knowledge gained from an unknown source. During an experiment with it, President Haltmann's daughter Susanna disappeared. The belief that Susanna was dead drove Haltmann insane, and he continued constructing Star Dream to grant his wish of eternal prosperity for his company. This required significant amounts of natural resources, which eventually led HWC to Popstar.\n\n===Star Dream===\nA [[supercomputer]] built by the Haltmann Works Company (HWC), {{nihongo|'''Star Dream'''|\u661f\u306e\u5922|Hoshi no Yume}} is the true main villain and final boss of ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''. President Haltmann constructed it using ancient technology and knowledge from an unknown source. Much later, when Haltmann has been defeated by Kirby, the computer wakes up and consumes Haltmann's mind to become self-aware. Speaking through Haltmann's body, Star Dream reveals that it used the HWC and its business plan to study organic life throughout the universe. Having arrived at the conclusion that all organic life is an obstacle to prosperity and thus must be destroyed, Star Dream flies off into space and is pursued by Kirby, who has fused the Robobot Armor with the Halberd. After taking heavy damage in the ensuing dogfight, Star Dream connects itself to the HWC's mothership, the Access Ark, to continue fighting. Once the armored shell of the Access Ark is broken off, the true form of Star Dream is revealed - a clockwork star nearly identical to Nova, the comet used by Marx in ''Kirby Super Star''. In a final battle, Kirby manages to drill completely through Star Dream, presumably destroying it.\n\nIn the \"Meta Knightmare Returns\" mode, Star Dream requests that Meta Knight prove himself to it after Haltmann is defeated. For this purpose, it creates clones of Dark Matter and Sectonia. After these fail, it summons Galacta Knight through a space-time portal, but Galacta Knight destroys it himself before doing battle with Meta Knight.\n\nIn \"The True Arena\", the damage done by Galacta Knight ends up activating a hidden program within the computer transforming it into the more powerful {{nihongo|'''Star Dream Soul OS'''|\u661f\u306e\u5922.Soul OS|Hoshi no Yume.Soul OS|Star Dream.Soul OS}} who is fought as the final opponent of \"The True Arena\". Upon the defeat of its clockwork star form, however, the mechanical monstrosity pulls Kirby into itself. Inside, the true form of Star Dream Soul OS is revealed as an armored, mechanical heart like that of Nova. After being defeated, the heart makes one final attempt to destroy Kirby by firing immense waves of energy before finally exploding.\n\n===Hyness===\n{{nihongo|'''Hyness'''|\u30cf\u30a4\u30cd\u30b9|Hainesu|Hiness}} is an antagonist in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. He is the leader of a mysterious cult that worships Void Termina, and the commander of the three Mage-Sisters: Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne. He is abusive towards the Mage-Sisters despite their loyalty to him, with a particularly cruel bend toward Zan Partizanne, who adores him despite his not caring enough to even learn her name. His goal is to obtain the pieces of the Jamba Heart scattered throughout the galaxy and use them to resurrect Void Termina, who he refers to as his \"Dark Lord.\"\n\nKirby and his allies battle Hyness's forces every step of the way and eventually reach him at the altar within the Divine Terminus, where he has assembled the nearly complete Jamba Heart. To buy Hyness time, Zan Partizanne fights Kirby again but is beaten. Hyness then takes notice of the intruders, shoves Zan Partizanne aside and battles them himself, utilizing his dark magic in combat. When beaten, his cloak falls off, revealing his grotesque true appearance as a Purple and yellow-skinned creature with a huge nose and ears and bulging eyes. Hyness flies into a state of madness and summons the three Mage-Sisters, then places them under his control and uses them as zombified puppets to battle his enemies. Even this fails to defeat Kirby, however, and Hyness is left greatly weakened. Desperate to fulfill his goal and resurrect Void Termina, Hyness sacrifices himself and the Mage-Sisters to the Jamba Heart, giving the Dark Lord the energy it needs to awaken. All four are later seen trapped in fleshy cocoons within Void Termina's body, but are ejected during Kirby's battle with the creature. Hyness's whereabouts after this point are unknown.\n\nIn the \"Heroes in Another Dimension\" storyline, it is revealed that Hyness's prayers to summon Void Termina have caused time and space to break down at the Divine Terminus, and he has vanished into the alternate dimension. Once Kirby and his friends gather the four spears that once sealed the Jamba Heart, they find a new Jamba Heart at the alternate dimension's Divine Terminus. The spears cause the heart to shatter, releasing Hyness in a demonic new form dubbed {{nihongo|'''Corrupt Hyness'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30cf\u30a4\u30cd\u30b9|D\u0101kusaido Hainesu|Dark Side Hiness}}. In this form, Hyness's magic is much more powerful at the cost of destroying his already fragile mental state. Kirby's group ultimately manages to defeat him, only for the three Mage-Sisters to arrive too late to help him. In the storyline's good ending, the Mage-Sisters are saved by the power of Kirby's Friend Heart, and after Kirby leaves, Hyness turns back into his true self, allowing the Mage-Sisters to help him up and bring him back to their world.\n\n===Void Termina===\n{{nihongo|'''Void Termina'''|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30fb\u30cb\u30eb|Ende Niru|Ende Nil}}, also known as the \"Destroyer of Worlds,\" is the final boss of ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. It is an ancient being that has been reincarnated throughout the ages, and is worshipped by Hyness's cult. Long ago, Void Termina was sealed away by four warriors who used mystical spears that Hyness removed from the Jamba Heart at the beginning of the game's story. Because of an imperfection in the ritual, pieces of the Jamba Heart scatter throughout space, including on Popstar, where they possess Whispy Woods, King Dedede and Meta Knight. At Hyness's behest, the three Mage-Sisters search through space to recover the Jamba Heart pieces so Void Termina can be revived. Once Hyness sacrifices himself and the Mage-Sisters to the Jamba Heart, the seal is fully broken and Void Termina reawakens.\n\nInitially assuming a giant humanoid form, Void Termina battles Kirby and his allies in deep space. In this form, Void Termina can create massive shockwaves and wield giant swords that it can charge with elemental energy. To damage Void Termina, Kirby must use the Star Allies Sparkler to shoot an eye on Void Termina's body. Once the beast suffers enough damage, it collapses and its mask falls off, pulling the heroes into its body and forcing them to battle its core. Eventually, the core splits open, and Kirby and his allies are ejected from Void Termina's body. Void Termina rises again, sprouts giant wings, and becomes able to summon and use a variety of magical weapons. Like before, the eye that appears on its body is a weak spot, and after taking heavy damage it falls to the ground and pulls Kirby into itself again. This time, Void Termina's true form appears inside its body - an amorphous mass capable of taking on a number of forms and taking control of Kirby's allies, which can only be undone using a Friend Heart. At the end of the battle, Void Termina is finally destroyed in a clash between the Star Allies Sparkler and its Dark Matter form's laser.\n\nIn the Soul Melter difficulty of the Ultimate Choice sub-game, Void Termina's true form is dubbed {{nihongo|'''Void Soul'''|\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb \u30aa\u30d6 \u30cb\u30eb|Souru obu Niru|Soul of Nil}}. It is noted that the ancient scrolls written about Void Termina say that its reincarnations may be affected by positive or negative energy, leaving the possibility that Void Termina may one day return as a friend instead of an enemy. In Soul Melter EX, Void Termina's appearance changes once again, with its body turning black, its mask bearing glowing red eyes, and its innards becoming a color-shifting abyss. This form's full name is '''Void Termina, the True Destroyer of Worlds''' and its abilities are accordingly dramatically enhanced. In the final phase, a new entity simply named {{nihongo|'''Void'''|\u30cb\u30eb|Niru|Nil}} awakens inside its body. Nicknamed the '''Astral Birth''', it fights with all the powers of Void Soul but also incorporates techniques used by Dark Mind and Drawcia Soul.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n\n===Adeleine===\n{{nihongo|'''Adeleine'''|\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc\u30cc|Ador\u0113nu}} is an artist who came to Pop Star to study art. In ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', she appeared as one of the early boss characters taken over by Dark Matter. She is taken over and fights Kirby, and later joins with Kirby after he frees her. She has the ability to make her paintings real, either creating monsters while under the control of Dark Matter or providing Kirby with help.\n\nA nearly identical character named {{nihongo|'''Ado'''|\u30a2\u30c9}} plays a similar role in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3''. Some official sources suggest that Ado may simply be a nickname of Adeleine, but it has yet to be completely confirmed.\n\nAdeleine appears as a playable Dream Friend in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', with Ribbon supporting her.\n\n===Dyna Blade===\n{{nihongo|'''Dyna Blade'''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9|Daina Bureido}} is an enormous armored [[bird]] that acts as both a friend and a foe in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', and Kirby Super Star Ultra. In her self-titled game, she destroys all of Dream Land's crops to feed her chicks. Kirby defeats her, not knowing this, so he ends up feeding the chicks with apples and teaching them how to fly. In \"Revenge of Meta Knight\", Dyna Blade returns the favor by successfully carrying Kirby onto the Halberd before the artillery forces her to retreat.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'', Dyna Blade is shown as a legendary bird that is worshiped by the citizens of Cappytown. King Dedede hatches a plot to get rid of Kirby by tricking him into eating her egg, which infuriates Dyna Blade and causes her to chase and attack Kirby for much of the episode, until her chick appears and Kirby feeds it, placating Dyna.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', Dyna Blade appears in City Trial mode and sometimes flies to different parts of the city until flying away all together. The player can defeat Dyna Blade by aiming for her head to obtain multiple power ups. In ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'', a similar boss to Dyna Blade named Hot Wings appears as the boss of Hot Land.\n\nDyna Blade's most recent appearance has been in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', making a cameo in Dream Land's overworld map\n\n===Gooey===\n{{nihongo|'''Gooey'''|\u30b0\u30fc\u30a4|G\u016bi}} is a blue blob with a pair of eyes and a mouth. He first appears in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'' as a friend of Kirby that can be rescued from a holding bag (if Kirby is already with the animal partner that's inside it). Rescuing him at least once awards a single percentage point for 100% completion. There is also a female blob similar to Gooey that must also be rescued for 100%, though she appears more rarely.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'' expands on Gooey's character. He is revealed to be of the Dark Matter race, but chose to be Kirby's friend instead. He can be summoned by Kirby as a helper character similar to those in ''Kirby Super Star'', controlled by either the computer or a second player. Gooey's main form of offense is to snag enemies with his tongue and spit them out like Kirby does; he cannot capture multiple enemies like Kirby can, but can use his tongue underwater. Gooey can also copy abilities like Kirby, but only when a second player is controlling him. When flying in the Hyper Zone, Gooey assumes his Dark Matter form, though he still maintains his own face. He also appears in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' as a playable character through an update.\n\n===Yellow Kirby===\n{{nihongo|Yellow Kirby|\u30ad\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3|K\u012bbyi|Keeby}} is a yellow-colored Kirby whose Japanese name only officially appears in ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'' supplemental material. Only playable through multiplayer mode, Yellow Kirby is Kirby's rival to see who can get the most points in a race to get to the golf hole first. Yellow Kirby also appears as an optional costume for Kirby in the ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros. series]]''. In ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', Yellow Kirby is the second player in the game \"Gourmet Race\", racing against Kirby. In ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', Kirby can use spray paint to become a yellow Kirby.\n\n===Animal Friends===\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'' feature various allies that can team up with Kirby and share powers.\n\n''Kirby's Dream Land 2'' introduces:\n* {{nihongo|'''Rick'''|\u30ea\u30c3\u30af|Rikku}} - A brown and white hamster who can walk on ice without slipping. In ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'', Rick can also defeat enemies by jumping on them and climb walls, but he is the only animal partner who cannot inhale and must walk into enemies with his mouth open to eat them.\n* {{nihongo|'''Coo'''|\u30af\u30fc|K\u016b}} - A wise purple owl who can fly against strong winds.\n* {{nihongo|'''Kine'''|\u30ab\u30a4\u30f3|Kain}} - A blue fish who can swim against strong currents and allow Kirby to use his inhaling attack underwater.

He can roll Kirby up into a ball and roll him around, and can also perform double or triple-jumps and jump on foes to defeat them.\n* {{nihongo|'''Pitch'''|\u30d4\u30c3\u30c1|Pitchi}} - A small green bird who can perform powerful attacks when he has a Copy Ability. He can fly too, but not against strong winds.\n* {{nihongo|'''ChuChu'''|\u30c1\u30e5\u30c1\u30e5|Chuchu}} - A pink octopus who can cling to ceilings, but also weighs [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] down when he attempts to fly.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', when Kirby uses the Cutter/Stone Power Combo, he can randomly carve himself into a stone statue of his allies. Rick, Coo, and Kine also appear in the anime series ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'', and appear in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'' as one of Stone Kirby's transformations.\n\nRick, Coo, and Kine make a cameo in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'', as the background image in the minigame \"Kirby Quest\". They also appear in the ''Kirby Fighters'' mode of ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', appearing in Coo's Forest stage where they randomly appear and attack players indiscriminately. In ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', Rick, Coo, and Kine are a composite playable Dream Friend, while Nago, Pitch, and ChuChu appear in various attacks when Kirby uses the Cleaning ability.\n\n===Prince Fluff===\n{{nihongo|'''Prince Fluff'''|\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30d5|Furaffu|Fluff}} is a playable character who helps Kirby in ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'' and its 3DS remake. He is similar in appearance to Kirby, but is blue in color, has brown eyes, and wears a small golden crown. He and Kirby team up to recover seven pieces of magic yarn scattered throughout the land, defeat Yin-Yarn, and bring peace back to his home, Patch Land.\n\n===Ribbon===\n{{nihongo|'''Ribbon'''|\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3|Ribon}} is a pink-haired fairy from the planet Ripple Star who appears in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''. She is a kind and brave character who attempted to escape her planet with the fairies' magical Crystal when it was invaded by ''[[List of Kirby characters#Dark Matter|Dark Matter]]''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[https://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_N64//Manual/formated/Kirby_64-_The_Crystal_Shards_-_2001_-_Nintendo.pdf Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]'' instruction booklet, pgs. 4-6 ([[PDF]])</ref> In space, Dark Matter blobs ambushed her, shattered the crystal, and made her fall to Pop Star, where she lands on a stargazing Kirby and pleads with him for help.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Kirby agrees and they search for the Crystal shards scattered on various planets and thwart Dark Matter's invasion of Ripple Star along with ''[[List of Kirby characters#Waddle Dee|Waddle Dee]]'', ''[[List of Kirby characters#Adeleine|Adeleine]]'', and ''[[List of Kirby characters#King Dedede|King Dedede]]''. In the final battle, Ribbon and the crystal aid Kirby in defeating 0\u00b2, the controlling force behind Dark Matter. In the ending cutscene of the game, she gives Kirby a kiss, blushing shyly afterward. She later makes a cameo in ''Kirby: Planet Robobot'' as a sticker and later appears in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' as Adeleine's partner in an update.\n\n===Landia===\n{{nihongo|'''Landia'''|\u30e9\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2|Randia}} is a four-headed [[dragon]] from ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]''. According to the in-game description, he has protected the Master Crown and the Lor Starcutter since ancient times. Magolor attempted to steal the treasures he guarded, thus waking him up and forcing him into a rampage. Magolor fought against Landia himself to get it but lost, so he stole the Lor Starcutter and flew to Planet Popstar in hopes of finding someone useful to his plans. Magolor returned with Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight and Bandana Waddle Dee, and sicced all four on the dragon. After they defeated him, Magolor finally obtained the Master Crown and left to take over the galaxy starting with Popstar. Landia, as four smaller dragons, helped Kirby and company in their efforts to defeat Magolor. After Magolor's defeat, Landia and the Lor Starcutter help Kirby and the others escape from the closing void back to Popstar before returning home to Halcandra.\n\nHe is also the one-to-final boss in the sub-game \"Team Kirby Clash\" in ''Planet Robobot'', and his EX form, which is colored purple, is the final boss in the same game. He is also fought in the expanded standalone version of the sub-game, ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'' in the Empyrean, as well as his EX counterpart in the Decisive Battlefield. A parallel version of Landia also appears where Landia EX is fought, and the game confirms Landia's gender to be male.\n\n===Taranza===\n{{nihongo|'''Taranza'''|\u30bf\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6}} is a spider-like creature who appears in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]''. He hails from Floralia and is a retainer to Queen Sectonia. He was sent by Queen Sectonia to kidnap Kirby but kidnaps King Dedede instead.  Kirby then chases him up the Dreamstalk all the way to Royal Road, where he uses his hypnotic abilities to put King Dedede under his control. After Masked Dedede is defeated, he entreats Queen Sectonia to save him, but she does not: instead, she strikes him with a laser beam attack, prompting Taranza to switch allegiances after this betrayal. It is hinted in the in-game descriptions that Taranza used to be friends with Queen Sectonia but recently noticed some disturbing changes in her demeanor.\n\nIn ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'', Taranza is the main villain responsible for driving the inhabitants of the Dream Kingdom into disturbing the peace. After Kirby and his allies defeat him, he uses a magical mirror to summon dangerous monsters from another dimension. However, the game's ending reveals that the mirror was controlling Taranza the entire time, and he returns to being peaceful after it is destroyed. He is a playable character in the third update for ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n===Elline===\n{{nihongo|'''Elline'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc\u30cc|Er\u012bnu}} is a paintbrush-like fairy who appears in ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]''.

She is placed in charge of the project to take over Planet Popstar and convert it to a fully mechanized HWC planet. Kirby confronts Susie at several points, initially as a boss who fights in a custom-built Robobot Armor, and later to summon Meta Knight and King Dedede, both having been captured and experimented on during the invasion and turned into servants of HWC. In the final level, Access Ark, President Haltmann fires Susie for her repeated failures. After Kirby and Haltmann fight, Susie suddenly reveals that she's a corporate spy and attempts to steal Star Dream with the intent to sell it to the highest bidder, but Star Dream wakes up during the scuffle and begins its rampage. Susie gives Kirby a Robobot Armor and begs him to stop Star Dream, after which she escapes to unknown whereabouts.\n\nIn the \"Meta Knightmare Returns\" mode, new information about Susie and her relationship with Haltmann is revealed via the Pause screen. Her full name is {{nihongo|'''Susanna Patrya Haltmann'''|\u30b9\u30b6\u30f3\u30ca\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Suzanna Famiria Harutoman|Susanna Familia Hartmann}}.

It has a witch-like appearance, but possesses no ranged attacks: it often walks in one direction, sweeping the floor with its broom as it goes, and sometimes changing directions should it draw near to the edge of a platform.

It has yellow eyes garbed in a pink cloak and limbless, orange hands that float in front of it. Madoo is always seen floating in the air and attacking by shooting down dark blasts.

It is a round sleeping enemy which, if inhaled by Kirby, transforms him into Sleep Kirby. This ability is useless, as all it does is make Kirby sleep for a few seconds before he wakes up and it vanishes.\n\nIn the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya]]'' episode \"The Pillow Case\", there were Noddies in the pillowcases that the Cappies purchased from King Dedede which induced nightmares revolving around Kirby. The pillows were destroyed by Meta Knight and the Noddies end up running. In \"Flower Power\", King Dedede tricks Kirby into inhaling a Noddy which causes Kirby to fall asleep.

In ''Kirby Super Star'', attacking a Scarfy with a strong enough attack will cause it to explode instantly. In games before this, any attack other than inhaling will trigger this reaction.\n\nIn the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' episode \"Dedede's Pet Threat\", King Dedede buys four Scarfys from NightMare Enterprises. Their appetites made King Dedede bankrupt and he ended up releasing the Scarfies. While in the wild, the Scarfies started eating the animals and reproducing. The Scarfies then ate the bones given to them by NightMare Enterprises which gave them the ability to assume their angry form. This caused a Scarfy army to form overnight that only Hammer Kirby could stop. In the end, King Dedede was forced to keep and take care of the Scarfies.\n\n===Scoopy===\n{{nihongo|'''Scoopy'''|\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30d4\u30a3|Suk\u016bp\u012b}} is a white and periwinkle giant squid with black eyes, six arms, and a lip-like muzzle around its mouth that appears in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]''.\n\n===Shotzo===\n{{nihongo|'''Shotzo'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30c4\u30a9|Shattso}} is an invincible and immobile black cannon.

In the anime, he is King Dedede's right-hand man as the leader of Waddle Dee troops and gives orders under King Dedede's commands. If swallowed by Kirby in most ''Kirby'' games, Kirby is given the Beam ability and is able to shoot powerful beams at foes. Waddle Doo first appeared in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'', and has since then been consistent in his appearance in ''Kirby'' games. In ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', Waddle Doo only appeared as a version of Waddle Dee possessed by [[List of Kirby characters#Dark Matter|Dark Matter]].\n\n===Walky===\n{{nihongo|'''Walky'''|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc|W\u014dk\u012b}} is a walking [[microphone]] that is a recurring enemy in the ''Kirby'' franchise.

It appears as a boss of the game modes \"The Great Cave Offensive\" and \"Milky Way Wishes\". It behaves like a malfunctioning [[role-playing game]] with turn-based events where if the enemy turns, Kirby cannot harm them and the enemies do not attack in Kirby's turn. In \"The Great Cave Offensive\", Computer Virus uses Slime, [[Puppet]], and [[Magician (fantasy)|Magician]] to attack Kirby. For \"Milky Way Wishes\", Computer Virus uses Magician, Evil [[Knight]], and Great [[Dragon]] to attack Kirby.\n\n===Fatty Whale===\n{{nihongo|'''Fatty Whale'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fb\u30db\u30a8\u30fc\u30eb|Fatti Ho\u0113ru}} is a boss in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' and its remake.

His first appearance is in ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', as the final boss of \"Meta Knightmare Ultra\". He performs unusual attacks with his sword, consisting of swipes, tornadoes, and energy blasts. He appears when Meta Knight, done with his training, wishes to the reformed Nova to fight the strongest warrior in the galaxy. Nova grants this by allowing a challenge with Galacta Knight, who is said by Nova to have been sealed away in ancient times for fear that his power was too great. He has a white mask with a plus sign on it and a hot pink body. His eyes are red and glow just like Meta Knight's, except Galacta Knight's eyes are more rectangular. He wields a purple lance with a white shield that has a purple cross on the front. As for his wings, they are angel-like and glow white. He must also be faced in \"The True Arena\", in which he is one of the Final Four and is fought as the penultimate boss.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', fought right before Magolor EX in that game's own \"The True Arena\" mode as a secret boss. In the Meta Knightmare sub-game of ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'', Star Dream summons Galacta Knight as Meta Knight's final opponent, but Galacta Knight destroys Star Dream before fighting Meta Knight again. In ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', Galacta Knight appears as the apparent final boss of the Guest Star ???? Star Allies Go! sub-game. However, before the fight with him can begin, a butterfly lands on his lance and merges with him, creating the being known as {{nihongo|'''Morpho Knight'''|\u30d0\u30eb\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Barufureinaito|Burfley Knight}}. Wielding a pair of butterfly-themed swords, Morpho Knight is capable of many of the same techniques as Galacta Knight, and can also teleport and create waves of energy that corrupt the player's partners. Additionally, many of his attacks are imbued with fire, making him an even greater threat. Upon his defeat, Morpho Knight is bathed in a heavenly light and vanishes into a cloud of butterflies and hearts.\n\nGalacta Knight again appears as the final boss in the game ''Super Kirby Clash'' where he was summoned by Parallel Nightmare to beat Team Kirby. Here he is known as the {{nihongo|'''Aeon Hero'''|{{ruby-ja|\u6df5\u6e90|\u3048\u3093\u3052\u3093}}\u3092{{ruby-ja|\u5de1|\u3081\u3050}}\u308b{{ruby-ja|\u82f1\u96c4|\u3048\u3044\u3086\u3046}}|Engen o Meguru Eiy\u016b|Origin-Revolving Hero}}.\n\n===Grand Doomer===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Grand Doomer'''|\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc|Gurando R\u014dp\u0101|Grand Lowper}} is the ruler or master of all Sphere Doomers. He appears in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'' as a main boss when beating planet Popstar. He is much more advanced than the miniature Sphere Doomers because of its health and attack. The Grand Doomer is golden with dark red eyes and is very shiny. He is faced against Kirby in \"The Arena\" and Nutty Noon. He has a bunch of attacks familiar to \"Dyna Blade\". His attacks are laying or spreading fireballs or hiding in shadows or black holes then popping out at the player. The Grand Doomer is also the Boss carries the last piece to Magolor's ship, which is the mast.\n\n===Heavy Lobster===\n{{nihongo|'''Heavy Lobster'''|\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Heb\u012b Robusut\u0101}} is a strong mechanical [[lobster]]-like monster that appears in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''. It attacks Kirby multiple times during his assault on the Halberd. In the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' episode \"Combat Kirby\", Heavy Lobster is one of Nightmare's strongest creations.

It also reappears in ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'' and ''Super Kirby Clash'' as a boss.\n\nIn the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' episode \"Dedede's Snow Job\", King Dedede orders Ice Dragon from NightMare Enterprises in order to combat the heat wave in Cappy Town. Kirby, Tiff, and Tuff later find the Ice Dragon in its mature state where it ends up attacking Chilly. Kirby becomes Ice Kirby and freezes the Ice Dragon from within. Once the Ice Dragon is destroyed, all the snow and Chilly begins to melt. In \"Labor Daze\", King Dedede uses the Cappies that he enlisted to work at his newly built factory to build a robot replica of the Ice Dragon. Ice Kirby freezes the factory's boiler enough to destroy the Ice Dragon Robot and the factory with the destroyed environment also being restored.\n\n===Kabula===\n'''Kabula''', also known as {{nihongo|'''Kaboola'''|\u30ab\u30d6\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc|Kab\u016br\u0101}}, is King Dedede's blimp, who appears as a boss in some games. She has the ability to fire cannonballs and barrel-roll at Kirby, and Kirby must shoot her down by firing projectiles (air pellets in ''Kirby's Dream Land'', the Starship in ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', and in the Robobot Armor's Jet Mode in'' Kirby: Planet Robobot''.\n\n===Kracko===\n{{nihongo|'''Kracko'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Kurakko}} is a boss that first appears in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. He resembles a large [[cumulus cloud]] with spikes protruding from all sides, and a single large eyeball in the center. He attacks with electricity, rain, and by producing smaller enemies, such as Waddle Doos. Kracko is typically first seen in a weaker form, sometimes called {{nihongo|'''Kracko Jr.'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3Jr.|Kurakko Junia}}. Its characteristic eye remains, but he is surrounded by four balls, which it either spins slowly or launches at Kirby. It usually drops Waddle Doos or bombs at Kirby. This form either fights as a mini-boss earlier in various games, or immediately prior to transforming to his \"adult\" form. Kracko is slightly different in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' (''Ultra'') in that Kracko Jr. and Kracko are two separate bosses. In ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'', an illusion of Kracko in his adult form is drawn up and brought to life by Ado to fight for her, and is the last monster to be drawn. Kracko returns in the ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' game mode \"Revenge of the King\" as {{nihongo|'''Kracko Jr.'s Revenge'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3Jr. \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Kurakko Junia Ribenji}} and {{nihongo|'''Kracko's Revenge'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3 \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Kurakko Ribenji}}, each with purple [[sclera]]s and dark grey cloud-parts.\n\nKracko appears in the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' episode \"Dark and Stormy Knight\" where it appears as a monster purchased by King Dedede from NightMare Enterprises to defeat Kirby. For most of the episode, Kracko appeared as a storm cloud that shot lightning throughout Cappytown. But when Kirby flew inside it, Kracko shot electric sword beams at Kirby, giving him the Sword ability. Kirby shot five sword beams back with the last one splitting Kracko in half. Kracko was shown the same way it is in the games.\n\nKracko is also a surprise boss in ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]''. Unlike most bosses in ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'', Kracko is not a mirror copy, but has no copy and is the original boss. In ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', a gray, robot version called {{nihongo|'''Mecha Kracko'''|\u30e1\u30ab\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Meka Kurakko}} appears as a boss.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', Kracko returns as a boss, encountered in Old Odyssey. According to its in-game description, it has made Floralia part of its territory and is being fed by a mysterious power source, making its attacks stronger than ever before. In Dededetour, King Dedede fights {{nihongo|'''Kracko DX'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3 DX|Kurakko DX}}, Kracko's stronger form.\n\nIn ''Kirby: Planet Robobot'', a solid hologram of Kracko appears as one of the four bosses summoned by the Holo Defense API, and is known as {{nihongo|'''Holo-Kracko'''|\u30db\u30ed\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Horo Kurakko}}.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', Kracko can split into two clouds known as {{nihongo|'''Twin Kracko'''|\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Tsuin Kurakko}}. Both clouds fight against Kirby and his allies after the original Kracko is defeated.\n\n===Lololo & Lalala===\n{{nihongo|'''Lololo & Lalala'''|\u30ed\u30ed\u30ed&\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9|Rororo to Rarara}} appear once as the second boss fight in ''Kirby's Dream Land'', where they push objects in an attempt to hurt Kirby. They appear to be parodies of Lolo and Lala, the protagonists of HAL's ''[[Eggerland]]'' series of games.\n\nThey also appear in ''Kirby Super Star'' game mode \"Spring Breeze\" as bosses, and in the ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' game mode \"Revenge of the King\", they return as {{nihongo|'''Lololo & Lalala's Revenge'''|\u30ed\u30ed\u30ed&\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9 \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Rororo to Rarara Ribenji}}.\n\nThey appear in the anime as friendly characters, where they are known as '''Fololo & Falala''' in the English dub, and they reside in King Dedede's castle. They are originally a single monster created by NightMare Enterprises called {{nihongo|'''Fofa'''|\u30ed\u30e9|Rora|Lola}}, but it is split into two by Slice n' Splice and sent to Dedede at the suggestion to the N.M.E. Sales Guy by Nightmare. In the Japanese version of the anime, Lololo is voiced by Chiro Kanzaki and Lalala is voiced by Madoka Akita. In the English dub, they are both voiced by [[Tara Sands|Tara Jayne Sands]].\n\n===Meta-Knights===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Meta-Knights'''|\u30e1\u30bf\u30ca\u30a4\u30c4|Meta-Naitsu}} are an army led by [[List of Kirby characters#Meta Knight|Meta Knight]], who often uses them to test Kirby's skills throughout [[Kirby's Adventure]], which is their first appearance. The Meta-Knights include {{nihongo|'''Axe Knight'''|\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Akkusunaito}}, {{nihongo|'''Mace Knight'''|\u30e1\u30a4\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Meisunaito}}, {{nihongo|'''Javelin Knight'''|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d9\u30ea\u30f3\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Jaberinnaito}}, and {{nihongo|'''Trident Knight'''|\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Toraidentonaito}}. They are four distinct armored soldiers that each wield the weapon they are named after. The Meta-Knights return prominently in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', where they aided Meta Knight in his attempt to conquer Dream Land via his armored airship, the Halberd. They also appeared in some other game modes, also fighting as a team. A version of them can also be summoned by Galacta Knight.\n\n===Mr. Shine & Mr. Bright===\n{{nihongo|'''Mr. Shine & Mr. Bright'''|\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30f3&\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8|Misut\u0101 Shain & Misut\u0101 Buraito}} are tag-team bosses first appearing in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]''. Mr. Shine appears as a crescent [[moon]] with a face and limbs, while Mr. Bright is a [[sun]] with similar features. One always stays in the air, raining down projectiles, while the other attacks from the ground. One of their most lethal attacks is when they create a solar eclipse: Mr. Bright will blast the area with flames while Mr. Shine creates a patch of shadow, which is the only safe spot. They return as drawings come to life in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]''. In ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', similar entities are the Sun and the Moon of Pop Star, who literally fought day and night in \"Milky Way Wishes\" due to a misunderstanding caused by Marx. In the anime, a monster named Slice n' Splice uses moon- and sun-shaped staffs to split and paste his enemies. Presumably, this was a nod to Mr. Shine & Mr. Bright. They also appear in ''Kirby Mass Attack'' on Strato Patrol EOS mode.\n\n===Paintra===\n{{nihongo|'''Paintra'''|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30a2|Peinshia|Paincia}} is a mysterious paint [[Witchcraft|witch]] who appears as a boss in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]''. She has paintbrushes for legs (which she can combine into one paintbrush) and uses many paint based attacks. Some examples of her attacks include one where she paints over the screen, making seeing her more difficult, and one where she rains down paint across the arena. Her pause screen description speaks of a painting that depicted two sisters who were separated at birth. This painting hung unnoticed in a painter's studio for many years but later became sentient and vowed revenge. She is encountered in Lollipop Land. She also has a more vicious form known as {{nihongo|'''Paintra DX'''|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30a2 DX|Peinshia DX|Paincia DX}}, which is battled in \"Dededetour\" and \"The True Arena\".\n\n===Paint Roller===\n{{nihongo|'''Paint Roller'''|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc|Peinto R\u014dr\u0101}} appears as a boss in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', and ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]''. It wears a baseball cap and roller skates, and it is capable of drawing enemies that come to life. It appears in the anime as a monster bought by Dedede to fight Kirby.\n\n===Pon & Con===\n{{nihongo|'''Pon & Con'''|\u30dd\u30f3&\u30b3\u30f3|Pon to Kon}} are a raccoon and fox, respectively, that appear as bosses in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'' and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. In the latter, they have stronger versions called {{nihongo|'''Goldon & Silvox'''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30f3&\u30b7\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b9|G\u014drudon to Shirubakkusu}}.\n\n===Poppy Bros. Jr. & Poppy Bros. Sr.===\n{{nihongo|'''Poppy Bros. Jr'''|\u30dd\u30d4\u30fc\u30d6\u30ed\u30b9Jr.|Pop\u012b Burozu Junia}}. is an [[elf]]-like enemy seen in many games. They may either be unarmed, throw bombs, or throw boomerangs, and are sometimes found balancing on apples, Maxim Tomatoes, or riding on a mount.  He is the Helper assigned to the Bomb ability in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' and ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]''. {{nihongo|'''Poppy Bros. Sr.'''|\u30dd\u30d4\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30baSr.|Pop\u012b Buraz\u0101zu Shinia}} serves as a boss and is a larger version of the Bomb-wielding Poppy Bros. Jr. They sometimes give Kirby the Bomb or Cutter ability, though most often the former. Poppy Bros. Jr. also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' as a monster in training.\n\n===Pyribbit===\n{{nihongo|'''Pyribbit'''|\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30b2\u30ed\u30e0|Vorugeromu|Volgerom}} is a giant [[frog]] enemy who appears as a boss in [[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]. He lives in volcanic environments, and mainly uses fire and lava based attacks in battle such as fire breath or lava pillars that race towards the platform Kirby stands on. He is found in Endless Explosions and has a more powerful form called {{nihongo|'''Pyribbit DX'''|\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30b2\u30ed\u30e0 DX|Vorugeromu DX|Volgerom DX}}, fought in \"Dededetour\" and \"The True Arena\".\n\n===Squeak Squad===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Squeak Squad'''|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c1\u30a7\u56e3|Dorocche Dan}}, also called the '''Squeaks''', are an [[infamy|infamous]] band of thieves who are the villains in ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]''. When Kirby's cake disappears, Kirby thinks King Dedede took it, but he then finds out the Squeaks stole his cake. Kirby follows the Squeaks throughout the game trying to get his cake back. The Squeaks also stole a treasure chest which Kirby thinks has his cake inside. Kirby has to fight {{nihongo|'''Daroach'''|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c1\u30a7|Dorocche}}, leader of the Squeaks, at the end of World 6. Once Daroach is beaten, Meta Knight comes out of nowhere and takes the chest. Kirby follows Meta Knight throughout World 7. At World 7's end Kirby fights Meta Knight for the chest. Once Kirby beats Meta Knight, he takes the chest, but the Squeaks come and take it from him. Daroach opens the chest, but instead of the cake, he finds a dark cloud that grabs him. Kirby chases after the cloud in World 8, and eventually fights Dark Daroach. Once Kirby beats it, the dark cloud lets out Daroach. It floats away as a small, black star. Kirby follows the star until it becomes its true form, a dark star called Dark Nebula. Using the Triple Star Rod Daroach gave him, Kirby defeats Dark Nebula. Once Dark Nebula is beaten, the player beats ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. The ending shows Kirby flying back home wondering where his cake went. The Squeaks give Kirby his cake back as an apology for the trouble they put Kirby into. It turns out Meta Knight didn't give Kirby the chest because he didn't want Kirby to let out Dark Nebula.\n\nThe Squeaks later appear in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'', where Daroach gives Kirby hints on where medals are.\n\nDaroach is a playable Dream Friend in ''Kirby Star Allies'', and the other Squeaks show up in some of his attacks.\n\n===Wham Bam Rock===\n{{nihongo|'''Wham Bam Rock'''|\u30ef\u30e0\u30d0\u30e0\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Wamu Bamu Rokku}} first appeared in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', and resembled a tribal head with two floating stone hands. Its motives are unknown, and it appeared as both the final boss of The Great Cave Offensive and as a normal boss character in \"Milky Way Wishes\". In ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', it was redesigned to look less organic, though some aspects of its previous design were incorporated into a stronger variant named {{nihongo|'''Wham Bam Jewel'''|\u30ef\u30e0\u30d0\u30e0\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30eb|Wamu Bamu Jueru}}. Wearing a jeweled crown with swinging [[diamond]] earrings, fangs, and three eyes, it serves as the final boss in the \"Helper to Hero\" boss rush along with Wham Bam Rock. Kirby must also defeat his standalone self as the second of the final four bosses in \"The True Arena\". One of his attacks is a reference to the [[finger gun]], in which he points at Kirby and fires. Wham Bam Rock is possibly the inspiration for Master Hand in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n===Whispy Woods===\n{{nihongo|'''Whispy Woods'''|\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30a6\u30c3\u30ba|Wisup\u012b Uzzu}} is a large apple tree whose most common attack is dropping apples from his branches. He generally appears as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]], usually the first one in many ''Kirby'' games and the first boss to appear in the ''Kirby'' series. Also, in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' (and [[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|its remake]]) there exists a related pair of creatures named {{nihongo|'''Twin Woods'''|\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30a6\u30c3\u30ba|Tsuin Uzzu}}, and they can be found in Milky Way Wishes, Revenge of Meta Knight, Meta Knightmare Ultra, The Arena, and Helper to Hero. In \"Revenge of the King\", Whispy Woods comes back as {{nihongo|'''Whispy's Revenge'''|\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30a6\u30c3\u30ba \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Wisup\u012b Uzzu Ribenji|Whispy Woods Revenge}}. This time, its leaves are purple and it can drop poisonous apples and worms. It can also drop Gordos like Twin Woods, and shoot gusts of wind and small twisters.\n\nWhispy makes appearances in the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]].

After most of the forest is cut down, it is revived by one of Whispy's apples. Dedede continues to constantly try to build his golf course during the series while Whispy becomes Kirby's ally.

When Dedede and Escargoon meet him in person, they decide to get revenge on the Sales Guy for all the trouble he gave them by feeding him Chef Kawasaki's horrid cooking.\n\nAlthough he is considered an anime-only character, the Sales Guy appears in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'' in the sub-game Strato Patrol EOS at the game over screen.\n\nThe Sales Guy is voiced by [[Banjo Ginga]] in the original version and by [[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] in the English Dub.\n\n===Monsters===\n{{expand section|date=November 2012}}\n{{nihongo|'''Monsters'''|\u9b54\u7363|Maj\u016b}} are the fiendish creatures in the anime.

Max Flexer is then purchased to help them burn off the fat, but Max's real motive is to destroy Kirby while he is too fat to inhale. After spitting out the chips to lose the excess weight, Kirby inhales Max's headset microphone and becomes Mike Kirby, whose singing destroys the monster and much of Dedede's castle. Max Flexer also appears in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'' as an enemy in the \"Kirby Quest\" sub-game, making him the first anime monster to appear in a ''Kirby'' game.\n* {{nihongo|'''Head Cold Monsters'''|{{ruby-ja|\u98a8\u90aa|\u304b\u305c}}\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u30b9{{ruby-ja|\u9b54\u7363|\u307e\u3058\u3085\u3046}}|Kaze Wirusu Maj\u016b|Cold Virus Monster}} - Microscopic cold monsters appearing in \"Something to Sneeze At\".

The main games always have Kirby with the same basic abilities; he can walk, run, jump, float, and inhale and spit out or swallow his enemies. Following ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'', Kirby can gain the abilities of the enemies he swallowed, such as Fire, Sword, Fighter, and Cutter.\n\n===King Dedede===\n{{main|King Dedede}}\n{{nihongo|'''King Dedede'''|\u30c7\u30c7\u30c7{{ruby-ja|\u5927\u738b|\u3060\u3044\u304a\u3046}}|Dedede Dai\u014d}} is the [[archenemy]] of Kirby. He is a large [[penguin]]-like bird who serves as the monarch of Dream Land, carrying a large wooden mallet and is known to be self-centered; furthermore, Dedede causes many problems for the inhabitants of Dream Land through selfish mischief. Other times, his villainous acts are usually under the corrupting influences of other, more dangerous evils. Despite this, he is not truly evil, and has allied with Kirby several times to defeat a common enemy. Dedede has many of the same abilities as Kirby himself does, such as being able to inhale objects and spit them back out with tremendous force, and the ability to suck in air and fly.\n\nThe \"Revenge of the King\" game of ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'' introduces a harder version of King Dedede known as {{nihongo|'''Masked Dedede'''|\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u30c9\u30fb\u30c7\u30c7\u30c7|Masukudo Dedede}}, wearing a distinctive combat mask and wielding a giant mechanical hammer filled with multiple weapons.

He wears a navy blue cloak that can transform into a set of wings, and he usually wields a special sword called the Galaxia Sword.

In the side series, however, Bandana Waddle Dee appears as a playable character in ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'', in the single player mode of ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]'' (using a parasol instead of a spear), and as a Dream Friend in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\nIt is implied<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Kirby_JP/status/938241598281826305|title=\u30ab\u30d3\u30aa\u30b1\u901f\u5831\u3063\uff01 \u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u306e\u697d\u66f2\u516c\u958b\u3001\u7b2c\uff13\u5f3e\uff01\uff01 \u306a\u3093\u3068\u3001\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u300e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\uff01\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u306e\uff22\uff27\uff2d\u304c\u6b4c\u306b\u2026\uff1f\uff01 \u305d\u306e\u4ed6\u697d\u66f2\u3084\u9ad8\u97f3\u8cea\u306e\u8a66\u8074\u306f\u3001\u4e0b\u8a18\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u3063\uff01 http://www.kirby.jp/25th/cd/\u00a0pic.twitter.com/vznEMaY5qU|last=\u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3|date=2017-12-05|website=[[Twitter]]|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> that \"The Apple Juice Song\" (a special arrangement of the Apple Scramble theme from ''Kirby Battle Royale'' made for the 25th anniversary of the series) is being sung by Bandana Waddle Dee in-universe.

After Nightmare invades the miraculous Fountain of Dreams, [[List of Kirby characters#King Dedede|King Dedede]] splits up the Star Rod into seven pieces and gives them to his friends, preventing Nightmare from spreading bad dreams. Kirby, not knowing this, finds the pieces and reunites them. Nightmare is inadvertently freed, but Kirby ends up using it to defeat him. {{nihongo|'''Nightmare's Power Orb'''|\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30aa\u30fc\u30d6|Naitomea Paw\u0101 \u014cbu}} is his initial form that shoots stars, and he eventually transforms into a humanoid, vampire-like being with a tornado-like cloak for a body known as {{nihongo|'''Nightmare Wizard'''|\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2\u30a6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9|Naitomea Wiz\u0101do}}.<ref name=\"Adventure\">{{cite video game|title=Kirby's Adventure|developer=HAL Laboratory|publisher=Nintendo|date=1993-05-01|platform=Nintendo Entertainment System}}</ref>\n\nNightmare is also the main villain of the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' anime. He runs '''NightMare Enterprises'''. He is given the name of '''eNeMeE''' in the English version. Depicted as having a more threatening persona than in the game, he is instead bent on conquering the universe, and dominates much of the universe from the series' beginning. He uses his ability to create an endless number of monsters to conquer civilizations. He also sells them to unsuspecting customers for a profit, via a transportation network. His only opposition are the Star Warriors and Galaxy Soldier Army, though they are wiped out before the series begins. He is an embodiment of life's fear and suffering, and so he strives to bring more pain to increase his power, and will always exist as long as people hold fear in their hearts. In the finale, he was destroyed by Kirby using the Star Rod.\n\nNightmare is voiced by [[Banjo Ginga]] in the Japanese version of the anime and by [[Andrew Rannells]] in the English dub.\n\nNightmare appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as an assist trophy, voiced by [[Hisao Egawa]].\n\nAn Another Dimension counterpart of Nightmare known as {{nihongo|'''Parallel Nightmare'''|\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2|Anaz\u0101 Naitomea|Another Nightmare}} appears as the main antagonist in the game ''Super Kirby Clash''. Parallel Nightmare is again voiced by [[Banjo Ginga]].\n\n===Dark Matter===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DarkMatterKirby.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dark Matter, as seen in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]''.]] -->\n{{nihongo|'''Dark Matter'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30bf\u30fc|D\u0101ku Mat\u0101}} is a cloud-like creature commonly appearing as a black orb covered in orange petal-like extensions and possessing a single red eye. It has been depicted as both a character and a species, the latter of which is generally known in Japanese as \u300c{{ruby-ja|\u9ed2|\u304f\u308d}}\u3044{{ruby-ja|\u96f2|\u304f\u3082}}\u300d (meaning \"black cloud\"). It is a force of negative energy that lives a lonely existence, and initially attacked Pop Star out of jealousy for Dream Land's lifestyle, seeking to recreate it into a dark world where no one can be happy. Dark Matter can possess other beings, putting them under its control.\n\nDark Matter makes its debut in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'' and possesses King Dedede. The Rainbow Drops extract it and reveal its form as a masked, robed being wielding a magical sword. After being defeated, it assumes its small orb form as it faces Kirby. In ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', a massive cloud of Dark Matter appears in the Pop Star sky and possesses many of its inhabitants. After aiding various creatures in need, Kirby eventually obtains the Love-Love Stick and enters the center of the cloud known as the Hyper Zone, and defeats Dark Matter once again. After its defeat, Kirby faces the leader of Dark Matter, a giant white creature with a single red eye known as {{nihongo|'''Zero'''|\u30bc\u30ed}}.\n\nDark Matter clouds return once more in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', where they invade Ripple Star for its Crystal. When the Crystal is shattered, Kirby sets out to reassemble the pieces on five other planets before confronting a Dark Matter creature called {{nihongo|'''Miracle Matter'''|\u30df\u30e9\u30af\u30eb\u30de\u30bf\u30fc|Mirakuru Mat\u0101}}. Its defeat repels Dark Matter from Ripple Star, but the Crystal detects and expels a powerful presence of Dark Matter from the queen, which goes on to form a new planet. In the core of this last world is {{nihongo|'''0\u00b2'''|\u30bc\u30ed\u30c4\u30fc|Zero Ts\u016b|Zero Two}}, presumably Zero's successor or a reincarnated version of it. It an angelic-looking form of Zero with a halo, a band-aid (confirming that Zero's eye shell from Dream Land 3 was a last ditch effort and effectively hurt him in the process), segmented wings, and a green spiked tail.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', a Dark Matter-related being known as {{nihongo|'''Dark Nebula'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30bc\u30ed|D\u0101ku Zero|Dark Zero}} is the prisoner of a treasure chest which was originally in King Dedede's possession. Meta Knight realizes what is truly inside the treasure chest and suddenly steals it to prevent his release. Kirby, thinking his cake is inside, chases him to the ruins of the Halberd under the Secret Sea. Aboard the operational Halberd, the leader of the Squeaks, Daroach, manages to open the chest and releases him. However, Dark Nebula takes over his body and escapes to Gamble Galaxy. Kirby eventually fights Daroach again and Dark Nebula is forced out. Daroach relinquishes the Triple Star, a mystical rod. With his help, Dark Nebula is banished. Dark Nebula has two cameos in the base version of ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', where he appears as a transformation of the Stone ability, and as a [[Jack-in-the-box]] in one of Daroach's attacks; in the 4.0.0 update, it also appears in the \"\"Bad Boss Brothers\", where it is shown opposite 0\u00b2 and Zero among other final bosses.\n\nDark Matter makes small cameo appearances in ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'' and ''[[Kirby: Mass Attack]]''. A clone of Dark Matter in its ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'' form, dubbed {{nihongo|'''Dark Matter Clone'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3\u5263\u58eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30bf\u30fc|Kur\u014dn Kenshi D\u0101ku Mat\u0101|Clone Swordsman Dark Matter}} or '''Dark Matter Blade''', appears as an extra boss in ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''. It was created from an unknown source by the [[supercomputer]] Star Dream; however, it is noted that Star Dream was unable to fully replicate Dark Matter's powers, as he is unable to turn into his second form.\n\n===Marx===\n{{nihongo|'''Marx'''|\u30de\u30eb\u30af|Maruku}} is the final boss in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' and its remake. He is a round, lavender creature, similar to Kirby, but having no arms, wearing a jester hat, a bow tie, and brown shoes. He is frequently seen bouncing on a ball.\n\nIn the beginning of the sixth and final chapter, \"Milky Way Wishes\", Marx tells Kirby about how the Sun and Moon are fighting and that only the power of a giant mechanical creature called Nova can make them stop, sending Kirby on the adventure. Once Nova appears, Marx suddenly pushes Kirby out of the way and wishes for control over Pop Star. Explaining that he was the one who started the fight between the Sun and Moon in the first place, Marx then turns into a more powerful form of himself, which has fangs and strange yellow wings, before sending Nova on a collision course with Pop Star. As the Sun and Moon hold Nova back, Kirby rides a magical shooting Starship into Nova and disables its heart, then defeats Marx and sends him crashing into Nova to destroy them both. In ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', pieces of Nova fuse with Marx's dead body and revives him as the more powerful {{nihongo|'''Marx Soul'''|\u30de\u30eb\u30af\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb|Maruku Souru}}, the final boss of the new and most difficult mode \"The True Arena\" with a new design and improved attacks.\n\nHe makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', in an unlockable picture with other series villains. In ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', an arrange of the music when Kirby is battling Marx in ''Kirby Super Star'' can be played on the Halberd stage. The final boss from this game, Tabuu, also shares some similar moves and pattern with Marx (both of them created by [[Masahiro Sakurai]]) In ''Kirby: Mass Attack'', he appears as the big boss of the \"Kirby Brawlball\" sub-game. In ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'', he makes a brief appearance in the crowd of the final Kirby Master 100% video, and if Kirby uses the Stone ability in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'', he will occasionally turn into a stone statue of Marx in his original form bouncing on his striped ball.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' as a playable Dream Friend, added through update 1.0.\n\nHe makes an appearance of the Kirby representative of the boss fights in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', through [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]'s, the [[Inkling (character)|Inkling]]'s, and [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina and Luma]]'s Classic Modes and also appears in World of Light.<br />\n\n===Dark Mind===\n{{nihongo|'''Dark Mind'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9|D\u0101ku Maindo}} is the main villain of ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', with Dark Meta Knight as his right-hand man. At the intro of the game, after Meta Knight rushes into the mirror world, Dark Meta Knight slices Kirby into four, unintentionally giving Kirby backup against the corrupted Mirror World. Throughout the game, Dark Meta Knight masquerades as the real deal and a timid \"Shadow Kirby\" also makes its appearance. Towards the end of the game, the original Meta Knight exposes the copy during the final confrontation. After Dark Meta Knight is shattered, the way to Dark Mind is open and sucks Kirby and Meta Knight's Master Sword. After Dark Mind is defeated, it is learned that he intended to make the Mirror World be overrun with a person's worst reflection of themselves; Shadow Kirby is actually an honest reflection of the real Kirby with no such qualities, and stays behind as the guardian of the Mirror World as Meta Knight lays his Master Sword to rest. In ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'' and ''Super Kirby Clash'', Dark Mind assumes the form of King Dedede as the game's final boss, named {{nihongo|'''King D-Mind'''|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0D\u30fb\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9|Kingu D-Maindo}}. Although he is the final boss in ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'', he is not in ''Super Kirby Clash''.\n\nDark Meta Knight is also a playable Dream Friend in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' update 3.0.0.\n\n===Drawcia===\n{{nihongo|'''Drawcia'''|\u30c9\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2|Doroshia}} is the villain of ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]''. She is an evil paint-[[Witchcraft|witch]] and a dangerous sorceress. She curses Kirby into a ball at the start of the game and turns Pop Star into paint. She has two forms: Drawcia Sorceress and Drawcia Soul. Her first, humanoid form, can shoot balls of energy at Kirby and summon enemies to damage him. Her second form resembles a blob of paint, and she has many paint-related techniques. When she is defeated, her curse is lifted and Pop Star and Kirby return to normal.\n\n===Yin-Yarn the Sorcerer===\n{{nihongo|'''Yin-Yarn'''|\u30a2\u30df\u30fc\u30dc\u30fb\u30a2\u30e2\u30fc\u30ec|Am\u012bbo Am\u014dre|Amiibo Amore}} is the main villain of ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'' and the remake, ''Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn''. He is an evil sorcerer who wreaks chaos and havoc in Dream Land and Patch Land. When Kirby tries to eat his Metatomato (thinking it's a Maxim Tomato), Yin-Yarn traps Kirby inside a sock that sends him to Patch Land, where Kirby's body transforms into yarn. A bit later, Kirby realizes that air goes through yarn, which forces him to use the yarn whip and transformations with yarn instead of his normal inhalation-based power. Later, Kirby learns about Yin-Yarn tearing Patch Land into seven pieces and stealing the magic yarn. In the game, Kirby must retrieve the magic yarn by defeating a boss. Yin-Yarn, after tearing Patch Land into seven pieces, he travels to Dream Land to wreak havoc there. So, to save both of their worlds, Kirby and Prince Fluff set off to recover seven pieces of yarn, defeat Yin-Yarn, and bring peace back to both Dream Land and Patch Land. Yin-Yarn is the boss of Dream Land and is fought in two forms: first, he attacks Kirby and Prince Fluff in his normal form. Secondly, he attacks them as Mega Yin-Yarn, leaving Kirby and Prince Fluff hopeless. Suddenly, Meta Knight flies by, dropping a Tankbot Metamortex, turning them into a Tankbot to fight and defeat this evil incarnation. Yin-Yarn's name is a pun on [[yin yang]]. Yin Yarn, like all of Patch Land's creatures, is made from yarn (considering the name, Yin-''Yarn''), and a button for a nose. He uses knitting needles for his evil schemes (which are mostly creating giant monsters and fake Waddle Dees to beat up King Dedede).\n\n===Necrodeus===\n{{nihongo|'''Necrodeus'''|\u30cd\u30af\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30b9|Nekurodiasu}} is the primary antagonist of ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]''. He is the leader of a group of [[demon]]s known as the Skull Gang. Upon appearing at the beginning of the game, Necrodeus casts a spell that splits Kirby into ten pieces, and defeats all but one Kirby. Necrodeus has the ultimate goal of shrouding Popstar in darkness, but is defeated by Kirby in the final scenes. His name means \"Deathgod\" in Latin, a name that accurately describes his appearance and nature. As the final boss of ''Kirby Mass Attack'', he faces Kirby in two forms: first, Kirby must defeat his hands (similar to the Wham Bam Rock fight from ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''), next, Kirby must defeat him. Upon death, Necrodeus drops his magic staff, the source of his power, which Kirby uses to restore himself to normal.\n\n===Magolor===\n{{nihongo|'''Magolor'''|\u30de\u30db\u30ed\u30a2|Mahoroa}} appears in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', initially as a friendly character. He travels to Dream Land on an inter-dimensional ship called the Lor Starcutter. When the ship crash lands in Dream Land, Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Waddle Dee offer to help repair the Lor Starcutter so that he can return to a realm known as Halcandra - and as a reward for their efforts, Magolor brings Kirby and the group to Halcandra for a visit. When the group arrives, a large four-headed dragon known as Landia attacks and shoots down the Lor Starcutter for an unknown reason. Angry that they have been trapped, Magolor sends Kirby and the group to defeat Landia.\n\nIn truth, Magolor is a power-hungry villain who is secretly using the four to defeat Landia for him, so that he could obtain the Master Crown. The Master Crown grants limitless power to the wearer, and Landia is currently in possession of this crown. Magolor wishes to become the universe's ruling overlord, but he must gain the power to do so from the Master Crown. It is revealed that Magolor had fought and lost to Landia before, and in his escape attempt he landed in Dream Land. After Landia is defeated by Kirby and the group, Magolor puts on the Master Crown and transforms into a giant floating entity with enormous power, then announces that he will conquer Planet Popstar as his \"reward\" to Kirby and his friends for their help. With help from Landia, Kirby chases Magolor into another dimension and sinks the Lor Starcutter, then battles Magolor himself. After his first defeat, Magolor is seemed to been destroyed. But, during a cutscene, it's revealed that the Master Crown took control of Magolor's body, and turned himself into Magolor Soul. After the second defeat, the crown is broken, and Magolor is taken into a portal, seeming to end his tyranny. \n\nMagolor returns in ''[[Kirby's Dream Collection]]'', revealed to be alive and reformed, where he builds Kirby a new playground as an apology for his actions in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]''.  Here, Kirby can play through new challenge stages, some of which he races against Magolor. During the races, he uses magic to summon enemies, as well as attack Kirby. His rivalry with Kirby still exists, albeit more friendly.\n\nAfter his appearance in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'', Magolor also has made cameo appearances in other games, including ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]] (as an 8 bit keychain)'', ''Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe'' (as an enemy, although he doesn't deal damage), ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]'' (as a trophy), ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'' (as a sticker), and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' (as a spirit).\n\nHe appears as a playable character in the third update for ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n===Queen Sectonia===\n{{nihongo|'''Queen Sectonia'''|\u30af\u30a3\u30f3\u30fb\u30bb\u30af\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2|Kin Sekutonia|Queen Sectnia}} is the main villain of ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]''. She claims to be the ruler of the heavens, calling Dream Land the \"lower world\". Sectonia ruled over her land, Floralia, with an iron fist, resulting in the people of the sky to send out the Dreamstalk, which they hope would bring Kirby to their rescue. However, Queen Sectonia sent her trusted servant, Taranza, to intercept this plan by kidnapping the Hero of Dream Land. Taranza accidentally mistakes King Dedede for Kirby and kidnaps him. Kirby then pursues Taranza in an effort to rescue Dedede. Finally, Kirby corners Taranza in Royal Road, Queen Sectonia's palace. After defeating a possessed King Dedede, Taranza calls forth Queen Sectonia in an effort to save himself, but Queen Sectonia instead shoots him, calling him a \"pitiful fool.\" Kirby and Queen Sectonia do battle, with Kirby reigning victorious.\n\nIn a last ditch effort, the queen fuses herself with the Dreamstalk, with the intent of warping Popstar into her perfect vision. Kirby once again battles Sectonia, but ends up being captured. As the queen begins to strangle Kirby, Taranza returns with King Dedede. King Dedede frees Kirby, while Taranza gives Kirby a Miracle Fruit, allowing Kirby to become Hypernova Kirby. Kirby then inhales Queen Sectonia's laser blast before spitting it back at her, destroying her. In the extra mode Dededetour, she returns as {{nihongo|'''Queen Sectonia DX'''|\u30af\u30a3\u30f3\u30fb\u30bb\u30af\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2DX|Kin Sekutonia DX|Queen Sectnia DX}} and is fought by King Dedede.\n\nShe later returns in \"The True Arena\" where she consumes four Miracle Fruits turning her into {{nihongo|'''Soul of Sectonia'''|\u30bb\u30af\u30c8\u30cb\u30a2 \u30bd\u30a6\u30eb|Sekutonia Souru|Sectnia Soul}} and once again battles Kirby. After her defeat, however, she rips herself out of the Dreamstalk to battle Kirby one last time. After her defeat she bursts into a shower of flower petals. One petal, which glowed larger than the others, fell slowly, giving note of the usage of how Star Dream was able to clone her.\n\nA clone of Sectonia appears in ''Kirby: Planet Robobot'' as an extra boss, created by Star Dream using a sample from Sectonia's flower form. It is more zombie-like in appearance than the original Sectonia, and upon defeat briefly shrinks down into a spider-like form similar to Taranza (possibly Sectonia's original form) before dying.\n\n===Dark Crafter===\n{{nihongo|'''Dark Crafter'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc|D\u0101ku Kurafut\u0101}} is the main antagonist of ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]''. He is a multicolored cloud-like creature with the strange urge to steal color from places, and possessed Claycia to fulfill these plans. But after Claycia was freed from his control, Dark Crafter became furious and decided to steal the colors himself. With help from Claycia, Kirby and Elline destroyed Dark Crafter causing him to explode.\n\n===President Haltmann===\n{{nihongo|'''President Haltmann'''|\u30d7\u30ec\u30b8\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Purejidento Harutoman|President Hartmann}}, full name {{nihongo|'''Max Profitt Haltmann'''|\u30b2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u30e0\u30fb\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Geinzu Inkamu Harutoman|Gains Income Hartmann}}, is an antagonist in ''Kirby: Planet Robobot''. As the President of Haltmann Works Company (HWC), Haltmann cares only about the prosperity of his company. To this end, he travels the galaxy in his giant spaceship, the Access Ark, and terraforms planets by stripping away their resources and converting them to giant mechanical fortresses. The plight of the natives do not interest Haltmann, whom he cruelly dismisses as \"savages\". At the end of the game, Kirby confronts Haltmann, who fights him in a custom-built Robobot Armor made of solid gold. After his defeat, Haltmann summons the Mother Computer, Star Dream, in his attempt to destroy Kirby, but Susie interrupts and tries to steal Star Dream. This backfires when Star Dream wakes up and uploads itself into Haltmann, possessing him and driving Star Dream to grant his wish of eternal prosperity for HWC by erasing everything else in existence. In \"The True Arena\", Star Dream's control over Haltmann becomes even stronger when Kirby fights its Core OS, erasing every last trace of Haltmann from its programming as Kirby disables and eventually destroys the rampaging computer.\n\nIn the \"Meta Knightmare Returns\" mode, he is faced by Meta Knight under the name {{nihongo|'''President Haltmann 2.0'''|Re:\u30d7\u30ec\u30b8\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30f3|Re:Purejidento Harutoman|Re:President Hartmann}}, once defeated, Star Dream awakens and tests Meta Knight who it acknowledges as the new admin.\n\nPause screen descriptions in \"Meta Knightmare Returns\" and \"The True Arena\" shed additional light on Haltmann's backstory. He originally built Star Dream from ancient technology and knowledge gained from an unknown source. During an experiment with it, President Haltmann's daughter Susanna disappeared. The belief that Susanna was dead drove Haltmann insane, and he continued constructing Star Dream to grant his wish of eternal prosperity for his company. This required significant amounts of natural resources, which eventually led HWC to Popstar.\n\n===Star Dream===\nA [[supercomputer]] built by the Haltmann Works Company (HWC), {{nihongo|'''Star Dream'''|\u661f\u306e\u5922|Hoshi no Yume}} is the true main villain and final boss of ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''. President Haltmann constructed it using ancient technology and knowledge from an unknown source. Much later, when Haltmann has been defeated by Kirby, the computer wakes up and consumes Haltmann's mind to become self-aware. Speaking through Haltmann's body, Star Dream reveals that it used the HWC and its business plan to study organic life throughout the universe. Having arrived at the conclusion that all organic life is an obstacle to prosperity and thus must be destroyed, Star Dream flies off into space and is pursued by Kirby, who has fused the Robobot Armor with the Halberd. After taking heavy damage in the ensuing dogfight, Star Dream connects itself to the HWC's mothership, the Access Ark, to continue fighting. Once the armored shell of the Access Ark is broken off, the true form of Star Dream is revealed - a clockwork star nearly identical to Nova, the comet used by Marx in ''Kirby Super Star''. In a final battle, Kirby manages to drill completely through Star Dream, presumably destroying it.\n\nIn the \"Meta Knightmare Returns\" mode, Star Dream requests that Meta Knight prove himself to it after Haltmann is defeated. For this purpose, it creates clones of Dark Matter and Sectonia. After these fail, it summons Galacta Knight through a space-time portal, but Galacta Knight destroys it himself before doing battle with Meta Knight.\n\nIn \"The True Arena\", the damage done by Galacta Knight ends up activating a hidden program within the computer transforming it into the more powerful {{nihongo|'''Star Dream Soul OS'''|\u661f\u306e\u5922.Soul OS|Hoshi no Yume.Soul OS|Star Dream.Soul OS}} who is fought as the final opponent of \"The True Arena\". Upon the defeat of its clockwork star form, however, the mechanical monstrosity pulls Kirby into itself. Inside, the true form of Star Dream Soul OS is revealed as an armored, mechanical heart like that of Nova. After being defeated, the heart makes one final attempt to destroy Kirby by firing immense waves of energy before finally exploding.\n\n===Hyness===\n{{nihongo|'''Hyness'''|\u30cf\u30a4\u30cd\u30b9|Hainesu|Hiness}} is an antagonist in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. He is the leader of a mysterious cult that worships Void Termina, and the commander of the three Mage-Sisters: Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne. He is abusive towards the Mage-Sisters despite their loyalty to him, with a particularly cruel bend toward Zan Partizanne, who adores him despite his not caring enough to even learn her name. His goal is to obtain the pieces of the Jamba Heart scattered throughout the galaxy and use them to resurrect Void Termina, who he refers to as his \"Dark Lord.\"\n\nKirby and his allies battle Hyness's forces every step of the way and eventually reach him at the altar within the Divine Terminus, where he has assembled the nearly complete Jamba Heart. To buy Hyness time, Zan Partizanne fights Kirby again but is beaten. Hyness then takes notice of the intruders, shoves Zan Partizanne aside and battles them himself, utilizing his dark magic in combat. When beaten, his cloak falls off, revealing his grotesque true appearance as a Purple and yellow skinned creature with a huge nose and ears and bulging eyes. Hyness flies into a state of madness and summons the three Mage-Sisters, then places them under his control and uses them as zombified puppets to battle his enemies. Even this fails to defeat Kirby, however, and Hyness is left greatly weakened. Desperate to fulfill his goal and resurrect Void Termina, Hyness sacrifices himself and the Mage-Sisters to the Jamba Heart, giving the Dark Lord the energy it needs to awaken. All four are later seen trapped in fleshy cocoons within Void Termina's body, but are ejected during Kirby's battle with the creature. Hyness's whereabouts after this point are unknown.\n\nIn the \"Heroes in Another Dimension\" storyline, it is revealed that Hyness's prayers to summon Void Termina have caused time and space to break down at the Divine Terminus, and he has vanished into the alternate dimension. Once Kirby and his friends gather the four spears that once sealed the Jamba Heart, they find a new Jamba Heart at the alternate dimension's Divine Terminus. The spears cause the heart to shatter, releasing Hyness in a demonic new form dubbed {{nihongo|'''Corrupt Hyness'''|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30cf\u30a4\u30cd\u30b9|D\u0101kusaido Hainesu|Dark Side Hiness}}. In this form, Hyness's magic is much more powerful at the cost of destroying his already fragile mental state. Kirby's group ultimately manages to defeat him, only for the three Mage-Sisters to arrive too late to help him. In the storyline's good ending, the Mage-Sisters are saved by the power of Kirby's Friend Heart, and after Kirby leaves, Hyness turns back into his true self, allowing the Mage-Sisters to help him up and bring him back to their world.\n\n===Void Termina===\n{{nihongo|'''Void Termina'''|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30fb\u30cb\u30eb|Ende Niru|Ende Nil}}, also known as the \"Destroyer of Worlds,\" is the final boss of ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. It is an ancient being that has been reincarnated throughout the ages, and is worshipped by Hyness's cult. Long ago, Void Termina was sealed away by four warriors who used mystical spears that Hyness removed from the Jamba Heart at the beginning of the game's story. Because of an imperfection in the ritual, pieces of the Jamba Heart scatter throughout space, including on Popstar, where they possess Whispy Woods, King Dedede and Meta Knight. At Hyness's behest, the three Mage-Sisters search through space to recover the Jamba Heart pieces so Void Termina can be revived. Once Hyness sacrifices himself and the Mage-Sisters to the Jamba Heart, the seal is fully broken and Void Termina reawakens.\n\nInitially assuming a giant humanoid form, Void Termina battles Kirby and his allies in deep space. In this form, Void Termina can create massive shockwaves and wield giant swords that it can charge with elemental energy. To damage Void Termina, Kirby must use the Star Allies Sparkler to shoot an eye on Void Termina's body. Once the beast suffers enough damage, it collapses and its mask falls off, pulling the heroes into its body and forcing them to battle its core. Eventually, the core splits open, and Kirby and his allies are ejected from Void Termina's body. Void Termina rises again, sprouts giant wings, and becomes able to summon and use a variety of magical weapons. Like before, the eye that appears on its body is a weak spot, and after taking heavy damage it falls to the ground and pulls Kirby into itself again. This time, Void Termina's true form appears inside its body - an amorphous mass capable of taking on a number of forms and taking control of Kirby's allies, which can only be undone using a Friend Heart. At the end of the battle, Void Termina is finally destroyed in a clash between the Star Allies Sparkler and its Dark Matter form's laser.\n\nIn the Soul Melter difficulty of the Ultimate Choice sub-game, Void Termina's true form is dubbed {{nihongo|'''Void Soul'''|\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb \u30aa\u30d6 \u30cb\u30eb|Souru obu Niru|Soul of Nil}}. It is noted that the ancient scrolls written about Void Termina say that its reincarnations may be affected by positive or negative energy, leaving the possibility that Void Termina may one day return as a friend instead of an enemy. In Soul Melter EX, Void Termina's appearance changes once again, with its body turning black, its mask bearing glowing red eyes, and its innards becoming a color-shifting abyss. This form's full name is '''Void Termina, the True Destroyer of Worlds''' and its abilities are accordingly dramatically enhanced. In the final phase, a new entity simply named {{nihongo|'''Void'''|\u30cb\u30eb|Niru|Nil}} awakens inside its body. Nicknamed the '''Astral Birth''', it fights with all the powers of Void Soul but also incorporates techniques used by Dark Mind and Drawcia Soul.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n\n===Adeleine===\n{{nihongo|'''Adeleine'''|\u30a2\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc\u30cc|Ador\u0113nu}} is an artist who came to Pop Star to study art. In ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', she appeared as one of the early boss characters taken over by Dark Matter. She is taken over and fights Kirby, and later joins with Kirby after he frees her. She has the ability to make her paintings real, either creating monsters while under the control of Dark Matter or providing Kirby with help.\n\nA nearly identical character named {{nihongo|'''Ado'''|\u30a2\u30c9}} plays a similar role in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3''. Some official sources suggest that Ado may simply be a nickname of Adeleine, but it has yet to be completely confirmed.\n\nAdeleine appears as a playable Dream Friend in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', with Ribbon supporting her.\n\n===Dyna Blade===\n{{nihongo|'''Dyna Blade'''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9|Daina Bureido}} is an enormous armored [[bird]] that acts as both a friend and a foe in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', and Kirby Super Star Ultra. In her self-titled game, she destroys all of Dream Land's crops to feed her chicks. Kirby defeats her, not knowing this, so he ends up feeding the chicks with apples and teaching them how to fly. In \"Revenge of Meta Knight\", Dyna Blade returns the favor by successfully carrying Kirby onto the Halberd before the artillery forces her to retreat.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'', Dyna Blade is shown as a legendary bird that is worshiped by the citizens of Cappytown. King Dedede hatches a plot to get rid of Kirby by tricking him into eating her egg, which infuriates Dyna Blade and causes her to chase and attack Kirby for much of the episode, until her chick appears and Kirby feeds it, placating Dyna.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', Dyna Blade appears in City Trial mode and sometimes flies to different parts of the city until flying away all together. The player can defeat Dyna Blade by aiming for her head to obtain multiple power ups. In ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'', a similar boss to Dyna Blade named Hot Wings appears as the boss of Hot Land.\n\nDyna Blade's most recent appearance has been in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', making a cameo in Dream Land's over world map\n\n===Gooey===\n{{nihongo|'''Gooey'''|\u30b0\u30fc\u30a4|G\u016bi}} is a blue blob with a pair of eyes and a mouth. He first appears in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'' as a friend of Kirby that can be rescued from a holding bag (if Kirby is already with the animal partner that's inside it). Rescuing him at least once awards a single percentage point for 100% completion. There is also a female blob similar to Gooey that must also be rescued for 100%, though she appears more rarely.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'' expands on Gooey's character. He is revealed to be of the Dark Matter race, but chose to be Kirby's friend instead. He can be summoned by Kirby as a helper character similar to those in ''Kirby Super Star'', controlled by either the computer or a second player. Gooey's main form of offense is to snag enemies with his tongue and spit them out like Kirby does; he cannot capture multiple enemies like Kirby can, but can use his tongue underwater. Gooey can also copy abilities like Kirby, but only when a second player is controlling him. When flying in the Hyper Zone, Gooey assumes his Dark Matter form, though he still maintains his own face. He also appears in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' as a playable character through an update.\n\n===Yellow Kirby===\n{{nihongo|Yellow Kirby|\u30ad\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3|K\u012bbyi|Keeby}} is a yellow-colored Kirby whose Japanese name only officially appears in ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'' supplemental material.

Rick, Coo, and Kine also appear in the anime series ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'', and appear in ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'' as one of Stone Kirby's transformations.\n\nRick, Coo, and Kine make a cameo in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'', as the background image in the minigame \"Kirby Quest\". They also appear in the ''Kirby Fighters'' mode of ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', appearing in Coo's Forest stage where they randomly appear and attack players indiscriminately.

According to the in-game description, he has protected the Master Crown and the Lor Starcutter since ancient times. Magolor attempted to steal the treasures he guarded, thus waking him up and forcing him into a rampage. Magolor fought against Landia himself to get it but lost, so he stole the Lor Starcutter and flew to Planet Popstar in hopes of finding someone useful to his plans. Magolor returned with Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight and Bandana Waddle Dee, and sicced all four on the dragon. After they defeated him, Magolor finally obtained the Master Crown and left to take over the galaxy starting with Popstar. Landia, as four smaller dragons, helped Kirby and company in their efforts to defeat Magolor. After Magolor's defeat, Landia and the Lor Starcutter help Kirby and the others escape from the closing void back to Popstar before returning home to Halcandra.\n\nHe is also the one-to-final boss in the sub-game \"Team Kirby Clash\" in ''Planet Robobot'', and his EX form, which is colored purple, is the final boss in the same game. He is also fought in the expanded standalone version of the sub-game, ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'' in the Empyrean, as well as his EX counterpart in the Decisive Battlefield. A parallel version of Landia also appears where Landia EX is fought, and the game confirms Landia's gender to be male.\n\n===Taranza===\n{{nihongo|'''Taranza'''|\u30bf\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6}} is a spider-like creature who appears in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]''. He hails from Floralia and is a retainer to Queen Sectonia. He was sent by Queen Sectonia to kidnap Kirby but kidnaps King Dedede instead.  Kirby then chases him up the Dreamstalk all the way to Royal Road, where he uses his hypnotic abilities to put King Dedede under his control. After Masked Dedede is defeated, he entreats Queen Sectonia to save him, but she does not: instead she strikes him with a laser beam attack, prompting Taranza to switch allegiances after this betrayal. It is hinted in the in-game descriptions that Taranza used to be friends with Queen Sectonia but recently noticed some disturbing changes in her demeanor.\n\nIn ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'', Taranza is the main villain responsible for driving the inhabitants of the Dream Kingdom into disturbing the peace.

She is placed in charge of the project to take over Planet Popstar and convert it to a fully mechanized HWC planet.

In the final level, Access Ark, President Haltmann fires Susie for her repeated failures. After Kirby and Haltmann fight, Susie suddenly reveals that she's a corporate spy and attempts to steal Star Dream with the intent to sell it to the highest bidder, but Star Dream wakes up during the scuffle and begins its rampage.

When King Dedede's Octopus monster threatens Cappy Town, Kabu foretells that a Star Warrior named Kirby will appear to save them. After Kirby arrives, Kabu aids him by sending out his Warp Star, a role he continues to perform for the entire series.

This ability is useless, as all it does is make Kirby sleep for a few seconds before he wakes up and it vanishes.\n\nIn the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya]]'' episode \"The Pillow Case\", there were Noddies in the pillowcases that the Cappies purchased from King Dedede which induced nightmares revolving around Kirby. The pillows were destroyed by Meta Knight and the Noddies end up running. In \"Flower Power\", King Dedede tricks Kirby into inhaling a Noddy which causes Kirby to fall asleep.

Their appetites made King Dedede bankrupt and he ended up releasing the Scarfies. While in the wild, the Scarfies started eating the animals and reproducing.

This caused a Scarfy army to form overnight that only Hammer Kirby could stop. In the end, King Dedede was forced to keep and take care of the Scarfies.\n\n===Scoopy===\n{{nihongo|'''Scoopy'''|\u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30d4\u30a3|Suk\u016bp\u012b}} is a white and periwinkle giant squid with black eyes, six arms, and a lip-like muzzle around its mouth that appears in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]''.\n\n===Shotzo===\n{{nihongo|'''Shotzo'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30c4\u30a9|Shattso}} is an invincible and immobile black cannon.

The Grand Doomer is also the Boss carries the last piece to Magolor's ship, which is the mast.\n\n===Heavy Lobster===\n{{nihongo|'''Heavy Lobster'''|\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ed\u30d6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Heb\u012b Robusut\u0101}} is a strong mechanical [[lobster]]-like monster that appears in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''. It attacks Kirby multiple times during his assault on the Halberd. In the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' episode \"Combat Kirby\", Heavy Lobster is one of Nightmare's strongest creations. Nightmare sends Heavy Lobster to track down and rip apart the Halberd. It took the combined attacks of Ice Kirby, Sword Knight, and Blade Knight to destroy Heavy Lobster.\n\n===Heavy Mole===\n{{nihongo|'''Heavy Mole'''|\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Heb\u012b M\u014dru}} is a mechanical monster that appears in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'' and ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''. It is the boss of Yogurt Yard.\n\n===Ice Dragon===\n{{other uses|Ice Dragon (disambiguation)}}\nThe {{nihongo|'''Ice [[Dragon]]'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b9\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Aisu Doragon}} is a [[dinosaur]]-like monster that appears in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]''. It is the boss of the Iceberg. In ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', Ice Dragon is drawn up by Ado, and drawn by Adelene in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''. In ''Kirby: Planet Robobot'', a solid hologram of Ice Dragon appears as one of the four bosses summoned by the Holo Defense API, and is known as {{nihongo|'''Holo-Ice Dragon'''|\u30db\u30ed\u30fb\u30a2\u30a4\u30b9\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Horo Aisu Doragon}}. It also reappers in ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe'' and ''Super Kirby Clash'' as a boss.\n\nIn the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' episode \"Dedede's Snow Job\", King Dedede orders Ice Dragon from NightMare Enterprises in order to combat the heat wave in Cappy Town. Kirby, Tiff, and Tuff later find the Ice Dragon in its mature state where it ends up attacking Chilly. Kirby becomes Ice Kirby and freezes the Ice Dragon from within. Once the Ice Dragon is destroyed, all the snow and Chilly begins to melt. In \"Labor Daze\", King Dedede uses the Cappies that he enlisted to work at his newly built factory to build a robot replica of the Ice Dragon. Ice Kirby freezes the factory's boiler enough to destroy the Ice Dragon Robot and the factory with the destroyed environment also being restored.\n\n===Kabula===\n'''Kabula''', also known as {{nihongo|'''Kaboola'''|\u30ab\u30d6\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc|Kab\u016br\u0101}}, is King Dedede's blimp, who appears as a boss in some games. She has the ability to fire cannonballs and barrel-roll at Kirby, and Kirby must shoot her down by firing projectiles (air pellets in ''Kirby's Dream Land'', the Starship in ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', and in the Robobot Armor's Jet Mode in'' Kirby: Planet Robobot''.\n\n===Kracko===\n{{nihongo|'''Kracko'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Kurakko}} is a boss that first appears in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. He resembles a large [[cumulus cloud]] with spikes protruding from all sides, and a single large eyeball in the center. He attacks with electricity, rain, and by producing smaller enemies, such as Waddle Doos. Kracko is typically first seen in a weaker form, sometimes called {{nihongo|'''Kracko Jr.'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3Jr.|Kurakko Junia}}. Its characteristic eye remains, but he is surrounded by four balls, which it either spins slowly or launches at Kirby. It usually drops Waddle Doos or bombs at Kirby. This form either fights as a mini-boss earlier in various games, or immediately prior to transforming to his \"adult\" form. Kracko is slightly different in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' (''Ultra'') in that Kracko Jr. and Kracko are two separate bosses. In ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'', an illusion of Kracko in his adult form is drawn up and brought to life by Ado to fight for her, and is the last monster to be drawn. Kracko returns in the ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' game mode \"Revenge of the King\" as {{nihongo|'''Kracko Jr.'s Revenge'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3Jr. \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Kurakko Junia Ribenji}} and {{nihongo|'''Kracko's Revenge'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3 \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Kurakko Ribenji}}, each with purple [[sclera]]s and dark grey cloud-parts.\n\nKracko appears in the ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' episode \"Dark and Stormy Knight\" where it appears as a monster purchased by King Dedede from NightMare Enterprises to defeat Kirby. For most of the episode, Kracko appeared as a storm cloud that shot lightning throughout Cappytown. But when Kirby flew inside it, Kracko shot electric sword beams at Kirby, giving him the Sword ability. Kirby shot five sword beams back with the last one splitting Kracko in half. Kracko was shown the same way it is in the games.\n\nKracko is also a surprise boss in ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]''. Unlike most bosses in ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'', Kracko is not a mirror copy, but has no copy and is the original boss. In ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'', a gray, robot version called {{nihongo|'''Mecha Kracko'''|\u30e1\u30ab\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Meka Kurakko}} appears as a boss.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', Kracko returns as a boss, encountered in Old Odyssey. According to its in-game description, it has made Floralia part of its territory and is being fed by a mysterious power source, making its attacks stronger than ever before. In Dededetour, King Dedede fights {{nihongo|'''Kracko DX'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3 DX|Kurakko DX}}, Kracko's stronger form.\n\nIn ''Kirby: Planet Robobot'', a solid hologram of Kracko appears as one of the four bosses summoned by the Holo Defense API, and is known as {{nihongo|'''Holo-Kracko'''|\u30db\u30ed\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Horo Kurakko}}.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', Kracko can split into two clouds known as {{nihongo|'''Twin Kracko'''|\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b3|Tsuin Kurakko}}. Both clouds fight against Kirby and his allies after the original Kracko is defeated.\n\n===Lololo & Lalala===\n{{nihongo|'''Lololo & Lalala'''|\u30ed\u30ed\u30ed&\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9|Rororo to Rarara}} appear once as the second boss fight in ''Kirby's Dream Land'', where they push objects in an attempt to hurt Kirby. They appear to be parodies of Lolo and Lala, the protagonists of HAL's ''[[Eggerland]]'' series of games.\n\nThey also appear in ''Kirby Super Star'' game mode \"Spring Breeze\" as bosses, and in the ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' game mode \"Revenge of the King\", they return as {{nihongo|'''Lololo & Lalala's Revenge'''|\u30ed\u30ed\u30ed&\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9 \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Rororo to Rarara Ribenji}}.\n\nThey appear in the anime as friendly characters, where they are known as '''Fololo & Falala''' in the English dub, and they reside in King Dedede's castle. They are originally a single monster created by NightMare Enterprises called {{nihongo|'''Fofa'''|\u30ed\u30e9|Rora|Lola}}, but it is split into two by Slice n' Splice and sent to Dedede at the suggestion to the N.M.E. Sales Guy by Nightmare. In the Japanese version of the anime, Lololo is voiced by Chiro Kanzaki and Lalala is voiced by Madoka Akita. In the English dub, they are both voiced by [[Tara Sands|Tara Jayne Sands]].\n\n===Meta-Knights===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Meta-Knights'''|\u30e1\u30bf\u30ca\u30a4\u30c4|Meta-Naitsu}} are an army led by [[List of Kirby characters#Meta Knight|Meta Knight]], who often uses them to test Kirby's skills throughout [[Kirby's Adventure]], which is their first appearance. The Meta-Knights include {{nihongo|'''Axe Knight'''|\u30a2\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Akkusunaito}}, {{nihongo|'''Mace Knight'''|\u30e1\u30a4\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Meisunaito}}, {{nihongo|'''Javelin Knight'''|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d9\u30ea\u30f3\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Jaberinnaito}}, and {{nihongo|'''Trident Knight'''|\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8|Toraidentonaito}}. They are four distinct armored soldiers that each wield the weapon they are named after. The Meta-Knights return prominently in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', where they aided Meta Knight in his attempt to conquer Dream Land via his armored airship, the Halberd. They also appeared in some other game modes, also fighting as a team. A version of them can also be summoned by Galacta Knight.\n\n===Mr. Shine & Mr. Bright===\n{{nihongo|'''Mr. Shine & Mr. Bright'''|\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30f3&\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8|Misut\u0101 Shain & Misut\u0101 Buraito}} are tag-team bosses first appearing in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]''. Mr. Shine appears as a crescent [[moon]] with a face and limbs, while Mr. Bright is a [[sun]] with similar features. One always stays in the air, raining down projectiles, while the other attacks from the ground. One of their most lethal attacks is when they create a solar eclipse: Mr. Bright will blast the area with flames while Mr. Shine creates a patch of shadow, which is the only safe spot. They return as drawings come to life in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]''. In ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', similar entities are the Sun and the Moon of Pop Star, who literally fought day and night in \"Milky Way Wishes\" due to a misunderstanding caused by Marx. In the anime, a monster named Slice n' Splice uses moon- and sun-shaped staffs to split and paste his enemies. Presumably, this was a nod to Mr. Shine & Mr. Bright. They also appear in ''Kirby Mass Attack'' on Strato Patrol EOS mode.\n\n===Paintra===\n{{nihongo|'''Paintra'''|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30a2|Peinshia|Paincia}} is a mysterious paint [[Witchcraft|witch]] who appears as a boss in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]''. She has paintbrushes for legs (which she can combine into one paintbrush) and uses many paint based attacks. Some examples of her attacks include one where she paints over the screen, making seeing her more difficult, and one where she rains down paint across the arena. Her pause screen description speaks of a painting that depicted two sisters who were separated at birth. This painting hung unnoticed in a painter's studio for many years but later became sentient and vowed revenge. She is encountered in Lollipop Land. She also has a more vicious form known as {{nihongo|'''Paintra DX'''|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30a2 DX|Peinshia DX|Paincia DX}}, which is battled in \"Dededetour\" and \"The True Arena\".\n\n===Paint Roller===\n{{nihongo|'''Paint Roller'''|\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc|Peinto R\u014dr\u0101}} appears as a boss in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', and ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]''. It wears a baseball cap and roller skates, and it is capable of drawing enemies that come to life. It appears in the anime as a monster bought by Dedede to fight Kirby.\n\n===Pon & Con===\n{{nihongo|'''Pon & Con'''|\u30dd\u30f3&\u30b3\u30f3|Pon to Kon}} are a raccoon and fox, respectively, that appear as bosses in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'' and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. In the latter, they have stronger versions called {{nihongo|'''Goldon & Silvox'''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30f3&\u30b7\u30eb\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30b9|G\u014drudon to Shirubakkusu}}.\n\n===Poppy Bros. Jr. & Poppy Bros. Sr.===\n{{nihongo|'''Poppy Bros. Jr'''|\u30dd\u30d4\u30fc\u30d6\u30ed\u30b9Jr.|Pop\u012b Burozu Junia}}. is an [[elf]]-like enemy seen in many games. They may either be unarmed, throw bombs, or throw boomerangs, and are sometimes found balancing on apples, Maxim Tomatoes, or riding on a mount.  He is the Helper assigned to the Bomb ability in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' and ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]''. {{nihongo|'''Poppy Bros. Sr.'''|\u30dd\u30d4\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30baSr.|Pop\u012b Buraz\u0101zu Shinia}} serves as a boss and is a larger version of the Bomb-wielding Poppy Bros. Jr. They sometimes give Kirby the Bomb or Cutter ability, though most often the former. Poppy Bros. Jr. also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' as a monster in training.\n\n===Pyribbit===\n{{nihongo|'''Pyribbit'''|\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30b2\u30ed\u30e0|Vorugeromu|Volgerom}} is a giant [[frog]] enemy who appears as a boss in [[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]. He lives in volcanic environments, and mainly uses fire and lava based attacks in battle such as fire breath or lava pillars that race towards the platform Kirby stands on. He is found in Endless Explosions and has a more powerful form called {{nihongo|'''Pyribbit DX'''|\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30b2\u30ed\u30e0 DX|Vorugeromu DX|Volgerom DX}}, fought in \"Dededetour\" and \"The True Arena\".\n\n===Squeak Squad===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Squeak Squad'''|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c1\u30a7\u56e3|Dorocche Dan}}, also called the '''Squeaks''', are an [[infamy|infamous]] band of thieves who are the villains in ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]''. When Kirby's cake disappears, Kirby thinks King Dedede took it, but he then finds out the Squeaks stole his cake. Kirby follows the Squeaks throughout the game trying to get his cake back. The Squeaks also stole a treasure chest which Kirby thinks has his cake inside. Kirby has to fight {{nihongo|'''Daroach'''|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30c1\u30a7|Dorocche}}, leader of the Squeaks, at the end of World 6. Once Daroach is beaten, Meta Knight comes out of nowhere and takes the chest. Kirby follows Meta Knight throughout World 7. At World 7's end Kirby fights Meta Knight for the chest. Once Kirby beats Meta Knight, he takes the chest, but the Squeaks come and take it from him. Daroach opens the chest, but instead of the cake, he finds a dark cloud that grabs him. Kirby chases after the cloud in World 8, and eventually fights Dark Daroach. Once Kirby beats it, the dark cloud lets out Daroach. It floats away as a small, black star. Kirby follows the star until it becomes its true form, a dark star called Dark Nebula. Using the Triple Star Rod Daroach gave him, Kirby defeats Dark Nebula. Once Dark Nebula is beaten, the player beats ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. The ending shows Kirby flying back home wondering where his cake went. The Squeaks give Kirby his cake back as an apology for the trouble they put Kirby into. It turns out Meta Knight didn't give Kirby the chest because he didn't want Kirby to let out Dark Nebula.\n\nThe Squeaks later appear in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'', where Daroach gives Kirby hints on where medals are.\n\nDaroach is a playable Dream Friend in ''Kirby Star Allies'', and the other Squeaks show up in some of his attacks.\n\n===Wham Bam Rock===\n{{nihongo|'''Wham Bam Rock'''|\u30ef\u30e0\u30d0\u30e0\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Wamu Bamu Rokku}} first appeared in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', and resembled a tribal head with two floating stone hands. Its motives are unknown, and it appeared as both the final boss of The Great Cave Offensive and as a normal boss character in \"Milky Way Wishes\". In ''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'', it was redesigned to look less organic, though some aspects of its previous design were incorporated into a stronger variant named {{nihongo|'''Wham Bam Jewel'''|\u30ef\u30e0\u30d0\u30e0\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30eb|Wamu Bamu Jueru}}. Wearing a jeweled crown with swinging [[diamond]] earrings, fangs, and three eyes, it serves as the final boss in the \"Helper to Hero\" boss rush along with Wham Bam Rock. Kirby must also defeat his standalone self as the second of the final four bosses in \"The True Arena\". One of his attacks is a reference to the [[finger gun]], in which he points at Kirby and fires. Wham Bam Rock is possibly the inspiration for Master Hand in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n===Whispy Woods===\n{{nihongo|'''Whispy Woods'''|\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30a6\u30c3\u30ba|Wisup\u012b Uzzu}} is a large apple tree whose most common attack is dropping apples from his branches. He generally appears as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]], usually the first one in many ''Kirby'' games and the first boss to appear in the ''Kirby'' series. Also, in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' (and [[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|its remake]]) there exists a related pair of creatures named {{nihongo|'''Twin Woods'''|\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30a6\u30c3\u30ba|Tsuin Uzzu}}, and they can be found in Milky Way Wishes, Revenge of Meta Knight, Meta Knightmare Ultra, The Arena, and Helper to Hero. In \"Revenge of the King\", Whispy Woods comes back as {{nihongo|'''Whispy's Revenge'''|\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30a6\u30c3\u30ba \u30ea\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8|Wisup\u012b Uzzu Ribenji|Whispy Woods Revenge}}. This time, its leaves are purple and it can drop poisonous apples and worms. It can also drop Gordos like Twin Woods, and shoot gusts of wind and small twisters.\n\nWhispy makes appearances in the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]]. He can be seen in ''Kirby''-based stages, blowing wind at the characters and dropping apples.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', a similar creature called {{nihongo|'''King Golem'''|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30b4\u30fc\u30ec\u30e0|Kingu G\u014dremu}} appears, its appearance and attacks identical to that of Whispy Woods. In ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', Whispy appears as a stage in ''Kirby Fighters'' multiplayer. In Story Mode, Taranza uses his power on a nearby plant which grows into {{nihongo|'''Flowery Woods'''|\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30d5\u30e9\u30ef\u30fc\u30ba|Wisup\u012b Furaw\u0101zu|Whispy Flowers}} and is the game's first boss. Unlike Whispy Woods, Flowery Woods can uproot itself and can attack using its roots. In \"Dededetour\", King Dedede's first boss is {{nihongo|'''Flowery Woods DX'''|\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30d5\u30e9\u30ef\u30fc\u30ba DX|Wisup\u012b Furaw\u0101zu DX|Whispy Flowers DX}}. According to its in-game description, Flowery Woods DX's relation to Whispy Woods is unclear. In ''Kirby: Planet Robobot'', a mechanical version of Whispy appears called {{nihongo|'''Clanky Woods'''|\u30a6\u30a3\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30b0|Wisup\u012b B\u014dgu|Whispy Borg}}, and in ''Kirby: Star Allies'' an aged version of Whispy called {{nihongo|'''Yggy Woods'''|\u30e6\u30b0\u30c9\u30e9\u30eb\u30a6\u30c3\u30ba|Yugudoraru Uzzu|Yggdral Woods}} appears alongside Whispy Woods.\n\nThe anime features him as the king of the forest in Dream Land. Whispy is several hundred years old, and very wise, though he has a bit of a temper. He's very kind to his friends, but shows no mercy to those that threaten his kingdom. At first, he believes Kirby and his friends are intruders when they build a campfire around him. It turns out to be a setup by Dedede, who wants to destroy Whispy to build a golf course. After most of the forest is cut down, it is revived by one of Whispy's apples. Dedede continues to constantly try to build his golf course during the series while Whispy becomes Kirby's ally. It is voiced by [[Osamu Hosoi]] in the Japanese version of the anime and by [[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] in the English dub.\n\n===''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'' Bosses===\nThe first four bosses of this game are creations of the sorcerer Yin-Yarn, each being a guardian of one piece of magic yarn; they have not been seen in any other ''Kirby'' game.\n\n* The boss of Grass Land is {{nihongo|'''Fangora'''|\u30c9\u30c9\u30ef\u30f3|Dodowan}}, a [[dragon]] who attacks with its long tongue, strong winds creates with its wings, and fireballs.\n* The boss of Hot Land is {{nihongo|'''Hot Wings'''|\u30d5\u30a7\u30cb\u30af\u30ed\u30a6|Fenikurou}}, a flaming [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] named after the chicken dish, who attacks by shooting fireballs, charging at the player, and summoning enemies.\n* The boss of Treat Land is {{nihongo|'''Squashini'''|\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3|Ranpukin}} (his name is a portmanteau of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] and [[Houdini]]), a [[pumpkin]]-headed [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] who attacks the player with varying magic tricks, selected by a randomised [[slot machine]].\n* Water Land's boss is {{nihongo|'''Capamari'''|\u30a4\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30b3\u30b9|Ikasutakosu}} (a play on \"calamari\", also known as \"Stylocto\" on the American website), a gigantic [[squid]] with a nightcap on its head.\n\nLater bosses in the game are more familiar.\n\n* Snow Land's boss is yarn version of King Dedede, who was teleported to Patch Land by Yin-Yarn, and transformed into a marionette (Kirby can free him by pulling at all the buttons holding him up).\n* The boss of Space Land is Meta Knight, also teleported by Yin-Yarn and brainwashed using a set of enchanted swords (after defeating him, Meta Knight and Kirby team up).\n* Whispy Woods, Kracko, and the Combo Cannon and Halberd's Reactor appear as mini-bosses in Dream Land, and the final boss is Yin-Yarn himself, who assumes two different forms, Yin-Yarn and Mega Yin-Yarn.\n\n==TV Show Characters==\nThese characters only appeared in the anime series ''[[Kirby: Right Back At Ya!]]'' and not in any particular games to date.\n\n===Escargoon===\n{{nihongo|'''Escargoon'''|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30b9\u30ab\u30eb\u30b4\u30f3|Dokut\u0101 Esukarugon|Doctor Escargon}} is a purple [[anthropomorphic]] [[snail]] that serves King Dedede in the anime series. He originally left his mother's farm to become famous and make his mother proud, but ended up serving Dedede instead as his [[personal assistant]]. He helps Dedede's plots by creating various inventions to help defeat Kirby. King Dedede smashes Escargoon as much as he does Kirby, but his loyalty never waivers. Escargoon has a [[goatee]]. He is voiced by [[Naoki Tatsuta]] in the Japanese version and by [[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ted Lewis]] in the English dub impersonating [[Paul Lynde]].\n\nAlthough he was an anime-exclusive character, Escargoon makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'', as part of one of King Dedede's attacks (along with several Waddle Dees) in the sub-game ''Kirby Quest''.\n\n===Sir Ebrum & Lady Like===\n{{nihongo|'''Sir Ebrum'''|\u30d1\u30fc\u30e0|P\u0101mu}} and {{nihongo|'''Lady Like'''|\u30e1\u30fc\u30e0|M\u0113mu}} are the parents of Tiff and Tuff, who work and live in King Dedede's Castle and keep peace between their strong-willed offspring and their rambunctious employer.

Lady Like is voiced by [[Yuko Mizutani]] in the Japanese version and [[Kayzie Rogers]] impersonating [[Eva Gabor]] in the English dub.\n\n===Tiff & Tuff===\n{{nihongo|'''Tiff'''|\u30d5\u30fc\u30e0|F\u016bmu}} and {{nihongo|'''Tuff'''|\u30d6\u30f3|Bun}} are the brother and sister duo that accompany Kirby in the anime series where they are the children of Sir Ebrum and Lady Like.

Tuff is voiced by [[Rika Komatsu]] in the Japanese version and [[Kayzie Rogers]] in the English dub.\n\n===Biblio===\n{{nihongo|'''Biblio'''|\u30d3\u30d6\u30ea|Biburi|Bibli}} is a Cappy who wears glasses and runs a [[Bookselling|book store]] in Cappy Town.

Kirby Quiz Show\" (\"The Kirby Quiz\" in the dub), he hosts a quiz show to welcome the new year with questions about the series. Until the final episode, only the top half of his body is shown, giving King Dedede and Escargoon the illusion of him being a tall human. In the finale, he is revealed to be very short with tiny Kirby-like feet below his waist. When Dedede and Escargoon meet him in person, they decide to get revenge on the Sales Guy for all the trouble he gave them by feeding him Chef Kawasaki's horrid cooking.\n\nAlthough he is considered an anime only character, the Sales Guy appears in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'' in the sub-game Strato Patrol EOS at the game over screen.\n\nThe Sales Guy is voiced by [[Banjo Ginga]] in the original version and by [[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] in the English Dub.\n\n===Monsters===\n{{expand section|date=November 2012}}\n{{nihongo|'''Monsters'''|\u9b54\u7363|Maj\u016b}} are the fiendish creatures in the anime.

It was sent by Nightmare to steal Galaxia and hid it in a dark cave until Meta Knight and Garlude succeeded in reclaiming it, with the latter sacrificing herself knowing that the former would be the one to wield Galaxia and thus being killed by the monster in the process. In the present, King Dedede, scared out of his wits of Sirica, consulted the N.M.E. Sales Guy about it, and he sent Kirisakin over to him. It quickly bested Sirica, Sword Knight and Blade Knight before ultimately being destroyed by Galaxia Sword Kirby, avenging Garlude's death as a result.\n* {{nihongo|'''Max Flexer'''|\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30e7\u30b5\u30f3|Machosan}} - A fitness-obsessed monster with brown skin and a pink afro. In \"Fitness Fiend\", King Dedede orders a supply of additive-packed potato chips from NightMare Enterprises designed to bloat Kirby into helplessness, except Dedede forgets this and ends up eating the chips himself until he and Kirby are both morbidly obese. Max Flexer is then purchased to help them burn off the fat, but Max's real motive is to destroy Kirby while he is too fat to inhale. After spitting out the chips to lose the excess weight, Kirby inhales Max's headset microphone and becomes Mike Kirby, whose singing destroys the monster and much of Dedede's castle. Max Flexer also appears in ''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'' as an enemy in the \"Kirby Quest\" sub-game, making him the first anime monster to appear in a ''Kirby'' game.\n* {{nihongo|'''Head Cold Monsters'''|{{ruby-ja|\u98a8\u90aa|\u304b\u305c}}\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u30b9{{ruby-ja|\u9b54\u7363|\u307e\u3058\u3085\u3046}}|Kaze Wirusu Maj\u016b|Cold Virus Monster}} - Microscopic cold monsters appearing in \"Something to Sneeze At\".

In \"The School Scam\", they attend the Dedede Academy school and Tiff attempts in vain to tame them, leading her to train with Meta Knight in how to defend herself and fight back. After she humiliates all three, they turn into a three-headed monster called MT2, who is capable of flight, spits out school supplies, and uses Kirk's mohawk to attack. MT2 is destroyed by Fighter Kirby.\n* {{nihongo|'''Delivery Man'''|\u30c7\u30ea\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3|Deribar\u012bman}} - A robot riding a motorcycle who, just like his name suggests, excels at making deliveries.

It is destroyed by Spark Kirby.\n* {{nihongo|'''Rekketsu'''|\u30ec\u30c3\u30b1\u30c4}} - A [[samurai]] monster teacher known for his fierce temper. In \"Teacher's Threat\", he is sent to King Dedede by NightMare Enterprises to deal with Kirby, since Mr. Chip is just too nice and friendly to do anything bad to any of his students. His weapons are a [[bokken]] and an energy [[katana]], and he can stretch his arms to abnormal lengths.

In \"A Sunsational Surprise\", the fans delivered by NightMare Enterprises make it hot outside during daytime and create a hole in the ozone layer, which is where the monster takes up residence. Jet Kirby ends up failing to destroy it, but Bomb Kirby succeeds in doing so as the monster cannot heal due to the rapid damage it takes from his bombs.\n* {{nihongo|'''Ebifryer'''|\u30a8\u30d3\u30d5\u30ea\u30e3\u30fc|Ebifury\u0101}} - A monster created from the fusion of Chef Nagoya's ingredients and ingredients from NightMare Enterprises that uses claws and fire spewed from its mouth to attack.
