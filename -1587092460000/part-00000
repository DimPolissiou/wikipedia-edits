Feist]], and where most of his [[The Riftwar Cycle|Riftwar books]] take place. Only the [[Empire Trilogy]], which was co-written with [[Janny Wurts]], takes place entirely on [[Kelewan]], another world connected to Midkemia by magically created rifts in space.\n\n===Geography===\nMidkemia is very similar to Earth in climate, and its flora and fauna. It has three continents: Triagia, Novindus and Wi\u00f1et. It has two oceans, though there are various names for them depending on the continent or nation. The Endless Sea is west of Triagia and is east of Novindus where it is called the Blue Sea. The Sea of Tears is east of Triagia and west of Novindus where it is called the Green Sea.\n\n====Triagia====\n'''Triagia''' is the largest continent on Midkemia.  Humans constitute the vast majority of the population of this continent, with other races contributing almost negligibly to the total. The extreme north is mostly sparsely inhabited wilderness with few enduring settlements. The continent surrounds, but does not completely enclose, two large seas, the Bitter Sea to the west and the Sea of Kingdoms to the east, which together form a moderately-sized isthmus in the middle of Triaga located about one-third of the length of the continent from south to north. The northern portion is heavily forested, but the south has few forests and is described in ways that would suggest a more equatorial latitude. The Jal-Pur desert is the most notable desert on the continent and occupies most of the central expanse of the southern landmass. The two largest nations on this continent are, from south to north, [[the Empire of Great Kesh]] and [[the Kingdom of the Isles]].\n\nThe northern parts of Triagia seem to be based on European culture \u2013 for example, Bas-Tyra is based on France, and Rodez on Spain \u2013 while the south is based on Africa and the Middle East \u2013 for example, the women of the Jal-Pur desert in Kesh wear head coverings similar to the hijab worn by women in Islamic cultures.\n\nThe vast majority of Feist's work which feature Midkemia occur at least in part on Triagia, and most take place there in their entirety.\n\n====Novindus====\n'''[[Novindus]]''' is the second largest continent on Midkemia with a variety of landscapes. It is to the west of the Triagia across the Endless Sea and to the east across the Sea of Tears, and it is not immediately clear from the literature which is the closer distance, suggesting that it is probably close to halfway around the globe in either direction.  Politically, it has a collection of largely independent city-states which are spread out across the continent but form no overarching political system.\n\nIt is first seen (called simply \"The Southern Continent\") in ''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]'' where [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug]] and [[Ashen-Shugar/Tomas|Tomas]] arrive there on a quest to the Halls of the Dead, to which there is an entrance from this continent (though living people usually do not venture there) and where the goddess Lims-Kragma judges the dead. Inhabitants mentioned are the sinister [[Pantathians]] (snake-men) who live in the continent's southern part and their sworn enemies the tiger-men \u2013 both races being creations of the ancient Valheru.  There is also mention of both goblins and dwarves living on this continent.\n\nThe continent also featured highly in Feist's [[Serpent War]] saga, in which the continent was largely laid to waste.\n\n[[Macros the Black]] owns at least one map of this continent, and when Pug inherits this chart it is the first mention of another continent on Midkemia. Before learning of this map, the Endless Sea was believed to be infinite. The first novel to describe the continent and have part of its story set there is ''[[The King's Buccaneer]]'', in which the youngest Son of Prince Arutha travels there to rescue two young noblewomen who were captured during a raid on Crydee, on the west coast. Although few characters have any knowledge of the continent before actually going there, the gambler Nakor claims to have been there before, but did not know the continent's name.\n\nThis continent seems to be based on India, evident in its shape, name, customs and the fact that the tallest mountain in the world is on this continent.\n\n====Wi\u00f1et====\nThe third continent on Midkemia. Sometime ages ago, part of the continent rose up some 600 feet creating an isolated plateau. In later books it is disclosed that the lower portion of the continent was settled by refugees from Triagia, during the purging of the Ishapian Temple of the Heretics of Al-maral. The upper portion (The Ethel-Duath) was populated by the Saaur lizard-men, a race of nomadic warriors also created by ''Alma-Lodaka'' but who were left on the world of Shila, rather than Midkemia, and who were brought to serve the Emerald Queen during the Serpentwar Saga. After the war was concluded, they were relocated by the magician Pug, who sought to remove them from the Kingdom without fighting.\n\n===Technology and magic===\nDuring the period in which Feist's current books are set, Midkemia is on a technological par with 14th to 15th century [[Europe]], with a few anachronisms. For example, shipbuilding seems to be as advanced as 17th-century Europe, with three-masted square-riggers in evidence but no [[gunpowder]] or [[cannon]]s, though [[naphtha]] and Quegan fire oil is known. Generally, the world seems to be in a mostly pre-industrial agrarian state.\n\nMagic in Midkemia is practiced by very few people. To the eyes of any nonmagician, anything that a person can do that cannot be explained is labeled magical. In the more superstitious rural areas, magic-users are usually shunned, or worse, captured and killed. Duke Borric of Crydee, with his foresight, bequeathed an island to [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug]] to start an academy devoted to magical studies, where magicians can gather without fear of discrimination and prejudice.\n\nWith Pug's education on [[Kelewan]], it is revealed that these Midkemian arts are considered the Lesser Path of Magic, and the Kelewan magic is the so-called Greater Path. The Lesser Arts were seen as rudimentary talents, more focused to the very nature of magic, while the Greater Arts were seen as having greater effectiveness and practicality such as teleportation, conjuring energy from nothing, and so on; it is later realised that this is a misconception brought about because there are very few Lesser Path magicians on Kelewan, and those that are have little power and training, and as a result the Lesser Path has not developed to the same level as the Greater, as it has on Midkemia (though there are few Greater Path magicians on Midkemia and it is not widely known of). Under extreme duress (being tortured on Kelewan), Pug discovered that he could use Lesser Path magic even though at the time his mind was more attuned to Greater Path magic, an unprecedented feat. The Paths are normally mutually exclusive \u2013 a Greater Path magician would not be able to invoke Lesser Path powers and skills.\n\nThere are several great magicians on Midkemia whose powers do not fit this dual-path model; Macros the Black, Pug conDoin (in his later years), Nakor the Isalani, Miranda, and Magnus, son of Pug and Miranda (and Robert De Lyse a student of Pug). Macros possessed abilities transcending the traditional Greater and Lesser Paths of magic; it is inconclusive whether this ability is a part of his gift upon becoming the agent for Sarig the \"Lost\" God of Magic (in truth it is Ban-ath, the God of thieves and gambler), or if Macros was simply born with the ability like Pug. Similarly, Macros's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pug, his daughter Miranda, and his grandson Magnus also possessed the ability to invoke Lesser or Greater path powers at will. Nakor also wielded magic not confined to the classical definition of Lesser and Greater paths, though he insists upon the idea that \"there is no magic\", but merely \"tricks\" in manipulating some elemental forces of the world. As the books progress, Pug comes to the realisation that Nakor is correct, and the limits of magic are merely a result of a lack of understanding among magicians.\n\nClerics are also known to have their own forms of magic, which vary depending on the order they belong to.\n\n====Rifts====\nThese are instantaneous links between two places, often on entirely different planets or levels of reality. The Riftwar Saga involved the rift between Midkemia and the world of the [[Tsurani]]. They can be created (with difficulty) by proficient users of the Greater Magic, but the Tsurani maintained one using a machine. They are sometimes created by accident and fluke. Most rifts are unstable, and so move about in space. The Tsurani's machine was one of the first known devices to stabilise a rift and to make it fixed in one position. Rifts, whilst a powerful device for travelling, are a risky device as they attract the attention of the Enemy, an evil being of immense power and the foe behind the events in the books ''Silverthorn'' and ''A Darkness At Sethanon''.\n\nThroughout the rest of Midkemia's history various other rifts have appeared that are different from the norm. At the end of the SerpentWar Saga [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug]], [[Nakor]], Tomas and Miranda encounter a rift that is connected to [[Nalar]]. They fight Zaltais who is a being from Nalar's thoughts and force him into the rift.\n\nDuring Kaspar's exile on Novindus he encounters some strange creatures and also 'wrong' armour. After his visit to the Pavilion of the Gods he learns that these creatures are coming from magnet driven rifts. The magnets being the 'wrong' armour, which is known as Talnoy who come from a dark planet on a separate plane of reality known as [[Kosridi]].\n\nNakor is also found to have the ability to create what are thought to be controllable rifts of a diminutive size which are undetectable to the Enemy (possibly due to their size).Though when questioned by Pug he is unsure if referring to them as rifts is adequate but he suggests that they are foldings in space but is quite sure they are not rifts but different. Much the same as anything else to do with Nakor his bag is a mystery still to be revealed. These \"rifts\" are placed in the lining of his travel bag allowing access to a cave, where Nakor stores items he may need, and a warehouse containing oranges (one of Nakor's most well-known traits is the seemingly never-ending supply of oranges he carries with him).\n\n===Races===\n\n====Humans====\nHumans fled to Midkemia through rifts in space-time when the Dragon Lords rose up to challenge the gods and have become the dominant race on the planet. Humanity on Midkemia is as diverse as it is on Earth, with many clear analogues to real-world cultures, from Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.\n\n====Elves====\n{{Further|Elvandar}}\nKnown in their own language as '''Edhel''' (The People), and as Elves by humans, this ancient race was created by the Valheru to serve them as slaves.  Over time they have evolved into several distinct groups: \n*'''''Eldar:''''' the wise ones; originally librarians and the keepers of lore and of plundered artefacts for their Valheru masters these elves were scattered across worlds during the chaos wars; some would remain trapped on the world of Kelewan for millennia before returning to Midkemia and Elvandar, while others would eventually evolve into the Taredhel.  \n*'''''Eledhel:''''' People of Light; originally the tenders of fields and forests under the Valheru the Eledhel now inhabit an ancient forest within the Western Realm of the Kingdom, where they have built the 'City of Lights' Elvandar; the Eledhel have long been led by a monarchy, even before the Valheru finally left Midkemia.  \n*'''''Moredhel:''''' People of Darkness; originally the slaves that tended directly to their Valheru masters and their dwellings the Moredhel were twisted by their proximity to the Dragon Lords and sought to claim the power of the Valheru for themselves, once they were gone, seeing themselves as the rightful heirs to Midkemia; this attempt to claim Valheru power is known as 'The Dark Path' and as such the Moredhel are known to humans as 'The Brotherhood of the Dark Path'.  \n*'''''Glamredhel:''''' People of Madness; these elves went mad during, or shortly after, the upheavals of the chaos wars; they eventually regained their sanity and went on to found their own city based, warlike civilisation, before being almost completely destroyed by the Moredhel; for a time they dwelled among the Eledhel in Elvandar but were never fully at home there.  \n*'''''Ocedhel:''''' People of the Sea; these are the elves from the continent of Novindus; separated from other elves they lost most of the knowledge and language of their people and were almost destroyed by the army of the Emerald Queen during the Serpent War; the survivors were rescued and brought to live in Elvandar.  \n*'''''Anoredhel:''''' People of the Sun; known by the Valheru as the '''Tirithedhel''' (Guardian Elves) the Anoredhel guard the Sven'gar'ri and their tenders the Quor, an ancient mission given to them by the Valheru; they reside in Baranor in the Peaks of the Quor.  \n*'''''Taredhel:''''' People of the Stars; once Eldar, these elves evolved after their abandonment by the Valheru in to a powerful and arrogant race with an empire that spanned several worlds until they were forced to retreat to Midkemia by an invasion of Demons; many share the Moredhel vision of succeeding the Valheru.\n\nThe elves were originally the servants of the Valheru, until Ashen-Shugar released them when the other Valheru went to fight the chaos wars. The Anoredhel, or Tirithedhel (Guardian Elves) in the Valheru language, were freed, but Ashen-Shugar requested that they remained in the position as guardians of the Quor.\n\nMany years before the Riftwar, a moredhel chieftain Murmandamus once united the moredhel clans of the north in a Great Uprising to conquer the glamredhel. When Murmandamus was killed, the moredhel clans scattered and fled back to the Northlands, never again uniting under a single true leader.\n\nAfter the war between Kelewan and Midkemia, the Moredhel, Goblins, and several bands of renegade humans again united for a couple years to wage war against the Kingdom (chronicled in ''Silverthorn'' and ''Darkness at Sethanon''), under the false prophet Murmandamus, who was actually just a powerful Pantathian (serpent man, servant of the Dragon Host) priest in a magical disguise. Under his leadership and magic powered by death, the Valheru were briefly freed again upon Midkemia, only to be immediately imprisoned within the Lifestone due to the combined efforts of Milamber (as Pug is also known), Arutha, Tomas/Ashen-Shugar, Macros, Hochopepa, Elhagar, Dolgan (and his armies), Black Guy (and his Hadati refugees), Amos Trask, Squires Jimmy and Locklear, Duke Martin, the hadati Baru (who killed Murmandamus' general in ''Silverthorn''), Duke Laurie, Galain (and his small elven host), the Sethanon Garrison, a greater dragon Ryath, and several other prominent characters.\n\nIn recent history the Glamhedrel joined the court of the Eledhel and they uneasily became one people.\n\nMoredhel that have a philosophical awakening and choose to become one with the Eledhel are known as 'returned'.\n\n====Dwarves====\nDwarves are a long-lived race, reaching hundreds of years in age. The main Dwarves found in Feist's works are the dwarves of the West, most often the Grey Tower dwarves led by Dolgan, of Tholin's line, at village Caldara. There is another dwarven kingdom in the West: the Stone Mountain dwarves, led by Harthorn, of Hogar's line, at village Delmoria. In the east, the dwarves make their home at Dorgin, under the banner of King Halfdan. There is also mention of a dwarven city, ''Sarakan'', across the sea on the continent of Novindus, found in the Ratn'gary Mountains.\n\n====Valheru====\n'''Valheru''', also called ''The Dragon Lords'', were the first race on Midkemia, and among the most powerful in the known universe. They rode on the backs of great dragons, travelling throughout the cosmos in search of plunder, and proved superior to all other races and cultures which they met and destroyed \u2013 some of these being themselves highly technological interstellar empires. Arrogantly presuming themselves to be gods, they also created lesser races to serve as slaves.\n\nAs a result of their wanton acts of destruction throughout the universe, energy was released from what were once mighty civilizations. Reaching a critical point, these energies formed a new pantheon of gods. While the new gods strove among themselves, the Valheru, exhorted by Draken-Korin, attempted to overthrow the new order of gods.\n\nAshen-Shugar was the only Dragon Lord to disapprove of his son's plan, but he did nothing but watch as the other Dragon Lords rose to battle the gods. Ashen-Shugar, the most powerful of the Valheru, felt something \"alien\" to his kind, a desire to protect the world, and the presence of [[Ashen-Shugar/Tomas|Tomas]] via the magics of Macros the Black.  With the coming of the new gods Ashen Shugar felt himself become alien to the new order, as if reality rejected his nature and he fell into a torpor, sleeping in his mountain on his throne many ages after the rest of the Valheru had gone away. Upon his death his essence became infused in his armor so that Tomas could replace him as guardian of Midkemia.\n\nSpace and time became warped as the Valheru battled the gods in the time known as the Chaos Wars. Of one hundred gods, only sixteen survived, but the Valheru were defeated. With the exception of Ashen-Shugar, the Valheru were cast away into another dimension to prevent them from returning to their homeworld, Midkemia.\n\nIn ''A Darkness at Sethanon'' the Valheru briefly returned to Midkemia at the end of the book, Draken-Koren and Tomas/Ashen-Shugar fought and Tomas impaled Draken-Korin to the Lifestone, and the Lifestone sealed the Valheru in it and prevented the end of Midkemia. Tomas's blade was left in the Lifestone for 50 years until ''Rage of a Demon King''.\n\nIn ''Rage of a Demon King'', Pug, Miranda, Nakor, Tomas and Calis, along with Brother Dominic of the Priesthood of Ishap and Sho Pi (a former Monk of Dala and, until near the end of ''Shards of a Broken Crown'', Nakor's disciple), went to Sethanon to the Lifestone. Calis, being human, elven and Valheru, managed to undo the Lifestone over a period of many hours and amidst a battle with Jakan, a demon who sought the Lifestone for his own selfish gain. After defeating Jakan, the Lifestone (Which had the Valheru trapped inside) was destroyed forever, and with it the Valheru. Calis and Tomas/Ashen-Shugar suffer a painful transformation as this occurs, as their Valheru parts are \"returned to the world\", but being \"more than Valheru\", they survive.\n\n;Known Valheru\n*''Ashen-Shugar'' \u2013 Ruler of the Eagles Reaches; the most powerful Valheru; son of Hali-Marmora; father and husband to Alma-Lodaka; father of Draken-Korin; the last of the Valheru; reincarnated in the body of Tomas Megarson, son of Megar and Magya of Crydee, Prince Consort of Queen Aglaranna and Warleader of Elvandar, father of Calis.\n*''Draken-Korin'' \u2013 Lord of Tigers, son of Ashen-Shugar and Alma-Lodaka, slain by Ashen-Shugar at the end of the Chaos Wars; returned briefly to activate the Lifestone but was slain again by Tomas/Ashen-Shugar. Returns a second time at the end in Book 1 of the Chaoswar Saga, by reincarnating in the body of a mercenary warrior.\n*''Alma-Lodaka'' \u2013 the Emerald Queen of Serpents; daughter and wife of Ashen-Shugar; mother of Draken-Korin; nearly reincarnated in a body of Lady Clovis, also known as Jorna, wife of Nakor then of Macros, mother of Miranda by Macros.\n*''Algon-Kokoon'' \u2013 Tyrant of Wind Valley, slain by Ashen-Shugar\n*''Alrin-Stolda'' \u2013 Monarch of the Black Lake\n*''Hali-Marmora'' \u2013 Mother of Ashen-Shugar; slain by Ashen-Shugar\n*''Lowris-Tanaka'' \u2013 King of Bats; Ashen-Shugar's first Dragon Lord kill\n*''Lyron-Baktos'' \u2013 Lord of the Dragons; whose talisman was used to incapacitate the Oracle of Aal\n*''Kindo-Raber'' \u2013 Master of Serpents; torn apart by the Dasati\n\n====Tomas====\n{{further|The Serpentwar Saga#Characters}}\nTomas Megarson was born a kitchen boy in Castle Crydee. Due to the manipulations of the sorcerer Macros the Black, he received a gift of white and gold armor and a golden sword from the dragon Rhuagh and merged with the essence of the long-dead Dragon Lord, [[Ashen-Shugar/Tomas|Ashen-Shugar]], to be a weapon against the outworld invaders.\n\nFor a while, the newly melded being was consumed by the battle-madness of the Valheru, before the compassion of a human boy won through, and Tomas, the human, mastered the powers of a Dragon Lord. While the elves, whom he sought refuge with, feared dominion from the Dragon Lord, Tomas assuaged their fears, becoming merely the prince consort of their Queen Aglaranna. While Tomas gained the full might of Ashen-Shugar, he eventually lost much of this power during the events of the Serpentwar. Tomas still stands as one of the most powerful people in Midkemia, with few able to match him.\n\nDue to some unforeseen circumstances, the human-turned-Valheru and the Elf Queen conceived a child possessing the heritage of all three races. Calis, son of Tomas and Aglaranna, would be unique throughout the world, neither human nor elf. He would also be instrumental during the Serpentwar invasion, first by creating the Crimson Eagles military commandos, then later dismantling a powerful artifact capable of draining all life in the world.\n\nFinally accepting his lot in fate, Calis settled down in Elvandar with a widowed elf, also adopting twins who were refugees from the recent war.\n\n====Other creatures====\nMidkemia is a deeply magical place, though predominantly populated by [[humans]]. [[elf|Elves]], [[trolls]], [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[goblins]], [[dragons]], and other, more exotic forms of intelligent life can be found, representing most usual species in fantasy literature.\n\nAlso, Feist has made his own more unusual additions, including the [[Pantathians]], a race of serpent-men bent on returning their evil goddess to this plane of existence; the [[#Valheru|Valheru]], an ancient race of godlike warriors and dragon-riders who plundered the universe for millions of years before being banished by the gods; and the gwali, a shy forest species.\n\nDragons are the most ancient race in Midkemia after the Dragon Lords. They served the Valheru as mounts. Since the fall of the Dragon Lords, the dragons have generally isolated themselves from contact with any other race. A notable character, Rhuagh, was an ancient gold dragon who lived in the Mac Mordain Cadal mines. He befriended Macros the Black. Many years later, Tomas and the dwarf chieftain Dolgan would stand on his deathwatch as he told them of his life. His daughter, Ryath, aided Pug and Tomas in their search for Macros the Black. She perished in battle with a Dreadlord, though her body lived on as a vessel for the Oracle of Aal. In return for her sacrifice, Pug took in her daughter Ryana, to his island where she would be cared for until she could survive on her own.\n\nGiants, standing at an average of twelve feet tall, form no civilized society, living as little more than wild animals in the Northlands. The moredhel were known to recruit giants into their army.\n\n===Gods===\nIn the beginning, there were only two gods. '''Rythar''', '''Goddess of Order''', took the 'threads of power' and weaved them together, forming the fabric of space-time. '''Mythar''', '''God of Chaos''', took this fabric and tore them asunder. The remains are then gathered back by Rythar and the cycle begins again. Eventually however some threads were unseen by Rythar and fell not to be rewoven, forming the race that would come to be known as the Valheru .\n\nThe two '''''Blind Gods of the Beginning''''' were deposed when the universe reordered itself. Without Rythar to knit together the strings of power, they became the new order of gods, a hundred in total. There were the seven Greater Gods and the other 93 are Lesser Gods. '''Ishap''' is the most important of the Greater Gods being the one who created all of the lesser Gods and Goddess, being the Balancer. Slightly less in power and authority are '''Arch-Indar''', Goddess of Good, and '''Nalar''', God of Evil. The other four Greater Gods are called the Builders, composed of the four traits within all mortal races.\n\nDuring the Chaos Wars, when the Valheru rose up to challenge the new order of gods, the gods were unprepared while they still contended against each other for control of various domains. As a result, most of the gods were slain, including Ishap, Arch-Indar, Wodar-Hospur, and many others. The remaining gods worked in concert, and cast the Valheru into another dimension, but the damage was done. Without the Goddess of Good to offset the God of Evil, and without the Balancer to balance all actions, the four Builder Gods exiled the God of Evil to a distant universe. Nalar is to remain imprisoned until the continual worship from the mortal races could revive the 'dead' Ishap and Arch-Indar.\n\nMany important Lesser Gods also perished, with great consequences. Tith and Onanka combined their essences to form a new being, the two faced god of war. Killian, Goddess of Nature, took over the domain of Eortis, God of the Sea. Sarig, God of Magic, sought to return by appointing an avatar to work for the betterment of magic, to eventually ascend as the new god of magic.\n\nNakor the Isalini also theorized that the universe itself is another, ultimate god, having become reality as mortals perceive it in an attempt to understand itself.\n\n====Greater gods====\nThe first gods.\n* Rythar \u2013 the Goddess of Order\n* Mythar \u2013 the God of Chaos\n\nAfter the falling of the first gods\n* Ishap \u2013 the Matrix; God of Balance (order); He who is Above All (currently dead, but returning).\n* Arch-Indar \u2013 the Selfless; Goddess of good; She who is perfection (currently dead, but returning).\n* Nalar (the Nameless one) \u2013 the Selfish; God of Evil; The Mad God (currently sealed away).\n* Abrem-Sev \u2013 Forger of Action; the Giver of Laws.\n* Ev-Dem \u2013 Worker from Within; Calculator of Odds.\n* Graff \u2013 Weaver of Desire\n* Helbinor \u2013 the Abstainer\n\n====Lesser gods====\n* Astalon \u2013 The Just; the Builder; Who Brought Order.\n* Banath (Kalkin) \u2013 The Artful Dodger; the Prankster; the Nightwalker; God of Hopeless Quests and Misadventures.\n* Dala \u2013 Shield of the Weak; Goddess of Passive Strength; the Protector\n* Guis-wan (Fimbulstran) \u2013 The Bayer after Moons; the Red-jawed Hunter; the Wanter of All Things.\n* Ka-hooli \u2013 The Howler After Fugitives; the Unraveller of Mysteries of Truth; God of Justice/Vengeance.\n* Killian \u2013 The Singer of Green Silences; the Gatherer of Quiet Pleasures; the Goddess of Love; Goddess of Nature.\n* Lims- Kragma (Zandros) (Khali-shi) \u2013 The Drawer of Nets, She who Waits; the Mistress of Death; Judger of Souls.\n* Prandur (Jehan-suz) (Agni) \u2013 The Burner of Cities; the Light Bringer; God of Fire.\n* Ruthia \u2013 The Dancer through Men's Hearts; the Goddess of Love Scorned; Lady of Luck.\n* Silban \u2013 The Earthmother, the Bringer of the Harvests; Sleeper without Dreams.\n* Sung (LaTimsa) \u2013 The White; the Pure; the Follower of one Path.\n* Tith-Onanka \u2013 The War God; the Tactician (Planner of Battles); the Joyful Warrior.\n\n====Dead gods====\nThe dead gods might some day return to power.\n\n* Drusala \u2013 Goddess of Healing.

Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' are usually acknowledged as indebted to him to some extent, Feist has fairly directly borrowed elements amounting to entire cultures. The elves are described using Tolkien's own words, including borrowings from his [[Elvish language]]s (for example, ''moredhel'', Feist's name for his \"dark elves\", is found in Tolkien and comes from the [[Sindarin]] elements ''mor'' 'dark' and ''edhel'' 'elf'). The Elven city of [[Elvandar]] is heavily borrowed from [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], and the Mac Mordain Cadal is certainly influenced by [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. However, Feist's Elves - unlike Tolkien's \u2013 do age and eventually die, though they are very long-lived. Feist's Dwarves are also distinctly [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|Tolkienesque]]. Feist himself is forthcoming about the influence, calling his use of Sindar an \"homage\". Readers have noted that the influences are less pronounced in later books.\n\nAlso Feist has borrowed and used cultures throughout history to base his nations, countries and people in, such as Roman influences in the Quegan culture, Arabian influences in Keshian culture, and Asian influences in the Tsurani culture (one of several influences from [[M. A. R. Barker]]'s ''[[T\u00e9kumel]]''). From references, it can also be inferred that Kinnoch is influenced by Ireland, Krondor by London, Darkmoor by Germany, Bas-Tyra by France, Novindus by India and Australia, and Rodez by Spain.\n\nMidkemia is the world setting from Feist's college role-playing group, also known as the Thursday Nighters (until they became the Friday Nighters due to late games and early morning classes), which had begun as an outgrowth of the Triton Wargaming Society at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). [[Dungeons and Dragons]] (D&D), published by [[TSR, Inc.]], formed the root of the Midkemian game, but like many groups playing D&D at that time, the Thursday Nighters modified and evolved the rules wholesale, until they were barely recognizable as having any relationship to D&D. Feist came into this group after the original campaign had been developed by fellow students at UCSD, and played for three years before he began writing his stories, the first of which were humorous short stories set in the game realm. None of those stories were ever published. Later Feist decided to try his hand at serious fantasy, and asked if anyone objected to his using Midkemia, as it saved him the trouble of world-building from scratch. Feist has mentioned on many occasions that many of the constraints of that world created dramatic issues he would never have dreamed up on his own, and for which he was grateful. Several of the novels are dedicated to other members of that group from college. None of his books are based on campaigns, as the game takes place roughly 500 years after the novel ''Magician''. Feist has likened himself more to historical novelists rather than fantasy writers, stating that he writes \"historical novels about a place that doesn't exist\". None of his characters are \"player characters\" from these Friday Nighter sessions, save two, Praji and Vaja, introduced in the novel The King's Buccaneer, characters created for Feist's campaign, by his college friend, Richard Spahl.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riftwar Cycle, The}}\n[[Category:High fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Works by Raymond E.

As a result, much of the background of [[Kelewan]] - the Tsurani Empire, the lack of metals and horses, the Cho'ja, the pantheons of 10 major and 10 minor gods - comes from [[Tekumel]].

Feist]], and where most of his [[The Riftwar Cycle|Riftwar books]] take place. Only the [[Empire Trilogy]], which was co-written with [[Janny Wurts]], takes place entirely on [[Kelewan]], another world connected to Midkemia by magically created rifts in space.\n\n===Geography===\nMidkemia is very similar to Earth in climate, and its flora and fauna. It has three continents: Triagia, Novindus and Wi\u00f1et. It has two oceans, though there are various names for them depending on the continent or nation. The Endless Sea is west of Triagia and is east of Novindus where it is called the Blue Sea. The Sea of Tears is east of Triagia and west of Novindus where it is called the Green Sea.\n\n====Triagia====\n'''Triagia''' is the largest continent on Midkemia.  Humans constitute the vast majority of the population of this continent, with other races contributing almost negligibly to the total. The extreme north is mostly sparsely inhabited wilderness with few enduring settlements. The continent surrounds, but does not completely enclose, two large seas, the Bitter Sea to the west and the Sea of Kingdoms to the east, which together form a moderately-sized isthmus in the middle of Triaga located about one-third of the length of the continent from south to north. The northern portion is heavily forested, but the south has few forests and is described in ways that would suggest a more equatorial latitude. The Jal-Pur desert is the most notable desert on the continent and occupies most of the central expanse of the southern landmass. The two largest nations on this continent are, from south to north, [[the Empire of Great Kesh]] and [[the Kingdom of the Isles]].\n\nThe northern parts of Triagia seem to be based on European culture \u2013 for example, Bas-Tyra is based on France, and Rodez on Spain \u2013 while the south is based on Africa and the Middle East \u2013 for example, the women of the Jal-Pur desert in Kesh wear head coverings similar to the hijab worn by women in Islamic cultures.\n\nThe vast majority of Feist's work which feature Midkemia occur at least in part on Triagia, and most take place there in their entirety.\n\n====Novindus====\n'''[[Novindus]]''' is the second largest continent on Midkemia with a variety of landscapes. It is to the west of the Triagia across the Endless Sea and to the east across the Sea of Tears, and it is not immediately clear from the literature which is the closer distance, suggesting that it is probably close to halfway around the globe in either direction.  Politically, it has a collection of largely independent city-states which are spread out across the continent but form no overarching political system.\n\nIt is first seen (called simply \"The Southern Continent\") in ''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]'' where [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug]] and [[Ashen-Shugar/Tomas|Tomas]] arrive there on a quest to the Halls of the Dead, to which there is an entrance from this continent (though living people usually do not venture there) and where the goddess Lims-Kragma judges the dead. Inhabitants mentioned are the sinister [[Pantathians]] (snake-men) who live in the continent's southern part and their sworn enemies the tiger-men \u2013 both races being creations of the ancient Valheru.  There is also mention of both goblins and dwarves living on this continent.\n\nThe continent also featured highly in Feist's [[Serpent War]] saga, in which the continent was largely laid to waste.\n\n[[Macros the Black]] owns at least one map of this continent, and when Pug inherits this chart it is the first mention of another continent on Midkemia. Before learning of this map, the Endless Sea was believed to be infinite. The first novel to describe the continent and have part of its story set there is ''[[The King's Buccaneer]]'', in which the youngest Son of Prince Arutha travels there to rescue two young noblewomen who were captured during a raid on Crydee, on the west coast. Although few characters have any knowledge of the continent before actually going there, the gambler Nakor claims to have been there before, but did not know the continent's name.\n\nThis continent seems to be based on India, evident in its shape, name, customs and the fact that the tallest mountain in the world is on this continent.\n\n====Wi\u00f1et====\nThe third continent on Midkemia. Sometime ages ago, part of the continent rose up some 600 feet creating an isolated plateau. In later books it is disclosed that the lower portion of the continent was settled by refugees from Triagia, during the purging of the Ishapian Temple of the Heretics of Al-maral. The upper portion (The Ethel-Duath) was populated by the Saaur lizard-men, a race of nomadic warriors also created by ''Alma-Lodaka'' but who were left on the world of Shila, rather than Midkemia, and who were brought to serve the Emerald Queen during the Serpentwar Saga. After the war was concluded, they were relocated by the magician Pug, who sought to remove them from the Kingdom without fighting.\n\n===Technology and magic===\nDuring the period in which Feist's current books are set, Midkemia is on a technological par with 14th to 15th century [[Europe]], with a few anachronisms. For example, shipbuilding seems to be as advanced as 17th-century Europe, with three-masted square-riggers in evidence but no [[gunpowder]] or [[cannon]]s, though [[naphtha]] and Quegan fire oil is known. Generally, the world seems to be in a mostly pre-industrial agrarian state.\n\nMagic in Midkemia is practiced by very few people. To the eyes of any nonmagician, anything that a person can do that cannot be explained is labeled magical. In the more superstitious rural areas, magic-users are usually shunned, or worse, captured and killed. Duke Borric of Crydee, with his foresight, bequeathed an island to [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug]] to start an academy devoted to magical studies, where magicians can gather without fear of discrimination and prejudice.\n\nWith Pug's education on [[Kelewan]], it is revealed that these Midkemian arts are considered the Lesser Path of Magic, and the Kelewan magic is the so-called Greater Path. The Lesser Arts were seen as rudimentary talents, more focused to the very nature of magic, while the Greater Arts were seen as having greater effectiveness and practicality such as teleportation, conjuring energy from nothing, and so on; it is later realised that this is a misconception brought about because there are very few Lesser Path magicians on Kelewan, and those that are have little power and training, and as a result the Lesser Path has not developed to the same level as the Greater, as it has on Midkemia (though there are few Greater Path magicians on Midkemia and it is not widely known of). Under extreme duress (being tortured on Kelewan), Pug discovered that he could use Lesser Path magic even though at the time his mind was more attuned to Greater Path magic, an unprecedented feat. The Paths are normally mutually exclusive \u2013 a Greater Path magician would not be able to invoke Lesser Path powers and skills.\n\nThere are several great magicians on Midkemia whose powers do not fit this dual-path model; Macros the Black, Pug conDoin (in his later years), Nakor the Isalani, Miranda, and Magnus, son of Pug and Miranda (and Robert De Lyse a student of Pug). Macros possessed abilities transcending the traditional Greater and Lesser Paths of magic; it is inconclusive whether this ability is a part of his gift upon becoming the agent for Sarig the \"Lost\" God of Magic (in truth it is Ban-ath, the God of thieves and gambler), or if Macros was simply born with the ability like Pug. Similarly, Macros's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pug, his daughter Miranda, and his grandson Magnus also possessed the ability to invoke Lesser or Greater path powers at will. Nakor also wielded magic not confined to the classical definition of Lesser and Greater paths, though he insists upon the idea that \"there is no magic\", but merely \"tricks\" in manipulating some elemental forces of the world. As the books progress, Pug comes to the realisation that Nakor is correct, and the limits of magic are merely a result of a lack of understanding among magicians.\n\nClerics are also known to have their own forms of magic, which vary depending on the order they belong to.\n\n====Rifts====\nThese are instantaneous links between two places, often on entirely different planets or levels of reality. The Riftwar Saga involved the rift between Midkemia and the world of the [[Tsurani]]. They can be created (with difficulty) by proficient users of the Greater Magic, but the Tsurani maintained one using a machine. They are sometimes created by accident and fluke. Most rifts are unstable, and so move about in space. The Tsurani's machine was one of the first known devices to stabilise a rift and to make it fixed in one position. Rifts, whilst a powerful device for travelling, are a risky device as they attract the attention of the Enemy, an evil being of immense power and the foe behind the events in the books ''Silverthorn'' and ''A Darkness At Sethanon''.\n\nThroughout the rest of Midkemia's history various other rifts have appeared that are different from the norm. At the end of the SerpentWar Saga [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug]], [[Nakor]], Tomas and Miranda encounter a rift that is connected to [[Nalar]]. They fight Zaltais who is a being from Nalar's thoughts and force him into the rift.\n\nDuring Kaspar's exile on Novindus he encounters some strange creatures and also 'wrong' armour. After his visit to the Pavilion of the Gods he learns that these creatures are coming from magnet driven rifts. The magnets being the 'wrong' armour, which is known as Talnoy who come from a dark planet on a separate plane of reality known as [[Kosridi]].\n\nNakor is also found to have the ability to create what are thought to be controllable rifts of a diminutive size which are undetectable to the Enemy (possibly due to their size).Though when questioned by Pug he is unsure if referring to them as rifts is adequate but he suggests that they are foldings in space but is quite sure they are not rifts but different. Much the same as anything else to do with Nakor his bag is a mystery still to be revealed. These \"rifts\" are placed in the lining of his travel bag allowing access to a cave, where Nakor stores items he may need, and a warehouse containing oranges (one of Nakor's most well-known traits is the seemingly never-ending supply of oranges he carries with him).\n\n===Races===\n\n====Humans====\nHumans fled to Midkemia through rifts in space-time when the Dragon Lords rose up to challenge the gods and have become the dominant race on the planet. Humanity on Midkemia is as diverse as it is on Earth, with many clear analogues to real-world cultures, from Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.\n\n====Elves====\n{{Further|Elvandar}}\nKnown in their own language as '''Edhel''' (The People), and as Elves by humans, this ancient race was created by the Valheru to serve them as slaves.  Over time they have evolved into several distinct groups: \n*'''''Eldar:''''' the wise ones; originally librarians and the keepers of lore and of plundered artefacts for their Valheru masters these elves were scattered across worlds during the chaos wars; some would remain trapped on the world of Kelewan for millennia before returning to Midkemia and Elvandar, while others would eventually evolve into the Taredhel.  \n*'''''Eledhel:''''' People of Light; originally the tenders of fields and forests under the Valheru the Eledhel now inhabit an ancient forest within the Western Realm of the Kingdom, where they have built the 'City of Lights' Elvandar; the Eledhel have long been led by a monarchy, even before the Valheru finally left Midkemia.  \n*'''''Moredhel:''''' People of Darkness; originally the slaves that tended directly to their Valheru masters and their dwellings the Moredhel were twisted by their proximity to the Dragon Lords and sought to claim the power of the Valheru for themselves, once they were gone, seeing themselves as the rightful heirs to Midkemia; this attempt to claim Valheru power is known as 'The Dark Path' and as such the Moredhel are known to humans as 'The Brotherhood of the Dark Path'.  \n*'''''Glamredhel:''''' People of Madness; these elves went mad during, or shortly after, the upheavals of the chaos wars; they eventually regained their sanity and went on to found their own city based, warlike civilisation, before being almost completely destroyed by the Moredhel; for a time they dwelled among the Eledhel in Elvandar but were never fully at home there.  \n*'''''Ocedhel:''''' People of the Sea; these are the elves from the continent of Novindus; separated from other elves they lost most of the knowledge and language of their people and were almost destroyed by the army of the Emerald Queen during the Serpent War; the survivors were rescued and brought to live in Elvandar.  \n*'''''Anoredhel:''''' People of the Sun; known by the Valheru as the '''Tirithedhel''' (Guardian Elves) the Anoredhel guard the Sven'gar'ri and their tenders the Quor, an ancient mission given to them by the Valheru; they reside in Baranor in the Peaks of the Quor.  \n*'''''Taredhel:''''' People of the Stars; once Eldar, these elves evolved after their abandonment by the Valheru in to a powerful and arrogant race with an empire that spanned several worlds until they were forced to retreat to Midkemia by an invasion of Demons; many share the Moredhel vision of succeeding the Valheru.\n\nThe elves were originally the servants of the Valheru, until Ashen-Shugar released them when the other Valheru went to fight the chaos wars. The Anoredhel, or Tirithedhel (Guardian Elves) in the Valheru language, were freed, but Ashen-Shugar requested that they remained in the position as guardians of the Quor.\n\nMany years before the Riftwar, a moredhel chieftain Murmandamus once united the moredhel clans of the north in a Great Uprising to conquer the glamredhel. When Murmandamus was killed, the moredhel clans scattered and fled back to the Northlands, never again uniting under a single true leader.\n\nAfter the war between Kelewan and Midkemia, the Moredhel, Goblins, and several bands of renegade humans again united for a couple years to wage war against the Kingdom (chronicled in ''Silverthorn'' and ''Darkness at Sethanon''), under the false prophet Murmandamus, who was actually just a powerful Pantathian (serpent man, servant of the Dragon Host) priest in a magical disguise. Under his leadership and magic powered by death, the Valheru were briefly freed again upon Midkemia, only to be immediately imprisoned within the Lifestone due to the combined efforts of Milamber (as Pug is also known), Arutha, Tomas/Ashen-Shugar, Macros, Hochopepa, Elhagar, Dolgan (and his armies), Black Guy (and his Hadati refugees), Amos Trask, Squires Jimmy and Locklear, Duke Martin, the hadati Baru (who killed Murmandamus' general in ''Silverthorn''), Duke Laurie, Galain (and his small elven host), the Sethanon Garrison, a greater dragon Ryath, and several other prominent characters.\n\nIn recent history the Glamhedrel joined the court of the Eledhel and they uneasily became one people.\n\nMoredhel that have a philosophical awakening and choose to become one with the Eledhel are known as 'returned'.\n\n====Dwarves====\nDwarves are a long-lived race, reaching hundreds of years in age. The main Dwarves found in Feist's works are the dwarves of the West, most often the Grey Tower dwarves led by Dolgan, of Tholin's line, at village Caldara. There is another dwarven kingdom in the West: the Stone Mountain dwarves, led by Harthorn, of Hogar's line, at village Delmoria. In the east, the dwarves make their home at Dorgin, under the banner of King Halfdan. There is also mention of a dwarven city, ''Sarakan'', across the sea on the continent of Novindus, found in the Ratn'gary Mountains.\n\n====Valheru====\n'''Valheru''', also called ''The Dragon Lords'', were the first race on Midkemia, and among the most powerful in the known universe. They rode on the backs of great dragons, travelling throughout the cosmos in search of plunder, and proved superior to all other races and cultures which they met and destroyed \u2013 some of these being themselves highly technological interstellar empires. Arrogantly presuming themselves to be gods, they also created lesser races to serve as slaves.\n\nAs a result of their wanton acts of destruction throughout the universe, energy was released from what were once mighty civilizations. Reaching a critical point, these energies formed a new pantheon of gods. While the new gods strove among themselves, the Valheru, exhorted by Draken-Korin, attempted to overthrow the new order of gods.\n\nAshen-Shugar was the only Dragon Lord to disapprove of his son's plan, but he did nothing but watch as the other Dragon Lords rose to battle the gods. Ashen-Shugar, the most powerful of the Valheru, felt something \"alien\" to his kind, a desire to protect the world, and the presence of [[Ashen-Shugar/Tomas|Tomas]] via the magics of Macros the Black.  With the coming of the new gods Ashen Shugar felt himself become alien to the new order, as if reality rejected his nature and he fell into a torpor, sleeping in his mountain on his throne many ages after the rest of the Valheru had gone away. Upon his death his essence became infused in his armor so that Tomas could replace him as guardian of Midkemia.\n\nSpace and time became warped as the Valheru battled the gods in the time known as the Chaos Wars. Of one hundred gods, only sixteen survived, but the Valheru were defeated. With the exception of Ashen-Shugar, the Valheru were cast away into another dimension to prevent them from returning to their homeworld, Midkemia.\n\nIn ''A Darkness at Sethanon'' the Valheru briefly returned to Midkemia at the end of the book, Draken-Koren and Tomas/Ashen-Shugar fought and Tomas impaled Draken-Korin to the Lifestone, and the Lifestone sealed the Valheru in it and prevented the end of Midkemia. Tomas's blade was left in the Lifestone for 50 years until ''Rage of a Demon King''.\n\nIn ''Rage of a Demon King'', Pug, Miranda, Nakor, Tomas and Calis, along with Brother Dominic of the Priesthood of Ishap and Sho Pi (a former Monk of Dala and, until near the end of ''Shards of a Broken Crown'', Nakor's disciple), went to Sethanon to the Lifestone. Calis, being human, elven and Valheru, managed to undo the Lifestone over a period of many hours and amidst a battle with Jakan, a demon who sought the Lifestone for his own selfish gain. After defeating Jakan, the Lifestone (Which had the Valheru trapped inside) was destroyed forever, and with it the Valheru. Calis and Tomas/Ashen-Shugar suffer a painful transformation as this occurs, as their Valheru parts are \"returned to the world\", but being \"more than Valheru\", they survive.\n\n;Known Valheru\n*''Ashen-Shugar'' \u2013 Ruler of the Eagles Reaches; the most powerful Valheru; son of Hali-Marmora; father and husband to Alma-Lodaka; father of Draken-Korin; the last of the Valheru; reincarnated in the body of Tomas Megarson, son of Megar and Magya of Crydee, Prince Consort of Queen Aglaranna and Warleader of Elvandar, father of Calis.\n*''Draken-Korin'' \u2013 Lord of Tigers, son of Ashen-Shugar and Alma-Lodaka, slain by Ashen-Shugar at the end of the Chaos Wars; returned briefly to activate the Lifestone but was slain again by Tomas/Ashen-Shugar. Returns a second time at the end in Book 1 of the Chaoswar Saga, by reincarnating in the body of a mercenary warrior.\n*''Alma-Lodaka'' \u2013 the Emerald Queen of Serpents; daughter and wife of Ashen-Shugar; mother of Draken-Korin; nearly reincarnated in a body of Lady Clovis, also known as Jorna, wife of Nakor then of Macros, mother of Miranda by Macros.\n*''Algon-Kokoon'' \u2013 Tyrant of Wind Valley, slain by Ashen-Shugar\n*''Alrin-Stolda'' \u2013 Monarch of the Black Lake\n*''Hali-Marmora'' \u2013 Mother of Ashen-Shugar; slain by Ashen-Shugar\n*''Lowris-Tanaka'' \u2013 King of Bats; Ashen-Shugar's first Dragon Lord kill\n*''Lyron-Baktos'' \u2013 Lord of the Dragons; whose talisman was used to incapacitate the Oracle of Aal\n*''Kindo-Raber'' \u2013 Master of Serpents; torn apart by the Dasati\n\n====Tomas====\n{{further|The Serpentwar Saga#Characters}}\nTomas Megarson was born a kitchen boy in Castle Crydee. Due to the manipulations of the sorcerer Macros the Black, he received a gift of white and gold armor and a golden sword from the dragon Rhuagh and merged with the essence of the long-dead Dragon Lord, [[Ashen-Shugar/Tomas|Ashen-Shugar]], to be a weapon against the outworld invaders.\n\nFor a while, the newly melded being was consumed by the battle-madness of the Valheru, before the compassion of a human boy won through, and Tomas, the human, mastered the powers of a Dragon Lord. While the elves, whom he sought refuge with, feared dominion from the Dragon Lord, Tomas assuaged their fears, becoming merely the prince consort of their Queen Aglaranna. While Tomas gained the full might of Ashen-Shugar, he eventually lost much of this power during the events of the Serpentwar. Tomas still stands as one of the most powerful people in Midkemia, with few able to match him.\n\nDue to some unforeseen circumstances, the human-turned-Valheru and the Elf Queen conceived a child possessing the heritage of all three races. Calis, son of Tomas and Aglaranna, would be unique throughout the world, neither human nor elf. He would also be instrumental during the Serpentwar invasion, first by creating the Crimson Eagles military commandos, then later dismantling a powerful artifact capable of draining all life in the world.\n\nFinally accepting his lot in fate, Calis settled down in Elvandar with a widowed elf, also adopting twins who were refugees from the recent war.\n\n====Other creatures====\nMidkemia is a deeply magical place, though predominantly populated by [[humans]]. [[elf|Elves]], [[trolls]], [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[goblins]], [[dragons]], and other, more exotic forms of intelligent life can be found, representing most usual species in fantasy literature.\n\nAlso, Feist has made his own more unusual additions, including the [[Pantathians]], a race of serpent-men bent on returning their evil goddess to this plane of existence; the [[#Valheru|Valheru]], an ancient race of godlike warriors and dragon-riders who plundered the universe for millions of years before being banished by the gods; and the gwali, a shy forest species.\n\nDragons are the most ancient race in Midkemia after the Dragon Lords. They served the Valheru as mounts. Since the fall of the Dragon Lords, the dragons have generally isolated themselves from contact with any other race. A notable character, Rhuagh, was an ancient gold dragon who lived in the Mac Mordain Cadal mines. He befriended Macros the Black. Many years later, Tomas and the dwarf chieftain Dolgan would stand on his deathwatch as he told them of his life. His daughter, Ryath, aided Pug and Tomas in their search for Macros the Black. She perished in battle with a Dreadlord, though her body lived on as a vessel for the Oracle of Aal. In return for her sacrifice, Pug took in her daughter Ryana, to his island where she would be cared for until she could survive on her own.\n\nGiants, standing at an average of twelve feet tall, form no civilized society, living as little more than wild animals in the Northlands. The moredhel were known to recruit giants into their army.\n\n===Gods===\nIn the beginning, there were only two gods. '''Rythar''', '''Goddess of Order''', took the 'threads of power' and weaved them together, forming the fabric of space-time. '''Mythar''', '''God of Chaos''', took this fabric and tore them asunder. The remains are then gathered back by Rythar and the cycle begins again. Eventually however some threads were unseen by Rythar and fell not to be rewoven, forming the race that would come to be known as the Valheru .\n\nThe two '''''Blind Gods of the Beginning''''' were deposed when the universe reordered itself. Without Rythar to knit together the strings of power, they became the new order of gods, a hundred in total. There were the seven Greater Gods and the other 93 are Lesser Gods. '''Ishap''' is the most important of the Greater Gods being the one who created all of the lesser Gods and Goddess, being the Balancer. Slightly less in power and authority are '''Arch-Indar''', Goddess of Good, and '''Nalar''', God of Evil. The other four Greater Gods are called the Builders, composed of the four traits within all mortal races.\n\nDuring the Chaos Wars, when the Valheru rose up to challenge the new order of gods, the gods were unprepared while they still contended against each other for control of various domains. As a result, most of the gods were slain, including Ishap, Arch-Indar, Wodar-Hospur, and many others. The remaining gods worked in concert, and cast the Valheru into another dimension, but the damage was done. Without the Goddess of Good to offset the God of Evil, and without the Balancer to balance all actions, the four Builder Gods exiled the God of Evil to a distant universe. Nalar is to remain imprisoned until the continual worship from the mortal races could revive the 'dead' Ishap and Arch-Indar.\n\nMany important Lesser Gods also perished, with great consequences. Tith and Onanka combined their essences to form a new being, the two faced god of war. Killian, Goddess of Nature, took over the domain of Eortis, God of the Sea. Sarig, God of Magic, sought to return by appointing an avatar to work for the betterment of magic, to eventually ascend as the new god of magic.\n\nNakor the Isalini also theorized that the universe itself is another, ultimate god, having become reality as mortals perceive it in an attempt to understand itself.\n\n====Greater gods====\nThe first gods.\n* Rythar \u2013 the Goddess of Order\n* Mythar \u2013 the God of Chaos\n\nAfter the falling of the first gods\n* Ishap \u2013 the Matrix; God of Balance (order); He who is Above All (currently dead, but returning).\n* Arch-Indar \u2013 the Selfless; Goddess of good; She who is perfection (currently dead, but returning).\n* Nalar (the Nameless one) \u2013 the Selfish; God of Evil; The Mad God (currently sealed away).\n* Abrem-Sev \u2013 Forger of Action; the Giver of Laws.\n* Ev-Dem \u2013 Worker from Within; Calculator of Odds.\n* Graff \u2013 Weaver of Desire\n* Helbinor \u2013 the Abstainer\n\n====Lesser gods====\n* Astalon \u2013 The Just; the Builder; Who Brought Order.\n* Banath (Kalkin) \u2013 The Artful Dodger; the Prankster; the Nightwalker; God of Hopeless Quests and Misadventures.\n* Dala \u2013 Shield of the Weak; Goddess of Passive Strength; the Protector\n* Guis-wan (Fimbulstran) \u2013 The Bayer after Moons; the Red-jawed Hunter; the Wanter of All Things.\n* Ka-hooli \u2013 The Howler After Fugitives; the Unraveller of Mysteries of Truth; God of Justice/Vengeance.\n* Killian \u2013 The Singer of Green Silences; the Gatherer of Quiet Pleasures; the Goddess of Love; Goddess of Nature.\n* Lims- Kragma (Zandros) (Khali-shi) \u2013 The Drawer of Nets, She who Waits; the Mistress of Death; Judger of Souls.\n* Prandur (Jehan-suz) (Agni) \u2013 The Burner of Cities; the Light Bringer; God of Fire.\n* Ruthia \u2013 The Dancer through Men's Hearts; the Goddess of Love Scorned; Lady of Luck.\n* Silban \u2013 The Earthmother, the Bringer of the Harvests; Sleeper without Dreams.\n* Sung (LaTimsa) \u2013 The White; the Pure; the Follower of one Path.\n* Tith-Onanka \u2013 The War God; the Tactician (Planner of Battles); the Joyful Warrior.\n\n====Dead gods====\nThe dead gods might some day return to power.\n\n* Drusala \u2013 Goddess of Healing.

(Banath is custodian in his place)\n\n===Inspiration===\nThough all fantasy works published after [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' are usually acknowledged as indebted to him to some extent, Feist has fairly directly borrowed elements amounting to entire cultures. The elves are described using Tolkien's own words, including borrowings from his [[Elvish language]]s (for example, ''moredhel'', Feist's name for his \"dark elves\", is found in Tolkien and comes from the [[Sindarin]] elements ''mor'' 'dark' and ''edhel'' 'elf'). The Elven city of [[Elvandar]] is heavily borrowed from [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], and the Mac Mordain Cadal is certainly influenced by [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. However, Feist's Elves - unlike Tolkien's \u2013 do age and eventually die, though they are very long-lived. Feist's Dwarves are also distinctly [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|Tolkienesque]]. Feist himself is forthcoming about the influence, calling his use of Sindar an \"homage\". Readers have noted that the influences are less pronounced in later books.\n\nAlso Feist has borrowed and used cultures throughout history to base his nations, countries and people in, such as Roman influences in the Quegan culture, Arabian influences in Keshian culture, and Asian influences in the Tsurani culture (one of several influences from [[M. A. R. Barker]]'s ''[[T\u00e9kumel]]''). From references, it can also be inferred that Kinnoch is influenced by Ireland, Krondor by London, Darkmoor by Germany, Bas-Tyra by France, Novindus by India and Australia, and Rodez by Spain.\n\nMidkemia is the world setting from Feist's college role-playing group, also known as the Thursday Nighters (until they became the Friday Nighters due to late games and early morning classes), which had begun as an outgrowth of the Triton Wargaming Society at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). [[Dungeons and Dragons]] (D&D), published by [[TSR, Inc.]], formed the root of the Midkemian game, but like many groups playing D&D at that time, the Thursday Nighters modified and evolved the rules wholesale, until they were barely recognizable as having any relationship to D&D. Feist came into this group after the original campaign had been developed by fellow students at UCSD, and played for three years before he began writing his stories, the first of which were humorous short stories set in the game realm. None of those stories were ever published. Later Feist decided to try his hand at serious fantasy, and asked if anyone objected to his using Midkemia, as it saved him the trouble of world-building from scratch. Feist has mentioned on many occasions that many of the constraints of that world created dramatic issues he would never have dreamed up on his own, and for which he was grateful. Several of the novels are dedicated to other members of that group from college. None of his books are based on campaigns, as the game takes place roughly 500 years after the novel ''Magician''. Feist has likened himself more to historical novelists rather than fantasy writers, stating that he writes \"historical novels about a place that doesn't exist\". None of his characters are \"player characters\" from these Friday Nighter sessions, save two, Praji and Vaja, introduced in the novel The King's Buccaneer, characters created for Feist's campaign, by his college friend, Richard Spahl.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riftwar Cycle, The}}\n[[Category:High fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Works by Raymond E.

These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words\".<ref>St. Louis, K.

(pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.\n\nCluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.<ref>[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref>\n\nStutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.\n\nStuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as over tense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.

These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words\".<ref>St. Louis, K.

(pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.\n\nCluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.<ref>[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref>\n\nStutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.\n\nStuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.\n\nA clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:\n{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.<ref>{{cite web |url         = http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/cluttering/camil.html |title       = Interview with a Person who Clutters |last        = Reyes-Alami |first       = C. |date        = 2004-03-01 |accessdate  = 2006-01-01 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20051024000905/http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/cluttering/camil.html |archivedate = 2005-10-24 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\nCluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref>{{cite book | last = Daly | first = David A. |author2=Burnett, Michelle L. | editor = Curlee, Richard F. | title= Stuttering and Related Disorders of Fluency | location = New York | publisher= Thieme | isbn=0-86577-764-0 | year = 1999 | page=233}}</ref>  Clutterers often have [[reading disabilities|reading]] and writing disabilities, especially sprawling, disorderly handwriting, which poorly integrate ideas and space.<ref>[http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 Fluency Disorders: Stuttering vs Cluttering<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729022709/http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 |date=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nThe common goals of treatment for cluttering include slowing the rate of speech, heightening monitoring, using clear articulation, using acceptable and organized language, interacting with listeners, speaking naturally, and reducing excessive disfluencies.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Louis|first=Kenneth O.

Field hockey has the second biggest player base in the country after football. Currently, Zimbabwe has four pitches, two in Bulawayo \u2013 one water base and one sand filled \u2013 and another sand filled at the Arundel School and water base at St John's College in the capital city of Harare. Bulawayo has approximately 1,000 hockey players and Harare 8,000. The 5,000-capacity [[Khumalo Hockey Stadium]]<ref>http://www.worldstadiums.com/africa/countries/zimbabwe.shtml</ref> in [[Bulawayo]] is their home stadium. Field hockey club '''Skies Hockey Club''' also use the venue for home games. They are currently ranked 61st in [[FIH World Rankings|International hockey ranking]].  While the country had a tradition in the sport,  they struggled in recent times largely due to their inability to participate in international competitions organized by the African Hockey Federation (AfHF) and the International Hockey Federation (FIH), until the Khumalo Hockey Stadium was refurbished and played host to the 2011 African Olympic Qualifier.\n\nThe governing body for field hockey is [[Hockey Association of Zimbabwe]]. It was formed in 1925.\n\n==Medals table==\n\n{{Medals table\n | caption        = \n | host           = \n | flag_template  = \n | event          = \n | team           = \n | gold_AAA = 0 | silver_AAA = 1 | bronze_AAA = 1 | name_AAA = [[Field hockey at the African Games|All-Africa Games]]\n | gold_BBB = 0 | silver_BBB = 0 | bronze_BBB = 1 | name_BBB = [[Hockey Africa Cup of Nations]]\n | gold_CCC = 0 | silver_CCC = 1 | bronze_CCC = 0 | name_CCC = [[African Hockey Cup of Championship]]\n}}\n\n==History==\n===Early Years===\nBack when the country was [[Rhodesia]], the national hockey team qualified for the [[Field hockey at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics in Tokyo]] after beating the [[United Arab Republic]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/29/archives/olympic-field-hockey-berth-eyed-by-southern-rhodesia.html | title=Olympic Field Hockey Berth Eyed by Southern Rhodesia | date=29 March 1964 | newspaper=The New York Times | page=S4 | accessdate=1 September 2019}}</ref> Team captain [[Lloyd Koch]] was [[1964 Summer Olympics national flag bearers|Rhodesia's flag bearer]],<ref>https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/5/5150/5150.html</ref> and \nthe team won one game over New Zealand. Koch scored two goals in the tournament.\n\n===1980's \u2013 Rise in Africa after Independence===\n[[Zimbabwe]] got independence in 1980. Soon after independence, various attempts were made to establish sports in the country. [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|Women's team]] won the inaugural Gold medal in [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]]. Men's team picked the graph and went on to perform decent in the International games. They won silver and bronze medals in 1987 and 1991 [[All-Africa Games]] respectively. The team also bagged bronze medal in [[Hockey African Cup for Nations]] in 2000 by defeating [[Ghana men's national field hockey team|Ghana]]. They managed to hold a strong position in the African continent for almost two decades.\n\n===Decline and re-establishment=== \nZimbabwe saw a drought in sports after the year 2000. They couldn't manage to maintain their spot in the African region and fall down to sixth in the continental ranking. To revive the game of hockey in the country, [[2011 African Olympic Qualifier (field hockey)|2011 African Olympic Qualifier]] were organised in Zimbabwe. But the problem was the stadium was not ready by that time. [[Hockey Association of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] asked help from [[South African Hockey Association|South Africa]]. On 8 July 2011 The Hockey Association of Zimbabwe announced that the ship with the containers holding the new carpet for the Khumalo Hockey Stadium (KHS) was due to dock in Durban, South Africa. Chairman of the Hockey Olympic Qualifiers local organising committee Gavin Stephens said in a statement that the carpet should be delivered to Bulawayo by 16 July.\n\n\"This will keep the project on course for commissioning by the end of July. It is understood that the Ministry of Public Works is rushing to meet the deadline, with their work schedule lagging behind.\"\n\nIn response to a call from the Matabeleland Hockey Board (MHB), approximately 60\u201370 people arrived at the Khumalo Hockey Stadium on Saturday, 2 July 2011. About 20 of these were labourers from Petra School, Burger & McBean and Precast Concrete Products. The other 50 were made up of hockey players, parents of hockey players, and members of general public.\n\nThe Minister of Education, Sport, Arts and Culture, David Coltart, arrived to lend his support, while both current and former national and provincial hockey players were also present. Zimbabwe performed poorly in the tournament and lost 4 out of 5 games with a draw against Morocco. \nLater on, Zimbabwe hosted African Hockey Club of Championship in 2014 and won silver medal after losing to [[Kenya men's national field hockey team|Kenya]] by 7\u20130.\n\n===2015\u20132018===\n\nSince then, Zimbabwe are regularly organizing local competitions and events. They registered their biggest win in [[2015 African Olympic Qualifier (field hockey)|2015 African Olympic Qualifier]] by defeating Botswana by 19\u20130. [[Matthew Williams (cricketer)|Matthew Williams]] scored record 6 goals in the game, becoming first Zimbabwean ever to score more than 5 goals in a match. He emerged as highest scorer for Zimbabwe in the tournament by scoring 11 goals. In 2018, Zimbabwe played a 5 match test series against their arch rivals [[Namibia Hockey Union|Namibia]] and lost all the games. [[Tendayi Maredza]], who is currently the skipper of the team is regarded as one of the finest players in the African continent. Maredza was included in the International XI side that toured [[South Africa men's national field hockey team|South Africa]] in 2016\n\n===2018\u201319 Men's Hockey Series Open===\n\nThe [[2018\u201319 Men's Hockey Series Open#Bulawayo|2018\u201319 Men's Hockey Series Open]] was the first stage of the 2018\u201319 edition of the Hockey Series. It was held from June to December 2018. Zimbabwe participated and hosted the Bulawayo pool. Despite being the hosts, the Chevrons failed to qualify for the Olympic qualifiers and lost the spot to [[Egypt men's national field hockey team|Egypt]]. Tatenda Kanyangarara emerged as highest scorer for Zimbabwe.\n\n==Tournament history==\n===Summer Olympics===\n[[Field hockey at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]-12th Place\n\n===World Cup===\nNever Qualified\n\n===All-Africa Games===\n*[[1987 All-Africa Games|1987]] \u2013 {{sica}}\n*[[1991 All-Africa Games|1991]] \u2013 {{brca}}\n*[[1995 All-Africa Games|1995]] \u2013 4th Place\n*[[1999 All-Africa Games|1999]] \u2013 4th Place\n*[[2003 All-Africa Games|2003]] \u2013 5th Place\n\n===Hockey Africa Cup of Nations===\n* 1989 \u2013 4th Place\n* 1993 \u2013 4th Place\n* 1996 \u2013 4th Place\n* 2000 \u2013 {{brca}}\n\n===African Olympic Qualifiers===\n* [[2011 African Olympic Qualifier (field hockey)|2011]] \u2013 5th Place\n* [[2015 African Olympic Qualifier (field hockey)|2015]] \u2013 6th Place\n* [[2019 Men's African Olympic Qualifier|2019]] \u2013 4th Place\n\n==Current Squad==\n'''Head Coach:''' A Five\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Name\n!Caps\n!Goals\n!Role\n|-\n|1\n|Isheanesu Marima (GK) \n|4\n|0\n|Goal-Keeper\n|-\n|2\n|Takunda Chipumha\n|3\n|0\n|Defender\n|-\n|3\n|Gift Chomunorwa\n|3\n|0\n|Defender\n|-\n|4\n|'''Tendayi Maredza (c)'''\n|23\n|13\n|Forward\n|-\n|5\n|Edwin Tholanah\n|4\n|2\n|Forward\n|-\n|6\n|Kanyiwe Tafuma\n|4\n|1\n|Forward\n|-\n|7\n|Tapiwa Mushayakarara\n|4\n|0\n|Mid fielder\n|-\n|8\n|Pritchard Matambo\n|25\n|3\n|Defender\n|-\n|9\n|Luckson Sikisa\n|4\n|1\n|Mid fielder\n|-\n|10\n|Kudzanai Tembo\n|4\n|2\n|Mid fielder\n|-\n|11\n|Constantine Muchono\n|4\n|0\n|Defender\n|-\n|12\n|Kudzai Chimbetete (GK)\n|1\n|0\n|Goal-Keeper\n|-\n|13\n|Forbes Thindwa\n|4\n|2\n|Mid fielder\n|-\n|14\n|Tatenda Kanyangarara\n|3\n|3\n|Forward\n|}\n\n==Notable Former Players==\n* [[David Houghton (cricketer)|Dave Houghton]]\n* [[Lloyd Koch]]\n* [[John McPhun]]\n* [[Robert Ullyett]]\n* [[Collin Williams]]\n* [[Michael McKillop (cricketer)|Michael McKillop]]\n* [[Matthew Williams (cricketer)|Matthew Williams]]\n* Louis Mnyama\n\n==See also==\n*[[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team]]\n*[[:Category:Rhodesian field hockey players|Rhodesian field hockey players]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.zimhockey.co.zw/ Hockey Association of Zimbabwe]\n\n{{Africa Men's national field hockey teams}}\n{{National sports teams of Zimbabwe}}\n\n[[Category:National sports teams of Zimbabwe|Field hockey]]\n[[Category:Field hockey in Zimbabwe|National team]]\n[[Category:African men's national field hockey teams]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox national field hockey team\n| name          = Zimbabwe\n| association   = [[Hockey Association of Zimbabwe]]\n| confederation = [[African Hockey Federation|AfHF]] ([[Africa]])\n| coach         = N Milner\n| manager       = C Lapham\n| captain       = T Maredza\n| founded       = 1964\n| region        = Zimbabwe\n| rank          = {{FIH World Rankings|ZIM}}\n| max rank = 41\n| max date = 2003\n| min rank = 70\n| min date = January 2017\n| home ground   = [[Khumalo Hockey Stadium]]\n<!-- First kit colors -->\n| pattern_la1 = \n| pattern_b1 =_blacksides\n| pattern_ra1 = \n| leftarm1 = FF0000\n| body1 = FF0000\n| rightarm1 = FF0000\n| shorts1 = FF0000\n| socks1 = FF0000\n| show-medals    = yes\n| medaltemplates =\n{{MedalSport |Men's [[Field Hockey]]}}\n{{MedalCountry | {{ZIM}} }}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[All-Africa Games]]}}\n{{MedalSilver|[[1987 All-Africa Games|1987 Nairobi]]| [[1987 All-Africa Games|Team Competition]]}}\n{{MedalBronze|[[1991 All-Africa Games|1991 Cairo]]| [[1991 All-Africa Games|Team Competition]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Hockey Africa Cup of Nations]]}}\n{{MedalBronze|[[Hockey Africa Cup of Nations|2000 Bulawayo]]| [[Hockey Africa Cup of Nations|Team Competition]]}}\n}}\nThe '''Zimbabwe men's national field hockey team''' is the team that represents [[Zimbabwe]] in the sport of [[field hockey]].

Koch scored two goals in the tournament.\n\n===1980's \u2013 Rise in Africa after Independence===\n[[Zimbabwe]] got independence in 1980. Soon after independence, various attempts were made to establish sports in the country. [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|Women's team]] won the inaugural Gold medal in [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]]. Men's team picked the graph and went on to perform decent in the International games. They won silver and bronze medals in 1987 and 1991 [[All-Africa Games]] respectively. The team also bagged bronze medal in [[Hockey African Cup for Nations]] in 2000 by defeating [[Ghana men's national field hockey team|Ghana]]. They managed to hold a strong position in the African continent for almost two decades.\n\n===Decline and re-establishment=== \nZimbabwe saw a drought in sports after the year 2000. They couldn't manage to maintain their spot in the African region and fall down to sixth in the continental ranking. To revive the game of hockey in the country, [[2011 African Olympic Qualifier (field hockey)|2011 African Olympic Qualifier]] were organised in Zimbabwe. But the problem was the stadium was not ready by that time. [[Hockey Association of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] asked help from [[South African Hockey Association|South Africa]]. On 8 July 2011 The Hockey Association of Zimbabwe announced that the ship with the containers holding the new carpet for the Khumalo Hockey Stadium (KHS) was due to dock in Durban, South Africa. Chairman of the Hockey Olympic Qualifiers local organising committee Gavin Stephens said in a statement that the carpet should be delivered to Bulawayo by 16 July.\n\n\"This will keep the project on course for commissioning by the end of July. It is understood that the Ministry of Public Works is rushing to meet the deadline, with their work schedule lagging behind.\"\n\nIn response to a call from the Matabeleland Hockey Board (MHB), approximately 60\u201370 people arrived at the Khumalo Hockey Stadium on Saturday, 2 July 2011. About 20 of these were labourers from Petra School, Burger & McBean and Precast Concrete Products. The other 50 were made up of hockey players, parents of hockey players, and members of general public.\n\nThe Minister of Education, Sport, Arts and Culture, David Coltart, arrived to lend his support, while both current and former national and provincial hockey players were also present. Zimbabwe performed poorly in the tournament and lost 4 out of 5 games with a draw against Morocco. \nLater on, Zimbabwe hosted African Hockey Club of Championship in 2014 and won silver medal after losing to [[Kenya men's national field hockey team|Kenya]] by 7\u20130.\n\n===2015\u20132018===\n\nSince then, Zimbabwe are regularly organizing local competitions and events. They registered their biggest win in [[2015 African Olympic Qualifier (field hockey)|2015 African Olympic Qualifier]] by defeating Botswana by 19\u20130. [[Matthew Williams (cricketer)|Matthew Williams]] scored record 6 goals in the game, becoming first Zimbabwean ever to score more than 5 goals in a match. He emerged as highest scorer for Zimbabwe in the tournament by scoring 11 goals. In 2018, Zimbabwe played a 5 match test series against their arch rivals [[Namibia Hockey Union|Namibia]] and lost all the games. [[Tendayi Maredza]], who is currently the skipper of the team is regarded as one of the finest players in the African continent.

Construction of the two 490 MW nuclear reactors, known as \"Reactor 1\" and \"Reactor 2\", began in 1963. They became operational in 1971. Wylfa was located on the coast because seawater was used as a coolant.\n\nIn 2012, Reactor 2 was shut down. Three years later, Reactor 1 was switched off on 30 December 2015 so ending 44 years of operation at the site.\n\n'''Wylfa Newydd''' (literally New Wylfa) is a proposed new nuclear station on a site adjacent to the old plant. An application to build two [[advanced boiling water reactor]]s was submitted by [[Horizon Nuclear Power]] to the [[Office of Nuclear Regulation]] on 4 April 2017.\n\n==History==\nWylfa was the second nuclear power station to be built in [[Wales]] after [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station|Trawsfynydd]] in 1959. Following the closure of Trawsfynydd in 1991, Wylfa became Wales' only nuclear power station.\n\nConstruction of Wylfa, which was undertaken by British Nuclear Design & Construction (BNDC), a consortium backed by [[English Electric]], [[Babcock & Wilcox Ltd]] and [[Taylor Woodrow Construction]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/appendices/nuclear-development-in-the-united-kingdom.aspx|title=Nuclear Development in the United Kingdom -UK Nuclear Energy Development - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}</ref> began in 1963. The reactors were supplied by The Nuclear Power Group (TNPG) and the turbines by [[English Electric]]. These were the largest and last Magnox-type reactors to be built in the UK. Wylfa was also the second British nuclear power station, following [[Oldbury nuclear power station|Oldbury]], to have a pre-stressed concrete pressure vessel instead of steel for easier construction and enhanced safety.\n\nWylfa's two 490&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] [[Magnox]] [[nuclear reactor]]s, \"Reactor 1\" and \"Reactor 2\" became operational in 1971.<ref name=plants>[http://www.industcards.com/nuclear-uk-sc-wl.htm Nuclear Power Plants in the UK - Scotland and Wales] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090719124719/http%3A//www.industcards.com/nuclear%2Duk%2Dsc%2Dwl.htm |date=19 July 2009 }}</ref> They typically supplied 23&nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]]&nbsp;[[hour|h]] of electricity daily when they were both in service. \n\nAlthough the original design output was 1,190&nbsp;MW, unexpected accelerated (\"breakaway\") corrosion of [[mild steel]] components of the gas circuit in hot [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] was detected even before the first reactor began operating. The channel gas outlet temperature, the temperature at which the CO<sub>2</sub> leaves the fuel channels in the reactor core, had to be reduced, initially dropping the power output to 840&nbsp;MW, which was later raised to 980&nbsp;MW as more experience accumulated. A considerable portion of the output, up to 255 MW, was consumed by the nearby [[Anglesey Aluminium]] smelting plant.<ref name=bbc-20090115>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7829478.stm |title=Power deal threat to metal plant |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe graphite cores each weigh {{convert|3800|tonne|LT|-2|lk=on}}; 6,156 vertical fuel channels contain over 49,248 natural uranium [[magnox (alloy)|magnox]]-clad fuel elements, hence the name magnox reactor.  A further 200 channels allow [[boron]] control rods to enter the reactor and control the nuclear reaction. The primary coolant in the reactors is [[carbon dioxide]] gas.\n\nThe power station is still managed by Magnox Ltd, formerly Magnox North, formerly British Nuclear Group, formerly Magnox Electric, formerly Nuclear Electric, formerly National Power, formerly the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB).

Construction of the two 490 MW nuclear reactors, known as \"Reactor 1\" and \"Reactor 2\", began in 1963. They became operational in 1971. Wylfa was located on the coast because seawater was used as a coolant.\n\nIn 2012, Reactor 2 was shut down. Three years later, Reactor 1 was switched off on 30 December 2015 so ending 44 years of operation at the site.\n\n'''Wylfa Newydd''' (literally New Wylfa) is a proposed new nuclear station on a site adjacent to the old plant. An application to build two [[advanced boiling water reactor]]s was submitted by [[Horizon Nuclear Power]] to the [[Office of Nuclear Regulation]] on 4 April 2017.\n\n==History==\nWylfa was the second nuclear power station to be built in [[Wales]] after [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station|Trawsfynydd]] in 1959. Following the closure of Trawsfynydd in 1991, Wylfa became Wales' only nuclear power station.\n\nConstruction of Wylfa, which was undertaken by British Nuclear Design & Construction (BNDC), a consortium backed by [[English Electric]], [[Babcock & Wilcox Ltd]] and [[Taylor Woodrow Construction]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/appendices/nuclear-development-in-the-united-kingdom.aspx|title=Nuclear Development in the United Kingdom -UK Nuclear Energy Development - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org}}</ref> began in 1963. The reactors were supplied by The Nuclear Power Group (TNPG) and the turbines by [[English Electric]]. These were the largest and last Magnox-type reactors to be built in the UK. Wylfa was also the second British nuclear power station, following [[Oldbury nuclear power station|Oldbury]], to have a pre-stressed concrete pressure vessel instead of steel for easier construction and enhanced safety.\n\nWylfa's two 490&nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] [[Magnox]] [[nuclear reactor]]s, \"Reactor 1\" and \"Reactor 2\" became operational in 1971.<ref name=plants>[http://www.industcards.com/nuclear-uk-sc-wl.htm Nuclear Power Plants in the UK - Scotland and Wales] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090719124719/http%3A//www.industcards.com/nuclear%2Duk%2Dsc%2Dwl.htm |date=19 July 2009 }}</ref> They typically supplied 23&nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]]&nbsp;[[hour|h]] of electricity daily when they were both in service. \n\nAlthough the original design output was 1,190&nbsp;MW, unexpected accelerated (\"breakaway\") corrosion of [[mild steel]] components of the gas circuit in hot [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] was detected even before the first reactor began operating. The channel gas outlet temperature, the temperature at which the CO<sub>2</sub> leaves the fuel channels in the reactor core, had to be reduced, initially dropping the power output to 840&nbsp;MW, which was later raised to 980&nbsp;MW as more experience accumulated. A considerable portion of the output, up to 255 MW, was consumed by the nearby [[Anglesey Aluminium]] smelting plant.<ref name=bbc-20090115>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7829478.stm |title=Power deal threat to metal plant |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe graphite cores each weigh {{convert|3800|tonne|LT|-2|lk=on}}; 6,156 vertical fuel channels contain over 49,248 natural uranium [[magnox (alloy)|magnox]]-clad fuel elements, hence the name magnox reactor.

The term also refers to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudity.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may be practiced individually, within a familial or social context, or in public. \n\nEthical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing. At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and [[Naturist resort|resorts]] for that purpose. Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities. Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals to officially-designated nude beaches and parks.\n\n== Definition and lexicology ==\nThe XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:\n\n: a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref name=\"Definition\">{{cite web|last1=Desch\u00eanes|first1=St\u00e9phane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Official_INF-FNI_Definition_Of_Naturism.pdf |website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons, the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations have or present a simplified view of the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}\n\nThe International Naturist Federation explains:\n\n: '' \"Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings.\"''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund f\u00fcr freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote: \"Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity\".}}\n\nThe usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states, \"two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as \"nudists\". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as \"naturists\".}} Naturism and nudism have the same meaning in the United States,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} but there is a clear distinction between the two terms in Great Britain.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American \"nudism\") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}{{explain|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn naturist parlance, the terms \"[[wikt:textile|textile]]\" or \"textilist\" refer to non-naturist persons, behaviours or facilities (e.g. \"the textile beach starts at the flag\", \"they are a mixed couple&nbsp;&ndash; he is naturist, she is textile\").  \"Textile\" is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (\"textilist\" is unknown in British naturist magazines, including ''[[H&E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  \"Textilist\" is said to be used interchangeably with \"textile\", but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}}\n\n== Naturist places and events ==\n[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 03.jpg|thumb|right|Nude woman and man at 2007 [[Fremont Solstice Parade]]]]\n{{see also|Nude recreation}}\n=== Naturist facilities ===\n{{see also|Naturist resort}}\n{{see also|Nude recreation#Nude events}}\nAt naturist organised events or venues, clothing is usually optional. At naturist swimming pools or sunbathing places, however, complete nudity is expected (weather permitting). This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}\n\nFacilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' [[naturist club]] is one that owns its own facilities. Non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, or rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\n[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|left|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in [[Taiwan]]]] <!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle -->\n\nThe international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria.\n\nA holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. A center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card (that is, to be a member of their national organization), but some have relaxed this requirement, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers vary in size. Larger holiday centres may have swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families may visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}\n\nA naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm.

Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]].

It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an \"aristocracy\" of the original members, all of whom had \"club names\" to preserve their anonymity.

After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing & Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.\n\nCanadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nMost of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&nbsp;\u2013 Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nIn 1977 the {{lang|fr|[[La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de Naturisme|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de naturisme]]}} (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Va\u00efs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet.

The term also refers to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudity.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may be practiced individually, within a familial or social context, or in public.\n\nEthical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing. At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and [[Naturist resort|resorts]] for that purpose. Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities. Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals to officially-designated nude beaches and parks.\n\n== Definition and lexicology ==\nThe XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:\n\n: a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref name=\"Definition\">{{cite web|last1=Desch\u00eanes|first1=St\u00e9phane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Official_INF-FNI_Definition_Of_Naturism.pdf |website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons, the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations have or present a simplified view of the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}\n\nThe International Naturist Federation explains:\n\n: '' \"Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings.\"''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund f\u00fcr freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote: \"Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity\".}}\n\nThe usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states, \"two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as \"nudists\". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as \"naturists\".}} Naturism and nudism have the same meaning in the United States,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} but there is a clear distinction between the two terms in Great Britain.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American \"nudism\") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}{{explain|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn naturist parlance, the terms \"[[wikt:textile|textile]]\" or \"textilist\" refer to non-naturist persons, behaviours or facilities (e.g. \"the textile beach starts at the flag\", \"they are a mixed couple&nbsp;&ndash; he is naturist, she is textile\").  \"Textile\" is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (\"textilist\" is unknown in British naturist magazines, including ''[[H&E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  \"Textilist\" is said to be used interchangeably with \"textile\", but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}}\n\n== Naturist places and events ==\n[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 03.jpg|thumb|right|Nude woman and man at 2007 [[Fremont Solstice Parade]]]]\n{{see also|Nude recreation}}\n=== Naturist facilities ===\n{{see also|Naturist resort}}\n{{see also|Nude recreation#Nude events}}\nAt naturist organised events or venues, clothing is usually optional. At naturist swimming pools or sunbathing places, however, complete nudity is expected (weather permitting). This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}\n\nFacilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' [[naturist club]] is one that owns its own facilities. Non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, or rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\n[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|left|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in [[Taiwan]]]] <!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle -->\n\nThe international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria.\n\nA holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. A center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card (that is, to be a member of their national organization), but some have relaxed this requirement, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers vary in size. Larger holiday centres may have swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families may visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}\n\nA naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm.

Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]].

It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an \"aristocracy\" of the original members, all of whom had \"club names\" to preserve their anonymity.

After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing & Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.\n\nCanadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nMost of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&nbsp;\u2013 Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nIn 1977 the {{lang|fr|[[La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de Naturisme|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de naturisme]]}} (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Va\u00efs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet.

They are one of the 56 [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the government of China.\n\n==Name==\n{{See also|Pamiri people}}\n\nDespite the name by which they are known in China, the Tajiks of Xinjiang are not the same as the [[Tajiks|Tajik people]] (who speak the [[Tajik language]]). The Tajiks in Xinjiang of China, are an extension of the [[Pamiri people]], a different Iranian group who speak the indigenous Eastern Iranian [[Pamiri languages]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early period ===\n[[Tashkurgan Town]] became the capital of the [[Sarikol kingdom]] (\u8272\u52d2\u5e93\u5c14), a kingdom of the Pamir Mountains.\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nXinjiang and its eastern Iranian-speaking peoples underwent gradual Turkification caused by the conquests and settlements of Turkic peoples like the [[Uyghurs]] and [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Qarakhanids]]. By the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol period]], most of these eastern Iranian peoples were assimilated into the Turkic community. The Tajiks of Xinjiang claim to be descended from the remaining eastern Iranians who still resided in the mountainous region of Xinjiang. This claim is seemingly supported by medieval Chinese literature, documents and modern archaeological evidence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Conversion to Nizari Ismailism ===\nAccording to oral tradition, [[Nasir Khusraw]] led a mission to the region with four of his disciples: Sayyid Hassan Zarrabi, Sayyid Surab Wali, Sayyid Jalal Bukhari, and Jahan Malikshah. Khusraw purportedly told some of his disciples to settle down in the area to continue to aid and preach to the local converts about [[Isma'ilism|Ismailism]]. Many current ''pirs'' (holy men) claim descent from these early disciples.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the Tajiks were administered by a system of [[Baig|Begs]] like the rest of [[Xinjiang]]. During the Qing dynasty the Chinese claimed suzerainty over the [[Taghdumbash Pamir]] in the south west of [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County]] but permitted the [[Mir of Hunza]] to administer the region in return for a [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tribute]].\n\nThe Tajiks of Xinjiang practiced slavery, selling some of their own as a punishment. Submissive slaves were given wives and settled with the Tajiks. They were considered property and could be sold anytime. Their slaves came from numerous sources, enslaving Sunni captives such as Kirghiz in retaliation for Kirghiz slave raids against the Tajiks since the Kirghiz sold them into slavery in these raids, or from [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] (also known as Khujund), [[Gilgit]], and [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]]. Slaves from Chitral and Kunjud passed through there to [[Bukhara]]. The Sunnis called them Rafidites and did not consider them Muslim (as [[Slavery in Islam|enslaving fellow Muslims]] is contrary to [[Sharia|Sharia law]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JxwPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&dq=tajiks+kirghiz+enslave#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Report of a mission to Yarkund in 1873, under command of Sir T.

The Chinese authorities allow a few Ismaili religious buildings to function in Xinjiang's Tajik Autonomous District, whose clerics were appointed by the Chinese secular authorities. Restrictions by the Chinese government bars foreign Ismaili preachers from openly working among the Tajiks in China; and the religious leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect, the [[Aga Khan]], was once barred from business with the [[China]]'s Ismailis.<ref>UNHCR Refworld, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/46891841d.html CHINA: Xinjiang's Ismailis cut off from international Ismaili community] [accessed 13 May 2009]</ref> \n\nFrom 2\u20134 April 2012, His Highness the [[Aga Khan]] ([[Aga Khan IV]]), paid an official visit to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, China, at the invitation of the Governor of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Mr [[Nur Bekri]], to discuss collaboration between the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] (AKDN) and the autonomous government of [[Xinjiang]].

There's also a hierarchy which is determined by a family member's age and gender but the senior male stands as the head of the family. The responsibilities of the men tend to be providing for the family and looking after the children and elderly. The women's responsibilities are to raise the children, do household duties, and to attend to the elderly. The senior male is in charge of managing the entire household and the family's wealth through consulting with the rest of the men in the house. The young men are discouraged from seeking an independent life outside the household unless they get consent from the family. Failure to do so can forfeit them from inheritance. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1mGJDwAAQBAJ&vq=Ismailis+of+China|title=A Modern History of the Ismailis: Continuity and Change in a Muslim Community|last=Saidula|first=Amier|publisher=I.B.

The families of the couple also decide on the dowry amount, plan the engagements and wedding dates, and choose who can attend. Some three days before the wedding, the families come together and initiate a feast for the people in the area who have lost relatives in the last year or so. These people then approve of the celebration by tapping on a hand drum.<ref name=\":0\" /> Funerals are conducted by first doing the Islamic rites of cleansing the body and praying for the deceased. This is followed by the family who burn incense and close any room or ceiling windows as this is believed to purify the path for the deceased. Every family member is expected to attend the funeral or make up for it with a visit to the family. For forty days after the burial, the closest relatives of the deceased will begin to abstain from personal comforts like by keeping their hair unkempt or uncut. On the last day, friends and family come together to bathe and clean the mourners and to convince them to return to their daily lives.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Festivals and rituals ===\nThe two main celebrations of the Tajiks of Xinjiang are the [[Nowruz]] (Persian New Year) and the ''Pilik'' festival. Right before Nowruz or \"''ched chader''\" in Sariqoli (meaning cleaning the house') begins, families rigorously clean their homes and sprinkle the inner walls with ''putuk'' (wheat flour) to wish for a successful year. Each household bakes a cake for the occasion to share with guests. The guests are welcomed on the doorstep by dusting some ''putuk'' on their right shoulder. ''Pilik'' is dedicated to commemorate the dead. Families light candles and pray for the souls of the dead while circling the light and pulling the flame towards their face. This ritual lasts two days. On the first day, families ight candles inside the house. On the second day, they visit the local cemetery and light a candle for each deceased relative and place it on their graves.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeasonal rituals like the ''Zuwur zoht'' (irrigation) and ''Teghm zuwost'' (seed sowing) used to be commonplace but presently a ''pir'' (a local religious master) ''or khalifa'' (a religious functionary who trained under a pir) blesses the agricultural implements in the fields by reciting verses from the Quran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Livelihood ===\nBecause of the harsh and scarce environment in which the locals live in, they mostly rely on cultivating whatever arable land is available and engage in small-scale animal husbandry. Other types of subsistence also include selling traditional embroidery, clothes, hats, and other arts and crafts. However, this is only a seasonal operation. There are also a few governmental wages available but salaried jobs are few and the demand is very high.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/shao-2-tajik.htm The Tajik ethnic minority (China)] (government website, in English)\n\n{{-}}\n{{Xinjiang topics}}\n{{Iranian peoples}}\n{{CEG}}\n\n\n[[Category:Tajiks of Xinjiang| ]]\n[[Category:Xinjiang]]\n[[Category:Ethnic Tajik people|Xingjiang]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities of China]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups officially recognized by China]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Ethnic group}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group= Mountain Tajiks\n|image=[[File:\u65b0\u7586\u5854\u5409\u514b\u65cf\u7267\u6c11.jpg|250px]]\n|pop=41,028 (Xinjiang of China)<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/EthnicGroups/136950.htm|title=The Tajik Ethnic Group|accessdate=2007-12-10|date=June 21, 2005|publisher=China.org.cn}}</ref> 1,000~2,000 (Sarikoli in [[Tajikistan]])<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Research on Bilingual Phenomenon of Tajiks in Kashgar Prefecture|journal=Language and Translation|issn=1001-0823|author=Pam Arlund|year=2000|issue=1|volume=61|pages=12|id=|url=http://www.xjass.com/ls/content/2008-11/15/content_40826.htm|accessdate=2009-03-27|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718131543/http://www.xjass.com/ls/content/2008-11/15/content_40826.htm|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}</ref>\n|popplace=[[Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County]]\n|langs=[[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]] (majority), [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] (minority), [[Mandarin Chinese]]\n|rels=[[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Aga Khani]] [[Nizari]] [[Ismailism]]\n|related=[[Iranian peoples]]\n|\n}}\n\n'''Chinese Tajiks''' or '''Mountain Tajiks in China''' ([[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]]: {{IPA-fo|tud\u0292ik|}}, ''Tujik''; {{zh|c={{linktext|\u5854\u5409\u514b\u65cf}}|p=T\u01cej\u00edk\u00e8 Z\u00fa}}), including Sarikolis (majority) and [[Wakhi people|Wakhis]] (minority) in China, are an extension of the [[Pamiri people|Pamiri]] ethnic group that lives in the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. They are one of the 56 [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the government of China.\n\n==Name==\n{{See also|Pamiri people}}\n\nDespite the name by which they are known in China, the Tajiks of Xinjiang are not the same as the [[Tajiks|Tajik people]] (who speak the [[Tajik language]]). The Tajiks in Xinjiang of China, are an extension of the [[Pamiri people]], a different Iranian group who speak the indigenous Eastern Iranian [[Pamiri languages]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early period ===\n[[Tashkurgan Town]] became the capital of the [[Sarikol kingdom]] (\u8272\u52d2\u5e93\u5c14), a kingdom of the Pamir Mountains.\n\n=== Medieval period ===\nXinjiang and its eastern Iranian-speaking peoples underwent gradual Turkification caused by the conquests and settlements of Turkic peoples like the [[Uyghurs]] and [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Qarakhanids]]. By the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol period]], most of these eastern Iranian peoples were assimilated into the Turkic community. The Tajiks of Xinjiang claim to be descended from the remaining eastern Iranians who still resided in the mountainous region of Xinjiang. This claim is seemingly supported by medieval Chinese literature, documents and modern archaeological evidence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Conversion to Nizari Ismailism ===\nAccording to oral tradition, [[Nasir Khusraw]] led a mission to the region with four of his disciples: Sayyid Hassan Zarrabi, Sayyid Surab Wali, Sayyid Jalal Bukhari, and Jahan Malikshah. Khusraw purportedly told some of his disciples to settle down in the area to continue to aid and preach to the local converts about [[Isma'ilism|Ismailism]]. Many current ''pirs'' (holy men) claim descent from these early disciples.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], the Tajiks were administered by a system of [[Baig|Begs]] like the rest of [[Xinjiang]]. During the Qing dynasty the Chinese claimed suzerainty over the [[Taghdumbash Pamir]] in the south west of [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County]] but permitted the [[Mir of Hunza]] to administer the region in return for a [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tribute]].\n\nThe Tajiks of Xinjiang practiced slavery, selling some of their own as a punishment. Submissive slaves were given wives and settled with the Tajiks. They were considered property and could be sold anytime. Their slaves came from numerous sources, enslaving Sunni captives such as Kirghiz in retaliation for Kirghiz slave raids against the Tajiks since the Kirghiz sold them into slavery in these raids, or from [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] (also known as Khujund), [[Gilgit]], and [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]]. Slaves from Chitral and Kunjud passed through there to [[Bukhara]]. The Sunnis called them Rafidites and did not consider them Muslim (as e[[Slavery in Islam|nslaving fellow Muslims]] is contrary to [[Sharia|Sharia law]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JxwPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&dq=tajiks+kirghiz+enslave#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Report of a mission to Yarkund in 1873, under command of Sir T.

The Chinese authorities allow a few Ismaili religious buildings to function in Xinjiang's Tajik Autonomous District, whose clerics were appointed by the Chinese secular authorities. Restrictions by the Chinese government bars foreign Ismaili preachers from openly working among the Tajiks in China; and the religious leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect, the [[Aga Khan]], was once barred from business with the [[China]]'s Ismailis.<ref>UNHCR Refworld, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/46891841d.html CHINA: Xinjiang's Ismailis cut off from international Ismaili community] [accessed 13 May 2009]</ref> \n\nFrom 2\u20134 April 2012, His Highness the [[Aga Khan]] ([[Aga Khan IV]]), paid an official visit to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, China, at the invitation of the Governor of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Mr [[Nur Bekri]], to discuss collaboration between the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] (AKDN) and the autonomous government of [[Xinjiang]].

There's also a hierarchy which is determined by a family member's age and gender but the senior male stands as the head of the family. The responsibilities of the men tend to be providing for the family and looking after the children and elderly. The women's responsibilities are to raise the children, do household duties, and to attend to the elderly. The senior male is in charge of managing the entire household and the family's wealth through consulting with the rest of the men in the house. The young men are discouraged from seeking an independent life outside the household unless they get consent from the family. Failure to do so can forfeit them from inheritance. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1mGJDwAAQBAJ&vq=Ismailis+of+China|title=A Modern History of the Ismailis: Continuity and Change in a Muslim Community|last=Saidula|first=Amier|publisher=I.B.

The families of the couple also decide on the dowry amount, plan the engagements and wedding dates, and choose who can attend. Some three days before the wedding, the families come together and initiate a feast for the people in the area who have lost relatives in the last year or so. These people then approve of the celebration by tapping on a hand drum.<ref name=\":0\" /> Funerals are conducted by first doing the Islamic rites of cleansing the body and praying for the deceased. This is followed by the family who burn incense and close any room or ceiling windows as this is believed to purify the path for the deceased. Every family member is expected to attend the funeral or make up for it with a visit to the family. For forty days after the burial, the closest relatives of the deceased will begin to abstain from personal comforts like by keeping their hair unkempt or uncut. On the last day, friends and family come together to bathe and clean the mourners and to convince them to return to their daily lives.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Festivals and rituals ===\nThe two main celebrations of the Tajiks of Xinjiang are the [[Nowruz]] (Persian New Year) and the ''Pilik'' festival. Right before Nowruz or \"''ched chader''\" in Sariqoli (meaning cleaning the house') begins, families rigorously clean their homes and sprinkle the inner walls with ''putuk'' (wheat flour) to wish for a successful year. Each household bakes a cake for the occasion to share with guests. The guests are welcomed on the doorstep by dusting some ''putuk'' on their right shoulder. ''Pilik'' is dedicated to commemorate the dead. Families light candles and pray for the souls of the dead while circling the light and pulling the flame towards their face. This ritual lasts two days. On the first day, families ight candles inside the house. On the second day, they visit the local cemetery and light a candle for each deceased relative and place it on their graves.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeasonal rituals like the ''Zuwur zoht'' (irrigation) and ''Teghm zuwost'' (seed sowing) used to be commonplace but presently a ''pir'' (a local religious master) ''or khalifa'' (a religious functionary who trained under a pir) blesses the agricultural implements in the fields by reciting verses from the Quran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Livelihood ===\nBecause of the harsh and scarce environment in which the locals live in, they mostly rely on cultivating whatever arable land is available and engage in small-scale animal husbandry. Other types of subsistence also include selling traditional embroidery, clothes, hats, and other arts and crafts. However, this is only a seasonal operation. There are also a few governmental wages available but salaried jobs are few and the demand is very high.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/shao-2-tajik.htm The Tajik ethnic minority (China)] (government website, in English)\n\n{{-}}\n{{Xinjiang topics}}\n{{Iranian peoples}}\n{{CEG}}\n\n\n[[Category:Tajiks of Xinjiang| ]]\n[[Category:Xinjiang]]\n[[Category:Ethnic Tajik people|Xingjiang]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities of China]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups officially recognized by China]]\n", "name_user": "Geographyinitiative", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eQing dynasty", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajiks_of_Xinjiang"}

Shot in August 2014 during Pitt and Jolie's [[honeymoon]] in [[Gozo]], [[Malta]], the film was released by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] on November 13, 2015.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $3.3 million against its $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1960s, in France, an American couple, former dancer Vanessa and her husband Roland, a successful writer, have been married 14 years. They drive to a coastal hotel. Roland wants to write a story while staying there. The two are barely on speaking terms; Vanessa is withdrawn and grieving for an unknown reason. Roland appears to drink too much and seems unhappy that Vanessa is no longer interested in him sexually.\n\nRoland becomes friendly with the local cafe owner, an older man still grieving his much-loved late wife, but who carries on, cheerfully accepting what life has given him. Vanessa watches a local fisherman who goes out every day on the outgoing tide and returns on the incoming one, catching few fish, but contented.\n\nVanessa and Roland strike up a friendship with an attractive young couple staying in the room next to them. Soon after, they discover that the wall between their two rooms has a disused radiator pipe hole, enabling them to watch the couple in their bedroom talking and having sex.\n\nGradually their experiences at the hotel enable Vanessa and Roland to start patching up their relationship. However, Vanessa attempts a liaison with the young husband in the next room, interrupted violently by Roland, who has been watching through the wall. He bruises the husband, who must later explain to his wife and does so truthfully, seriously damaging the relationship between the young couple. This also triggers a confrontation between Vanessa and Roland, during which he tells her that if she wishes to hurt him, she should just go ahead and hurt him physically. Roland asserts that her seduction of the husband was motivated by his wife's envy of the young couple - particularly of their ability to bear children. Roland physically restrains Vanessa against a wall and makes her speak of herself being barren which they haven't been able to talk about.

Shot in August 2014 during Pitt and Jolie's [[honeymoon]] in [[Gozo]], [[Malta]], the film was released by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] on November 13, 2015.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $3.3 million against its $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1960s, in France, an American couple, former dancer Vanessa and her husband Roland, a successful writer, have been married 14 years. They drive to a coastal hotel. Roland wants to write a story while staying there. The two are barely on speaking terms; Vanessa is withdrawn and grieving for an unknown reason. Roland appears to drink too much and seems unhappy that Vanessa is no longer interested in him sexually.\n\nRoland becomes friendly with the local cafe owner, an older man still grieving his much-loved late wife, but who carries on, cheerfully accepting what life has given him. Vanessa watches a local fisherman who goes out every day on the outgoing tide and returns on the incoming one, catching few fish, but contented.\n\nVanessa and Roland strike up a friendship with an attractive young couple staying in the room next to them. Soon after, they discover that the wall between their two rooms has a disused radiator pipe hole, enabling them to watch the couple in their bedroom talking and having sex.\n\nGradually their experiences at the hotel enable Vanessa and Roland to start patching up their relationship. However, Vanessa attempts a liaison with the young husband in the next room, interrupted violently by Roland, who has been watching through the wall. He bruises the husband, who must later explain to his wife and does so truthfully, seriously damaging the relationship between the young couple. This also triggers a confrontation between Vanessa and Roland, during which he tells her that if she wishes to hurt him, she should just go ahead and hurt him physically. Roland asserts that her seduction of the husband was motivated by his wife's envy of the young couple - particularly of their ability to bear children. Roland physically restrains Vanessa against a wall and makes her speak of herself being barren which they haven't been able to talk about. After a short struggle, Vanessa breaks down and weeps for her loss. Later, Roland explains to the young wife that two miscarriages caused Vanessa's lasting grief, withdrawal and behavior toward her husband.\n\nHaving finally come to terms with their life together, Vanessa seems able to go on and Roland is able to finish writing a new book. It seems also that the young couple next door may be able to work their way through the episode as well, and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nAs Vanessa and Roland leave the hotel and drive away, they appear to be reconciled.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Roland\n* [[Angelina Jolie Pitt]] as Vanessa\n* [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] as L\u00e9a\n* [[Niels Arestrup]] as Michel\n* [[Melvil Poupaud]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Richard Bohringer]] as Patrice\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2014, it was announced that Angelina Jolie Pitt would co-star with Brad Pitt in a film titled ''By the Sea'', to be written and directed by Jolie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|title=Universal Buys Angelina Jolie-Brad Pitt Pic Deadline Broke In May|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/07/universal-buys-angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-pic-deadline-broke-in-may/|accessdate=July 19, 2014|publisher=deadline.com|date=July 18, 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' speculated it would be a relationship drama that Jolie Pitt wrote several years ago, centering on a couple with issues who take a vacation in a last-ditch effort to save their marriage.\n\nThis was the first cinematic collaboration between the two since ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-teaming-700953|title=Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Teaming Up for Mystery Movie Project|date=May 2, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref> Prime Minister [[Joseph Muscat]] of [[Malta]] confirmed the project, stating that it would be partially filmed at [[M\u0121arr ix-Xini]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kauri|title=Brangelina are headed to Malta|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2014/07/14/brangelina-are-headed-to-malta/|accessdate=July 19, 2014|publisher=onlocationvacations.com|date=July 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140703/local/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-blockbuster-to-be-filmed-at-mgarr-ix-xini.526135|title=Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt blockbuster to be filmed at Mgarr ix-Xini - timesofmalta.com|work=Times of Malta|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nJolie Pitt has stated that the film \"at its core, is about grief\" further noting that the loss of her mother in 2007 caused a great deal of sadness for her.<ref name=mom>{{cite web|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|title='By the Sea' Premiere: Angelina Jolie Pitt on Making a Movie For Her Mother|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/by-sea-premiere-angelina-jolie-837696|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> To that end, the movie resembles movies of the 1960s and '70s;

Waterways on the west side of the peak flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the [[Kern River]]. The Kern River terminates at [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] in the [[Tulare Lake|Tulare Basin]], the southern part of the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. During very wet years, water overflows from the Tulare Basin into the [[San Joaquin River]] which flows to the Pacific Ocean. From the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, which joins the [[Owens River]], which in turn terminates at [[Owens Lake]], an endorheic lake of the [[Great Basin]].\n\n=== Elevation measurements ===\nThe estimated elevation of the summit of Mount Whitney has changed over the years. The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at {{convert|14494|ft|abbr=on}} and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit.  An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \"elevation 14,496.811 feet\" but this was estimated using the older [[geodetic system|vertical datum]] ([[Sea Level Datum of 1929|NGVD29]]) from 1929. Since then the shape of the [[Earth]] (the [[geoid]]) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 ([[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]]) the benchmark is now estimated to be at {{convert|14505|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"ngs\"/><ref name=ngs_hcm/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[Image:Sierra nevada schematic.svg|thumb|left|Schematic of Sierra Nevada [[fault block]]]]\nThe eastern slope of Whitney is far steeper than its western slope because the entire Sierra Nevada is the result of a [[fault block]] that is analogous to a cellar door: the door is hinged on the west and is slowly rising on the east.<ref name=usfs_sn/>\n\nThe rise is caused by a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] system that runs along the eastern base of the Sierra, below Mount Whitney.

The routes on these include some of the finest big-wall climbing in the high Sierra. Two of the needles were named after participants in an 1880 scientific expedition to the mountain. Keeler Needle was named for [[James Edward Keeler|James Keeler]] and Day Needle was named for William Cathcart Day. The latter has now been renamed Crooks Peak after [[Hulda Crooks]] who hiked up Mount Whitney every year until well into her nineties.\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{portal|Mountains|California}}}}\n* [[List of mountain peaks of California]]\n* [[List of highest points in California by county]]\n* [[List of U.S. states by elevation]]\n* [[List of the highest major summits of the United States]]\n* [[List of the most prominent summits of the United States]]\n* [[List of the most isolated major summits of the United States]]\n* [[Whitney Classic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=dayhiker>\n  {{cite web |url=http://www.dayhiker.com/directory/MtWhitney.htm|title=Mt.

Waterways on the west side of the peak flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the [[Kern River]]. The Kern River terminates at [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] in the [[Tulare Lake|Tulare Basin]], the southern part of the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. During very wet years, water overflows from the Tulare Basin into the [[San Joaquin River]] which flows to the Pacific Ocean. From the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, which joins the [[Owens River]], which in turn terminates at [[Owens Lake]], an endorheic lake of the [[Great Basin]].\n\n=== Elevation measurements ===\nThe estimated elevation of the summit of Mount Whitney has changed over the years. The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at {{convert|14494|ft|abbr=on}} and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit.  An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \"elevation 14,496.811 feet\" but this was estimated using the older [[geodetic system|vertical datum]] ([[Sea Level Datum of 1929|NGVD29]]) from 1929. Since then the shape of the [[Earth]] (the [[geoid]]) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 ([[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]]) the benchmark is now estimated to be at {{convert|14505|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"ngs\"/><ref name=ngs_hcm/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[Image:Sierra nevada schematic.svg|thumb|left|Schematic of Sierra Nevada [[fault block]]]]\nThe eastern slope of Whitney is far steeper than its western slope because the entire Sierra Nevada is the result of a [[fault block]] that is analogous to a cellar door: the door is hinged on the west and is slowly rising on the east.<ref name=usfs_sn/>\n\nThe rise is caused by a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] system that runs along the eastern base of the Sierra, below Mount Whitney.

Permits are required year round, and to prevent overuse a limited number of permits are issued by the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] between May 1 and November 1.<ref>\n  {{cite web\n  | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/mtwhitney.shtml\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414042448/http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/inyo/recreation/wild/mtwhitney.shtml\n  | archivedate = 2008-04-14\n  | title = Recreational Activities - Mt.

Applications are accepted from February 1 through March 15. Any permits left over after the lottery is completed typically go on sale April 1. Most hikers plan to stay one or two nights camping along the route.<ref>\n  {{cite web\n  | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=stelprdb5150055\n  | title = Mount Whitney Lottery - Permit Reservations\n  | publisher = US Forest Service\n  | accessdate = 2014-01-23 }}</ref> Those in good physical condition sometimes attempt to reach the summit and return to Whitney Portal in one day. A single day hike requires a \"day use\" permit that prohibits the use of overnight camping gear (sleeping bag and tent). Day hikers often leave Whitney Portal before sunrise and hike from 12 to 18 hours round trip.<ref name=dayhiker/>\n\nLonger approaches to Whitney arrive at its west side, connecting to the Mount Whitney Trail near the summit by way of the [[John Muir Trail]].\n\n=== Scrambles ===\n[[File:Mt. Whitney and south-eastern Sierra Nevada aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Mount Whitney and the steep eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, from the north]]\nThe \"Mountaineer's Route\", a gully on the north side of the east face first climbed by [[John Muir]], is considered a [[scrambling|scramble]], {{YDS|3}} ([[Grade (climbing)#International French Adjectival System (IFAS)|PD+]]).<ref name=\"Secor\">{{cite Secor |pages=70\u201375}}</ref> The fastest recorded time up this route to the summit and back to the portal is 3 hours 10 minutes, by Jason Lakey of Bishop.<ref name=rockice/>\n\n=== Technical climbs ===\nThe steep eastern side of the mountain offers a variety of [[climbing]] challenges. The [[East Face (Mount Whitney)|East Face]] route, first climbed in 1931, is one of the ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'' [[climbing route|route]]s and involves technical [[free climbing]] ({{YDS|5.7}}) but is mostly class 4.  Other routes range up to grade 5.10d.<ref name=\"Secor\"/>\n\nSouth of the main summit there are a series of minor summits that are completely inconspicuous from the west but appear as a series of \"needles\" from the east. The routes on these include some of the finest big-wall climbing in the high Sierra. Two of the needles were named after participants in an 1880 scientific expedition to the mountain. Keeler Needle was named for [[James Edward Keeler|James Keeler]] and Day Needle was named for William Cathcart Day. The latter has now been renamed Crooks Peak after [[Hulda Crooks]] who hiked up Mount Whitney every year until well into her nineties.\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{portal|Mountains|California}}}}\n* [[List of mountain peaks of California]]\n* [[List of highest points in California by county]]\n* [[List of U.S. states by elevation]]\n* [[List of the highest major summits of the United States]]\n* [[List of the most prominent summits of the United States]]\n* [[List of the most isolated major summits of the United States]]\n* [[Whitney Classic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=dayhiker>\n  {{cite web |url=http://www.dayhiker.com/directory/MtWhitney.htm|title=Mt.
