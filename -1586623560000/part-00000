The band played a handful of gigs around Montreal, mostly in high schools.\n\nCalvo was soon replaced by bassist Christian \"Chris O'Bell\" Belleau, while Frisson relocated to New York.  Frisson's departure coincided with the recording of the 222s first single, ''I Love Susan b/w The First Studio Bomb''<ref>[http://citizenfreak.com/titles/264358]</ref>, so Rondeau took on lead vocals.

Barry brought his friend, Joe Cerrato into the group to replace Christian Belleau on bass. \n\nDoyon then met with some gangsters from [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]] who wanted to get into the music business. The band had been performing a cover of [[Michel Polnareff]]'s [[La Poup\u00e9e qui fait non]]; the gangsters wanted to turn the song into a hit, and offered to finance the band's second 7\".<ref name=\"hou\"/><ref name=\"sli\"/>.

This accelerated the demise of the group; the band members didn't agree about their musical direction and, in November 1981, broke up.\n\nOver the course of their career, the 222s toured Canada as extensively as any band could.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

plots above are charts showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info/> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt that the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

plots above are charts showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

One of the smallest countries on the African mainland, its capital city is [[Kigali]]. Located a few degrees south of the [[Equator]], Rwanda is bordered by [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is highly elevated with its geography dominated by mountains in the west and [[savanna]] to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. Rwanda has a population of over 12.6 million <ref>United Nations - [[List of countries by population (United Nations)]]</ref> living on 26,338 km<sup>2</sup> of land, and  is the most densely populated mainland African country.\n\nThe population is [[Youth in Rwanda|young]] and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]], although within this group there are three subgroups: the [[Hutu]], [[Tutsi]] and [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]]. The Twa are a forest-dwelling [[pygmy people]] and are often considered descendants of Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social [[caste]]s within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is [[Kinyarwanda]], spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as additional official languages. The [[sovereign state]] of Rwanda has a [[presidential system]] of government. The president is [[Paul Kagame]] of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), who has served continuously since 2000. Today, Rwanda has low levels of corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only three countries in the world with a female majority in the national parliament, the two other countries being [[Bolivia]] and [[Cuba]].\n\n[[Hunter-gatherer]]s settled the territory in the [[Stone Age|Stone]] and [[Iron Age]]s followed later by [[Bantu peoples]]. The population coalesced first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] and then into kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. [[German colonial empire|Germany]] colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of [[German East Africa]], followed by [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], which invaded in 1916 during [[World War I]]. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population [[Rwandan Revolution|revolted]] in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated republic in 1962. A [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|1973 military coup]] saw a change of leadership, but the pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] launched a [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, were killed when their aircraft was shot down on 6 April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide]] that followed, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\n\n[[Economy of Rwanda|Rwanda's developing economy]] suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on [[subsistence agriculture]]. Coffee and tea are the major [[cash crops]] for export. [[Tourism in Rwanda|Tourism]] is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which [[mountain gorilla]]s can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed ''intore'' dance. Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, including ''[[imigongo]]'', a unique cow dung art.\n\nRwanda has been governed as a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system]] with a [[Parliament of Rwanda|bicameral parliament]] ruled by [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] since 1994. The country is member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa|COMESA]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]] and the [[East African Community]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Rwanda|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}\nModern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the [[last glacial period]], either in the [[Neolithic]] period around 8000 BC, or in the [[Neolithic Subpluvial|long humid period]] which followed, up to around 3000 BC.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}} Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the late [[Stone Age]], followed by a larger population of early [[Iron Age]] settlers, who produced dimpled [[pottery]] and iron tools.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=45}} These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], while the [[Tutsi]] migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}} Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of the ancient King's Palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]].]]\n\nThe earliest form of social organisation in the area was the [[Clans of Rwanda|clan]] (''ubwoko'').{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=88}} The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} From the 15th century, the clans began to coalesce into kingdoms;{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=141}} by 1700 around eight kingdoms existed in present-day Rwanda.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} One of these, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi [[Nyiginya]] clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-eighteenth century.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the nineteenth century under the reign of King [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]]. Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} and initiated administrative reforms; these included ''[[ubuhake]]'', in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=13\u201314}} and ''[[uburetwa]]'', a [[corv\u00e9e]] system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court,{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} but their numbers continued to decline.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=6}}\n\nThe [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference of 1884]] assigned the territory to [[German Empire|Germany]] as part of [[German East Africa]], marking the beginning of the colonial era. The explorer [[Gustav Adolf von G\u00f6tzen]] was the first European to significantly explore the country in 1894; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=217}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=9}} The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy and delegating power to local chiefs.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=25}}<ref>See also Helmut Strizek, \"Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft\", Berlin: Ch.

The Belgians also simplified and centralised the power structure,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=270}} and introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works, and agricultural supervision, including new crops and improved agricultural techniques to try to reduce the incidence of famine.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=276\u2013277}} Both the Germans and the Belgians promoted Tutsi supremacy, considering the Hutu and Tutsi different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]].{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=450}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the classes.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|right|[[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]], president from 1973 to 1994|alt=Photograph of President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana arriving with entourage at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, USA on 25 September 1980.]]\n[[Belgium]] continued to rule [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territory]] after the [[Second World War]], with a mandate to oversee eventual [[Decolonisation of Africa|independence]].{{sfn|United Nations (II)}}{{sfn|United Nations (III)}} Tensions escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 [[Rwandan Revolution]]: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses,{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=267}} forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=58\u201359}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=51}} In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a [[Rwandan monarchy referendum, 1961|referendum]] in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy.

Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations.{{sfn|King|2007|p=105}} The most famous Rwandan literary figure was [[Alexis Kagame]] (1912\u20131981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=29}} The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as [[Benjamin Sehene]]. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the [[Golden Globe]]-nominated ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (2007 film)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', ''[[Sometimes in April]]'', and ''[[Shooting Dogs]]'', the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.{{sfn|Milmo|2006}}\n\nFourteen regular [[public holidays in Rwanda|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year,{{sfn|Government of Rwanda (I)}} with others occasionally inserted by the government. The week following Genocide Memorial Day on 7 April is designated an official week of mourning.{{sfn|Watson|Renzi|Viggiani|2010|p=25}} The victory for the RPF over the Hutu extremists is celebrated as [[Liberation Day]] on 4 July. The last Saturday of each month is ''[[umuganda]]'', a national morning of mandatory [[community service]] lasting from 8{{nbsp}}am to 11{{nbsp}}am, during which all able bodied people between 18 and 65 are expected to carry out community tasks such as cleaning streets or building homes for vulnerable people.{{sfn|Rwanda Governance Board}} Most normal services close down during ''umuganda'', and public transportation is limited.{{sfn|Rwanda Governance Board}}\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Rwanda}}\nThe cuisine of Rwanda is based on local [[staple food]]s produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ''[[ibitoke]]''), [[pulse (legume)|pulse]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, beans, and [[cassava]] (manioc).{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, [[tilapia]] is popular.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian [[Second European colonization wave (19th century\u201320th century)|colonialists]], is very popular.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} [[Ugali]], locally known as ''[[Ubugari]]'' (or ''umutsima'') is common, a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a [[porridge]]-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes.{{sfn|Auzias|2007|p=74}} ''[[Isombe]]'' is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} Lunch is usually a buffet known as ''m\u00e9lange'', consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=66}} [[Brochette]]s are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes [[tripe]], beef, or fish.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=66}} In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and [[barbecue|barbecuing]] the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas.{{sfn|Anyango|2010}} Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ''[[ikivuguto]]'', is a common drink throughout the country.{{sfn|Nzabuheraheza|2005}} Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and ''[[urwagwa]]'', made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is [[Bralirwa]], which was established in the 1950s, a Heineken partner, and is now listed on the [[Rwandan Stock Exchange]].{{sfn|Bralirwa (I)}} Bralirwa manufactures [[soft drink]] products from [[The Coca-Cola Company]], under license, including [[Coca-Cola]], [[Fanta]], and [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]],{{sfn|Bralirwa (II)}} and a range of beers including [[Primus beer|Primus]], [[M\u00fctzig beer|M\u00fctzig]], [[Amstel Brewery|Amstel]], and [[Turbo King]].{{sfn|Bralirwa (III)}} In 2009 a new brewery, [[Brasseries des Mille Collines]] (BMC) opened, manufacturing [[Skol]] beer and a local version known as [[Skol Gatanu]];{{sfn|Ngarambe|2012}} BMC is now owned by Belgian company [[Unibra]].{{sfn|Craig|2012}} [[East African Breweries]] also operate in the country, importing [[Guinness]], [[Tusker (beer)|Tusker]], and [[Bell (beer)|Bell]], as well as [[whisky]] and [[Distilled beverage|spirit]]s.{{sfn|Kezio-Musoke|2014}}\n\n=== Sport

Per Child]] program ]]\nPrior to 2012, the Rwandan government provided free education in state-run schools for nine years: six years in primary and three years following a common secondary programme.{{sfn|MINEDUC|2010|p=2}} In 2012, this started to be expanded to 12 years.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=935}} A 2015 study suggests that while enrollment rates in primary schools are \"near ubiquity\", rates of completion are low and repetition rates high.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=931}} While schooling is fee-free, there is an expectation that parents should contribute to the cost of their children's education by providing them with materials, supporting teacher development and making a contribution to school construction. According to the government, these costs should not be a basis for the exclusion of children from education, however.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=935}} There are many private schools across the country, some church-run, which follow the same syllabus but charge fees.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=27}} From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; because of the country's increasing ties with the [[East African Community]] and the [[Commonwealth]], only the English syllabi are now offered.{{sfn|McGreal|2009}} The country has a number of institutions of tertiary education.

One of the smallest countries on the African mainland, its capital city is [[Kigali]]. Located a few degrees south of the [[Equator]], Rwanda is bordered by [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is highly elevated with its geography dominated by mountains in the west and [[savanna]] to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. Rwanda has a population of over 12.6 million <ref>United Nations - [[List of countries by population (United Nations)]]</ref> living on 26,338 km<sup>2</sup> of land, and  is the most densely populated mainland African country.\n\nThe population is [[Youth in Rwanda|young]] and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]], although within this group there are three subgroups: the [[Hutu]], [[Tutsi]] and [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]]. The Twa are a forest-dwelling [[pygmy people]] and are often considered descendants of Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social [[caste]]s within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is [[Kinyarwanda]], spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as additional official languages. The [[sovereign state]] of Rwanda has a [[presidential system]] of government. The president is [[Paul Kagame]] of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), who has served continuously since 2000. Today, Rwanda has low levels of corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only three countries in the world with a female majority in the national parliament, the two other countries being [[Bolivia]] and [[Cuba]].\n\n[[Hunter-gatherer]]s settled the territory in the [[Stone Age|stone]] and [[Iron Age]]s followed later by [[Bantu peoples]]. The population coalesced first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] and then into kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. [[German colonial empire|Germany]] colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of [[German East Africa]], followed by [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], which invaded in 1916 during [[World War I]]. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population [[Rwandan Revolution|revolted]] in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated republic in 1962. A [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|1973 military coup]] saw a change of leadership, but the pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] launched a [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, were killed when their aircraft was shot down on 6 April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide]] that followed, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\n\n[[Economy of Rwanda|Rwanda's developing economy]] suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on [[subsistence agriculture]]. Coffee and tea are the major [[cash crops]] for export. [[Tourism in Rwanda|Tourism]] is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which [[mountain gorilla]]s can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed ''intore'' dance. Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, including ''[[imigongo]]'', a unique cow dung art.\n\nRwanda has been governed as a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system]] with a [[Parliament of Rwanda|bicameral parliament]] ruled by [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] since 1994. The country is member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa|COMESA]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]] and the [[East African Community]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Rwanda|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}\nModern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the [[last glacial period]], either in the [[Neolithic]] period around 8000 BC, or in the [[Neolithic Subpluvial|long humid period]] which followed, up to around 3000 BC.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}} Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the late [[Stone Age]], followed by a larger population of early [[Iron Age]] settlers, who produced dimpled [[pottery]] and iron tools.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=45}} These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], while the [[Tutsi]] migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}} Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of the ancient King's Palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]].]]\n\nThe earliest form of social organisation in the area was the [[Clans of Rwanda|clan]] (''ubwoko'').{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=88}} The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} From the 15th century, the clans began to coalesce into kingdoms;{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=141}} by 1700 around eight kingdoms existed in present-day Rwanda.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} One of these, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi [[Nyiginya]] clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-eighteenth century.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the nineteenth century under the reign of King [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]]. Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} and initiated administrative reforms; these included ''[[ubuhake]]'', in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=13\u201314}} and ''[[uburetwa]]'', a [[corv\u00e9e]] system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court,{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} but their numbers continued to decline.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=6}}\n\nThe [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference of 1884]] assigned the territory to [[German Empire|Germany]] as part of [[German East Africa]], marking the beginning of the colonial era. The explorer [[Gustav Adolf von G\u00f6tzen]] was the first European to significantly explore the country in 1894; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=217}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=9}} The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy and delegating power to local chiefs.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=25}}<ref>See also Helmut Strizek, \"Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft\", Berlin: Ch.

The Belgians also simplified and centralised the power structure,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=270}} and introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works, and agricultural supervision, including new crops and improved agricultural techniques to try to reduce the incidence of famine.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=276\u2013277}} Both the Germans and the Belgians promoted Tutsi supremacy, considering the Hutu and Tutsi different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]].{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=450}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised.

She became partially assimilated to aspects of the Earth-goddess [[Gaia (mythology) |Gaia]], of her possibly [[Minoan civilization |Minoan]] equivalent [[Rhea (mythology) |Rhea]], and of the harvest\u2013mother goddess [[Demeter]]. Some city-states, notably [[Athens]], evoked her as a protector, but her most celebrated Greek rites and processions show her as an essentially foreign, exotic [[Mystery religion | mystery-goddess]] who arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music, wine, and a disorderly, ecstatic following.

In Greece, Cybele became associated with mountains, town and city walls, fertile nature, and wild animals, especially lions.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome | Rome]], Cybele became known as '''Magna Mater''' (\"Great Mother\"). The Roman state adopted and developed a particular form of her cult after the [[Sibylline Books| Sibylline oracle]] in 205 BC recommended her conscription as a key religious ally in Rome's [[Second Punic War| second war against Carthage]] (218 to 201 BC). [[Roman mythology |Roman mythographers]] reinvented her as a [[Troy| Trojan]] goddess, and thus an ancestral goddess of the Roman people by way of the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]]. As Rome eventually established [[hegemony]] over the Mediterranean world, Romanized forms of Cybele's cults spread throughout Rome's empire.

Anatolian elites sought to harness her protective power to forms of ruler-cult; in [[Lydia]], her cult had possible connections to the semi-legendary king [[Midas]], as her sponsor, consort, or co-divinity.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 69ff.</ref> As protector of cities, or city states, she was sometimes shown wearing a [[mural crown]], representing the city walls.<ref>Takacs, in Lane, p. 376</ref> At the same time, her power \"transcended any purely political usage and spoke directly to the goddess' followers from all walks of life\".<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 111, 114, 140; for quotation, see p. 146.</ref>\n\nSome Phrygian shaft monuments are thought to have been used for libations and blood offerings to Cybele, perhaps anticipating by several centuries the pit used in her [[taurobolium]] and [[criobolium]] sacrifices during the Roman imperial era.<ref>Vecihi \u00d6zkay, \"The Shaft Monuments and the 'Taurobolium' among the Phrygians\", ''Anatolian Studies'', Vol. 47, (1997), pp. 89\u2013103, British Institute at Ankara.</ref> Over time, her Phrygian cults and iconography were transformed, and eventually subsumed, by the influences and interpretations of her foreign devotees, at first Greek and later Roman.\n\n===Greece===\nFrom around the 6th century BC, cults to the Anatolian mother-goddess were introduced from Phrygia into the ethnically Greek colonies of western Anatolia, mainland [[Greece]], the Aegean islands and the westerly colonies of [[Magna Graecia]].

As an exemplar of devoted motherhood, she was partly assimilated to the grain-goddess [[Demeter]], whose torchlight procession recalled her search for her lost daughter, [[Persephone]].<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 170 \u2013 176.</ref>\n\n[[File:AGMA Cyb\u00e8le.jpg|thumb|upright|Seated Cybele within a ''naiskos'' (4th century BC, [[Stoa of Attalus|Ancient Agora Museum, Athens)]]]]\nAs with other deities viewed as foreign introductions, the spread of Cybele's cult was attended by conflict and crisis. [[Herodotus]] says that when [[Anacharsis]] returned to [[Scythia]] after traveling and acquiring knowledge among the Greeks in the 6th century BC, his brother, the Scythian king, put him to death for joining the cult.<ref>Johnstone, P.A., in Lane, E.

She stands alone within a [[naiskos]], which represents her temple or its doorway, and is crowned with a ''polos'', a high, cylindrical hat. A long, flowing [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] covers her shoulders and back. She is sometimes shown with lion attendants. Around the 5th century BC, [[Agoracritos]] created a fully Hellenised and influential image of Cybele that was set up in the Athenian [[agora]]. It showed her enthroned, with a lion attendant, and a ''[[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanon]]'', the hand drum that was a Greek introduction to her cult and a salient feature in its later developments.<ref>Roller, 1994, p. 249.</ref>\n\nFor the Greeks, the tympanon was a marker of foreign cults, suitable for rites to Cybele, her close equivalent Rhea, and [[Dionysus]]; of these, only Cybele holds the tympanon herself. In the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Bibliotheca'' formerly attributed to Apollodorus]], Cybele is said to have cured Dionysus of his madness.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 157.</ref> Their cults, however shared several characteristics: the foreigner-deity arrived in a chariot, drawn by exotic big cats (Dionysus by tigers, Cybele by lions), accompanied by wild music and an ecstatic entourage of exotic foreigners and people from the lower classes. By the end of the 1st century BC, their rites In Athens, and elsewhere, were sometimes combined; [[Strabo]] notes that Rhea-Cybele's popular rites in Athens might be held in conjunction with Dionysus' procession.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', book&nbsp;X, 3:18; but see also<--why? this is much earlier--> [[Euripides]], ''Bacchae'', 64 \u2013 186, and [[Pindar]], ''Dithyramb'' II.6 \u2013 9.</ref> Like Dionysus, Cybele was regarded as having a distinctly un-Hellenic temperament,<ref>Roller, 1994, p. 253.</ref> simultaneously embraced and \"held at arm's length\" by the Greeks.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 143.</ref>\n\n[[File:AiKhanoumPlateSharp.jpg|thumb|left|Cybele drawn in her chariot by lions towards a votive sacrifice (right). Above are the [[Sun God]] and heavenly objects. Plaque from [[Ai Khanoum]], [[Bactria]] ([[Afghanistan]]), 2nd century BC. Gilded silver, \u03c6 25 cm]]\nIn contrast to her public role as a protector of cities, Cybele was also the focus of [[mystery religions|mystery cult]], private rites with a [[chthonic]] aspect connected to [[Greek hero cult|hero cult]] and exclusive to those who had undergone initiation, though it is unclear who Cybele's initiates were.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 225 \u2013 227.</ref> [[Relief]]s show her alongside young female and male attendants with torches, and vessels for purification. Literary sources describe joyous abandonment to the loud, percussive music of tympanon, castanets, clashing cymbals and flutes, and to the frenzied \"Phrygian dancing\", perhaps a form of circle-dancing by women, to the roar of \"wise and healing music of the gods\".<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 149 \u2013 151 and footnotes 20 \u2013 25, citing Homeric Hymn 14, Pindar, ''Dithyramb'' II.10 (Snell), Euripides, ''Helen'', 1347; ''Palamedes'' (Strabo 10.3.13); ''Bacchae'',  64 \u2013 169, Strabo 10.3.15 \u2013 17 ''et al''.</ref>\n \n[[Conflation]] with Rhea led to Cybele's association with various male demigods who served Rhea as attendants, or as guardians of her son, the infant [[Zeus]], as he lay in the cave of his birth. In cult terms, they seem to have functioned as intercessors or intermediaries between goddess and mortal devotees, through dreams, waking trance or ecstatic dance and song. They include the armed [[Kouretes]], who danced around Zeus and clashed their shields to amuse him; their supposedly Phrygian equivalents, the youthful [[Corybantes]], who provided similarly wild and martial music, dance and song; and the [[dactyl (mythology)|dactyls]] and [[Telchines]], magicians associated with metalworking.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 171, 172 (and notes 110 \u2013 115), 173.</ref>\n\n=== Cybele and Attis ===\n[[File:Attis Altieri Chiaramonti Inv1656.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman Imperial Attis wearing a Phrygian cap and performing a cult dance]]\nCybele's major mythographic narratives attach to her relationship with her son, Attis, who is described by ancient Greek and Roman sources and cults as her youthful consort, and as a Phrygian deity.  In Phrygia, \"Attis\" was both a commonplace and priestly name, found alike in casual graffiti, the dedications of personal monuments and several of Cybele's Phrygian shrines and monuments. His divinity may therefore have begun as a Greek invention based on what was known of Cybele's Phrygian cult.<ref>Roller believes that the name \"Attis\" was originally associated with the Phrygian Royal family and inherited by a Phrygian priesthood or theocracy devoted to the Mother Goddess, consistent with Attis' mythology as deified servant or priest of his goddess. Greek cults and Greek art associate this \"Phrygian\" costume with several non-Greek, \"oriental\" peoples, including their erstwhile foes, the Persians and Trojans. In some Greek states, Attis was met with outright hostility; but his vaguely \"Trojan\" associations would have been counted in his favour for the eventual promotion of his Roman cult. See Roller, 1994, pp. 248 \u2013 56. See also Roscoe, 1996, pp. 198 \u2013 9, and Johnstone, in Lane, 1996, pp. 106 -7.</ref> His earliest certain image as deity appears on a 4th-century BC Greek [[stele]] from [[Piraeus]], near [[Athens]]. It shows him as the Hellenised stereotype of a rustic, eastern barbarian; he sits at ease, sporting the Phrygian cap and shepherd's crook of his later Greek and Roman cults.

Some scholarship defines the Criobolium as a rite of Attis; but some dedication slabs show the bull's garlanded head (Taurobolium) with a ram's (Criobolium), and no mention of Attis.</ref><ref>See also Vecihi \u00d6zkay, \"The Shaft Monuments and the 'Taurobolium' among the Phrygians\", ''Anatolian Studies'', Vol. 47, (1997), pp. 89\u2013103, British Institute at Ankara, for speculation that some Phrygian shaft monuments anticipate the Taurobolium pit.</ref>  A late, melodramatic and antagonistic account by the Christian apologist [[Prudentius]] has a priest stand in a pit beneath a slatted wooden floor; his assistants or junior priests dispatch a bull, using a sacred spear. The priest emerges from the pit, drenched with the bull's blood, to the applause of the gathered spectators. This description of a Taurobolium as blood-bath is, if accurate, an exception to usual Roman sacrificial practice;<ref>Prudentius is the sole original source for this version of a Taurobolium. Beard, p. 172, referring to it; \"[this is] quite contrary to the practice of traditional civic sacrifice in Rome, in which the blood was carefully collected and the officiant never sullied.\" Duthoy, p. 1 ff, believes that in early versions of these sacrifices, the animal's blood may have simply have been collected in a vessel; and that this was elaborated into what Prudentius more-or-less accurately describes. Cameron, p. 163, outright rejects Prudentius' testimony as anti-pagan hearsay,  sheer fabrication, and polemical embroidery of an ordinary bull-sacrifice.</ref> it may have been no more than a bull sacrifice in which the blood was carefully collected and offered to the deity, along with its organs of generation, the testicles.<ref>Cameron, p.163. cf the self-castration of Attis and the Galli.</ref>\n\nThe Taurobolium and Criobolium are not tied to any particular date or festival, but probably draw on the same theological principles as the life, death and rebirth cycle of the March \"holy week\". The celebrant personally and symbolically took the place of Attis, and like him was cleansed, renewed or, in emerging from the pit or tomb, \"reborn\".<ref>Duthoy, p. 119.</ref> These regenerative effects were thought to fade over time, but they could be renewed by further sacrifice. Some dedications transfer the regenerative power of the sacrifice to non-participants, including [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperors, the Imperial family and the Roman state]]; some mark a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|''dies natalis'']] (birthday or anniversary) for the participant or recipient. Dedicants and participants could be male or female.<ref>Duthoy, pp. 61ff, 107, 101 \u2013 104, 115. Some Taurobolium and Criobolium markers show a repetition between several years and more than two decades after.</ref>\n\nThe sheer expense of the Taurobolium ensured that its initiates were from Rome's highest class, and even the lesser offering of a Criobolium would have been beyond the means of the poor. Among the Roman masses, there is evidence of private devotion to Attis, but virtually none for initiations to Magna Mater's cult.<ref>Fear, in Lane, 1996, p. 41, 45.</ref> In the religious revivalism of the later Imperial era, Magna Mater's notable initiates included the deeply religious, wealthy and erudite [[praetorian prefect]] [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus|Praetextatus]];  the [[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]] [[Gaius Caeionius Rufius Volusianus|Volusianus]], who was twice consul; and possibly the [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]].<ref>Duthoy, p. 1.</ref>  Taurobolium dedications to Magna Mater tend to be more common in the Empire's western provinces than elsewhere, attested by inscriptions in (among others) Rome and [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] in Italy, [[Lugdunum]] in Gaul, and [[Carthage]], in Africa.<ref>Duthoy, p. 1 ff (listing the relevant inscriptions).</ref>\n\n== Priesthoods ==\n{{See also|Galli}}\n[[File:Archigallus of Cherchel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of an [[Archigallus]] (high priest of Cybele) 2nd\u20133rd century AD ([[Archaeological Museum of Cherchell]]).]]\n\"Attis\" may have been a name or title of Cybele's priests or priest-kings in ancient Phrygia.<ref>As it was of her priest at Pessinus in the 2nd century BC: see Roller, 1999, pp. 178 \u2013 181.</ref> Most myths of the deified [[Attis]] present him as founder of Cybele's Galli priesthood but in Servius' account, written during the Roman Imperial era, Attis castrates a king to escape his unwanted sexual attentions, and is castrated in turn by the dying king. Cybele's priests find Attis at the base of a pine tree; he dies and they bury him, emasculate themselves in his memory, and celebrate him in their rites to the goddess.

This priestly \"dynasty\" may have begun around the 3rd century BC.</ref> The Galli of Pessinus were politically influential; in 189 BC, they predicted or prayed for Roman victory in Rome's imminent war against the Galatians. The following year, perhaps in response to this gesture of goodwill, the Roman senate formally recognised [[Troy|Illium]] as the ancestral home of the Roman people, granting it extra territory and tax immunity.<ref>Roller, 1999, p.206.</ref> In 103, a Battakes traveled to Rome and addressed its senate, either for the redress of impieties committed at his shrine, or to predict yet another Roman military success. He would have cut a remarkable figure, with \"colourful attire and headdress, like a crown, with regal associations unwelcome to the Romans\". Yet the senate supported him; and when a plebeian tribune who had violently opposed his right to address the senate died of a fever (or, in the alternative scenario, when the prophesied Roman victory came) Magna Mater's power seemed proven.<ref>See Roller, 1999, p.290 \u2013 291, citing Diodorus's description of Battakes, and the latter's prediction of Roman victory in Plutarch, \"Life of Marius,\" 17.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Statue of Gallus priest.jpg|thumb|160px|Statue of a Gallus (priest of Cybele) late 2nd century ([[Capitoline Museums]]).]]\nIn Rome, the Galli and their cult fell under the supreme authority of the [[pontifices]], who were usually drawn from Rome's highest ranking, wealthiest citizens.<ref>Beard, 1994, p. 173 ff.</ref> The Galli themselves, though imported to serve the day-to-day workings of their goddess's cult on Rome's behalf, represented an inversion of Roman priestly traditions in which senior priests were citizens, expected to raise families, and personally responsible for the running costs of their temples, assistants, cults and festivals. As eunuchs, incapable of reproduction, the Galli were forbidden Roman citizenship and rights of inheritance; like their eastern counterparts, they were technically mendicants whose living depended on the pious generosity of others. For a few days of the year, during the Megalesia, Cybele's laws allowed them to leave their quarters, located within the goddess' temple complex, and roam the streets to beg for money. They were outsiders, marked out as Galli by their regalia, and their notoriously effeminate dress and demeanour, but as priests of a state cult, they were sacred and inviolate. From the start, they were objects of Roman fascination, scorn and religious awe.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp.318 \u2013 319.</ref> No Roman, not even a slave, could castrate himself \"in honour of the Goddess\" without penalty; in 101 BC, a slave who had done so was exiled.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 293.</ref> Augustus selected priests from among his own freedmen to supervise Magna Mater's cult, and brought it under Imperial control.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 315, citing [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]l 6.496.</ref> [[Claudius]] introduced the senior priestly office of [[Galli#Archigallus|Archigallus]], who was not a eunuch and held full Roman citizenship.<ref>Fear, in Lane, 1996, p. 47.</ref>\n\nThe religiously lawful circumstances for a Gallus's self-castration remain unclear; some may have performed the operation on the Dies Sanguinis (\"Day of Blood\") in Cybele and Attis' March festival. [[Pliny the elder|Pliny]] describes the procedure as relatively safe, but it is not known at what stage in their career the Galli performed it, or exactly what was removed,<ref>Roscoe, 1996, p.203, citing Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 11.261; 35.165, and noting that \"Procedures called \"castration\" in ancient times encompassed everything from vasectomy to complete removal of penis and testicles.</ref> or even if all Galli performed it. Some Galli devoted themselves to their goddess for most of their lives, maintained relationships with relatives and partners throughout, and eventually retired from service.<ref>Roscoe, 1996, p.203, and note 34, citing as example the thanksgiving dedication to the Mother Goddess by a Gallus from [[Cyzicus]] (in Anatolia), in gratitude for her intervention on behalf of the soldier Marcus Stlaticus, his partner \"(''oulppiou'', a term also applied to a husband or wife).\"</ref> Galli remained a presence in Roman cities well into the Empire's Christian era. Some decades after [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity became the sole Imperial religion]], St Augustine saw Galli \"parading through the squares and streets of Carthage, with oiled hair and powdered faces, languid limbs and feminine gait, demanding even from the tradespeople the means of continuing to live in disgrace\".<ref>St Augustine, Book 7, 26, in Augustine, (trans.

It was accessible via a long upward flight of steps from a flattened area or proscenium below, where the goddess's [[Ludi|festival games]] and [[Ludi scaenici|plays]] were staged. At the top of the steps was a statue of the enthroned goddess, wearing a mural crown and attended by lions. Her altar stood at the base of the steps, at the proscenium's edge. The first temple was damaged by fire in 111 BC, and was repaired or rebuilt. It burnt down in the early Imperial era, and was restored by [[Augustus]]; it burned down again soon after, and Augustus rebuilt it in more sumptuous style; the [[Ara Pietatis]] relief shows its pediment.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 309\u2013310.</ref> The goddess is represented by her empty throne and crown, flanked by two figures of Attis reclining on [[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanon]]s; and by two lions who eat from bowls, as if tamed by her unseen presence. The scene probably represents a ''[[sellisternium]]'', a form of banquet usually reserved for goddesses, in accordance with \"[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ritus graecus|Greek rite]]\" as practiced in Rome.<ref>The sellisternium and various other elements of ritus Graecus \"proved Rome\u2019s profound religious and cultural rooting in the Greek world\".

None of these dedicants were priests of the Magna Mater or Attis, and several held priesthoods of one or more different cults.<ref>Cameron, pp. 144 \u2013 149.</ref>\n\nNear [[Setif]] ([[Mauretania]]), the ''dendrophores'' and the faithful (''religiosi'') restored their temple of Cybele and Attis after a disastrous fire in 288 AD.

She stands alone within a [[naiskos]], which represents her temple or its doorway, and is crowned with a ''polos'', a high, cylindrical hat. A long, flowing [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] covers her shoulders and back. She is sometimes shown with lion attendants. Around the 5th century BC, [[Agoracritos]] created a fully Hellenised and influential image of Cybele that was set up in the Athenian [[agora]]. It showed her enthroned, with a lion attendant, and a ''[[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanon]]'', the hand drum that was a Greek introduction to her cult and a salient feature in its later developments.<ref>Roller, 1994, p. 249.</ref>\n\nFor the Greeks, the tympanon was a marker of foreign cults, suitable for rites to Cybele, her close equivalent Rhea, and [[Dionysus]]; of these, only Cybele holds the tympanon herself. In the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Bibliotheca'' formerly attributed to Apollodorus]], Cybele is said to have cured Dionysus of his madness.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 157.</ref> Their cults, however shared several characteristics: the foreigner-deity arrived in a chariot, drawn by exotic big cats (Dionysus by tigers, Cybele by lions), accompanied by wild music and an ecstatic entourage of exotic foreigners and people from the lower classes. By the end of the 1st century BC, their rites In Athens, and elsewhere, were sometimes combined; [[Strabo]] notes that Rhea-Cybele's popular rites in Athens might be held in conjunction with Dionysus' procession.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', book&nbsp;X, 3:18; but see also<--why? this is much earlier--> [[Euripides]], ''Bacchae'', 64 \u2013 186, and [[Pindar]], ''Dithyramb'' II.6 \u2013 9.</ref> Like Dionysus, Cybele was regarded as having a distinctly un-Hellenic temperament,<ref>Roller, 1994, p. 253.</ref> simultaneously embraced and \"held at arm's length\" by the Greeks.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 143.</ref>\n\n[[File:AiKhanoumPlateSharp.jpg|thumb|left|Cybele drawn in her chariot by lions towards a votive sacrifice (right).

In cult terms, they seem to have functioned as intercessors or intermediaries between goddess and mortal devotees, through dreams, waking trance or ecstatic dance and song. They include the armed [[Kouretes]], who danced around Zeus and clashed their shields to amuse him; their supposedly Phrygian equivalents, the youthful [[Corybantes]], who provided similarly wild and martial music, dance and song; and the [[dactyl (mythology)|dactyls]] and [[Telchines]], magicians associated with metalworking.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 171, 172 (and notes 110 \u2013 115), 173.</ref>\n\n=== Cybele and Attis ===\n[[File:Attis Altieri Chiaramonti Inv1656.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman Imperial Attis wearing a Phrygian cap and performing a cult dance]]\nCybele's major mythographic narratives attach to her relationship with her son, Attis, who is described by ancient Greek and Roman sources and cults as her youthful consort, and as a Phrygian deity.  In Phrygia, \"Attis\" was both a commonplace and priestly name, found alike in casual graffiti, the dedications of personal monuments and several of Cybele's Phrygian shrines and monuments. His divinity may therefore have begun as a Greek invention based on what was known of Cybele's Phrygian cult.<ref>Roller believes that the name \"Attis\" was originally associated with the Phrygian Royal family and inherited by a Phrygian priesthood or theocracy devoted to the Mother Goddess, consistent with Attis' mythology as deified servant or priest of his goddess. Greek cults and Greek art associate this \"Phrygian\" costume with several non-Greek, \"oriental\" peoples, including their erstwhile foes, the Persians and Trojans. In some Greek states, Attis was met with outright hostility; but his vaguely \"Trojan\" associations would have been counted in his favour for the eventual promotion of his Roman cult. See Roller, 1994, pp. 248 \u2013 56. See also Roscoe, 1996, pp. 198 \u2013 9, and Johnstone, in Lane, 1996, pp. 106 -7.</ref> His earliest certain image as deity appears on a 4th-century BC Greek [[stele]] from [[Piraeus]], near [[Athens]]. It shows him as the Hellenised stereotype of a rustic, eastern barbarian; he sits at ease, sporting the Phrygian cap and shepherd's crook of his later Greek and Roman cults. Before him stands a Phrygian goddess (identified by the inscription as [[Agdistis]]) who carries a tympanon in her left hand. With her right, she hands him a jug, as if to welcome him into her cult with a share of her own libation.<ref>Both names are inscribed on the stele. Roller offers Agdistis as Phrygian Kybele's personal name. See Roller, 1994, pp. 248 \u2013 56.

See Johnston, in Lane (Editor), 1996, pp. 107 \u2013 111, and Roller, pp. 177 \u2013 180: Pan is a \"natural companion\" for Cybele, and there is evidence of their joint cults.</ref> In [[Demosthenes]]' ''[[On the Crown]]'' (330 BC), ''attes'' is \"a ritual cry shouted by followers of mystic rites\".<ref>Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', 260: cf the cry ''iache'', invoking the god [[Iacchus]] in Demeter's [[Eleusinian mysteries]]; Roller, 1999, p. 181.</ref>\n\nAttis seems to have accompanied the diffusion of Cybele's cult through Magna Graecia; there is evidence of their joint cult at the Greek colonies of [[Marseilles#Prehistory and classical antiquity|Marseilles]] (Gaul) and [[Locri|Lokroi]] (southern Italy) from the 6th and 7th centuries BC. After [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests, \"wandering devotees of the goddess became an increasingly common presence in Greek literature and social life; depictions of Attis have been found at numerous Greek sites\".<ref>Roscoe, p. 200.</ref>  When shown with Cybele, he is always the younger, lesser deity, or perhaps her priestly attendant; the difference is one of relative degree, rather than essence, as priests were sacred in their own right and were closely identified with their gods. In the mid 2nd century, letters from the king of Pergamum to Cybele's shrine at Pessinos consistently address its chief priest as \"Attis\".<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 113 \u2013 114; see also Roller, 1994, p. 254.</ref>  <!-- Attis is therefore a form of Gallus.

From the 160's AD, citizens who sought initiation to her mysteries could offer either of two forms of bloody animal sacrifice \u2013 and sometimes both \u2013 as lawful substitutes for self-castration. The [[Taurobolium]] sacrificed a bull, the most potent and costly [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victim]] in Roman religion; the [[Criobolium]] used a lesser victim, usually a ram.<ref>See Duthoy, p. 1 ff.  Possible Greek precursors for the taurobolium are attested around 150 BC in Asia Minor, including [[Pergamum]], and at [[Illium]] (the traditional site of ancient Troy), which some Romans assumed as their own and Cybele's \"native\" city. The form of taurobolium presented by later Roman sources probably developed over time, and was not unique to Magna Mater \u2013 one was given at [[Puteoli]] in 134 AD to honour [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] Caelestia (C.I.L. X.1596) \u2013 but anti-pagan polemic represents it as hers. Some scholarship defines the Criobolium as a rite of Attis; but some dedication slabs show the bull's garlanded head (Taurobolium) with a ram's (Criobolium), and no mention of Attis.</ref><ref>See also Vecihi \u00d6zkay, \"The Shaft Monuments and the 'Taurobolium' among the Phrygians\", ''Anatolian Studies'', Vol. 47, (1997), pp. 89\u2013103, British Institute at Ankara, for speculation that some Phrygian shaft monuments anticipate the Taurobolium pit.</ref>  A late, melodramatic and antagonistic account by the Christian apologist [[Prudentius]] has a priest stand in a pit beneath a slatted wooden floor; his assistants or junior priests dispatch a bull, using a sacred spear. The priest emerges from the pit, drenched with the bull's blood, to the applause of the gathered spectators. This description of a Taurobolium as blood-bath is, if accurate, an exception to usual Roman sacrificial practice;<ref>Prudentius is the sole original source for this version of a Taurobolium. Beard, p. 172, referring to it; \"[this is] quite contrary to the practice of traditional civic sacrifice in Rome, in which the blood was carefully collected and the officiant never sullied.\" Duthoy, p. 1 ff, believes that in early versions of these sacrifices, the animal's blood may have simply have been collected in a vessel; and that this was elaborated into what Prudentius more-or-less accurately describes. Cameron, p. 163, outright rejects Prudentius' testimony as anti-pagan hearsay,  sheer fabrication, and polemical embroidery of an ordinary bull-sacrifice.</ref> it may have been no more than a bull sacrifice in which the blood was carefully collected and offered to the deity, along with its organs of generation, the testicles.<ref>Cameron, p.163. cf the self-castration of Attis and the Galli.</ref>\n\nThe Taurobolium and Criobolium are not tied to any particular date or festival, but probably draw on the same theological principles as the life, death and rebirth cycle of the March \"holy week\". The celebrant personally and symbolically took the place of Attis, and like him was cleansed, renewed or, in emerging from the pit or tomb, \"reborn\".<ref>Duthoy, p. 119.</ref> These regenerative effects were thought to fade over time, but they could be renewed by further sacrifice. Some dedications transfer the regenerative power of the sacrifice to non-participants, including [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperors, the Imperial family and the Roman state]]; some mark a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|''dies natalis'']] (birthday or anniversary) for the participant or recipient. Dedicants and participants could be male or female.<ref>Duthoy, pp. 61ff, 107, 101 \u2013 104, 115. Some Taurobolium and Criobolium markers show a repetition between several years and more than two decades after.</ref>\n\nThe sheer expense of the Taurobolium ensured that its initiates were from Rome's highest class, and even the lesser offering of a Criobolium would have been beyond the means of the poor. Among the Roman masses, there is evidence of private devotion to Attis, but virtually none for initiations to Magna Mater's cult.<ref>Fear, in Lane, 1996, p. 41, 45.</ref> In the religious revivalism of the later Imperial era, Magna Mater's notable initiates included the deeply religious, wealthy and erudite [[praetorian prefect]] [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus|Praetextatus]];  the [[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]] [[Gaius Caeionius Rufius Volusianus|Volusianus]], who was twice consul; and possibly the [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]].<ref>Duthoy, p. 1.</ref>  Taurobolium dedications to Magna Mater tend to be more common in the Empire's western provinces than elsewhere, attested by inscriptions in (among others) Rome and [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] in Italy, [[Lugdunum]] in Gaul, and [[Carthage]], in Africa.<ref>Duthoy, p. 1 ff (listing the relevant inscriptions).</ref>\n\n== Priesthoods ==\n{{See also|Galli}}\n[[File:Archigallus of Cherchel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of an [[Archigallus]] (high priest of Cybele) 2nd\u20133rd century AD ([[Archaeological Museum of Cherchell]]).]]\n\"Attis\" may have been a name or title of Cybele's priests or priest-kings in ancient Phrygia.<ref>As it was of her priest at Pessinus in the 2nd century BC: see Roller, 1999, pp. 178 \u2013 181.</ref> Most myths of the deified [[Attis]] present him as founder of Cybele's Galli priesthood but in Servius' account, written during the Roman Imperial era, Attis castrates a king to escape his unwanted sexual attentions, and is castrated in turn by the dying king.

Yet the senate supported him; and when a plebeian tribune who had violently opposed his right to address the senate died of a fever (or, in the alternative scenario, when the prophesied Roman victory came) Magna Mater's power seemed proven.<ref>See Roller, 1999, p.290 \u2013 291, citing Diodorus's description of Battakes, and the latter's prediction of Roman victory in Plutarch, \"Life of Marius,\" 17.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Statue of Gallus priest.jpg|thumb|160px|Statue of a Gallus (priest of Cybele) late 2nd century ([[Capitoline Museums]]).]]\nIn Rome, the Galli and their cult fell under the supreme authority of the [[pontifices]], who were usually drawn from Rome's highest ranking, wealthiest citizens.<ref>Beard, 1994, p. 173 ff.</ref> The Galli themselves, though imported to serve the day-to-day workings of their goddess's cult on Rome's behalf, represented an inversion of Roman priestly traditions in which senior priests were citizens, expected to raise families, and personally responsible for the running costs of their temples, assistants, cults and festivals. As eunuchs, incapable of reproduction, the Galli were forbidden Roman citizenship and rights of inheritance; like their eastern counterparts, they were technically mendicants whose living depended on the pious generosity of others. For a few days of the year, during the Megalesia, Cybele's laws allowed them to leave their quarters, located within the goddess' temple complex, and roam the streets to beg for money. They were outsiders, marked out as Galli by their regalia, and their notoriously effeminate dress and demeanour, but as priests of a state cult, they were sacred and inviolate. From the start, they were objects of Roman fascination, scorn and religious awe.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp.318 \u2013 319.</ref> No Roman, not even a slave, could castrate himself \"in honour of the Goddess\" without penalty; in 101 BC, a slave who had done so was exiled.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 293.</ref> Augustus selected priests from among his own freedmen to supervise Magna Mater's cult, and brought it under Imperial control.<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 315, citing [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]l 6.496.</ref> [[Claudius]] introduced the senior priestly office of [[Galli#Archigallus|Archigallus]], who was not a eunuch and held full Roman citizenship.<ref>Fear, in Lane, 1996, p. 47.</ref>\n\nThe religiously lawful circumstances for a Gallus's self-castration remain unclear; some may have performed the operation on the Dies Sanguinis (\"Day of Blood\") in Cybele and Attis' March festival.

At the top of the steps was a statue of the enthroned goddess, wearing a mural crown and attended by lions. Her altar stood at the base of the steps, at the proscenium's edge. The first temple was damaged by fire in 111 BC, and was repaired or rebuilt. It burnt down in the early Imperial era, and was restored by [[Augustus]]; it burned down again soon after, and Augustus rebuilt it in more sumptuous style; the [[Ara Pietatis]] relief shows its pediment.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 309\u2013310.</ref> The goddess is represented by her empty throne and crown, flanked by two figures of Attis reclining on [[Tympanum (hand drum)|tympanon]]s; and by two lions who eat from bowls, as if tamed by her unseen presence. The scene probably represents a ''[[sellisternium]]'', a form of banquet usually reserved for goddesses, in accordance with \"[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ritus graecus|Greek rite]]\" as practiced in Rome.<ref>The sellisternium and various other elements of ritus Graecus \"proved Rome\u2019s profound religious and cultural rooting in the Greek world\". See Scheid, John, in R\u00fcpke, J\u00f6rg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p.226.</ref> This feast was probably held within the building, with attendance reserved for the aristocratic sponsors of the goddesses rites; the flesh of her sacrificial animal provided their meat.\n\nFrom at least 139 AD, Rome's port at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the site of the goddess's arrival, had a fully developed sanctuary to Magna Mater and Attis, served by a local Archigallus and college of ''dendrophores'' (the ritual tree-bearers of \"Holy Week\").<ref>Duncan Fishwick, \"The Cannophori and the March Festival of Magna Mater,\" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 97, (1966), p. 199.</ref>\n\nGround preparations for the building of St Peters' basilica on the Vatican Hill uncovered a shrine, known as the Phrygianum, with some 24 dedications to Magna Mater and Attis.<ref>Cameron, p. 142.</ref> Many are now lost, but most that survive were dedicated by high-status Romans after a taurobolium sacrifice to Magna Mater. None of these dedicants were priests of the Magna Mater or Attis, and several held priesthoods of one or more different cults.<ref>Cameron, pp. 144 \u2013 149.</ref>\n\nNear [[Setif]] ([[Mauretania]]), the ''dendrophores'' and the faithful (''religiosi'') restored their temple of Cybele and Attis after a disastrous fire in 288 AD. Lavish new fittings paid for by the private group included the silver statue of Cybele and her processional chariot; the latter received a new canopy with tassels in the form of [[fir]] cones.<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'', p. 581.</ref> Cybele drew ire from Christians throughout the Empire; when [[Theodore of Amasea|St. Theodore of Amasea]] was granted time to recant his beliefs, he spent it by burning a temple of Cybele instead.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  | title = St. Theodore of Amasea  | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia  | publisher = Encyclopedia Press  | location = New York  | year = 1914  | url = https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14573a.htm  | accessdate = 2007-07-16  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180626135532/https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14573a.htm  | archivedate = 2018-06-26  | url-status = live  }}</ref>\n\n==Myths, theology, and cosmology==\n[[File:Fuente de Cibeles - 05.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|[[Plaza de Cibeles|Cybele fountain]] in [[Madrid]].]]\nCybele's major myths deal with her own origins and her relationship with [[Attis]]. The most complex, vividly detailed and lurid accounts of this myth were produced as anti-pagan polemic in the late 4th century by the Christian apologist [[Arnobius]].<ref>Roller, 1999, p. 244.</ref>\n\nFor Lucretius, Magna Mater \"symbolised the world order.\" Her image held aloft signifies the Earth, which \"hangs in the air.\" She is the mother of all, and the yoked lions that draw her chariot show the offspring's duty of obedience to the parent.<ref>Summers, in Lane, 339 -340, 342; Lucretius claims the authority of \"the old Greek poets\" but describes the Roman version of Cybele's procession; to most of his Roman readers, his interpretations would have seemed familiar ground.</ref> She herself is uncreated, and thus essentially separate from and independent of her creations.<ref>Roller, 1999, pp. 297 \u2013 299, citing Lucretius, ''De Rerum Natura'', 2,598 \u2013 660.</ref>\n\nIn the early Imperial era, the Roman poet [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] inserts Cybele as the thirteenth deity of an otherwise symmetrical, classic Greco-Roman [[zodiac]], in which each of twelve [[House (astrology)|zodiacal houses]] (represented by particular constellations) is ruled by one of twelve deities, known in Greece as the [[Twelve Olympians]] and in Rome as the [[Di Consentes]].

Some of the possible Greek models for Cybele's Megalensia festival include representations of lions attacking and dominating bulls. The festival date coincided, more or less, with events of the Roman agricultural calendar (around April 12) when farmers were advised to dig their vineyards, break up the soil, sow [[millet]] \"and \u2013 curiously apposite, given the nature of the Mother's priests \u2013 castrate cattle and other animals.\"<ref>Hannah, p. 872, citing [[Varro]], ''De Re Rustica'', 1. 30; [[Columella]], ''De Re Rustica'', 11. 2. 32 \u2013 35; [[Pliny the Elder]], Historia Naturalis, 18. 246 \u2013 249.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mythology|Asia}}\n* [[Agdistis]]\n* [[Atargatis]]\n* [[Attis]]\n* [[Mother goddess]]\n* [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Beard, Mary]], ''The Roman and the Foreign: The Cult of the 'Great Mother' in Imperial Rome'', in Nicholas Thomas and Caroline Humphrey, eds., Shamanism, History, and the State (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan, 1994) pp.&nbsp;164\u201390.\n* [[Walter Burkert|Burkert, Walter]], 1982.
