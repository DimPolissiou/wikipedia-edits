Run in late May, the [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] race is open to horses aged four and older.  Raced over a distance of seven [[furlong]]s on [[Grass|turf]], it currently offers a purse of $196,750.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/WO060317CAN8.pdf|title=Chart of the 2017 Connaught Cup Stakes|last=Equibase}}</ref>\n\nThe Connaught Cup was first run in 1912 on dirt at Toronto's [[Old Woodbine Race Course]]. As a result of [[World War I]], there was no race held in 1918 and 1919 and it was not run in 1930. The [[Great Depression]] saw much consolidation in the [[horse racing]] industry with track owners reducing the number of races run and the amount of the purses being offered. The Connaught Cup was suspended after the 1932 running and was not revived until 1952. In 1956 it was moved to the newly built Woodbine Racetrack where in 1958 it was converted to a turf race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cthsont.com/Domains/www.cthsont.com/CMSFiles/Docs/2018_CTHS_TIPSchedule_HR.pdf |title=Woodbine Thoroughbred Stakes Results 2017 |publisher=Ontario Racing |date=2017-04-01 |accessdate=2018-12-17}}</ref>\n\nIt was run in two divisions in 1984.\n\nSince inception, the race has been contested at various distances:<br>\n'''On dirt:'''\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles : 1912 through 1955 at Old Woodbine Race Course, 1956-1957 at Woodbine Racecourse\n\n'''On turf:'''\n* 7 furlongs : beginning 2010 at Woodbine Racetrack\n* 1 mile :  1994 at [[Fort Erie Racetrack]]\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles : 1958-1963, 1980\u201393, 1995-2009 at Woodbine Racetrack\n* {{frac|1|1|8}} miles : 1964-1966, 1979 at Woodbine Racetrack, 1967-1978 at Fort Erie Racetrack\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed  record:''' (at present distance of 7 furlongs)\n* 1:19.40 - Tower of Texas (2017)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 2 - [[Plate Glass (horse)|Plate Glass]] (1912, 1913)\n* 2 - [[King Maple]] (1955, 1956)\n* 2 - [[E.

Raced over a distance of seven [[furlong]]s on [[Grass|turf]], it currently offers a purse of $196,750.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/WO060317CAN8.pdf|title=Chart of the 2017 Connaught Cup Stakes|last=Equibase}}</ref>\n\nThe Connaught Cup was first run in 1912 on dirt at Toronto's [[Old Woodbine Race Course]]. As a result of [[World War I]], there was no race held in 1918 and 1919 and it was not run in 1930. The [[Great Depression]] saw much consolidation in the [[horse racing]] industry with track owners reducing the number of races run and the amount of the purses being offered. The Connaught Cup was suspended after the 1932 running and was not revived until 1952. In 1956 it was moved to the newly built Woodbine Racetrack where in 1958 it was converted to a turf race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cthsont.com/Domains/www.cthsont.com/CMSFiles/Docs/2018_CTHS_TIPSchedule_HR.pdf |title=Woodbine Thoroughbred Stakes Results 2017 |publisher=Ontario Racing |date=2017-04-01 |accessdate=2018-12-17}}</ref>\n\nIt was run in two divisions in 1984.\n\nSince inception, the race has been contested at various distances:<br>\n'''On dirt:'''\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles : 1912 through 1955 at Old Woodbine Race Course, 1956-1957 at Woodbine Racecourse\n\n'''On turf:'''\n* 7 furlongs : beginning 2010 at Woodbine Racetrack\n* 1 mile :  1994 at [[Fort Erie Racetrack]]\n* {{frac|1|1|16}} miles : 1958-1963, 1980\u201393, 1995-2009 at Woodbine Racetrack\n* {{frac|1|1|8}} miles : 1964-1966, 1979 at Woodbine Racetrack, 1967-1978 at Fort Erie Racetrack\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed  record:''' (at present distance of 7 furlongs)\n* 1:19.40 - Tower of Texas (2017)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 2 - [[Plate Glass (horse)|Plate Glass]] (1912, 1913)\n* 2 - [[King Maple]] (1955, 1956)\n* 2 - [[E.

Spanning approximately {{convert|128|mi|km}} along a generally west\u2013east axis, its roadbed is shared with [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95) for {{convert|88|mi|km}} from the New York state border in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]; [[Interstate 395 in Connecticut|I-395]] for {{convert|36|mi|km}} from East Lyme to [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]]; and [[Connecticut Turnpike#SR 695|State Road&nbsp;695]] (SR&nbsp;695) for {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} from Plainfield to the [[Rhode Island]] state line at [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|U.S. Route&nbsp;6]] (US&nbsp;6) in [[Killingly, Connecticut|Killingly]]. The turnpike briefly [[Concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;1]] from [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]] and [[Connecticut Route 2A|Route&nbsp;2A]] from [[Montville, Connecticut|Montville]] to [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]].\n\nConstruction on the Connecticut Turnpike began in 1954 and the highway was opened in 1958. It originally followed a sequential exit numbering system that disregarded route transition, where the exit numbers on I-395 were a continuation of the exit numbers on I-95. In 2015, the I-395 exit numbers were changed to a mileage-based system reflecting their distance from the split from I-95, effectively removing the defining element of the turnpike. In some sections southwest of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], it carries an annual average daily traffic of over 150,000&nbsp;vehicles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/traflog/traflog.pdf |title = 2006 Traffic Volumes |last =  |first =  |date =  |website = www.ct.gov |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike Exit 48 offramp.JPG|right|thumb|Northbound exit&nbsp;48 offramp from the I-95 section, before the reconstruction of the I-95/I-91 interchange]]\n\n===I-95===\nI-95 enters Connecticut as the Connecticut Turnpike in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line. The turnpike stretches for {{convert|128.5|mi|km}} across the state, but only the first {{convert|88|mi|km}} is signed as I-95. This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between Greenwich and New Haven, going through the cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with daily traffic volumes of 120,000 to over 150,000 throughout the entire {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on}} length between the New York border and the junction with I-91 in New Haven.<ref name=\":0\" /> The turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely [[U.S. Route 7|US&nbsp;7]] at exit&nbsp;15 in Norwalk, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&nbsp;8]] at exit&nbsp;27A in Bridgeport, the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway|Wilbur Cross]] parkways at exit&nbsp;38 (via the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]]) in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Interstate 91|I-91]] at exit&nbsp;48 in New Haven.\n\nNorth (east) of I-91, the turnpike continues along the Connecticut shoreline, usually with less traffic. The six-lane highway is reduced to four lanes in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 9|Route&nbsp;9]] at exit&nbsp;69 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]], crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] and continues until the interchange with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]] at exit&nbsp;76 near the East Lyme\u2013Waterford line.\n\n===I-395===\nThe turnpike leaves I-95 at exit&nbsp;76 in East Lyme, continuing on as I-395 north heading towards [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], [[Jewett City, Connecticut|Jewett City]] and Plainfield until exit&nbsp;35, where the turnpike and I-395 split. I-395 continues north towards [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], ending at [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] and the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Connecticut Turnpike officially ends at US&nbsp;6 (Danielson Pike) in [[Killingly, Connecticut|Killingly]], which continues on towards [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Unlike the I-95 portion, the I-395 portion of the turnpike has changed very little over the years, retaining its grass median with a guardrail separating directions of travel.\n\n===US 1===\nThe Connecticut Turnpike incorporated a pre-existing relocation of US&nbsp;1 between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme, which included the original Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge over the Connecticut River, which opened in 1948. Upon the turnpike's opening in 1958, US&nbsp;1 has been co-signed with the turnpike between exit&nbsp;68 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] and exit&nbsp;70 in Old Lyme.\n\n===Route 2A===\nRoute&nbsp;2A was constructed to serve as a bypass around Norwich. It shares its alignment with the Connecticut Turnpike from its northern terminus at Route&nbsp;2 to exit&nbsp;9 on I-395, where it turns east and serves the Mohegan Sun Casino before crossing the Thames River and ending at Route&nbsp;2 south of Norwich.\n\n===SR 695===\nSR&nbsp;695 is the {{convert|4.49|mi|km|adj=on}} unsigned portion of the turnpike from I-395 in [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]] to US&nbsp;6 at the Rhode Island state line in [[Killingly, Connecticut|Killingly]]. The road is not signed as SR&nbsp;695 but eastbound as \"To US&nbsp;6 East\" and westbound as \"To I-395 South\". SR&nbsp;695 would have become part of the now-defunct alignment of the [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|I-84]] freeway between [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island]], had that freeway been built. (Present-day I-84 continues eastbound from Hartford into Massachusetts where it ends at I-90, the Massachusetts Turnpike). There are two partial exits on SR&nbsp;695. Westbound exit&nbsp;1 (formerly exit&nbsp;90) at Squaw Rock Road is only accessible westbound. The easternmost exit (also numbered exit&nbsp;1, but formerly unnumbered), located {{convert|1500|ft|m}} east of the Squaw Rock Road onramp and accessible only eastbound, is for Ross Road, and the only onramp provided from Ross Road is for SR&nbsp;695 westbound. The intersection with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]] is only partial: there is no access provided from SR&nbsp;695 westbound to I-395 northbound and no access from I-395 southbound to SR 695 eastbound.\n\n==History==\nThe general route and construction of the turnpike were both mandated by state law.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cga.ct.gov/2001/pub/Chap237.htm#sec13a-21.htm |title = Section 13a-21 of the General Statutes of Connecticut |publisher =  |access-date = October 4, 2014 }}</ref> Intended to relieve congestion on [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;1]] and [[Connecticut Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]] (the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway|Wilbur Cross]] parkways), design work began in 1954. The Connecticut Turnpike opened on January 2, 1958;<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?A=1380&Q=259704 |title = ConnDOT: Chapter 7 DOT History |author = Connecticut Department of Transportation |date =  |publisher =  |access-date = November 6, 2016 }}</ref> however, the westernmost portion of the highway (the {{convert|3|mi|km|disp=sqbr|spell=in}} connecting [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] with the [[New England Thruway]]) opened 10&nbsp;months later. Tolls were originally collected through a series of eight toll booths along the route.\n\nThe Connecticut Turnpike was designed and built much differently than other toll roads built around the same time. Unlike toll roads in other states that operated under semi-autonomous, quasi-public toll road authorities, the Connecticut Turnpike was operated by the Connecticut Highway Department (later the Connecticut Department of Transportation) from its inception. Additionally, unlike toll roads in other states where revenues collected from motorists were legally required to be kept within the toll road authority and used to finance the facility's construction and upkeep, toll revenues from the Connecticut Turnpike were placed into the state's general fund and used for highway and non-highway expenditures alike. Finally, the closely spaced interchanges and eight mainline barriers were a result of each town through which the Connecticut Turnpike passed being guaranteed a certain number of access points to gain the support of each affected town for construction of the highway. This is in contrast to toll roads built in neighboring states with widely spaced interchanges that normally featured a ticket system where one obtained a ticket at entering the toll road, then paid a distance-based fare upon exiting.\n\nThe turnpike was renamed after former Connecticut Governor [[John Davis Lodge]] on December 31, 1985, two months after the tolls were removed. Local legend is the initial phase of turnpike construction in 1954 was so disruptive in heavily Republican [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] that local voters there turned on incumbent Republican Governor Lodge, leading to his defeat by [[Abraham Ribicoff]].<ref>{{cite web |author =  |date = April 24, 2003 |url = http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2/comments/3954/ |title = Providence Journal: I-95 in Fairfield |work = WestportNow.com |location = Westport, Connecticut |publisher =  |access-date = October 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nInitially, the Connecticut Turnpike was signed as an east\u2013west route, even after the I-95 designation was added to the turnpike between Greenwich and Waterford in the early 1960s. Signs indicating I-95/Connecticut Turnpike as an east\u2013west route existed in places until the early 1990s, when the remaining east\u2013west signage was replaced by north\u2013south signage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nFrom Waterford to Killingly, the turnpike was initially designated as Route&nbsp;52 in 1967, following the opening of the toll-free section of Route&nbsp;52 from Killingly to the Massachusetts border. To accommodate the truncation of the Hartford to Providence extension of I-84 to Killingly, following Rhode Island's cancellation of its portion of that extension in the early 1980s, Route&nbsp;52 was to be re-designated as an Interstate. Initially, Connecticut and Massachusetts requested that the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) extend the [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] designation southward along free Route&nbsp;52 and the Connecticut Turnpike to I-95 in Waterford. AASHTO rejected the I-290 request and instead approved the I-395 designation in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title = State Ordered to Lift Ban on Tandem Trucks |work = Hartford Courant |date = June 14, 1983 }}{{Full|date=December 2018}} The article lists \"I-290 (formerly Route&nbsp;52)\" as one of the highways to which the lifting of the ban applies.</ref>\n\n===Accidents===\nSeveral horrific accidents have occurred throughout the turnpike's history. Arguably, the most notorious of these was a [[List of road accidents#1983|serious incident]] on January 19, 1983, in which a [[tractor trailer]] after a brake failure collided with four cars at the [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] toll plaza, killing seven people and injuring several others. The investigation following the crash determined that the truck driver fell asleep at the wheel just before the crash took place.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/20/nyregion/6-die-in-crash-at-toll-station-in-connecticut.html |title = 6 die in Crash at Toll Station in Connecticut |newspaper = The New York Times |date = January 20, 1983 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1983, a section of the turnpike's northbound [[Mianus River Bridge]] in Greenwich collapsed due to corrosion of its substructure, killing three motorists crossing it at the time.\n\nOn March 25, 2004, a tanker truck carrying fuel swerved to avoid a car that cut the truck off and subsequently overturned, dumping {{convert|8,000|USgal|l}} of home heating oil onto the Howard Avenue overpass in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. Passing vehicles kicked up the oil which ignited a towering inferno that subsequently melted the bridge structure and caused the southbound lanes to sag several feet. The northbound lanes, which received less damage from the fire, were opened five days later after being reinforced with temporary scaffolding. The southbound lanes opened on April 1, after a temporary bridge was erected.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/26/nyregion/fiery-truck-crash-closes-i-95-in-connecticut-for-weeks.html |title = Fiery Truck Crash Closes I-95 in Connecticut for Weeks |newspaper = The New York Times |date = March 26, 2004 |last1 = Tavernise |first1 = Sabrina |last2 = Salzman |first2 = Avi }}</ref>\n\n===Stalling of upgrades by budget deficits and lawsuits===\n[[File:Fairfield Ave overpass 3.JPG|thumb|right|Northbound I-95 in Stamford]]\nThe Connecticut Turnpike opened southwest Connecticut to a mass migration of New Yorkers, leading to substantial residential and economic growth in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] and [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]] counties. The turnpike became a primary commuter route to [[New York City]]. With additional segments of I-95 that opened in the 1960s connecting to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Boston]], the turnpike became an essential route for transporting people and goods throughout the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. As a result, much of the turnpike had become functionally obsolete by 1965, with traffic exceeding its design capacity. Originally designed to carry 60,000&nbsp;vehicles per day (VPD) on the four-lane sections and 90,000&nbsp;VPD on the six-lane portion west of New Haven, the turnpike carried 75,000\u2013100,000&nbsp;VPD east of New Haven, and 130,000\u2013200,000&nbsp;VPD between New Haven and the New York state line as of 2006.\n\nThere were dozens of plans discussed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve safety on the turnpike for nearly 30 years, but most of these plans languished amid political infighting and lawsuits brought on by special-interest groups. Still, traffic and deadly accidents continued to increase each year on the turnpike, and by the 1990s the Connecticut Turnpike had started to become known as \"the Highway of Death\".<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.reiffandbily.com/dangerous-roads-america/ |title = The Most Dangerous Roads + Highways in America |publisher = Reiff & Bily |date = June 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, while most of the turnpike is signed as I-95 or I-395, the highway was designed and built before the [[Interstate Highway System]] was established. As a result, much of the turnpike does not meet Interstate standards, particularly with overpasses ranging from {{convert|13.5|to|15|ft|m}}; [[Interstate Highway standards]] require {{convert|16|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} of vertical clearance. Interchanges are too closely spaced; ramps and acceleration-deceleration lanes need to be lengthened. In some areas, median and shoulder widths and curve radii also fall short of Interstate standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/geometric/pubs/mitigationstrategies/ |title = Mitigation Strategies for Design Exceptions |date = July 2007 |publisher = Federal Highway Administration }}</ref>\n\nComplicating efforts to upgrade the turnpike to Interstate standards is that engineers did not acquire enough [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] to accommodate future expansion when the Connecticut Turnpike was built during the late 1950s, which means adjacent land must be seized to upgrade the turnpike, resulting in lengthy and costly [[eminent domain]] battles between the State of Connecticut and landowners refusing to give up their property. Additionally the turnpike passes through areas with some of the highest property values in the country, making land acquisition for expanding the highway extremely expensive.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2014}} Finally, the turnpike was built through environmentally sensitive ecosystems and wetlands associated with [[Long Island Sound]], meaning most expansion projects require lengthy environmental impact studies that are able to withstand constant litigation by environmental groups. Air pollution laws also cause conflict, since Connecticut is grouped into the federal statistical areas around New York City and it suffers from consequences and special regulations applied to non-compliant air quality areas. An example of this is that it is easier to lengthen an entrance or exit ramp than to add a full lane, since adding any capacity to a road, by definition, will increase the pollution created by the road, further violating federal air quality standards. In 2000, one ConnDOT official commented during a public meeting on expanding [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] (an Interstate that parallels I-95 about {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} further inland), \"If we had tried to build I-95 today, it would be impossible because of the sensitive ecosystems it passes through. It would never get approved.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Bridge collapse jumpstarts turnpike upgrades===\nA comprehensive plan to address safety and capacity issues on the Connecticut Turnpike did not progress beyond the initial planning stages until the collapse of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] on June 28, 1983.<ref>{{cite web |last = Weizel |first = Richard |date = October 17, 2011 |title = Road Crews Toil as Fairfield County Bridges Age |url = http://greenwich.dailyvoice.com/news/road-crews-toil-fairfield-county-bridges-age |work = The Greenwich Daily Voice |access-date = July 18, 2012 }}</ref> Following the collapse, Governor [[William O'Neill (Connecticut politician)|William A. O'Neill]] initiated an $8 billion program to rehabilitate Connecticut's highways. Included in this program was the inspection and repair of the turnpike's nearly 300&nbsp;bridges and overpasses. Furthermore, O'Neill directed ConnDOT to develop a viable plan for addressing safety and congestion on the state's roads.\n\n===High-priority status===\nThroughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, ConnDOT developed a comprehensive plan to improve the turnpike through Fairfield and New Haven counties. In 1993 ConnDOT embarked on a 25-year multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the Connecticut Turnpike from the [[Connecticut River]] at [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to the New York state line at [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. The program included the complete reconstruction of several turnpike segments, including replacing bridges, adding travel lanes, reconfiguring interchanges, upgrading lighting and signage, and implementing the [[intelligent transportation system]] with traffic cameras, a variety of embedded roadway sensors, and [[variable-message sign]]s. Since the start of the program, a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} section through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] was completely rebuilt to Interstate standards. In 2015, a long-term $2 billion program was completed, to rebuild {{convert|12|mi|km}} of turnpike between [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] and [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], including a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Quinnipiac River]] and [[New Haven Harbor]].\n\nPlans to upgrade the turnpike received a boost in 2005 when federal legislation known as [[SAFETEA-LU]] designated the I-95 portion of the Connecticut Turnpike from the New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] as [[Corridor 65 (NHS)|High Priority Corridor&nbsp;65]]. Corridor&nbsp;65 also includes the {{convert|24|mi|km|sing=on}} section of I-95 from Waterford to the Rhode Island state line that was built in 1964, which is not part of the Turnpike.\n\n===Plans for the I-395/SR&nbsp;695 section===\nTraffic is relatively light on the rural I-395 section and the northeast leg (SR&nbsp;695) in Killingly; this section is largely unchanged from its original 1958 profile. The only two major projects completed on this section since were the 2015 renumbering of exits based on I-395 mileposts (exit&nbsp;77 became exit&nbsp;2, up to exit&nbsp;90 which became exit&nbsp;35) and the reconstruction of the northbound on and off ramps at exit&nbsp;11 (old exit&nbsp;80) in [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], completed in 2009.\n\n===Improvement projects===\n{{prose|section|date=January 2020}}\n* [[Raymond E.

Due to the rising cost of materials however, there were no contractors interested in the project when it was advertised for bid in 2006. ConnDOT broke the project up into several smaller contracts, with construction completed on all contracts by November 2016.\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls on the Connecticut Turnpike have been a source of controversy from the turnpike's opening in 1958 to the removal of tolls in 1985, and the debate continues today. The Connecticut Turnpike originally opened with a [[barrier toll system]] (or open system), unlike toll roads in neighboring states, which used a [[ticket system]] (or closed system) for collecting tolls. Initially tolls on the Connecticut Turnpike were $0.25, and the toll barriers were located in the following locations: Greenwich, Norwalk, Stratford, West Haven, Branford, Madison, Montville, and Plainfield. Tolls also were collected until the early 1970s in Old Saybrook at the west end of the Baldwin Bridge over the Connecticut River. Additionally, unlike other toll roads which featured widely spaced interchanges and generally ran along the outskirts of major urban centers, the Connecticut Turnpike was built through the middle of several large cities (notably Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven) and has over 90&nbsp;interchanges along its {{convert|129|mi|km|adj=on}} length\u201450 of which are along the {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch between the New York state line and New Haven.\n\n===Token war with New York City Subway===\nThere was some controversy in the early 1980s when [[New York City Subway]] riders discovered that tokens purchased for use in the Connecticut Turnpike toll booths were of the same size and weight as New York City Subway tokens. Since they cost less than one third as much, they began showing up in subway collection boxes regularly.<ref>{{cite news |title = Connecticut Highway Token Buys Subway Ride, Too |work = The New York Times |date = November 18, 1982 |page = 1 }}</ref> Connecticut authorities initially agreed to change the size of their tokens,<ref>{{cite news |title = Connecticut to Alter Its Turnpike Tokens, Solving Subway Issue |work = The New York Times |date = December 15, 1982 |page = 1 }}</ref> but later reneged and the problem went unsolved until 1985, when Connecticut discontinued the tolls on its turnpike.<ref name=\"token war\">{{cite news |title = {{frac|17|1|2}} Accord Puts an End to the Great Token War |work = The New York Times |date = November 7, 1985 }}</ref> At that time, the MTA was paid 17.5 cents for each of more than two million tokens that had been collected during the three-year \"token war\".<ref name=\"token war\"/>\n\n===Abolition of tolls===\nAfter a 1983 truck crash that killed seven people at the Stratford toll plaza, toll opponents pressured the State of Connecticut to remove tolls from the turnpike in 1985. Three years later, these same opponents successfully lobbied the Connecticut General Assembly to pass legislation abolishing tolls on all of Connecticut's highways (with the exception of two car ferries across the Connecticut River in [[Chester, Connecticut|Chester]] and [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]]). While the 1983 Stratford accident was cited as the main reason for abolishing tolls in Connecticut, the underlying reason was that federal legislation at that time forbade states with toll roads from using federal funds for road projects. Because the [[Mianus River Bridge]] was rebuilt with federal highway funds following its June 1983 collapse, Connecticut was required by Section 113(c) of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] to remove tolls from the turnpike once its construction bonds were paid off.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/tollroad.cfm |title = Why Does The Interstate System Include Toll Facilities? |work = Ask the Rambler |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |author =  |date =  |access-date = November 6, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe debate over tolls on the Connecticut Turnpike did not end in 1988 with the abolition of tolls. Prior to their removal in 1985, the tolls generated over $65 million annually. Since their removal in the late 1980s, Connecticut lawmakers have continuously discussed reinstating tolls, but have balked at bringing tolls back out of concern of having to repay $2.6 billion in federal highway funds that Connecticut received for turnpike construction projects following the abolition of tolls.\n\nDuring the economic recession of the early 1990s, legislators studied reinstating tolls on parts of the Connecticut Turnpike and portions of highways around Hartford to make up for budget deficits. Proposals for reinstating tolls were scrapped in lieu of implementing an [[income tax]] and increasing the state gasoline tax and sales tax, and imposing a new tax on corporate windfall profits.\n\n===Continuation of toll debate===\nWith continual budget woes in Hartford, the idea of reinstating tolls resurfaced in January 2010. State Representative Tony Guerrera estimated a $5 toll at Connecticut's borders could generate $600 million in revenue. Governor Dannel P. Malloy expressed pessimism that toll revenue would be spent exclusively on infrastructure repairs, but a need to generate additional revenue, paired with decreases in traditional highway funding sources (such as federal aid and gas tax revenue) means the idea could receive serious consideration in the state legislature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Services==\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|Fairfield Service Plaza southbound]]\nThe turnpike has 13&nbsp;[[service plaza]]s, which are open 24&nbsp;hours a day. All feature a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], a [[Dunkin' Donuts]], a convenience store and fuel service provided by [[ExxonMobil]] (branded as [[Mobil]]). Most plazas also offer a variety of other food service options, including [[McDonald's]] and [[Sbarro]]. From 2011 to 2015, the original plazas were rebuilt with new and expanded buildings and improved fueling facilities. Prior to the rebuilding, the plazas on the [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] section only had a convenience store.\n* [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] southbound\u2014between exits&nbsp;10 and 9\u2014food and fuel\u2014rebuilt 2013\n* [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] northbound\u2014between exits&nbsp;12 and 13\u2014food and fuel\u2014Connecticut Welcome Center\u2014Rebuilt 2013.

In July 2016, the rest area was closed due to budget cuts and barriers were placed on the highway blocking access to the facility. In September 2019, the rest area was reopened.\n\nThere are three State Police stations located on the turnpike:\nTroop F: Westbrook at milepost&nbsp;74 on southbound side of turnpike.\nTroop E: Montville at milepost&nbsp;96 on northbound side of turnpike (at former service plaza).\nTroop G: Bridgeport at milepost&nbsp;29 and the junction with Route&nbsp;8 and Route&nbsp;25 (on surface road, exit 27, just below interchange).\n\nThere is one weigh station located northbound at milepost&nbsp;2 in Greenwich, at the location of the former toll plaza. Weigh stations on both sides of the turnpike used to exist near exit&nbsp;18 in Westport; these were removed during the 1990s. The former southbound weigh station in Westport is now used by ConnDOT to store construction materials, while the northbound station was demolished; the grounds returned to their natural state.\n\nThe administration building for the former West Haven toll plaza can still be seen by drivers between exits&nbsp;42 and 43. Today, ConnDOT uses the old toll building as a maintenance facility.\n\nDuring 2013, electric vehicle (EV) charging for Tesla automobiles was added to the Milford northbound and southbound service plazas in support of Tesla's effort to create a Boston\u2013Washington EV corridor. These locations were the second Supercharger installations on the East Coast; the first was in Newark, Delaware, at the Delaware Turnpike's service plaza. Each of the Milford locations received two Supercharger stalls. Later in 2014, the Darien northbound and southbound service plazas each received four Supercharger stalls. In addition, the southbound Darien service plaza received two chargers for CHAdeMO-equipped EV's.<!-- picture to follow--><ref>{{cite web |first = Richard C. |last = Hanley |title = EV Infrastructure Project Mgr. |publisher = Connecticut Department of Transportation Research & Implementation Unit }}</ref>\n\n==Exit list==\nExits were re-numbered to mile-based numbering on the I-395 and SR&nbsp;695 portions of the turnpike as part of a sign replacement project in 2015.\n{{jcttop|old|length_ref=<ref name=\"log\">[[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], [http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/hwylog/hwylog.pdf Highway Log] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905063334/http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/hwylog/hwylog.pdf |date=September 5, 2015 }} as of December 31, 2006</ref>}}\n{{CTint|old\n|county=Fairfield\n|cspan=48\n|location=Greenwich\n|lspan=7\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2014\n|road={{jct|state=NY|I|95|dir1=south|name1=[[New England Thruway]]|city1=New York City}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{CTint|old\n|mile=0.80\n|exit=2\n|road=Delavan Avenue&nbsp;\u2013 [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]]\n|notes=\n}}\n{{CTint|old\n|mile=2.00\n|type=closed\n|place=Former toll plaza\n}}\n{{CTint|old\n|mile=2.54\n|exit=3\n|road=Arch Street&nbsp;\u2013 [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n|notes=\n}}\n{{CTint|old\n|mile=3.73\n|exit=4\n|road=Indian Field Road&nbsp;\u2013 [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n|notes=\n}}\n{{jctbridge|old\n|mile=4.35\n|mile2=4.85\n|bridge=[[Mianus River Bridge]] over the [[Mianus River]]\n}}\n{{CTint|old\n|mile=5.53\n|exit=5\n|road={{jct|state=CT|US|1|city1=Riverside|city2=Old Greenwich|city3=Mianus}}\n|notes=\n}}\n{{CTint|old\n|location=Stamford\n|lspan=6\n|mile=6.50\n|mile2=6.62\n|exit=6\n|mspan=2\n|espan=2\n|ospan=2\n|type=incomplete\n|road=Harvard Avenue\n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint\n|mile=none\n|type=incomplete\n|road=West Avenue\n|notes=Southbound exit and northbound entrance\n}}\n{{CTint|old\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=7.34\n|exit=7\n|road={{jct|state=CT|to1=To|Route|137|dir1=North|road=Greenwich Avenue}}\n|notes=Access via Washington Boulevard ([[Special Service Road 493 (Connecticut)|SSR&nbsp;493]]);

it is maintained by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (ConnDOT). Spanning approximately {{convert|128|mi|km}} along a generally west\u2013east axis, its roadbed is shared with [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95) for {{convert|88|mi|km}} from the New York state border in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]; [[Interstate 395 in Connecticut|I-395]] for {{convert|36|mi|km}} from East Lyme to [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]]; and [[Connecticut Turnpike#SR 695|State Road&nbsp;695]] (SR&nbsp;695) for {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} from Plainfield to the [[Rhode Island]] state line at [[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|U.S. Route&nbsp;6]] (US&nbsp;6) in [[Killingly, Connecticut|Killingly]]. The turnpike briefly [[Concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;1]] from [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]] and [[Connecticut Route 2A|Route&nbsp;2A]] from [[Montville, Connecticut|Montville]] to [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]].\n\nConstruction on the Connecticut Turnpike began in 1954 and the highway was opened in 1958. It originally followed a sequential exit numbering system that disregarded route transition, where the exit numbers on I-395 were a continuation of the exit numbers on I-95. In 2015, the I-395 exit numbers were changed to a mileage-based system reflecting their distance from the split from I-95, effectively removing the defining element of the turnpike. In some sections southwest of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], it carries an annual average daily traffic of over 150,000&nbsp;vehicles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dpolicy/traflog/traflog.pdf |title = 2006 Traffic Volumes |last =  |first =  |date =  |website = www.ct.gov |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike Exit 48 offramp.JPG|right|thumb|Northbound exit&nbsp;48 offramp from the I-95 section, before the reconstruction of the I-95/I-91 interchange]]\n\n===I-95===\nI-95 enters Connecticut as the Connecticut Turnpike in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line. The turnpike stretches for {{convert|128.5|mi|km}} across the state, but only the first {{convert|88|mi|km}} is signed as I-95. This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between Greenwich and New Haven, going through the cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with daily traffic volumes of 120,000 to over 150,000 throughout the entire {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on}} length between the New York border and the junction with I-91 in New Haven.<ref name=\":0\" /> The turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely [[U.S. Route 7|US&nbsp;7]] at exit&nbsp;15 in Norwalk, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&nbsp;8]] at exit&nbsp;27A in Bridgeport, the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway|Wilbur Cross]] parkways at exit&nbsp;38 (via the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]]) in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Interstate 91|I-91]] at exit&nbsp;48 in New Haven.\n\nNorth (east) of I-91, the turnpike continues along the Connecticut shoreline, usually with less traffic. The six-lane highway is reduced to four lanes in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 9|Route&nbsp;9]] at exit&nbsp;69 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]], crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] and continues until the interchange with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]] at exit&nbsp;76 near the East Lyme\u2013Waterford line.\n\n===I-395===\nThe turnpike leaves I-95 at exit&nbsp;76 in East Lyme, continuing on as I-395 north heading towards [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], [[Jewett City, Connecticut|Jewett City]] and Plainfield until exit&nbsp;35, where the turnpike and I-395 split. I-395 continues north towards [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], ending at [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] and the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Connecticut Turnpike officially ends at US&nbsp;6 (Danielson Pike) in [[Killingly, Connecticut|Killingly]], which continues on towards [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Unlike the I-95 portion, the I-395 portion of the turnpike has changed very little over the years, retaining its grass median with a guardrail separating directions of travel.\n\n===US 1===\nThe Connecticut Turnpike incorporated a pre-existing relocation of US&nbsp;1 between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme, which included the original Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge over the Connecticut River, which opened in 1948. Upon the turnpike's opening in 1958, US&nbsp;1 has been co-signed with the turnpike between exit&nbsp;68 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] and exit&nbsp;70 in Old Lyme.\n\n===Route 2A===\nRoute&nbsp;2A was constructed to serve as a bypass around Norwich. It shares its alignment with the Connecticut Turnpike from its northern terminus at Route&nbsp;2 to exit&nbsp;9 on I-395, where it turns east and serves the Mohegan Sun Casino before crossing the Thames River and ending at Route&nbsp;2 south of Norwich.\n\n===SR 695===\nSR&nbsp;695 is the {{convert|4.49|mi|km|adj=on}} unsigned portion of the turnpike from I-395 in [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]] to US&nbsp;6 at the Rhode Island state line in [[Killingly, Connecticut|Killingly]]. The road is not signed as SR&nbsp;695 but eastbound as \"To US&nbsp;6 East\" and westbound as \"To I-395 South\". SR&nbsp;695 would have become part of the now-defunct alignment of the [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|I-84]] freeway between [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island]], had that freeway been built. (Present-day I-84 continues eastbound from Hartford into Massachusetts where it ends at I-90, the Massachusetts Turnpike). There are two partial exits on SR&nbsp;695. Westbound exit&nbsp;1 (formerly exit&nbsp;90) at Squaw Rock Road is only accessible westbound. The easternmost exit (also numbered exit&nbsp;1, but formerly unnumbered), located {{convert|1500|ft|m}} east of the Squaw Rock Road onramp and accessible only eastbound, is for Ross Road, and the only onramp provided from Ross Road is for SR&nbsp;695 westbound. The intersection with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]] is only partial: there is no access provided from SR&nbsp;695 westbound to I-395 northbound and no access from I-395 southbound to SR 695 eastbound.\n\n==History==\nThe general route and construction of the turnpike were both mandated by state law.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cga.ct.gov/2001/pub/Chap237.htm#sec13a-21.htm |title = Section 13a-21 of the General Statutes of Connecticut |publisher =  |access-date = October 4, 2014 }}</ref> Intended to relieve congestion on [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;1]] and [[Connecticut Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]] (the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway|Wilbur Cross]] parkways), design work began in 1954. The Connecticut Turnpike opened on January 2, 1958;<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?A=1380&Q=259704 |title = ConnDOT: Chapter 7 DOT History |author = Connecticut Department of Transportation |date =  |publisher =  |access-date = November 6, 2016 }}</ref> however, the westernmost portion of the highway (the {{convert|3|mi|km|disp=sqbr|spell=in}} connecting [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] with the [[New England Thruway]]) opened 10&nbsp;months later. Tolls were originally collected through a series of eight toll booths along the route.\n\nThe Connecticut Turnpike was designed and built much differently than other toll roads built around the same time. Unlike toll roads in other states that operated under semi-autonomous, quasi-public toll road authorities, the Connecticut Turnpike was operated by the Connecticut Highway Department (later the Connecticut Department of Transportation) from its inception. Additionally, unlike toll roads in other states where revenues collected from motorists were legally required to be kept within the toll road authority and used to finance the facility's construction and upkeep, toll revenues from the Connecticut Turnpike were placed into the state's general fund and used for highway and non-highway expenditures alike. Finally, the closely spaced interchanges and eight mainline barriers were a result of each town through which the Connecticut Turnpike passed being guaranteed a certain number of access points to gain the support of each affected town for construction of the highway. This is in contrast to toll roads built in neighboring states with widely spaced interchanges that normally featured a ticket system where one obtained a ticket at entering the toll road, then paid a distance-based fare upon exiting.\n\nThe turnpike was renamed after former Connecticut Governor [[John Davis Lodge]] on December 31, 1985, two months after the tolls were removed. Local legend is the initial phase of turnpike construction in 1954 was so disruptive in heavily Republican [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] that local voters there turned on incumbent Republican Governor Lodge, leading to his defeat by [[Abraham Ribicoff]].<ref>{{cite web |author =  |date = April 24, 2003 |url = http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2/comments/3954/ |title = Providence Journal: I-95 in Fairfield |work = WestportNow.com |location = Westport, Connecticut |publisher =  |access-date = October 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nInitially, the Connecticut Turnpike was signed as an east\u2013west route, even after the I-95 designation was added to the turnpike between Greenwich and Waterford in the early 1960s. Signs indicating I-95/Connecticut Turnpike as an east\u2013west route existed in places until the early 1990s, when the remaining east\u2013west signage was replaced by north\u2013south signage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nFrom Waterford to Killingly, the turnpike was initially designated as Route&nbsp;52 in 1967, following the opening of the toll-free section of Route&nbsp;52 from Killingly to the Massachusetts border. To accommodate the truncation of the Hartford to Providence extension of I-84 to Killingly, following Rhode Island's cancellation of its portion of that extension in the early 1980s, Route&nbsp;52 was to be re-designated as an Interstate. Initially, Connecticut and Massachusetts requested that the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) extend the [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] designation southward along free Route&nbsp;52 and the Connecticut Turnpike to I-95 in Waterford. AASHTO rejected the I-290 request and instead approved the I-395 designation in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title = State Ordered to Lift Ban on Tandem Trucks |work = Hartford Courant |date = June 14, 1983 }}{{Full|date=December 2018}} The article lists \"I-290 (formerly Route&nbsp;52)\" as one of the highways to which the lifting of the ban applies.</ref>\n\n===Accidents===\nSeveral horrific accidents have occurred throughout the turnpike's history. Arguably, the most notorious of these was a [[List of road accidents#1983|serious incident]] on January 19, 1983, in which a [[tractor trailer]] after a brake failure collided with four cars at the [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] toll plaza, killing seven people and injuring several others. The investigation following the crash determined that the truck driver fell asleep at the wheel just before the crash took place.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/20/nyregion/6-die-in-crash-at-toll-station-in-connecticut.html |title = 6 die in Crash at Toll Station in Connecticut |newspaper = The New York Times |date = January 20, 1983 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1983, a section of the turnpike's northbound [[Mianus River Bridge]] in Greenwich collapsed due to corrosion of its substructure, killing three motorists crossing it at the time.\n\nOn March 25, 2004, a tanker truck carrying fuel swerved to avoid a car that cut the truck off and subsequently overturned, dumping {{convert|8,000|USgal|l}} of home heating oil onto the Howard Avenue overpass in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. Passing vehicles kicked up the oil which ignited a towering inferno that subsequently melted the bridge structure and caused the southbound lanes to sag several feet. The northbound lanes, which received less damage from the fire, were opened five days later after being reinforced with temporary scaffolding. The southbound lanes opened on April 1, after a temporary bridge was erected.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/26/nyregion/fiery-truck-crash-closes-i-95-in-connecticut-for-weeks.html |title = Fiery Truck Crash Closes I-95 in Connecticut for Weeks |newspaper = The New York Times |date = March 26, 2004 |last1 = Tavernise |first1 = Sabrina |last2 = Salzman |first2 = Avi }}</ref>\n\n===Stalling of upgrades by budget deficits and lawsuits===\n[[File:Fairfield Ave overpass 3.JPG|thumb|right|Northbound I-95 in Stamford]]\nThe Connecticut Turnpike opened southwest Connecticut to a mass migration of New Yorkers, leading to substantial residential and economic growth in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] and [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven]] counties. The turnpike became a primary commuter route to [[New York City]]. With additional segments of I-95 that opened in the 1960s connecting to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Boston]], the turnpike became an essential route for transporting people and goods throughout the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. As a result, much of the turnpike had become functionally obsolete by 1965, with traffic exceeding its design capacity. Originally designed to carry 60,000&nbsp;vehicles per day (VPD) on the four-lane sections and 90,000&nbsp;VPD on the six-lane portion west of New Haven, the turnpike carried 75,000\u2013100,000&nbsp;VPD east of New Haven, and 130,000\u2013200,000&nbsp;VPD between New Haven and the New York state line as of 2006.\n\nThere were dozens of plans discussed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve safety on the turnpike for nearly 30 years, but most of these plans languished amid political infighting and lawsuits brought on by special-interest groups. Still, traffic and deadly accidents continued to increase each year on the turnpike, and by the 1990s the Connecticut Turnpike had started to become known as \"the Highway of Death\".<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.reiffandbily.com/dangerous-roads-america/ |title = The Most Dangerous Roads + Highways in America |publisher = Reiff & Bily |date = June 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, while most of the turnpike is signed as I-95 or I-395, the highway was designed and built before the [[Interstate Highway System]] was established. As a result, much of the turnpike does not meet Interstate standards, particularly with overpasses ranging from {{convert|13.5|to|15|ft|m}}; [[Interstate Highway standards]] require {{convert|16|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} of vertical clearance. Interchanges are too closely spaced; ramps and acceleration-deceleration lanes need to be lengthened. In some areas, median and shoulder widths and curve radii also fall short of Interstate standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/geometric/pubs/mitigationstrategies/ |title = Mitigation Strategies for Design Exceptions |date = July 2007 |publisher = Federal Highway Administration }}</ref>\n\nComplicating efforts to upgrade the turnpike to Interstate standards is that engineers did not acquire enough [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] to accommodate future expansion when the Connecticut Turnpike was built during the late 1950s, which means adjacent land must be seized to upgrade the turnpike, resulting in lengthy and costly [[eminent domain]] battles between the State of Connecticut and landowners refusing to give up their property. Additionally the turnpike passes through areas with some of the highest property values in the country, making land acquisition for expanding the highway extremely expensive.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2014}} Finally, the turnpike was built through environmentally sensitive ecosystems and wetlands associated with [[Long Island Sound]], meaning most expansion projects require lengthy environmental impact studies that are able to withstand constant litigation by environmental groups. Air pollution laws also cause conflict, since Connecticut is grouped into the federal statistical areas around New York City and it suffers from consequences and special regulations applied to non-compliant air quality areas. An example of this is that it is easier to lengthen an entrance or exit ramp than to add a full lane, since adding any capacity to a road, by definition, will increase the pollution created by the road, further violating federal air quality standards. In 2000, one ConnDOT official commented during a public meeting on expanding [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] (an Interstate that parallels I-95 about {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} further inland), \"If we had tried to build I-95 today, it would be impossible because of the sensitive ecosystems it passes through. It would never get approved.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Bridge collapse jumpstarts turnpike upgrades===\nA comprehensive plan to address safety and capacity issues on the Connecticut Turnpike did not progress beyond the initial planning stages until the collapse of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] on June 28, 1983.<ref>{{cite web |last = Weizel |first = Richard |date = October 17, 2011 |title = Road Crews Toil as Fairfield County Bridges Age |url = http://greenwich.dailyvoice.com/news/road-crews-toil-fairfield-county-bridges-age |work = The Greenwich Daily Voice |access-date = July 18, 2012 }}</ref> Following the collapse, Governor [[William O'Neill (Connecticut politician)|William A. O'Neill]] initiated an $8 billion program to rehabilitate Connecticut's highways. Included in this program was the inspection and repair of the turnpike's nearly 300&nbsp;bridges and overpasses. Furthermore, O'Neill directed ConnDOT to develop a viable plan for addressing safety and congestion on the state's roads.\n\n===High-priority status===\nThroughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, ConnDOT developed a comprehensive plan to improve the turnpike through Fairfield and New Haven counties. In 1993 ConnDOT embarked on a 25-year multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the Connecticut Turnpike from the [[Connecticut River]] at [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to the New York state line at [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. The program included the complete reconstruction of several turnpike segments, including replacing bridges, adding travel lanes, reconfiguring interchanges, upgrading lighting and signage, and implementing the [[intelligent transportation system]] with traffic cameras, a variety of embedded roadway sensors, and [[variable-message sign]]s. Since the start of the program, a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} section through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] was completely rebuilt to Interstate standards. In 2015, a long-term $2 billion program was completed, to rebuild {{convert|12|mi|km}} of turnpike between [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] and [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], including a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Quinnipiac River]] and [[New Haven Harbor]].\n\nPlans to upgrade the turnpike received a boost in 2005 when federal legislation known as [[SAFETEA-LU]] designated the I-95 portion of the Connecticut Turnpike from the New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] as [[Corridor 65 (NHS)|High Priority Corridor&nbsp;65]]. Corridor&nbsp;65 also includes the {{convert|24|mi|km|sing=on}} section of I-95 from Waterford to the Rhode Island state line that was built in 1964, which is not part of the Turnpike.\n\n===Plans for the I-395/SR&nbsp;695 section===\nTraffic is relatively light on the rural I-395 section and the northeast leg (SR&nbsp;695) in Killingly; this section is largely unchanged from its original 1958 profile. The only two major projects completed on this section since were the 2015 renumbering of exits based on I-395 mileposts (exit&nbsp;77 became exit&nbsp;2, up to exit&nbsp;90 which became exit&nbsp;35) and the reconstruction of the northbound on and off ramps at exit&nbsp;11 (old exit&nbsp;80) in [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], completed in 2009.\n\n===Improvement projects===\n{{prose|section|date=January 2020}}\n* [[Raymond E.

Due to the rising cost of materials however, there were no contractors interested in the project when it was advertised for bid in 2006. ConnDOT broke the project up into several smaller contracts, with construction completed on all contracts by November 2016.\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls on the Connecticut Turnpike have been a source of controversy from the turnpike's opening in 1958 to the removal of tolls in 1985, and the debate continues today. The Connecticut Turnpike originally opened with a [[barrier toll system]] (or open system), unlike toll roads in neighboring states, which used a [[ticket system]] (or closed system) for collecting tolls. Initially tolls on the Connecticut Turnpike were $0.25, and the toll barriers were located in the following locations: Greenwich, Norwalk, Stratford, West Haven, Branford, Madison, Montville, and Plainfield. Tolls also were collected until the early 1970s in Old Saybrook at the west end of the Baldwin Bridge over the Connecticut River. Additionally, unlike other toll roads which featured widely spaced interchanges and generally ran along the outskirts of major urban centers, the Connecticut Turnpike was built through the middle of several large cities (notably Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven) and has over 90&nbsp;interchanges along its {{convert|129|mi|km|adj=on}} length\u201450 of which are along the {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch between the New York state line and New Haven.\n\n===Token war with New York City Subway===\nThere was some controversy in the early 1980s when [[New York City Subway]] riders discovered that tokens purchased for use in the Connecticut Turnpike toll booths were of the same size and weight as New York City Subway tokens. Since they cost less than one third as much, they began showing up in subway collection boxes regularly.<ref>{{cite news |title = Connecticut Highway Token Buys Subway Ride, Too |work = The New York Times |date = November 18, 1982 |page = 1 }}</ref> Connecticut authorities initially agreed to change the size of their tokens,<ref>{{cite news |title = Connecticut to Alter Its Turnpike Tokens, Solving Subway Issue |work = The New York Times |date = December 15, 1982 |page = 1 }}</ref> but later reneged and the problem went unsolved until 1985, when Connecticut discontinued the tolls on its turnpike.<ref name=\"token war\">{{cite news |title = {{frac|17|1|2}} Accord Puts an End to the Great Token War |work = The New York Times |date = November 7, 1985 }}</ref> At that time, the MTA was paid 17.5 cents for each of more than two million tokens that had been collected during the three-year \"token war\".<ref name=\"token war\"/>\n\n===Abolition of tolls===\nAfter a 1983 truck crash that killed seven people at the Stratford toll plaza, toll opponents pressured the State of Connecticut to remove tolls from the turnpike in 1985. Three years later, these same opponents successfully lobbied the Connecticut General Assembly to pass legislation abolishing tolls on all of Connecticut's highways (with the exception of two car ferries across the Connecticut River in [[Chester, Connecticut|Chester]] and [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]]). While the 1983 Stratford accident was cited as the main reason for abolishing tolls in Connecticut, the underlying reason was that federal legislation at that time forbade states with toll roads from using federal funds for road projects. Because the [[Mianus River Bridge]] was rebuilt with federal highway funds following its June 1983 collapse, Connecticut was required by Section 113(c) of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] to remove tolls from the turnpike once its construction bonds were paid off.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/tollroad.cfm |title = Why Does The Interstate System Include Toll Facilities? |work = Ask the Rambler |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |author =  |date =  |access-date = November 6, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe debate over tolls on the Connecticut Turnpike did not end in 1988 with the abolition of tolls. Prior to their removal in 1985, the tolls generated over $65 million annually. Since their removal in the late 1980s, Connecticut lawmakers have continuously discussed reinstating tolls, but have balked at bringing tolls back out of concern of having to repay $2.6 billion in federal highway funds that Connecticut received for turnpike construction projects following the abolition of tolls.\n\nDuring the economic recession of the early 1990s, legislators studied reinstating tolls on parts of the Connecticut Turnpike and portions of highways around Hartford to make up for budget deficits. Proposals for reinstating tolls were scrapped in lieu of implementing an [[income tax]] and increasing the state gasoline tax and sales tax, and imposing a new tax on corporate windfall profits.\n\n===Continuation of toll debate===\nWith continual budget woes in Hartford, the idea of reinstating tolls resurfaced in January 2010. State Representative Tony Guerrera estimated a $5 toll at Connecticut's borders could generate $600 million in revenue. Governor Dannel P. Malloy expressed pessimism that toll revenue would be spent exclusively on infrastructure repairs, but a need to generate additional revenue, paired with decreases in traditional highway funding sources (such as federal aid and gas tax revenue) means the idea could receive serious consideration in the state legislature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Services==\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|Fairfield Service Plaza southbound]]\nThe turnpike has 13&nbsp;[[service plaza]]s, which are open 24&nbsp;hours a day.

Most plazas also offer a variety of other food service options, including [[McDonald's]] and [[Sbarro]]. From 2011 to 2015, the original plazas were rebuilt with new and expanded buildings and improved fueling facilities.

In July 2016, the rest area was closed due to budget cuts and barriers were placed on the highway blocking access to the facility. In September 2019, the rest area was reopened.\n\nThere are three State Police stations located on the turnpike:\nTroop F: Westbrook at milepost&nbsp;74 on southbound side of turnpike.\nTroop E: Montville at milepost&nbsp;96 on northbound side of turnpike (at former service plaza).\nTroop G: Bridgeport at milepost&nbsp;29 and the junction with Route&nbsp;8 and Route&nbsp;25 (on surface road, exit 27, just below interchange).\n\nThere is one weigh station located northbound at milepost&nbsp;2 in Greenwich, at the location of the former toll plaza. Weigh stations on both sides of the turnpike used to exist near exit&nbsp;18 in Westport; these were removed during the 1990s. The former southbound weigh station in Westport is now used by ConnDOT to store construction materials, while the northbound station was demolished; the grounds returned to their natural state.\n\nThe administration building for the former West Haven toll plaza can still be seen by drivers between exits&nbsp;42 and 43. Today, ConnDOT uses the old toll building as a maintenance facility.\n\nDuring 2013, electric vehicle (EV) charging for Tesla automobiles was added to the Milford northbound and southbound service plazas in support of Tesla's effort to create a Boston\u2013Washington EV corridor. These locations were the second Supercharger installations on the East Coast; the first was in Newark, Delaware, at the Delaware Turnpike's service plaza.

In France, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are present.\n* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\n* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.\n* The velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').\n* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/~/\u0292/}}. {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[\u0281u]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.\n* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[\u0265]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/p\u025bj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', \"pay\", vs. {{IPA|/p\u025bi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', \"country\".\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n* Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).\n** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' \u2192 ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' \u2192 ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.\n* Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' (\"the man whom he saw\") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.\n\n==Writing system==\n\n===Alphabet===\n{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in \"\u00e7\".\n\nThere are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed to \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' \"finger\" (Latin ''digitus'')\n* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' \"foot\" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]\n\nFrench is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber'' and ''tomb\u00e9'' both end with the /e/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129\u201344|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00785731/file/Brissaud_Chevrot_2011_.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''ch\u00e2teau'' pl. ''ch\u00e2teaux''.\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\n* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\n* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzj\u0254\u0303]}} and not {{IPA|[il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u025b\u0303fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo]}}.\n* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\n** Accents that affect pronunciation\n*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''\u00e9'' (e.g., '''''\u00e9'''cole''\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''\u00e8'' (e.g., ''\u00e9l'''\u00e8'''ve''\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''\u00ea'' (e.g. ''for'''\u00ea'''t''\u2014forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and that an ''\u00f4'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} for the letter ''\u00e2'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''for\u00eat'', ''hospital'' became ''h\u00f4pital'', and ''hostel'' became ''h\u00f4tel''.\n*** [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Diaeresis]] or ''tr\u00e9ma'' (''\u00eb'', ''\u00ef'', ''\u00fc'', ''\u00ff''): over ''e'', ''i'', ''u'' or ''y'',  indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''na\u00efve'', ''No\u00ebl''.\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''o'' (''N'''o\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|\u0254\u025b|}}) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by ''n'' (''[[Samo\u00ebns|Sam'''o\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|w\u025b\u0303|}})\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''a'' is either pronounced {{IPA-fr|\u025b|}} (''Raph'''a\u00eb'''l'', ''Isr'''a\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|a\u025b|}}) or not pronounced, leaving only the ''a'' (''[[Madame de Sta\u00ebl|St'''a\u00eb'''l]]'' {{IPA-fr|a|}}) and the ''a'' is nasalized in the regular way if ''a\u00eb'' is followed by ''n'' (''[[Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-S'''a\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303|}})\n****A diaeresis on ''y'' only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which ''\u00ff'' appears include ''[[A\u00ff]]'' (commune in ''d\u00e9partement de la [[Marne (department)|Marne]]'', formerly ''A\u00ff-Champagne''), ''Rue des Clo\u00ffs'' (alley in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]), ''Cro\u00ff'' (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), ''[[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff|Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff]]'' (near [[Joigny]]), ''Gh\u00ffs'' (name of Flemish origin spelt ''Gh\u0133s'' where ''\u0133'' in handwriting looked like ''\u00ff'' to French clerks), ''[[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]]'' (commune between Paris and [[Orly]] airport), [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] (author), [[Mo\u00ff-de-l'Aisne]] (commune in '' d\u00e9partement de l'[[Aisne (department)|Aisne]]'' and family name), and ''Le Blanc de Nicola\u00ff'' (an insurance company in eastern France).\n****The diaeresis on ''u'' appears in the Biblical proper names ''Arch\u00e9la\u00fcs'', ''Capharna\u00fcm'', ''Emma\u00fcs'', ''\u00c9sa\u00fc'', and ''Sa\u00fcl'', as well as French names such as [[Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy|Ha\u00fcy]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing ''gu\u00eb'' (such as ''aigu\u00eb'' or ''cigu\u00eb'') may be moved onto the ''u'': ''aig\u00fce'', ''cig\u00fce'', and by analogy may be used in verbs such as ''j'arg\u00fce''.\n****In addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as ''K\u00e4rcher'' (trademark of a pressure washer).\n*** The [[cedilla]] (''la c\u00e9dille'') ''\u00e7'' (e.g., ''gar'''\u00e7'''on''\u2014boy) means that the letter ''\u00e7'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''\u00e7'' is never found in front of front vowels.\n** Accents with no pronunciation effect\n*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''\u00eele'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''d\u00eetes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''d\u00fb'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\n*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''l\u00e0'' and ''o\u00f9'' (\"there\", \"where\") from the article ''la'' (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' (\"or\"), respectively.\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fon\u00e9tik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>\n\nIn 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|date=2016-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|French grammar}}\nFrench is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s\n* the loss of the neuter gender\n* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s\n* the loss of certain Latin [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nEvery French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante\". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants\". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants\". In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant\", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le\", \"la\", and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Main|French verbs}}\n\n==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (imp\u00e9ratif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[infinitive]] mood (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the [[past participle]] (participe pass\u00e9).\n\n===== Finite moods =====\n\n====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (pr\u00e9sent), the [[simple past]] ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]] and [[pass\u00e9 simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur ant\u00e9rieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Indicatif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 simple\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimons\n|j'aimais\n|nous aimions\n|j'ai aim\u00e9\n|nous avons aim\u00e9\n|j'aimai\n|nous aim\u00e2mes\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimez\n|tu aimais\n|vous aimiez\n|tu as aim\u00e9\n|vous avez aim\u00e9\n|tu aimas\n|vous aim\u00e2tes\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aimait\n|ils/elles aimaient\n|il/elle a aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles ont aim\u00e9\n|il/elle aima\n|ils/elles aim\u00e8rent\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur simple\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur ant\u00e9rieur\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aimerai\n|nous aimerons\n|j'aurai aim\u00e9\n|nous aurons aim\u00e9\n|j'avais aim\u00e9\n|nous avions aim\u00e9\n|j'eus aim\u00e9\n|nous e\u00fbmes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimeras\n|vous aimerez\n|tu auras aim\u00e9\n|vous aurez aim\u00e9\n|tu avais aim\u00e9\n|vous aviez aim\u00e9\n|tu eus aim\u00e9\n|vous e\u00fbtes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aimera\n|ils/elles aimeront\n|il/elle aura aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles auront aim\u00e9\n|il/elle avais aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles avaient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle eut aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eurent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Subjonctif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimions\n|j'aimasse\n|nous aimassions\n|j'aie aim\u00e9\n|nous ayons aim\u00e9\n|j'eusse aim\u00e9\n|nous eussions aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimiez\n|tu aimasses\n|vous aimassiez\n|tu aies aim\u00e9\n|vous ayez aim\u00e9\n|tu eusses aim\u00e9\n|vous eussiez aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aim\u00e2t\n|ils/elles aimassent\n|il/elle ait aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles aient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle e\u00fbt aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eussent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Imperative (Imperatif) ======\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense).

The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''\u00eatre'' (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\n* \"Elle aime le chien.\" ''She loves the dog.''\n* \"Marc a conduit la voiture.\" ''Marc drove the car.''\nExample of the passive voice:\n* \"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" ''The dog is loved by her.''\n* \"La voiture \u00e9tait conduite par Marc.\" ''The car was driven by Marc.''\n\n==== Syntax ====\n\n===== Word order =====\nFrench declarative word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] (VOS) and [[object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n* brother: ''[[wikt:fr\u00e8re|fr\u00e8re]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''\n* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''\n* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fid\u00e8le|fid\u00e8le]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''\n* eye: ''[[wikt:\u0153il|\u0153il]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''\n* ''[[wikt:\u00e9teindre|\u00e9teindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''\n* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''\n* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''\n* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<!-- <ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules.

The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences. This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge| page = 110 | isbn = 978-0-521-09838-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name=\"Jean-Pierre Martin 1984\">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du fran\u00e7ais parl\u00e9 en Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'', \u00e9d.

Its closest relatives are the other [[langues d'o\u00efl]]\u2014languages historically spoken in northern [[France]] and in southern [[Belgium]], which French ([[Francien]]) largely supplanted. French was also [[substratum|influenced]] by native [[Celtic languages]] of Northern Roman Gaul like [[Gallia Belgica]] and by the ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) [[Frankish language]] of the post-Roman [[Franks|Frankish]] invaders.

In France, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are present.\n* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\n* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.\n* The velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').\n* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/~/\u0292/}}. {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[\u0281u]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.\n* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[\u0265]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/p\u025bj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', \"pay\", vs. {{IPA|/p\u025bi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', \"country\".\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n* Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).\n** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' \u2192 ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' \u2192 ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.\n* Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' (\"the man whom he saw\") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.\n\n==Writing system==\n\n===Alphabet===\n{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in \"\u00e7\".\n\nThere are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed to \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' \"finger\" (Latin ''digitus'')\n* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' \"foot\" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]\n\nFrench is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber'' and ''tomb\u00e9'' both end with the /e/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129\u201344|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00785731/file/Brissaud_Chevrot_2011_.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''ch\u00e2teau'' pl. ''ch\u00e2teaux''.\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\n* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\n* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzj\u0254\u0303]}} and not {{IPA|[il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u025b\u0303fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo]}}.\n* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\n** Accents that affect pronunciation\n*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''\u00e9'' (e.g., '''''\u00e9'''cole''\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''\u00e8'' (e.g., ''\u00e9l'''\u00e8'''ve''\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''\u00ea'' (e.g. ''for'''\u00ea'''t''\u2014forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and that an ''\u00f4'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} for the letter ''\u00e2'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''for\u00eat'', ''hospital'' became ''h\u00f4pital'', and ''hostel'' became ''h\u00f4tel''.\n*** [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Diaeresis]] or ''tr\u00e9ma'' (''\u00eb'', ''\u00ef'', ''\u00fc'', ''\u00ff''): over ''e'', ''i'', ''u'' or ''y'',  indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''na\u00efve'', ''No\u00ebl''.\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''o'' (''N'''o\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|\u0254\u025b|}}) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by ''n'' (''[[Samo\u00ebns|Sam'''o\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|w\u025b\u0303|}})\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''a'' is either pronounced {{IPA-fr|\u025b|}} (''Raph'''a\u00eb'''l'', ''Isr'''a\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|a\u025b|}}) or not pronounced, leaving only the ''a'' (''[[Madame de Sta\u00ebl|St'''a\u00eb'''l]]'' {{IPA-fr|a|}}) and the ''a'' is nasalized in the regular way if ''a\u00eb'' is followed by ''n'' (''[[Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-S'''a\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303|}})\n****A diaeresis on ''y'' only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which ''\u00ff'' appears include ''[[A\u00ff]]'' (commune in ''d\u00e9partement de la [[Marne (department)|Marne]]'', formerly ''A\u00ff-Champagne''), ''Rue des Clo\u00ffs'' (alley in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]), ''Cro\u00ff'' (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), ''[[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff|Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff]]'' (near [[Joigny]]), ''Gh\u00ffs'' (name of Flemish origin spelt ''Gh\u0133s'' where ''\u0133'' in handwriting looked like ''\u00ff'' to French clerks), ''[[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]]'' (commune between Paris and [[Orly]] airport), [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] (author), [[Mo\u00ff-de-l'Aisne]] (commune in '' d\u00e9partement de l'[[Aisne (department)|Aisne]]'' and family name), and ''Le Blanc de Nicola\u00ff'' (an insurance company in eastern France).\n****The diaeresis on ''u'' appears in the Biblical proper names ''Arch\u00e9la\u00fcs'', ''Capharna\u00fcm'', ''Emma\u00fcs'', ''\u00c9sa\u00fc'', and ''Sa\u00fcl'', as well as French names such as [[Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy|Ha\u00fcy]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing ''gu\u00eb'' (such as ''aigu\u00eb'' or ''cigu\u00eb'') may be moved onto the ''u'': ''aig\u00fce'', ''cig\u00fce'', and by analogy may be used in verbs such as ''j'arg\u00fce''.\n****In addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as ''K\u00e4rcher'' (trademark of a pressure washer).\n*** The [[cedilla]] (''la c\u00e9dille'') ''\u00e7'' (e.g., ''gar'''\u00e7'''on''\u2014boy) means that the letter ''\u00e7'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''\u00e7'' is never found in front of front vowels.\n** Accents with no pronunciation effect\n*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''\u00eele'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''d\u00eetes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''d\u00fb'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\n*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''l\u00e0'' and ''o\u00f9'' (\"there\", \"where\") from the article ''la'' (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' (\"or\"), respectively.\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fon\u00e9tik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>\n\nIn 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|date=2016-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|French grammar}}\nFrench is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s\n* the loss of the neuter gender\n* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s\n* the loss of certain Latin [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nEvery French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante\". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants\". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants\". In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant\", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le\", \"la\", and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Main|French verbs}}\n\n==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (imp\u00e9ratif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[infinitive]] mood (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the [[past participle]] (participe pass\u00e9).\n\n===== Finite moods =====\n\n====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (pr\u00e9sent), the [[simple past]] ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]] and [[pass\u00e9 simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur ant\u00e9rieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Indicatif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 simple\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimons\n|j'aimais\n|nous aimions\n|j'ai aim\u00e9\n|nous avons aim\u00e9\n|j'aimai\n|nous aim\u00e2mes\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimez\n|tu aimais\n|vous aimiez\n|tu as aim\u00e9\n|vous avez aim\u00e9\n|tu aimas\n|vous aim\u00e2tes\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aimait\n|ils/elles aimaient\n|il/elle a aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles ont aim\u00e9\n|il/elle aima\n|ils/elles aim\u00e8rent\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur simple\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur ant\u00e9rieur\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aimerai\n|nous aimerons\n|j'aurai aim\u00e9\n|nous aurons aim\u00e9\n|j'avais aim\u00e9\n|nous avions aim\u00e9\n|j'eus aim\u00e9\n|nous e\u00fbmes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimeras\n|vous aimerez\n|tu auras aim\u00e9\n|vous aurez aim\u00e9\n|tu avais aim\u00e9\n|vous aviez aim\u00e9\n|tu eus aim\u00e9\n|vous e\u00fbtes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aimera\n|ils/elles aimeront\n|il/elle aura aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles auront aim\u00e9\n|il/elle avais aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles avaient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle eut aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eurent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Subjonctif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimions\n|j'aimasse\n|nous aimassions\n|j'aie aim\u00e9\n|nous ayons aim\u00e9\n|j'eusse aim\u00e9\n|nous eussions aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimiez\n|tu aimasses\n|vous aimassiez\n|tu aies aim\u00e9\n|vous ayez aim\u00e9\n|tu eusses aim\u00e9\n|vous eussiez aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aim\u00e2t\n|ils/elles aimassent\n|il/elle ait aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles aient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle e\u00fbt aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eussent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Imperative (Imperatif) ======\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense).

The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''\u00eatre'' (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\n* \"Elle aime le chien.\" ''She loves the dog.''\n* \"Marc a conduit la voiture.\" ''Marc drove the car.''\nExample of the passive voice:\n* \"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" ''The dog is loved by her.''\n* \"La voiture \u00e9tait conduite par Marc.\" ''The car was driven by Marc.''\n\n==== Syntax ====\n\n===== Word order =====\nFrench declarative word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] (VOS) and [[object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n* brother: ''[[wikt:fr\u00e8re|fr\u00e8re]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''\n* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''\n* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fid\u00e8le|fid\u00e8le]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''\n* eye: ''[[wikt:\u0153il|\u0153il]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''\n* ''[[wikt:\u00e9teindre|\u00e9teindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''\n* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''\n* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''\n* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<!-- <ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules.

Online version</ref>\n\n===Numerals===\nThe French counting system is partially [[vigesimal]]: [[20 (number)|twenty]] (''{{lang|fr|vingt}}'') is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 70 to 99. The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences. This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge| page = 110 | isbn = 978-0-521-09838-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name=\"Jean-Pierre Martin 1984\">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du fran\u00e7ais parl\u00e9 en Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'', \u00e9d.

In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'' (Geneva, Neuch\u00e2tel, Jura) or ''{{lang|fr|huitante}}'' (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg).

The years during which her sons reigned have been called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici\" as she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France.<ref>Thomson, 98; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 3; Neale, ''The Age of Catherine de Medici''.</ref> \n\nShe was born in Florence to [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino|Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Duke of Urbino]] and  [[Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne]]. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] and [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]]. Catherine's marriage was arranged by her uncle [[Pope Clement VII]]. Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]], who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old King Francis II. When Francis II died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as [[regent]] for her son [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX, King of France]]. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months).\n\nCatherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant [[French Wars of Religion|civil and religious war in France]]. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or [[Huguenots]], as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 272.</ref> In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572, in which thousands of [[Huguenot]]s were killed in Paris and throughout France.\n\nSome historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters.<ref>Knecht, 272. For a summary of the fluctuations in Catherine's historical reputation, see the preface to R. J. Knecht's ''Catherine de' Medici'', 1998: xi\u2013xiv.</ref> In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the [[House of Valois|Valois monarchy]] on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 20.</ref> Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 26.</ref> According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in 16th-century Europe.<ref name=\"stragexi\">Strage, Mark (1976).

Prologue, p.xi.</ref>\n\n==Birth and upbringing==\n[[File:El papa Clemente VII, por Sebastiano del Piombo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, [[Pope Clement VII]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], c.1531. Clement called Catherine's betrothal to [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orl\u00e9ans]] \"the greatest match in the world\".]]\nCatherine de' Medici was born on 13 April 1519 in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], the only child of [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]], and his wife, [[Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at [[Amboise]] as part of the alliance between King [[Francis I of France]] and Lorenzo's uncle [[Pope Leo X]] against the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]]. According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were \"as pleased as if it had been a boy\".\n\nWithin a month of Catherine's birth, both her parents were dead: Madeleine died on 28 April of [[puerperal fever]] or [[plague (disease)|plague]], and Lorenzo died on 4 May,<ref name =\"kviii\"/> his title over Urbino reverting to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]]. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her.<ref name =\"kviii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 8.</ref>\n\nCatherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]]). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, [[Clarice de' Medici]]. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her ''duchessina'' (\"the little duchess\"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the [[Duchy of Urbino]].<ref>Young, ''The Medici: Volume II'', 15.</ref>\n\nIn 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal [[Silvio Passerini]], and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 11.</ref> The final one, the ''Santissima Annuziata delle Murate'' was her home for three years. Mark Strage described these years as \"the happiest of her entire life\".<ref name=\"strage13\">Strage, pp. 13, 15</ref> Clement had no choice but to crown [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 10\u201311.</ref> In October 1529, Charles's troops laid [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)|siege to Florence]]. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification.<ref name=\"strage15\">Strage, p.15</ref> The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.<ref name= \"kxii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 12.</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Henri & Catherine.jpg|thumb|right|Catherine and Henry's marriage, painted seventeen years after the event]]\nOn her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as \"small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 14.</ref> Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including [[James V of Scotland]] who sent the [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530.<ref>Hay, Denys, ed., ''The Letters of James V'', HMSO (1954), p.173, 180\u20132, 189,</ref> When Francis I of France proposed his second son, [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who, despite her wealth, was of common origin.\n\nThe wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving,<ref name=knecht/> took place in the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]] in [[Marseille]] on 28 October 1533.<ref>[http://www.marseille13.fr/fr/eglise-saint-ferreol-les-augustins Marseille 13: Eglise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]</ref> Prince Henry danced and [[jousting|jousted]] for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that \"each had shown valour in the joust\".<ref name=knecht>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 16.</ref> Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings.\n\nCatherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please. The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court. The next pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, \"The girl has come to me stark naked.\"\n\nPrince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, [[Filippa Duci|Philippa Duci]], one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29\u201330. Henry legitimised the child under the name [[Diane de France]]; he also produced at least two sons by other women.</ref> This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.\n\n===Dauphine===\n[[File:Henry II, king of France.. F Clouet.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], by [[Corneille de Lyon]]. During his childhood, Henry spent almost four and a half years as a hostage in Spain, an ordeal that marked him for life, leaving him introverted and gloomy.]]\nIn 1536, Henry's older brother, [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis]], caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir. As [[Dauphine of France|dauphine]], Catherine was expected to provide a future heir to the throne.<ref name = \"kxxiv\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29.</ref> According to the court chronicler [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant\u00f4me|Brant\u00f4me]], \"many people advised the king and the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France\".<ref>Knecht, 29.</ref> Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her \"source of life\", and drinking mule's urine. On 19 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a [[Francis II of France|son]], named after King Francis.\n\nAfter becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician [[Jean Fernel]], who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]]. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (born 27 June 1550); the future [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (born 19 September 1551); and [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]] (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the [[House of Valois|Valois dynasty]], which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.\n\nCatherine's ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, at the age of 15, Henry had taken as his mistress the 38-year-old [[Diane de Poitiers]], whom he adored for the rest of his life.<ref>Heritier, 38\u201342.</ref> Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint-Denis]] on 10 June 1549.\n\n===Queen of France===\n[[File:KatharinavonMedici.jpg|thumb|left|Catherine de' Medici, as queen of France. \"Her mouth is too large and her eyes too prominent and colourless for beauty\", wrote a Venetian envoy as Catherine approached forty, \"but a very distinguished-looking woman, with a shapely figure, a beautiful skin and exquisitely shaped hands\".]]\nHenry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen.<ref>Morris, 247</ref> Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 42\u201343.</ref> Henry gave the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau|Ch\u00e2teau of Chenonceau]], which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, who took her place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.\n[[File:Jeton en argent sur Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.jpg|thumb|Silver jeton on Catherine de'M\u00e9dici]]\n\nThe imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 38.</ref> Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 34.</ref> The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.\n\nHenry's reign also saw the rise of the Guise brothers, [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles]], who became a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and Henry's boyhood friend [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Francis]], who became [[Counts and Dukes of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. Their sister [[Mary of Guise]] had married [[James V of Scotland]] in 1538 and was the mother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis.<ref>Guy, 46.</ref> Catherine brought her up with her own children at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's [[regent]].<ref>Guy, 41.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brazilian ball for Henry II in Rouen October 1 1550.jpg|thumb|\"[[France Antarctique|Brazilian ball]]\" for [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and Catherine de' Medici in [[Rouen]], 1 October 1550, a precursor to the creation of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Brazil]].]]\nOn 3\u20134 April 1559, Henry signed the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]] with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and England, ending a long period of [[Italian Wars]]. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine's thirteen-year-old daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] to [[Philip II of Spain]].<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 55.</ref> Their [[proxy wedding]], in Paris on 22 June 1559, was celebrated with festivities, balls, [[masque]]s, and five days of [[jousting]].\n\nKing Henry took part in the jousting, sporting Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery]], knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\">Pettegree, 154.</ref> Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters \"of a good bigness\" sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Ch\u00e2teau de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, \"for fear\", in the words of a chronicler, \"of being expelled by the Queen\". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words \"''lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor''\" (\"from this come my tears and my pain\"), and wore black [[mourning]] in memory of Henry.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 56\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Queen mother==\n\n===Reign of Francis II===\n[[File:FrancoisII.jpg| thumb| upright| [[Francis II of France]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], 1560. Francis found the crown so heavy at his coronation that four nobles had to hold it in place as he walked up the steps to his throne.<ref>Guy, 102\u20133.</ref>]]\n\n[[Francis II of France|Francis II]] became king at the age of fifteen. In what has been called a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'', the Cardinal of Lorraine and the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]]\u2014whose niece, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], had married Francis II the year before\u2014seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the [[Louvre Palace]] with the young couple.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 59.</ref> The English ambassador reported a few days later that \"the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 60.</ref> For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself.<ref>Morris, 248.</ref> Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: \"This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that&nbsp;...\". Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]] to the crown. She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.\n\nThe Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], the [[First Prince of the Blood]], and then, with more success, to his brother, [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force.<ref>Holt, 38\u201339.</ref> When the Guises heard of the plot,<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 64; Holt, 44. The incident was known later as the [[Amboise conspiracy|\"tumult\" or conspiracy of Amboise]].</ref> they moved the court to the fortified [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]]. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the ch\u00e2teau. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 282.</ref> Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nIn June 1560, [[Michel de l'H\u00f4pital]] was appointed [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Chancellor of France]]. He sought the support of France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 32.</ref> Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Cond\u00e9 raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an [[abscess]] in his ear.<ref>Knecht, 72; Guy, 119.</ref>\n\nWhen Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], in return for the release of his brother Cond\u00e9.<ref>Pettegree, 154; Hoogvliet, 105. The regency was traditionally the preserve of the princes of the blood.</ref> As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (''gouvernante de France''), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: \"My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 73.</ref>\n\n===Reign of Charles IX===\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles IX of France]], after [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], c. 1565. The Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiel described Charles as \"an admirable child, with fine eyes, gracious movements, though he is not robust. He favours physical exercise that is too violent for his health, for he suffers from shortness of breath\".]]\n\nAt first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 28.</ref>\n\nShe summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting [[Colloquy of Poissy]] ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission.<ref>Manetsch, 22.</ref> Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, \"she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 80.</ref> In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 311; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 11\u201312. The edict, also known as the Edict of Toleration and the Edict of January, was significant for effectively recognising the existence of Protestant churches and permitting their worship outside city walls.</ref> On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the [[Massacre of Vassy]], the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at [[Wassy|Vassy (Wassy)]], killing 74 and wounding 104.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 87.</ref> Guise, who called the massacre \"a regrettable accident\", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the [[French Wars of Religion]]. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 140.</ref>\n\nWithin a month [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], and [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Gaspard de Coligny]] had raised an army of 1,800. They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down. She therefore told him: \"Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 89.</ref> The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held [[Rouen]]. Catherine visited the deathbed of [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], after he was fatally wounded by an [[arquebus]] shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, \"My courage is as great as yours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 90.</ref> The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called [[Jean de Poltrot|Poltrot de M\u00e9r\u00e9]] fired an arquebus into the back of the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], at the siege of Orl\u00e9ans. The murder triggered an aristocratic [[feud|blood feud]] that complicated the French civil wars for years to come.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 91; Carroll, 126; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 17.</ref> Catherine, however, was delighted with the death of her ally. \"If Monsieur de Guise had perished sooner\", she told the Venetian ambassador, \"peace would have been achieved more quickly\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 91\u201392.</ref> On 19 March 1563, the [[Edict of Amboise]], also known as the Edict of Pacification, ended the war. Catherine now rallied both Huguenot and Catholic forces to retake [[Le Havre]] from the English.\n\n====Huguenots====\nOn 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the [[Parlement]] of Rouen, but he was never able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 20.</ref> Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the [[Edict of Amboise]] and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a [[royal entry|progress]] around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 15.</ref> Catherine held talks with [[Jeanne d'Albret]], the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of [[Antoine de Bourbon]]) at [[M\u00e2con]] and [[N\u00e9rac]].

Nevertheless, the [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.<ref>Wood, 28.</ref>\n\nCatherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554-1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref>Holt, 77.</ref> After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for [[Philip II of Spain]]. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and [[Henry III of Navarre]], Jeanne' son, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 135.</ref>\n\nCatherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court.

Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 151.

Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 154\u201357. Coligny was lobbying the king to intervene against the empire in the Netherlands.<br />\u2022 The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, [[Francis, Duke of Guise]].<br />\u2022 For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83\u20134.</ref> Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.<ref>Pettegree, 159\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], which began two days later, has stained Catherine's reputation ever since.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\"/> There is reason to believe she was party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX is said to have ordered, \"Then kill them all!

It is almost certain, however, that when Charles gave the order \"Kill them all!\", he meant those drawn up on a list by Catherine, and not, as has often been claimed, all Huguenots.</ref> Historians have suggested that Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.<ref>Holt, 84.</ref>\n\nThe slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian [[Jules Michelet]], \"St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season\".<ref>Quoted by Morris, 252.</ref> On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 163\u201364; Heller, 117; Manetsch, 60\u201361.

As [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], he often showed more interest in pious devotions than in government.]]\n\n===Reign of Henry III===\nTwo years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were \"oh, my mother&nbsp;...\" The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he had been elected [[List of Polish monarchs#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|king]] the year before. However, three months after his coronation at [[Wawel Cathedral]], Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: \"I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end&nbsp;... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 172.</ref>\n\nHenry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[flagellation]].<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 232, 240, 247.</ref>\n\nHenry married [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaud\u00e9mont]] in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal [[nuncio]] Salviati observed, \"it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring&nbsp;... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long.\" As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]], known as \"Monsieur\", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 22.</ref> Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 205.</ref>\n\nIn 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown.<ref>Holt, 104.</ref> On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the [[Edict of Beaulieu]]. The treaty became known as the ''Peace of Monsieur'' because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown.<ref>Holt, 105\u20136; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 186.</ref> Francis died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 212\u201313.</ref> Catherine wrote, the next day: \"I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that He lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 217.</ref> The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams.

Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent [[Pomponne de Belli\u00e8vre]] to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at [[Agen]] and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough \"to put food on her table\". Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Usson]]. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 254\u201355.</ref> Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.\n\nCatherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 189.</ref> Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 209.</ref> On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: \"She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 200.</ref> She was under no illusions, however.

After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 185.</ref> The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal Charles de Bourbon]] on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the [[treaty of Joinville]] with Spain, and prepared to make war on the \"heretics\".<ref>Pettegree, 164.</ref> By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 255.</ref> As Catherine put it, \"peace is carried on a stick\" (''b\u00e2ton porte paix'').<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 249.</ref> \"Take care\", she wrote to the king, \"especially about your person.

In the [[Treaty of Nemours]], signed on 7 July 1585, he was forced to give in to all the League's demands, even that he pay its troops.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 440.</ref> He went into hiding to fast and pray, surrounded by a bodyguard known as \"[[The forty-five guards|the Forty-five]]\", and left Catherine to sort out the mess.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 253.</ref> The monarchy had lost control of the country, and was in no position to assist England in the face of the coming Spanish attack.

The chronicler L'Estoile reported that she cried all through her lunch that day. She wrote to Belli\u00e8vre, \"Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 263.</ref> As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day. On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.\n\nOn 8 September 1588 at Blois, where the court had assembled for a meeting of the Estates, Henry dismissed all his ministers without warning. Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, had been kept in the dark.<ref>Henry wrote a note to Villeroy, which began: \"Villeroy, I remain very well contented with your service; do not fail however to go away to your house where you will stay until I send for you; do not seek the reason for this my letter, but obey me.\" Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 300\u20133.</ref> The king's actions effectively ended her days of power.\n\nAt the meeting of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done.

As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons.<ref>Pettegree, 165.</ref> Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, \"Please forgive me.

At the time, Henry was besieging Paris with the King of Navarre, who would [[Henry IV of France's succession|succeed him as Henry IV of France]]. Henry III's assassination ended nearly three centuries of [[House of Valois|Valois]] rule and brought the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon dynasty]] into power.

In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late [[French Renaissance]] culture in all branches of the arts.<ref>Knecht, 220.</ref>\n\nAn [[inventory]] drawn up at the [[H\u00f4tel de la Reine]] after Catherine's death shows her to have been a keen collector.

Many portraits in her collection were by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480\u20131541) and his son [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]] ({{circa|1510}}{{snd}}1572). Fran\u00e7ois Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court.<ref>Dimier, 205\u20136.</ref> After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by Fran\u00e7ois Clouet had all but died out.<ref>Dimier, 308\u201319; Jollet, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nBeyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.<ref name=\"biic\"/> In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: [[Jean Cousin the Younger]] ({{circa|lk=no|1522|1594}}), few of whose works survive, and [[Antoine Caron]] ({{circa|lk=no|1521}}{{snd}}1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Francesco Primaticcio|Primaticcio]].

His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] celebrate the ''f\u00eates,'' picnics, and mock battles of the \"magnificent\" entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at [[Bayonne]] in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]].<ref name = \"biic\">Blunt, 98.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumb|200px|upright|The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]],'' from a 1582 engraving by Jacques Patin]]\nThe musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts.

To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her \"a great creative artist in festivals.\"<ref>Yates, 68.</ref> Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]],'' emerged from these creative advances.<ref>Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121\u201322.</ref> Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.<ref>Lee, 44.</ref>\n\nCatherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture. \"As the daughter of the Medici,\" suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, \"she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.\"<ref>Babelon, 263.</ref> After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 6.</ref> These included work on ch\u00e2teaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s]], and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the H\u00f4tel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.<ref>Knecht, 228.</ref>\n\nCatherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.<ref>Knecht, 223.</ref> Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]] as a tomb for her dead husband.<ref>Hoogvliet, 108.</ref> As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1504\u20131570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528\u20131590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument \"the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance.\"<ref name = \"zccclxxvix\">Zerner, 379.</ref> Catherine also commissioned [[Germain Pilon]] to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.<ref>Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may be referring to Artemisia, who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which became part of her own body.</ref>\n\nAlthough Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts,<ref>Thomson, 168.</ref> most of her patronage left no permanent legacy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 244.</ref> The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.\n\n[[File:COA french queen Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.svg|thumb|Coat of arms]]\n\n=== Culinary legend ===\nThe legend that de' Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians.<ref name=\"Davidson2014\">{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ|edition=2nd|date=11 August 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|page=232}}</ref> Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner [[fork]], [[parsley]], the [[artichoke]], [[lettuce]], [[broccoli]], the [[garden pea]], [[pasta]], [[Parmesan]], as well as the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[tomato]] of the [[New World]].

In fact, a large population of Italians\u2014bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\u2014had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning [[Renaissance]]. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.\n\nThe earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for \"cuisine\" in [[Diderot]] and [[d\u2019Alembert]]\u2019s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' published in 1754, which describes [[haute cuisine]] as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via \"that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de\u2019 Medici.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|last2=le Rond d'Alembert|first2=Jean|title=Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers|date=1754|publisher=Briasson, David, Le Breton and Durand|location=Paris|page=vol.

[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] was treated with similar suspicion\u2014she too entertained questionable characters (such as her advisor, [[John Dee]]), and produced no official heir. Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]'s penile deformity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The \"infertility\" of Catherine de Medici and its influence on 16th century France|last = Gordetsky, Rabinowitz and O'Brien|volume = 16|issue = 2|journal = The Canadian Journal of Urology|year = 2009|pages = 4584\u20138|url = https://www.canjurol.com/pdfs/DrGordetsky.pdf|pmid = 19364432}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Catherine de Medici's alleged talisman.jpg|thumb|The talisman Nostradamus allegedly made for Catherine de' Medici|276x276px]]\nSuspicion was fuelled to some degree by her entertainment of questionable characters at court\u2014for example, the reputed seer [[Nostradamus]], who was rumoured to have created a [[talisman]] for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in [[necromancy]] and the black arts. [[Cosimo Ruggeri]], in particular, was believed to be Catherine's own \"trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts\", although there is not a great deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Witchcraft prosecutions in Italy|last = Herzig|first = Tamar|publisher = Oxford|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = |editor-last = Levack}}</ref> Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe|last = Wiesner-Hanks|first = Merry|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 253}}</ref> and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.\n\nCatherine herself had been educated in [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]].

Nevertheless, Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for Witchcraft in Italy. This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled 'witches' simply because they did not act the way a woman should (humble and grateful), or simply to suit personal agendas.<ref name=\":1\" /> This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects, who labelled her \"the Italian woman\".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2010/06/history%E2%80%99s-black-widow-the-legend-of-catherine-de-medici.html|title = History's Black Widow: The Legend of Catherine de Medici|access-date = 20 February 2016|website = Wonders and Marvels|last = Gortner|first = C.

The years during which her sons reigned have been called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici\" as she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France.<ref>Thomson, 98; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 3; Neale, ''The Age of Catherine de Medici''.</ref> \n\nShe was born in Florence to [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino|Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Duke of Urbino]] and  [[Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne]]. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] and [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]]. Catherine's marriage was arranged by her uncle [[Pope Clement VII]]. Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]], who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as [[regent]] for her son [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX, King of France]]. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months).\n\nCatherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant [[French Wars of Religion|civil and religious war in France]]. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or [[Huguenots]], as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 272.</ref> In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572, in which thousands of [[Huguenot]]s were killed in Paris and throughout France.\n\nSome historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters.<ref>Knecht, 272. For a summary of the fluctuations in Catherine's historical reputation, see the preface to R. J. Knecht's ''Catherine de' Medici'', 1998: xi\u2013xiv.</ref> In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the [[House of Valois|Valois monarchy]] on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 20.</ref> Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 26.</ref> According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in 16th-century Europe.<ref name=\"stragexi\">Strage, Mark (1976).

Prologue, p.xi.</ref>\n\n==Birth and upbringing==\n[[File:El papa Clemente VII, por Sebastiano del Piombo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, [[Pope Clement VII]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], c.1531. Clement called Catherine's betrothal to [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orl\u00e9ans]] \"the greatest match in the world\".]]\nCatherine de' Medici was born on 13 April 1519 in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], the only child of [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]], and his wife, [[Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at [[Amboise]] as part of the alliance between King [[Francis I of France]] and Lorenzo's uncle [[Pope Leo X]] against the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]]. According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were \"as pleased as if it had been a boy\".\n\nWithin a month of Catherine's birth, both her parents were dead: Madeleine died on 28 April of [[puerperal fever]] or [[plague (disease)|plague]], and Lorenzo died on 4 May,<ref name =\"kviii\"/> his title over Urbino reverting to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]]. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her.<ref name =\"kviii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 8.</ref>\n\nCatherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]]). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, [[Clarice de' Medici]]. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her ''duchessina'' (\"the little duchess\"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the [[Duchy of Urbino]].<ref>Young, ''The Medici: Volume II'', 15.</ref>\n\nIn 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal [[Silvio Passerini]], and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 11.</ref> The final one, the ''Santissima Annuziata delle Murate'' was her home for three years. Mark Strage described these years as \"the happiest of her entire life\".<ref name=\"strage13\">Strage, pp. 13, 15</ref> Clement had no choice but to crown [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 10\u201311.</ref> In October 1529, Charles's troops laid [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)|siege to Florence]]. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification.<ref name=\"strage15\">Strage, p.15</ref> The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.<ref name= \"kxii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 12.</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Henri & Catherine.jpg|thumb|right|Catherine and Henry's marriage, painted seventeen years after the event]]\nOn her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as \"small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 14.</ref> Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including [[James V of Scotland]] who sent the [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530.<ref>Hay, Denys, ed., ''The Letters of James V'', HMSO (1954), p.173, 180\u20132, 189,</ref> When Francis I of France proposed his second son, [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who, despite her wealth, was of common origin.\n\nThe wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving,<ref name=knecht/> took place in the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]] in [[Marseille]] on 28 October 1533.<ref>[http://www.marseille13.fr/fr/eglise-saint-ferreol-les-augustins Marseille 13: Eglise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]</ref> Prince Henry danced and [[jousting|jousted]] for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that \"each had shown valour in the joust\".<ref name=knecht>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 16.</ref> Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings.\n\nCatherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please. The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court. The next pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, \"The girl has come to me stark naked.\"\n\nPrince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, [[Filippa Duci|Philippa Duci]], one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29\u201330. Henry legitimised the child under the name [[Diane de France]]; he also produced at least two sons by other women.</ref> This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.\n\n===Dauphine===\n[[File:Henry II, king of France.. F Clouet.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], by [[Corneille de Lyon]]. During his childhood, Henry spent almost four and a half years as a hostage in Spain, an ordeal that marked him for life, leaving him introverted and gloomy.]]\nIn 1536, Henry's older brother, [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis]], caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir. As [[Dauphine of France|dauphine]], Catherine was expected to provide a future heir to the throne.<ref name = \"kxxiv\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29.</ref> According to the court chronicler [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant\u00f4me|Brant\u00f4me]], \"many people advised the king and the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France\".<ref>Knecht, 29.</ref> Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her \"source of life\", and drinking mule's urine. On 19 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a [[Francis II of France|son]], named after King Francis.\n\nAfter becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician [[Jean Fernel]], who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]]. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (born 27 June 1550); the future [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (born 19 September 1551); and [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]] (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the [[House of Valois|Valois dynasty]], which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.\n\nCatherine's ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, at the age of 15, Henry had taken as his mistress the 38-year-old [[Diane de Poitiers]], whom he adored for the rest of his life.<ref>Heritier, 38\u201342.</ref> Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint-Denis]] on 10 June 1549.\n\n===Queen of France===\n[[File:KatharinavonMedici.jpg|thumb|left|Catherine de' Medici, as queen of France. \"Her mouth is too large and her eyes too prominent and colourless for beauty\", wrote a Venetian envoy as Catherine approached forty, \"but a very distinguished-looking woman, with a shapely figure, a beautiful skin and exquisitely shaped hands\".]]\nHenry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen.<ref>Morris, 247</ref> Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 42\u201343.</ref> Henry gave the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau|Ch\u00e2teau of Chenonceau]], which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, who took her place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.\n[[File:Jeton en argent sur Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.jpg|thumb|Silver jeton on Catherine de'M\u00e9dici]]\n\nThe imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 38.</ref> Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 34.</ref> The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.\n\nHenry's reign also saw the rise of the Guise brothers, [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles]], who became a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and Henry's boyhood friend [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Francis]], who became [[Counts and Dukes of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. Their sister [[Mary of Guise]] had married [[James V of Scotland]] in 1538 and was the mother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis.<ref>Guy, 46.</ref> Catherine brought her up with her own children at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's [[regent]].<ref>Guy, 41.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brazilian ball for Henry II in Rouen October 1 1550.jpg|thumb|\"[[France Antarctique|Brazilian ball]]\" for [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and Catherine de' Medici in [[Rouen]], 1 October 1550, a precursor to the creation of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Brazil]].]]\nOn 3\u20134 April 1559, Henry signed the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]] with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and England, ending a long period of [[Italian Wars]]. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine's thirteen-year-old daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] to [[Philip II of Spain]].<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 55.</ref> Their [[proxy wedding]], in Paris on 22 June 1559, was celebrated with festivities, balls, [[masque]]s, and five days of [[jousting]].\n\nKing Henry took part in the jousting, sporting Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery]], knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\">Pettegree, 154.</ref> Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters \"of a good bigness\" sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Ch\u00e2teau de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, \"for fear\", in the words of a chronicler, \"of being expelled by the Queen\". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words \"''lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor''\" (\"from this come my tears and my pain\"), and wore black [[mourning]] in memory of Henry.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 56\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Queen mother==\n\n===Reign of Francis II===\n[[File:FrancoisII.jpg| thumb| upright| [[Francis II of France]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], 1560. Francis found the crown so heavy at his coronation that four nobles had to hold it in place as he walked up the steps to his throne.<ref>Guy, 102\u20133.</ref>]]\n\n[[Francis II of France|Francis II]] became king at the age of fifteen. In what has been called a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'', the Cardinal of Lorraine and the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]]\u2014whose niece, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], had married Francis II the year before\u2014seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the [[Louvre Palace]] with the young couple.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 59.</ref> The English ambassador reported a few days later that \"the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 60.</ref> For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself.<ref>Morris, 248.</ref> Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: \"This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that&nbsp;...\". Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]] to the crown. She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.\n\nThe Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], the [[First Prince of the Blood]], and then, with more success, to his brother, [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force.<ref>Holt, 38\u201339.</ref> When the Guises heard of the plot,<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 64; Holt, 44. The incident was known later as the [[Amboise conspiracy|\"tumult\" or conspiracy of Amboise]].</ref> they moved the court to the fortified [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]]. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the ch\u00e2teau. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 282.</ref> Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nIn June 1560, [[Michel de l'H\u00f4pital]] was appointed [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Chancellor of France]]. He sought the support of France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 32.</ref> Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Cond\u00e9 raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an [[abscess]] in his ear.<ref>Knecht, 72; Guy, 119.</ref>\n\nWhen Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], in return for the release of his brother Cond\u00e9.<ref>Pettegree, 154; Hoogvliet, 105. The regency was traditionally the preserve of the princes of the blood.</ref> As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (''gouvernante de France''), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: \"My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 73.</ref>\n\n===Reign of Charles IX===\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles IX of France]], after [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], c. 1565. The Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiel described Charles as \"an admirable child, with fine eyes, gracious movements, though he is not robust. He favours physical exercise that is too violent for his health, for he suffers from shortness of breath\".]]\n\nAt first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 28.</ref>\n\nShe summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting [[Colloquy of Poissy]] ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission.<ref>Manetsch, 22.</ref> Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, \"she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 80.</ref> In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 311; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 11\u201312. The edict, also known as the Edict of Toleration and the Edict of January, was significant for effectively recognising the existence of Protestant churches and permitting their worship outside city walls.</ref> On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the [[Massacre of Vassy]], the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at [[Wassy|Vassy (Wassy)]], killing 74 and wounding 104.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 87.</ref> Guise, who called the massacre \"a regrettable accident\", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the [[French Wars of Religion]]. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 140.</ref>\n\nWithin a month [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], and [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Gaspard de Coligny]] had raised an army of 1,800. They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down. She therefore told him: \"Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 89.</ref> The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held [[Rouen]]. Catherine visited the deathbed of [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], after he was fatally wounded by an [[arquebus]] shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, \"My courage is as great as yours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 90.</ref> The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called [[Jean de Poltrot|Poltrot de M\u00e9r\u00e9]] fired an arquebus into the back of the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], at the siege of Orl\u00e9ans.

She also met her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] at [[Bayonne]] near the Spanish border, amidst lavish [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities]]. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] excused himself from the occasion. He sent the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 104, 107\u20138.</ref>\n\nIn 1566, through the ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie]], and because of a long-standing [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], Charles and Catherine proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French [[Huguenots]] and French and German [[Lutherans]] in Ottoman-controlled [[Moldavia]], in order to create a military colony and a buffer against the [[Habsburg]]. This plan also had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from [[France]], but it failed to interest the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Faroqhi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=-m8mind_TVIC&pg=PA37 ''The Ottoman Empire and the world around it'' by Suraiya Faroqhi p.37]</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 1567, in a swoop known as the [[Surprise of Meaux]], Huguenot forces attempted to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war.<ref>Wood, 17.</ref> Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 147.</ref> The war was ended by the [[Peace of Longjumeau]] of 22\u201323 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 118.</ref> The Surprise of Meaux marked a turning point in Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots.

Nevertheless, the [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.<ref>Wood, 28.</ref>\n\nCatherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554-1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref>Holt, 77.</ref> After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for [[Philip II of Spain]]. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and [[Henry III of Navarre]], Jeanne' son, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 135.</ref>\n\nCatherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: \"Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children\".<ref>Bryson, 282.</ref> When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine pressured her hard,<ref>Jeanne d'Albret wrote to her son, Henry: \"I am not free to talk with either the King or Madame, only the Queen Mother, who goads me [''me traite \u00e1 la fourche'']&nbsp;... You have doubtless realized that their main object, my son, is to separate you from God, and from me\". Quoted by Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 148\u201349.</ref> playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 151. An autopsy revealed tuberculosis and an abscess.</ref> The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]], Paris.\n\n====St. Bartholomew's Day massacre====\nThree days later, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm.<ref>Sutherland, ''Massacre of St Bartholomew'', 313.</ref> A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse.<ref>Holt, 83.

Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 154\u201357. Coligny was lobbying the king to intervene against the empire in the Netherlands.<br />\u2022 The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, [[Francis, Duke of Guise]].<br />\u2022 For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83\u20134.</ref> Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.<ref>Pettegree, 159\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], which began two days later, has stained Catherine's reputation ever since.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\"/> There is reason to believe she was party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX is said to have ordered, \"Then kill them all!

It is almost certain, however, that when Charles gave the order \"Kill them all!\", he meant those drawn up on a list by Catherine, and not, as has often been claimed, all Huguenots.</ref> Historians have suggested that Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.<ref>Holt, 84.</ref>\n\nThe slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian [[Jules Michelet]], \"St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season\".<ref>Quoted by Morris, 252.</ref> On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 163\u201364; Heller, 117; Manetsch, 60\u201361.

As [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], he often showed more interest in pious devotions than in government.]]\n\n===Reign of Henry III===\nTwo years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were \"oh, my mother&nbsp;...\" The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he had been elected [[List of Polish monarchs#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|king]] the year before. However, three months after his coronation at [[Wawel Cathedral]], Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: \"I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end&nbsp;... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 172.</ref>\n\nHenry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[flagellation]].<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 232, 240, 247.</ref>\n\nHenry married [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaud\u00e9mont]] in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal [[nuncio]] Salviati observed, \"it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring&nbsp;... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long.\" As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]], known as \"Monsieur\", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 22.</ref> Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 205.</ref>\n\nIn 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown.<ref>Holt, 104.</ref> On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the [[Edict of Beaulieu]]. The treaty became known as the ''Peace of Monsieur'' because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown.<ref>Holt, 105\u20136; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 186.</ref> Francis died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 212\u201313.</ref> Catherine wrote, the next day: \"I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that He lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 217.</ref> The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams.

Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent [[Pomponne de Belli\u00e8vre]] to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at [[Agen]] and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough \"to put food on her table\". Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Usson]]. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 254\u201355.</ref> Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.\n\nCatherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 189.</ref> Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 209.</ref> On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: \"She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 200.</ref> She was under no illusions, however.

After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 185.</ref> The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal Charles de Bourbon]] on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the [[treaty of Joinville]] with Spain, and prepared to make war on the \"heretics\".<ref>Pettegree, 164.</ref> By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 255.</ref> As Catherine put it, \"peace is carried on a stick\" (''b\u00e2ton porte paix'').<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 249.</ref> \"Take care\", she wrote to the king, \"especially about your person.

At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons.<ref>Pettegree, 165.</ref> Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, \"Please forgive me.

Listed works of art included [[tapestry|tapestries]], hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, [[ebony]] furniture inlaid with [[ivory]], sets of china, and [[Limoges]] pottery.<ref>Knecht, 240\u201341.</ref> There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480\u20131541) and his son [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]] ({{circa|1510}}{{snd}}1572). Fran\u00e7ois Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court.<ref>Dimier, 205\u20136.</ref> After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by Fran\u00e7ois Clouet had all but died out.<ref>Dimier, 308\u201319; Jollet, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nBeyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.<ref name=\"biic\"/> In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: [[Jean Cousin the Younger]] ({{circa|lk=no|1522|1594}}), few of whose works survive, and [[Antoine Caron]] ({{circa|lk=no|1521}}{{snd}}1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Francesco Primaticcio|Primaticcio]]. Caron's vivid [[Mannerism]], with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].<ref>Blunt calls Caron's style \"perhaps the purest known type of Mannerism in its elegant form, appropriate to an exquisite but neurotic society.\" Blunt, 98, 100.</ref>\n\nMany of Caron's paintings, such as those of the ''Triumphs of the Seasons'', are of [[allegory|allegorical]] subjects that echo the [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|festivities]] for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] celebrate the ''f\u00eates,'' picnics, and mock battles of the \"magnificent\" entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at [[Bayonne]] in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]].<ref name = \"biic\">Blunt, 98.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumb|200px|upright|The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]],'' from a 1582 engraving by Jacques Patin]]\nThe musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts. They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on [[Mythology|mythological]] themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her \"a great creative artist in festivals.\"<ref>Yates, 68.</ref> Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]],'' emerged from these creative advances.<ref>Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121\u201322.</ref> Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.<ref>Lee, 44.</ref>\n\nCatherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture. \"As the daughter of the Medici,\" suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, \"she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.\"<ref>Babelon, 263.</ref> After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 6.</ref> These included work on ch\u00e2teaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s]], and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the H\u00f4tel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.<ref>Knecht, 228.</ref>\n\nCatherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.<ref>Knecht, 223.</ref> Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]] as a tomb for her dead husband.<ref>Hoogvliet, 108.</ref> As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1504\u20131570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528\u20131590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument \"the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance.\"<ref name = \"zccclxxvix\">Zerner, 379.</ref> Catherine also commissioned [[Germain Pilon]] to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.<ref>Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may be referring to Artemisia, who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which became part of her own body.</ref>\n\nAlthough Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts,<ref>Thomson, 168.</ref> most of her patronage left no permanent legacy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 244.</ref> The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.\n\n[[File:COA french queen Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.svg|thumb|Coat of arms]]\n\n=== Culinary legend ===\nThe legend that de' Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians.<ref name=\"Davidson2014\">{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ|edition=2nd|date=11 August 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|page=232}}</ref> Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner [[fork]], [[parsley]], the [[artichoke]], [[lettuce]], [[broccoli]], the [[garden pea]], [[pasta]], [[Parmesan]], as well as the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[tomato]] of the [[New World]].

In fact, a large population of Italians\u2014bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\u2014had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning [[Renaissance]]. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.\n\nThe earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for \"cuisine\" in [[Diderot]] and [[d\u2019Alembert]]\u2019s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' published in 1754, which describes [[haute cuisine]] as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via \"that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de\u2019 Medici.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|last2=le Rond d'Alembert|first2=Jean|title=Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers|date=1754|publisher=Briasson, David, Le Breton and Durand|location=Paris|page=vol.

Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]'s penile deformity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The \"infertility\" of Catherine de Medici and its influence on 16th century France|last = Gordetsky, Rabinowitz and O'Brien|volume = 16|issue = 2|journal = The Canadian Journal of Urology|year = 2009|pages = 4584\u20138|url = https://www.canjurol.com/pdfs/DrGordetsky.pdf|pmid = 19364432}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Catherine de Medici's alleged talisman.jpg|thumb|The talisman Nostradamus allegedly made for Catherine de' Medici|276x276px]]\nSuspicion was fuelled to some degree by her entertainment of questionable characters at court\u2014for example, the reputed seer [[Nostradamus]], who was rumoured to have created a [[talisman]] for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in [[necromancy]] and the black arts. [[Cosimo Ruggeri]], in particular, was believed to be Catherine's own \"trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts\", although there is not a great deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Witchcraft prosecutions in Italy|last = Herzig|first = Tamar|publisher = Oxford|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = |editor-last = Levack}}</ref> Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe|last = Wiesner-Hanks|first = Merry|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 253}}</ref> and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.\n\nCatherine herself had been educated in [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]].

Nevertheless, Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for Witchcraft in Italy. This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled 'witches' simply because they did not act the way a woman should (humble and grateful), or simply to suit personal agendas.<ref name=\":1\" /> This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects, who labelled her \"the Italian woman\".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2010/06/history%E2%80%99s-black-widow-the-legend-of-catherine-de-medici.html|title = History's Black Widow: The Legend of Catherine de Medici|access-date = 20 February 2016|website = Wonders and Marvels|last = Gortner|first = C.

After the [[coup d'etat]] of 4 June 1943, Genta was appointed to head the Universidad del Litoral, and gained notoriety as a defender of [[reactionary]] ideas, to the point that the popular [[FORJA]] movement and its leader [[Arturo Jauretche]] publicly condemned Genta's positions.\n\nWhen Per\u00f3n was [[Revolucion Libertadora|removed from power in 1955]], the armed forces were under the influence of [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas as represented by [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]] and the [[Alsogaray]] family. Some conservative circles saw Aramburu's deposing of [[Eduardo Lonardi]] as a coup against traditional Catholic values, which led to the establishment a series of right-wing movements, the most notorious of those being ''[[Alianza Libertadora Nacionalista]]'' (\"Nationalist Liberation Alliance\").\n\nIn 1958, another education-related fight galvanized the conservative Catholics, and new groups started forming. Most of them saw Genta as their ideological referent, and sought his advice and endorsement. Genta approved of their actions, even those that involved desecration of Jewish cemeteries or physical attacks on Jewish students.\n\nAs the 1960s brought left-wing guerrilla activity to Argentina, Genta was recognized as one of the ideologues behind ever-more violent far right groups such as [[Tacuara]]. Ironically, some of Tacuara's young recruits would later form the core of the (allegedly left-wing Peronist) [[Montoneros]] movement.\n\nThe armed struggle degenerated into the so-called [[dirty war]], which claimed thousands of lives and cast a heavy shadow over Argentine politics well into the 21st century. Genta himself would be the victim of such violence: on October 27, 1974, a [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP) guerrilla shot Genta eleven times as he was leaving his home. Genta died immediately. The gunner left the scene in a getaway car followed by two back-up vehicles. Genta was survived by his wife, two children and two grandchildren.\n\n== Legacy ==\nFor many years, far right activists would congregate at Genta's grave and shout slogans such as ''Viva la muerte!'' (Long live death), inspired by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s General [[Mill\u00e1n Astray]], commander of the [[Spanish Legion]].\n\nGenta's ideas were not confined to the fringes, as they influenced some sections of the military de facto governments, especially the [[National Reorganization Process]] (1976\u20131983). His staunch anti-communism and his contacts in the armed forces gained him some consideration from [[United States]] anti-communist operatives.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Genta, Jordan Bruno}}\n[[Category:1909 births]]\n[[Category:1974 deaths]]\n[[Category:Assassinated Argentine politicians]]\n[[Category:Argentine anti-communists]]\n[[Category:Argentine fascists]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Argentine male writers]]\n[[Category:Argentine philosophers]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- For more information see [[:Template:Infobox Writer/doc]]. --> \n| name          = Jord\u00e1n Bruno Genta\n| image         = \n| image_size    = \n| alt           = \n| caption       = \n| pseudonym     = \n| birth_name    = \n| birth_date    = <!-- {{Birth date and age|1909|10|2}} -->\n| birth_place   = \n| death_date    = <!-- {{Death date and age|1974|8|27|1909|10|2}} -->\n| death_place   = \n| resting_place = \n| occupation    = \n| language      = \n| nationality   = \n| ethnicity     = \n| citizenship   = \n| education     = \n| alma_mater    = \n| period        = \n| genre         = \n| subject       = \n| movement      = \n| notableworks  = \n| spouse        = \n| partner       = \n| children      = \n| relatives     = \n| influences    = \n| influenced    = \n| awards        = \n| signature     = \n| signature_alt = \n| website       = \n| portaldisp    = \n}}\n\n'''Jord\u00e1n Bruno Genta''', (2 October 1909 \u2013 27 August 1974) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer and educator, widely considered the ideologue of the Argentine extreme [[right-wing]].\n\n== Career ==\nIn his youth, Genta actively campaigned against several attempts at [[education reform]], fearing that the changes would dilute the influence of [[Catholic]] teachings.
