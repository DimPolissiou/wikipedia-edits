Yes, that's unusual, but that is the official spelling. -->nroe\n*: Sonny is a friendly, eccentric and well-intentioned teenage girl from [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], [[Wisconsin]] who lands a main role on her favorite comedy sketch television show, ''[[So Random!]].'' She is a rising star of the ensemble cast and works hard to be the best comedian she can be. Sonny often tries to solve the ongoing feud between the ''Mackenzie Falls'' and ''So Random!'' casts, especially when she dates the star of \"Mackenzie Falls,\" Chad Dylan Cooper. She was Chad's girlfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice\". As seen in further episodes, all of her co-stars are very fond of her. She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.\n* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart\n*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.\n* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper\n*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris\n*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.\n* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell\n*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster\n*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.\n\n==Production==\nThe original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Sonny with a Chance'' Is Based On NBC Sitcom [[30 Rock]] Which Focused On The Background Of [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]], ''So Random!'', complete with fully produced sketches.

The show is similar to ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', among others. The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]].

It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'', released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 9, 2009. The song is also available as the bonus track on Lovato's second album ''[[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|Here We Go Again]]'', released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 21, 2009.\n\nIn the [[Russian language|Russian]] version of the series (\"\u0414\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441\" aka Give Sonny a Chance), the cast members' names are rendered in [[Cyrillic]]\u2014and the intro is performed by a different Russian girl in Russian (not by Demi Lovato).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TJ50fSJrE |title=Sonny With a Chance Russian opening (season 2) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Otherwise, in translation the intro music is not changed.\n\nIn the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version (\"Sunny Entre Estrelas\"), the intro music is sung in translation.\n\n==Broadcast==\n\n===Season 1===\nThe series originally premiered on February 8, 2009 on [[Disney Channel]], [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], and [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)]].

She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.\n* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart\n*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.\n* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper\n*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris\n*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.\n* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell\n*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster\n*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.\n\n==Production==\nThe original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Sonny with a Chance'' has a [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]], ''So Random!'', complete with fully produced sketches.

It often causes the cast of ''Sonny with a Chance'' to dress in ridiculous costumes, and act out nonsensical situations. This was spun-off to its own series after Lovato's departure.<ref name=\"omg.yahoo.com\" />\n\n===''Mackenzie Falls''===\nThe enemies of the ''So Random!'' group, ''Mackenzie Falls'' is a [[tween (demographic)|tween]] [[drama series]] featuring comedic overacting. The show is similar to ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', among others. The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]]. Minisodes and promos can be seen on the ''Sonny with a Chance'' website along with one minisode as a bonus feature on the DVD.\n\n==Theme song and opening sequence==\nThe show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written and produced by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned [[Hollywood Records]]. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'', released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 9, 2009.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\nExample.jpg|Caption1\nExample.jpg|Caption2\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\nExample.jpg|Caption1\nExample.jpg|Caption2\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

Complications arise for the ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' production team, after having wooed and won Carol Vorderman as [[Clare Balding]]'s replacement to co-present with [[Alan Titchmarsh]]. However, at the last minute Clare Balding is available and turns up at [[Broadcasting House|New Broadcasting House]] as Carol Vorderman is leaving and they have to be kept apart. In Salford Fletcher ignores advisors Sharpe and Pritchard with his own solution to both problems resulting in [[Alan Titchmarsh]] pulling out.\n'''Featuring as themselves:''' Carol Vorderman, Jenni Murray, Clare Balding\n |LineColor=bfe0bf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title=Episode 3\n |DirectedBy=John Morton\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|4|2|df=yes}}\n |Aux4=1.61\n |ShortSummary=Anna Rampton advocates moving ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' to radio, thus freeing up a prime slot for her own series, ''Britain's Tastiest Village''. The debate about the future of the BBC is not helped when Ian Fletcher's salary comes under intense scrutiny in the press. Neil Reid, current Controller of Current Affairs, is having to deal with the fallout from a blunder in [[BBC News]] coverage of the Syrian crisis when a photo of [[Trudie Styler]] was used instead of [[Asma al-Assad]]. Producer Lucy Freeman goes in to pitch ''Home Truth'', a script she's been developing over several years with writer Dan Shepherd. Siobhan Sharpe and her team at Perfect Curve are asked to refresh the [[Logo of the BBC|BBC logo]] and come to the conclusion that the problem with the current logo is that it has too many letters.\n |LineColor=bfe0bf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=4\n |Title=Episode 4\n |DirectedBy=John Morton\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|4|9|df=yes}}\n |Aux4=1.64\n |ShortSummary=A national paper has not only published details of Ian Fletcher's salary but followed up with a story of how he took Sally Owen, his PA at the [[Twenty Twelve|Olympic Deliverance Commission]], on holiday to Italy. So the BBC can either stand by their man or get him to pre-empt potential criticism by persuading him to cut his own salary. Meanwhile, a female ''[[Newsnight]]'' presenter has been accused of wearing clothes that are inappropriately watchable. When the name of the programme becomes known as Kneesnight and her legs get their own Twitter account there is a feeling something should be done about it. Flagship series ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' has lost all three of the big-name presenters who were attached to do the show \u2013 so the search continues.

One of her first jobs is to head up discussion on the Way Ahead Task Force around inclusivity targets, with an imminent meeting of the Cross Parliamentary Inclusion Action Watch Dog Group at Westminster.\nSiobhan Sharpe's idea is to \"viralise\" Muslim BBC Weather presenter Sadiq Iqbal, who is less than thrilled with the idea of becoming a national icon.\nIt's down to Head of Values Ian Fletcher to try and steer the BBC ship through increasingly choppy waters, while at the same time decide who he'd like to spend his free evening with, Lucy or Anna.\n |LineColor=fbec5d\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 3===\nIn August 2016, the BBC announced that ''W1A'' would return for a third and final series, due to be produced and broadcast in 2017.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-08-22/next-series-of-w1a-set-for-2017 |title=Next series of W1A set for 2017 |last1=Dowell |first1=Ben |date=22 August 2016 |magazine=Radio Times|access-date=12 October 2016 }}</ref> Some filming with Jeremy Paxman took place in March.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/75148718-13a8-11e7-80f4-13e067d5072c?mhq5j=e2 |title=London diary: Jeremy Paxman on heads of state in the age of Trump |last1=Dowell |date=14 July 2017 |newspaper=Financial Times |access-date=14 July 2017 }}</ref>\n\nSeries 3 began on 18 September 2017 on [[BBC Two]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| #\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Title\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Directed by\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Written by\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| Original air date\n!style=\"background: #eccdfb;\"| UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref name=\"barb_30\"/>\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=9\n |Title=Episode 1\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|9|18|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.83\n |ShortSummary= \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=10\n |Title=Episode 2\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|9|25|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.56\n |ShortSummary= \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=11\n |Title=Episode 3\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|2|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.82\n |ShortSummary= \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=12\n |Title=Episode 4\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|9|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.5\n |ShortSummary=  \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=13\n |Title=Episode 5\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|16|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.39\n |ShortSummary=  \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=14\n |Title=Episode 6\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|10|23|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.47\n |ShortSummary=  \n |LineColor=eccdfb\n}}\n|}\n\nAfter the transmission of Episode 1 on [[BBC Two]] Episode 2 was made available on [[BBC iPlayer]] on 18 September 2017.

Drawing upon distinctions between [[Jewish Christians]], Gentile Christians, and other groups such as Gnostics and [[Marcionites]], they argue that early Christianity was fragmented, and with contemporaneous competing orthodoxies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|authorlink=Elaine Pagels|title=The Gnostic Gospels|year=1979|isbn= 0-679-72453-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D.

Chesterton]], in his book ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' (1908), asserts that there have been substantial disagreements about faith from the time of the New Testament and Jesus, but that the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] all argued against changing the teachings of Christ, as did the earliest church fathers including [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Polycarp]].{{refn|group=note|See [[False prophets#New Testament|false prophet]], the [[antichrist]], the [[gnostic]] [[Nicolaitanes]] from the [[Book of Revelation]] and [[Man of Sin]].}}\n\n===Diversity===\n{{Main|Diversity in early Christian theology}}\n\nThe [[Ante-Nicene period]] (2nd-3rd century) saw the rise of a great number of Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. They had different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]], particularly the [[Christology|divinity of Jesus]] and the nature of the [[Trinity]]. Some of the major [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]] than the Proto-Orthodox church were:\n*[[Gnosticism]] (particularly [[Valentinianism]]) \u2013 reliance on revealed knowledge from an unknowable God, a distinct divinity from the [[Demiurge]] who created and oversees the material world.\n*[[Marcionism]] \u2013 the [[God the Father|God]] of [[Jesus]] was a different God from the [[Yahweh|God]] of the [[Old Testament]].\n*[[Montanism]] \u2013 relied on [[Prophecy|prophetic]] [[revelation]]s from the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].\n*[[Adoptionism]] \u2013 Jesus was not born the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]], but was adopted at his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] or [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]].\n*[[Docetism]] \u2013 Jesus was pure spirit and his physical form an illusion.\n\n===Proto-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Proto-orthodoxy}}\n\nBefore AD&nbsp;313, the \"heretical\" nature of some beliefs was a matter of much debate within the churches, and there was no true mechanism in place to resolve the various differences of beliefs. Heresy was to be approached by the leader of the church according to Eusebius, author of ''The Church History''.\n\nEarly attacks upon alleged heresies formed the matter of [[Tertullian]]'s ''Prescription Against Heretics'' (in 44 chapters, written from Rome), and of Irenaeus' ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (''ca'' 180, in five volumes), written in Lyon after his return from a visit to Rome. The letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] and [[Polycarp of Smyrna]] to various churches warned against false teachers, and the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'' accepted by many Christians as part of Scripture in the 2nd century, warned about [[Judaizing|mixing Judaism with Christianity]], as did other writers, leading to decisions reached in the [[first ecumenical council]], which was convoked by the Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325, in response to further disruptive polemical controversy within the Christian community, in that case [[Arianism|Arianist]] disputes over the nature of the Trinity.\n\nIrenaeus ({{circa|130}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|202}}) was the first to argue that his \"orthodox\" position was the same faith that Jesus gave to the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], and that the identity of the apostles, their successors, and the teachings of the same were all well-known public knowledge. This was therefore an early argument supported by [[apostolic succession]]. Irenaeus first established the doctrine of four gospels and no more, with the synoptic gospels interpreted in the light of ''[[Gospel of John|John]]''. Irenaeus' opponents, however, claimed to have received secret teachings from Jesus via other apostles which were not publicly known. Gnosticism is predicated on the existence of such hidden knowledge, but brief references to private teachings of Jesus have also survived in the canonic Scripture as did warning by the Christ that there would be [[false prophet]]s or false teachers. Irenaeus' opponents also claimed that the wellsprings of divine inspiration were not dried up, which is the doctrine of [[continuing revelation]].\n\n==Late Antiquity (313\u2013476) and Early Middle Ages (476\u2013799)==\n{{Main|Christianity in late antiquity|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}\n\n===Christology===\n{{Main|Christology}}\n\nThe earliest controversies in Late Antiquity were generally [[Christology|Christological]] in nature, concerning the interpretation of Jesus' (eternal) divinity and humanity. In the 4th century, [[Arius]] and [[Arianism]] held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than [[God the Father]].{{refn|group=note|{{Bibleverse||John|14:28}}}} Arianism was condemned at the Council of Nicea (325), but nevertheless dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them. [[Trinitarianism]] held that God the Father, [[God the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]] were all strictly one being with three [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostases]]. The [[Euchites]], a 4th-century [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] sect from Macedonia held that the Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis in order to unite with the souls of the perfect. They were anti-clerical and rejected baptism and the sacraments, believing that the passions could be overcome and perfection achieved through prayer.\n\nMany groups held [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic beliefs]], maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. [[Docetism]] held that Jesus' humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the incarnation.  Others held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58</ref>\n\nThe [[Orthodox Christianity|orthodox]] teaching, as it developed in response to these interpretations, is that Christ was fully divine and at the same time fully human, and that the three persons of the [[Trinity]] are co-equal and co-eternal.\n\n===Legal suppression of heresies===\n{{Main|History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance}}\n\nIt was only after the legalisation of Christianity, which began under [[Constantine I]] in AD&nbsp;313 that the various beliefs of the proto-orthodox Church began to be made uniform and formulated as dogma, through the ''canons'' promulgated by the [[Ecumenical council|General Councils]]. The first known usage of the term 'heresy' in a civil legal context was in 380 by the \"[[Edict of Thessalonica]]\" of Theodosius I. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as 'heresy'. By this edict, in some senses, the line between the Catholic Church's spiritual authority and the Roman State's jurisdiction was blurred. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and State was a sharing of State powers of legal enforcement between Church and State authorities, with the state enforcing what it determined to be orthodox teaching.\n\nWithin five years of the official 'criminalization' of heresy by the emperor, the first Christian heretic, [[Priscillian]], was executed in 385 by Roman officials.  For some years after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[list of Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]] were also known to execute those whom they considered heretics.\n\nThe edict of [[Theodosius II]] (435) provided severe punishments for those who had or spread writings of Nestorius.<ref name=\"Thompson2009\">{{cite book|author=Jay E.

These were mostly concerned with Christological disputes:\n#The [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council]] was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]], with over 300 bishops condemning the view of [[Arius]] that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father.{{refn|group=note|300 bishops, as well as Constantine I, were present at the Council. Constantine had invited all 1800 bishops of the Christian church (about 1000 in the east and 800 in the west). The number of participating bishops cannot be accurately stated; Socrates Scholasticus and Epiphanius of Salamis counted 318; Eusebius of Caesarea, only 250.}} Each phrase in the [[Nicene Creed]], formulated at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (AD 325), addresses some aspect that had been under passionate discussion prior to Constantine I. Nevertheless, Arianism dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them.\n#The [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity. This council also condemned Arianism.\n#The [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] is that of Ephesus, a stronghold of Cyrillian Christianity, in 431. It was presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops and was mired in controversy because of the absences of the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch, the absence of the Syrian Clergy, and violence directed against Nestorius and his supporters. It affirmed that Mary is the \"Bearer\" of God (''[[Theotokos]]''), contrary to the teachings of [[Nestorius]], and it anathematized Nestorius. A mirror Council held by Nestorius (Patriarch of Antioch) and the Syrian clergy affirmed Mary as Christokos, \"Bearer\" of Christ, and anathematized [[Cyril of Alexandria]].\n#The [[Council of Chalcedon|Fourth Ecumenical Council]] is that of Chalcedon in 451, with the Patriarch of Constantinople presiding over 500 bishops. This council affirmed that Jesus has two natures, is truly God and truly man, distinct yet always in perfect union. This was based largely on [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo the Great's]] ''Tome''. Thus, it condemned [[Monophysitism]] and would be influential in refuting [[Monothelitism]].\n#The [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]] is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the teachings of [[Origen]] on the pre-existence of the soul, etc.\n#The [[Third Council of Constantinople|Sixth Ecumenical Council]] is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the [[Monothelites]].\n#The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]] was called under the Empress Regent [[Irene of Athens]] in 787, known as the second of Nicaea. It supports the [[veneration]] of [[icon]]s while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as \"The Triumph of Orthodoxy\"\n\nNot all of these Councils have been universally recognised as [[Ecumenical Council|ecumenical]]. In addition, the [[Catholic Church]] has convened numerous other councils which it deems as having the same authority, making a total of twenty-one Ecumenical Councils recognised by the Catholic Church. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] accepts only the first two, and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] only three. [[Pope Sergius I]] rejected the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 (see also [[Pentarchy]]).  The Fourth Council of Constantinople of [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|869\u2013870]] and [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879\u2013880]] is disputed by Catholicism and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].  Present-day [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarians]], such as [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] and other [[Mormonism|Mormons]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], reject all seven Councils.\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox consider the following council to be ecumenical, although this is not universally agreed upon:\n#The [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the [[hesychastic]] theology of St. [[Gregory Palamas]] and condemned the philosopher [[Barlaam of Calabria]].\n#In addition to these councils there have been a number of significant councils meant to further define the Eastern Orthodox position. They are the Synods of [[Constantinople]] in 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of [[Ia\u015fi]] (Jassy), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of [[Jerusalem]], 1672.\n\nWithin the Eastern Orthodox Church, the role of the ecumenical councils was to better define the Orthodox canon of faith; however, the Eastern Orthodox Church authorities are not known to have authorized the use of violence in the persecution of heretics with nearly the frequency of their Western counterparts. Some individual examples of the execution of Orthodox heretics do exist, however, such as the execution of [[Avvakum]] in 1682. Far more typically, the Eastern Orthodox response to a heresy would rather be (and still is) to merely \"excommunicate\" the individuals involved.\n\n==High Middle Ages (800\u20131299) and Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance (1300\u20131520) ==\n[[File:Titelkupfer Index librorum prohibitorum.jpg|thumb|This 1711 illustration for the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' depicts the Holy Ghost supplying the book burning fire.]]\n{{Main|Medieval history of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131300)|l1=High Middle Ages|Medieval history of Christianity#Late Middle Ages (1300\u20131499|l2=Late Middle Ages}}\n\nFrom the late 11th century onward, heresy once again came to be a concern for Catholic authorities, as reports became increasingly common. The reasons for this are still not fully understood, but the causes for this new period of heresy include popular response to the 11th-century clerical reform movement, greater lay familiarity with the Bible, exclusion of lay people from sacramental activity, and more rigorous definition and supervision of Catholic dogma. The question of how heresy should be suppressed was not resolved, and there was initially substantial clerical resistance to the use of physical force by secular authorities to correct spiritual deviance. As heresy was viewed with increasing concern by the papacy, however, the \"secular arm\" was used more frequently and freely during the 12th century and afterward.\n\n===Medieval heresies===\nThere were many Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] and individuals throughout the Middle Ages whose teachings were deemed heretical by the established church, such as:\n*[[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] \u2013 an [[Armenia]]n group (6th to 9th centuries) who sought a return to the purity of the church at the time of [[Paul the Apostle]]. \n*[[Tondrakians]] - an [[Armenia]]n group (9th to 11th centuries) who advocated the abolition of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Church]] along with all its traditional rites.\n*[[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] \u2013 a group arising in the 11th century in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Balkans]] who sought a return to the spirituality of the early Christians and opposed established forms of government and church.\n*[[Gundolfo]] \u2013 an itinerant 11th century preacher near [[Lille]], [[France]], who taught that [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] was achieved through a virtuous life of abandoning the world, restraining the appetites of the flesh, earning food by the labor of hands, doing no injury to anyone, and extending charity to everyone of their own faith.\n*[[Catharism|Cathars]] \u2013 a major Christian movement in the [[Languedoc]] region of southern [[France]] from the 11th to 13th centuries. The Cathars believed that human [[soul]]s were the spirits of [[angel]]s trapped within the physical creation of an evil god. Through living a pure and sinless life, the soul could become perfect and free from the snare of matter.\n*[[Arnoldists]] \u2013 a 12th century group from [[Lombardy]] who criticized the wealth of the [[Catholic Church]] and preached against [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].\n*[[Peter of Bruys|Petrobrusians]] were 12th century followers of Peter of Bruys in southeastern [[France]] who rejected the authority of the [[Church Fathers]] and of the Catholic Church, opposing [[clerical celibacy]], [[infant baptism]], [[prayers for the dead]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]] music.\n*[[Henry of Lausanne|Henricans]] were 12th century followers of Henry of Lausanne in France. They rejected the [[Catholic theology|doctrinal]] and disciplinary authority of the [[Catholic Church|church]], did not recognize any form of [[worship]] or [[Liturgy#Christianity|liturgy]] and denied the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]].\n*[[Waldensians]] \u2013 a movement that began in the 12th century in [[Lyon]], [[France]], and still exists today. They held that [[Apostolic poverty]] was the way to spiritual perfection and rejected what they perceived as the [[Religious images in Christian theology|idolatry]] of the [[Catholic Church]].\n*[[Humiliati]] - a 12th century group from northern Italy who embraced poverty, charity and [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|mortification]]. Initially approved by the church, they were suppressed for disobedience in 1571.\n*[[Heresy of the Free Spirit|Brethren of the Free Spirit]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th century to those, primarily in the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Bohemia]] and northern [[Italy]], who believed that the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] were unnecessary for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]], that the [[soul]] could be perfected through imitating the life of [[Christ]], and that the perfected soul was free of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and beyond all [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|ecclesiastical]], [[Christian ethics|moral]] and secular law.\n*[[Apostolic Brethren]] (later known as [[Dulcinian]]s) \u2013 a 13th to 14th century sect from northern Italy founded by [[Gerard Segarelli]] and continued by [[Fra Dolcino]] of [[Novara]]. The Apostolic Brethren rejected the worldliness of the church and sought a life of perfect sanctity, in complete poverty, with no fixed domicile, no care for the morrow, and no vows.\n*[[Fraticelli]] (or Spiritual Franciscans) \u2013 [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] extremists through the 13th to 15th centuries who regarded the wealth of the Church as scandalous.\n*[[Adamites#Neo-Adamits|Neo-Adamites]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th to 15th century to those, including [[Taborites]], [[Picards]] and some [[Beghards]], who wished to return to the purity of the life of [[Adam]] by [[Intentional community|living communally]], practicing social and religious [[Christian naturism|nudity]], embracing [[free love]] and rejecting [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]] and individual ownership of property.\n*[[Nicholas of Basel]] \u2013 a 14th century [[Basel|Swiss]] leader who, after a spiritual experience, taught that he had the authority to use [[Bishop|episcopal]] and [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priestly]] powers (even though he was not ordained), that submission to his direction was necessary for attaining spiritual perfection, and that his followers could not [[Christian views on sin|sin]] even though they committed crimes or disobeyed both the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and [[pope]].\n*[[Lollardy|Lollards]] \u2013 the 14th century followers of [[John Wycliffe]]. They advocated [[Bible translations into English|translating the Bible into English]], rejected [[baptism]] and [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], and denied the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].\n\n===Inquisition===\nIn the late 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church instituted the [[Inquisition]], an official body charged with the suppression of heresy. This began as an extension and more rigorous enforcement of pre-existing episcopal powers (possessed, but little used, by bishops in the early Middle Ages) to inquire about and suppress heresy, but later became the domain of selected [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]]<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm|title= Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition|website=New Advent|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> under the direct power of the Pope. The use of torture to extract confessions was authorized by Innocent IV in 1252.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\"/> The Inquisition was active in several nations of [[Europe]], particularly where it had fervent support from the civil authority. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was particularly brutal in its methods, which included the [[burning at the stake]] of many heretics. However, it was initiated and substantially controlled by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]] rather than the Church; King Ferdinand used political leverage to obtain the Church's tacit approval.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229) was part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]'s efforts to crush the [[Cathars]]. It is linked to the movement now known as the [[Medieval Inquisition]]. Another example of a medieval heretic movement is the [[Hussite]] movement in the [[Czech lands]] in the early 15th century.  The last person to be burned alive at the stake on orders from Rome was [[Giordano Bruno]], executed in 1600 for a collection of heretical beliefs including [[Copernicus|Copernicanism]], belief of an unlimited universe with innumerable inhabited worlds, opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the Trinity, divinity of Christ, and Incarnation.\n\n== Reformation and Modern Era (1520\u2013present) ==\n[[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]], who played an instrumental part in the formation of the [[Lutheran Church]]es condemned [[Johannes Agricola]] and his doctrine of [[antinomianism]]\u2013the belief that Christians were free from the moral law contained in the [[Ten Commandments]]\u2013as a heresy.<ref name=\"SeelyeSelby2018\"/> Traditional Lutheranism, espoused by Luther himself, teaches that after justification, \"the Law of God continued to guide people in how they were to live before God\".<ref name=\"SeelyeSelby2018\">{{cite book |last1=Seelye |first1=James E. |last2=Selby |first2=Shawn |title=Shaping North America: From Exploration to the American Revolution |date=2018 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=9781440836695 |page=50 |language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[39 Articles]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] of the [[Methodist Church]]es condemn [[Pelagianism]].<ref name=\"Wilson2011\">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Methodist Theology |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9780567317469 |page=87 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n[[John Wesley]], the founder of the Methodist tradition, harshly criticized antinomianism,<ref name=\"YrigoyenWarrick2013\"/> considering it the \"worst of all heresies\".<ref name=\"Hurst1903\">{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|title=John Wesley the Methodist: A Plain Account of His Life and Work|url=https://archive.org/details/johnwesleymetho00hursgoog|year=1903|publisher=Eaton & Mains|language=English|page=[https://archive.org/details/johnwesleymetho00hursgoog/page/n210 200]}}</ref> He taught that Christian believers are bound to follow the [[Ten Commandments|moral law]] for their [[sanctification]].<ref name=\"YrigoyenWarrick2013\">{{cite book|last1=Jr.|first1=Charles Yrigoyen|last2=Warrick|first2=Susan E.|title=Historical Dictionary of Methodism|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810878945|page=30}}</ref> Methodist Christians thus teach the necessity of following the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments, citing [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus']] teaching, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments\" (cf.

The era of such absolute Church authority had lasted some 1,449 years, from AD&nbsp;385 through to 1834. The number of people executed as heretics as sentenced by various church authorities is not known; however it most certainly numbers into the [[Spanish Inquisition#Death tolls|several thousands]]. Coincidentally, the first heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Priscillian]]; the most notorious organization known for the persecution of heretics had been based in Spain, the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the last heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Cayetano Ripoll]]. Thus, the era of the execution of heretics by the Catholic Church had come to an end.\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic response to Protestantism==\n{{Main|Roman Catholic teachings on heresy}}\nWell into the 20th century, Catholics defined Protestants as heretics. Thus, [[Hilaire Belloc]], in his time one of the most conspicuous speakers for Catholicism in Britain, was outspoken about the \"Protestant heresy\". He even defined [[Islam]] as being \"a Christian heresy\", on the grounds that Muslims accept many of the tenets of Christianity but deny the [[divinity of Christ]].\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, and especially in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, tended to diminish the effects of [[Protestantism]] as a formal heresy by referring to many Protestants who, as material heretics, \"through no fault of their own do not know Christ and his Church\",<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/847.htm CCC 847]</ref> even though the teachings of Protestantism are indeed formally heretical from a Catholic perspective. Modern usage in ecumenical contexts favors referring to Protestants as \"separated brethren\".{{refn|group=note|In his book ''The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote that: \"The difficulty in the way of giving an answer is a profound one.  Ultimately it is due to the fact that there is no appropriate category in Catholic thought for the phenomenon of Protestantism today (one could say the same of the relationship to the separated churches of the East).  It is obvious that the old category of \u2018heresy\u2019 is no longer of any value.  Heresy, for Scripture and the early Church, includes the idea of a personal decision against the unity of the Church, and heresy\u2019s characteristic is pertinacia, the obstinacy of him who persists in his own private way.  This, however, cannot be regarded as an appropriate description of the spiritual situation of the Protestant Christian.  In the course of a now centuries-old history, Protestantism has made an important contribution to the realization of Christian faith, fulfilling a positive function in the development of the Christian message and, above all, often giving rise to a sincere and profound faith in the individual non-Catholic Christian, whose separation from the Catholic affirmation has nothing to do with the pertinacia characteristic of heresy.  Perhaps we may here invert a saying of St. Augustine\u2019s: that an old schism becomes a heresy.  The very passage of time alters the character of a division, so that an old division is something essentially different from a new one.  Something that was once rightly condemned as heresy cannot later simply become true, but it can gradually develop its own positive ecclesial nature, with which the individual is presented as his church and in which he lives as a believer, not as a heretic.  This organization of one group, however, ultimately has an effect on the whole.  The conclusion is inescapable, then: Protestantism today is something different from heresy in the traditional sense, a phenomenon whose true theological place has not yet been determined.<ref name=\"XVI1993\">{{cite book|title=The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood|year=1993|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=9780898704464|page=88|author=Pope Benedict XVI}}</ref>}}\n\nSome of the doctrines of Protestantism that the Catholic Church considers heretical are the belief that the [[Bible]] is the only supremely authoritative source and rule of faith and practice in Christianity (''[[sola scriptura]]''), that only by faith alone can anyone ever be lead to salvation and not by works (''[[sola fide]]''), that the [[Pope]] does not necessarily have universal jurisdiction over the whole Church by any divine right, that the Catholic Church cannot be \"the sole Church of Christ\", and that there is not a sacramental and ministerial priesthood exclusively received by ecclesiastical ordination, but rather that the only Christian priesthood can be a universal [[priesthood of all believers]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm Protestantism]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Catholic teachings on heresy]]\n*[[Christian heresy in the modern era]]\n*[[History of Christianity]]\n*[[Infallibility of the Church]]\n*[[List of movements declared heretical by the Catholic Church]]\n*[[List of people burned as heretics]]\n*[[Pelagius]]\n*[[Diversity in early Christian theology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- V -->\n* {{Cite book | editor1-last=Gregory | editor1-first=Andrew |editor2-last=Tuckett | editor2-first=Christopher | year = 2015 | title =The Oxford Handbook of Early Christian Apocrypha |publisher = Oxford University Press }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Clifton |first=Chas S. |title=Encyclopedia of Heresies and Heretics |isbn=0-7607-0823-1 |year=1992 |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofhe00chas }}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Edwards|first=Mark|year=2009|title=Catholicity and Heresy in the Early Church|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9acTl-jAkAC}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Slade|first=Darren M.|title=Arabia Haeresium Ferax (Arabia Bearer of Heresies): Schismatic Christianity\u2019s Potential Influence on Muhammad and the Qur\u2019an|journal=American Theological Inquiry|date=January 2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=43\u201353|url=https://www.academia.edu/7928101/Arabia_Haeresium_Ferax_Arabia_Bearer_of_Heresies_Schismatic_Christianity_s_Potential_Influence_on_Muhammad_and_the_Qur_an|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202093241/http://atijournal.org/ATI_Vol7_No1.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-02|via=|df=}}\n{{Beliefs condemned by the Catholic Church}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heresy}}\n[[Category:Heresy in Christianity| ]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Formal denial or doubt of a core doctrine of the Christian faith[}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n{{Historical Christian theology}}\n'''Heresy in Christianity''' denotes the formal denial or doubt of a core doctrine of the Christian faith<ref name=\"NIDCC-heresy\"/> as defined by one or more of the [[Christian churches]].<ref name=\"ODCC-heresy\"/>\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], [[heresy]] most commonly refers to those beliefs which were declared to be [[anathema]] by any of the [[ecumenical council]]s recognized by the [[Catholic Church]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In the [[Eastern Christianity|East]], the term \"heresy\" is eclectic and can refer to anything at variance with [[Holy Tradition|Church tradition]].

Chesterton]], in his book ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' (1908), asserts that there have been substantial disagreements about faith from the time of the New Testament and Jesus, but that the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] all argued against changing the teachings of Christ, as did the earliest church fathers including [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Polycarp]].{{refn|group=note|See [[False prophets#New Testament|false prophet]], the [[antichrist]], the [[gnostic]] [[Nicolaitanes]] from the [[Book of Revelation]] and [[Man of Sin]].}}\n\n===Diversity===\n{{Main|Diversity in early Christian theology}}\n\nThe [[Ante-Nicene period]] (2nd-3rd century) saw the rise of a great number of Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. They had different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]], particularly the [[Christology|divinity of Jesus]] and the nature of the [[Trinity]]. Some of the major [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] with different interpretations of [[Bible|Scripture]] than the Proto-Orthodox church were:\n*[[Gnosticism]] (particularly [[Valentinianism]]) \u2013 reliance on revealed knowledge from an unknowable God, a distinct divinity from the [[Demiurge]] who created and oversees the material world.\n*[[Marcionism]] \u2013 the [[God the Father|God]] of [[Jesus]] was a different God from the [[Yahweh|God]] of the [[Old Testament]].\n*[[Montanism]] \u2013 relied on [[Prophecy|prophetic]] [[revelation]]s from the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].\n*[[Adoptionism]] \u2013 Jesus was not born the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]], but was adopted at his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] or [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]].\n*[[Docetism]] \u2013 Jesus was pure spirit and his physical form an illusion.\n\n===Proto-orthodoxy===\n{{Main|Proto-orthodoxy}}\n\nBefore AD&nbsp;313, the \"heretical\" nature of some beliefs was a matter of much debate within the churches, and there was no true mechanism in place to resolve the various differences of beliefs. Heresy was to be approached by the leader of the church according to Eusebius, author of ''The Church History''.\n\nEarly attacks upon alleged heresies formed the matter of [[Tertullian]]'s ''Prescription Against Heretics'' (in 44 chapters, written from Rome), and of Irenaeus' ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (''ca'' 180, in five volumes), written in Lyon after his return from a visit to Rome. The letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] and [[Polycarp of Smyrna]] to various churches warned against false teachers, and the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'' accepted by many Christians as part of Scripture in the 2nd century, warned about [[Judaizing|mixing Judaism with Christianity]], as did other writers, leading to decisions reached in the [[first ecumenical council]], which was convoked by the Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325, in response to further disruptive polemical controversy within the Christian community, in that case [[Arianism|Arianist]] disputes over the nature of the Trinity.\n\nIrenaeus ({{circa|130}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|202}}) was the first to argue that his \"orthodox\" position was the same faith that Jesus gave to the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], and that the identity of the apostles, their successors, and the teachings of the same were all well-known public knowledge. This was therefore an early argument supported by [[apostolic succession]]. Irenaeus first established the doctrine of four gospels and no more, with the synoptic gospels interpreted in the light of ''[[Gospel of John|John]]''. Irenaeus' opponents, however, claimed to have received secret teachings from Jesus via other apostles which were not publicly known. Gnosticism is predicated on the existence of such hidden knowledge, but brief references to private teachings of Jesus have also survived in the canonic Scripture as did warning by the Christ that there would be [[false prophet]]s or false teachers. Irenaeus' opponents also claimed that the wellsprings of divine inspiration were not dried up, which is the doctrine of [[continuing revelation]].\n\n==Late Antiquity (313\u2013476) and Early Middle Ages (476\u2013799)==\n{{Main|Christianity in late antiquity|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}\n\n===Christology===\n{{Main|Christology}}\n\nThe earliest controversies in Late Antiquity were generally [[Christology|Christological]] in nature, concerning the interpretation of Jesus' (eternal) divinity and humanity. In the 4th century, [[Arius]] and [[Arianism]] held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than [[God the Father]].{{refn|group=note|{{Bibleverse||John|14:28}}}} Arianism was condemned at the Council of Nicea (325), but nevertheless dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them. [[Trinitarianism]] held that God the Father, [[God the Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]] were all strictly one being with three [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostases]]. The [[Euchites]], a 4th-century [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] sect from Macedonia held that the Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis in order to unite with the souls of the perfect. They were anti-clerical and rejected baptism and the sacraments, believing that the passions could be overcome and perfection achieved through prayer.\n\nMany groups held [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic beliefs]], maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. [[Docetism]] held that Jesus' humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the incarnation.  Others held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58</ref>\n\nThe [[Orthodox Christianity|orthodox]] teaching, as it developed in response to these interpretations, is that Christ was fully divine and at the same time fully human, and that the three persons of the [[Trinity]] are co-equal and co-eternal.\n\n===Legal suppression of heresies===\n{{Main|History of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance}}\n\nIt was only after the legalisation of Christianity, which began under [[Constantine I]] in AD&nbsp;313 that the various beliefs of the proto-orthodox Church began to be made uniform and formulated as dogma, through the ''canons'' promulgated by the [[Ecumenical council|General Councils]]. The first known usage of the term 'heresy' in a civil legal context was in 380 by the \"[[Edict of Thessalonica]]\" of Theodosius I. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as 'heresy'. By this edict, in some senses, the line between the Catholic Church's spiritual authority and the Roman State's jurisdiction was blurred. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and State was a sharing of State powers of legal enforcement between Church and State authorities, with the state enforcing what it determined to be orthodox teaching.\n\nWithin five years of the official 'criminalization' of heresy by the emperor, the first Christian heretic, [[Priscillian]], was executed in 385 by Roman officials.  For some years after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[list of Christian denominations|Protestant denominations]] were also known to execute those whom they considered heretics.\n\nThe edict of [[Theodosius II]] (435) provided severe punishments for those who had or spread writings of Nestorius.<ref name=\"Thompson2009\">{{cite book|author=Jay E.

These were mostly concerned with Christological disputes:\n#The [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council]] was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]], with over 300 bishops condemning the view of [[Arius]] that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father.{{refn|group=note|300 bishops, as well as Constantine I, were present at the Council. Constantine had invited all 1800 bishops of the Christian church (about 1000 in the east and 800 in the west). The number of participating bishops cannot be accurately stated; Socrates Scholasticus and Epiphanius of Salamis counted 318; Eusebius of Caesarea, only 250.}} Each phrase in the [[Nicene Creed]], formulated at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (AD 325), addresses some aspect that had been under passionate discussion prior to Constantine I. Nevertheless, Arianism dominated most of the church for the greater part of the 4th century, often with the aid of Roman emperors who favoured them.\n#The [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity. This council also condemned Arianism.\n#The [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] is that of Ephesus, a stronghold of Cyrillian Christianity, in 431. It was presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops and was mired in controversy because of the absences of the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch, the absence of the Syrian Clergy, and violence directed against Nestorius and his supporters. It affirmed that Mary is the \"Bearer\" of God (''[[Theotokos]]''), contrary to the teachings of [[Nestorius]], and it anathematized Nestorius. A mirror Council held by Nestorius (Patriarch of Antioch) and the Syrian clergy affirmed Mary as Christokos, \"Bearer\" of Christ, and anathematized [[Cyril of Alexandria]].\n#The [[Council of Chalcedon|Fourth Ecumenical Council]] is that of Chalcedon in 451, with the Patriarch of Constantinople presiding over 500 bishops. This council affirmed that Jesus has two natures, is truly God and truly man, distinct yet always in perfect union. This was based largely on [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo the Great's]] ''Tome''. Thus, it condemned [[Monophysitism]] and would be influential in refuting [[Monothelitism]].\n#The [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]] is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the teachings of [[Origen]] on the pre-existence of the soul, etc.\n#The [[Third Council of Constantinople|Sixth Ecumenical Council]] is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the [[Monothelites]].\n#The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]] was called under the Empress Regent [[Irene of Athens]] in 787, known as the second of Nicaea. It supports the [[veneration]] of [[icon]]s while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as \"The Triumph of Orthodoxy\"\n\nNot all of these Councils have been universally recognised as [[Ecumenical Council|ecumenical]]. In addition, the [[Catholic Church]] has convened numerous other councils which it deems as having the same authority, making a total of twenty-one Ecumenical Councils recognised by the Catholic Church. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] accepts only the first two, and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] only three. [[Pope Sergius I]] rejected the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 (see also [[Pentarchy]]).  The Fourth Council of Constantinople of [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|869\u2013870]] and [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879\u2013880]] is disputed by Catholicism and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].  Present-day [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarians]], such as [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] and other [[Mormonism|Mormons]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], reject all seven Councils.\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox consider the following council to be ecumenical, although this is not universally agreed upon:\n#The [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the [[hesychastic]] theology of St. [[Gregory Palamas]] and condemned the philosopher [[Barlaam of Calabria]].\n#In addition to these councils there have been a number of significant councils meant to further define the Eastern Orthodox position. They are the Synods of [[Constantinople]] in 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of [[Ia\u015fi]] (Jassy), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of [[Jerusalem]], 1672.\n\nWithin the Eastern Orthodox Church, the role of the ecumenical councils was to better define the Orthodox canon of faith; however, the Eastern Orthodox Church authorities are not known to have authorized the use of violence in the persecution of heretics with nearly the frequency of their Western counterparts. Some individual examples of the execution of Orthodox heretics do exist, however, such as the execution of [[Avvakum]] in 1682. Far more typically, the Eastern Orthodox response to a heresy would rather be (and still is) to merely \"excommunicate\" the individuals involved.\n\n==High Middle Ages (800\u20131299) and Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance (1300\u20131520) ==\n[[File:Titelkupfer Index librorum prohibitorum.jpg|thumb|This 1711 illustration for the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' depicts the Holy Ghost supplying the book burning fire.]]\n{{Main|Medieval history of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131300)|l1=High Middle Ages|Medieval history of Christianity#Late Middle Ages (1300\u20131499|l2=Late Middle Ages}}\n\nFrom the late 11th century onward, heresy once again came to be a concern for Catholic authorities, as reports became increasingly common. The reasons for this are still not fully understood, but the causes for this new period of heresy include popular response to the 11th-century clerical reform movement, greater lay familiarity with the Bible, exclusion of lay people from sacramental activity, and more rigorous definition and supervision of Catholic dogma. The question of how heresy should be suppressed was not resolved, and there was initially substantial clerical resistance to the use of physical force by secular authorities to correct spiritual deviance. As heresy was viewed with increasing concern by the papacy, however, the \"secular arm\" was used more frequently and freely during the 12th century and afterward.\n\n===Medieval heresies===\nThere were many Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] and individuals throughout the Middle Ages whose teachings were deemed heretical by the established church, such as:\n*[[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] \u2013 an [[Armenia]]n group (6th to 9th centuries) who sought a return to the purity of the church at the time of [[Paul the Apostle]]. \n*[[Tondrakians]] - an [[Armenia]]n group (9th to 11th centuries) who advocated the abolition of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Church]] along with all its traditional rites.\n*[[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] \u2013 a group arising in the 11th century in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Balkans]] who sought a return to the spirituality of the early Christians and opposed established forms of government and church.\n*[[Gundolfo]] \u2013 an itinerant 11th century preacher near [[Lille]], [[France]], who taught that [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] was achieved through a virtuous life of abandoning the world, restraining the appetites of the flesh, earning food by the labor of hands, doing no injury to anyone, and extending charity to everyone of their own faith.\n*[[Catharism|Cathars]] \u2013 a major Christian movement in the [[Languedoc]] region of southern [[France]] from the 11th to 13th centuries. The Cathars believed that human [[soul]]s were the spirits of [[angel]]s trapped within the physical creation of an evil god. Through living a pure and sinless life, the soul could become perfect and free from the snare of matter.\n*[[Arnoldists]] \u2013 a 12th century group from [[Lombardy]] who criticized the wealth of the [[Catholic Church]] and preached against [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].\n*[[Peter of Bruys|Petrobrusians]] were 12th century followers of Peter of Bruys in southeastern [[France]] who rejected the authority of the [[Church Fathers]] and of the Catholic Church, opposing [[clerical celibacy]], [[infant baptism]], [[prayers for the dead]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]] music.\n*[[Henry of Lausanne|Henricans]] were 12th century followers of Henry of Lausanne in France. They rejected the [[Catholic theology|doctrinal]] and disciplinary authority of the [[Catholic Church|church]], did not recognize any form of [[worship]] or [[Liturgy#Christianity|liturgy]] and denied the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]].\n*[[Waldensians]] \u2013 a movement that began in the 12th century in [[Lyon]], [[France]], and still exists today. They held that [[Apostolic poverty]] was the way to spiritual perfection and rejected what they perceived as the [[Religious images in Christian theology|idolatry]] of the [[Catholic Church]].\n*[[Humiliati]] - a 12th century group from northern Italy who embraced poverty, charity and [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|mortification]]. Initially approved by the church, they were suppressed for disobedience in 1571.\n*[[Heresy of the Free Spirit|Brethren of the Free Spirit]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th century to those, primarily in the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Bohemia]] and northern [[Italy]], who believed that the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] were unnecessary for [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]], that the [[soul]] could be perfected through imitating the life of [[Christ]], and that the perfected soul was free of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] and beyond all [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|ecclesiastical]], [[Christian ethics|moral]] and secular law.\n*[[Apostolic Brethren]] (later known as [[Dulcinian]]s) \u2013 a 13th to 14th century sect from northern Italy founded by [[Gerard Segarelli]] and continued by [[Fra Dolcino]] of [[Novara]]. The Apostolic Brethren rejected the worldliness of the church and sought a life of perfect sanctity, in complete poverty, with no fixed domicile, no care for the morrow, and no vows.\n*[[Fraticelli]] (or Spiritual Franciscans) \u2013 [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] extremists through the 13th to 15th centuries who regarded the wealth of the Church as scandalous.\n*[[Adamites#Neo-Adamits|Neo-Adamites]] \u2013 a term applied in the 13th to 15th century to those, including [[Taborites]], [[Picards]] and some [[Beghards]], who wished to return to the purity of the life of [[Adam]] by [[Intentional community|living communally]], practicing social and religious [[Christian naturism|nudity]], embracing [[free love]] and rejecting [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]] and individual ownership of property.\n*[[Nicholas of Basel]] \u2013 a 14th century [[Basel|Swiss]] leader who, after a spiritual experience, taught that he had the authority to use [[Bishop|episcopal]] and [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priestly]] powers (even though he was not ordained), that submission to his direction was necessary for attaining spiritual perfection, and that his followers could not [[Christian views on sin|sin]] even though they committed crimes or disobeyed both the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and [[pope]].\n*[[Lollardy|Lollards]] \u2013 the 14th century followers of [[John Wycliffe]]. They advocated [[Bible translations into English|translating the Bible into English]], rejected [[baptism]] and [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], and denied the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].\n\n===Inquisition===\nIn the late 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church instituted the [[Inquisition]], an official body charged with the suppression of heresy. This began as an extension and more rigorous enforcement of pre-existing episcopal powers (possessed, but little used, by bishops in the early Middle Ages) to inquire about and suppress heresy, but later became the domain of selected [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]]<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm|title= Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition|website=New Advent|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> under the direct power of the Pope. The use of torture to extract confessions was authorized by Innocent IV in 1252.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia Inquisition\"/> The Inquisition was active in several nations of [[Europe]], particularly where it had fervent support from the civil authority. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] was particularly brutal in its methods, which included the [[burning at the stake]] of many heretics.

The era of such absolute Church authority had lasted some 1,449 years, from AD&nbsp;385 through to 1834. The number of people executed as heretics as sentenced by various church authorities is not known; however it most certainly numbers into the [[Spanish Inquisition#Death tolls|several thousands]]. Coincidentally, the first heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Priscillian]]; the most notorious organization known for the persecution of heretics had been based in Spain, the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the last heretic executed had been a Spaniard, [[Cayetano Ripoll]]. Thus, the era of the execution of heretics by the Catholic Church had come to an end.\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic response to Protestantism==\n{{Main|Roman Catholic teachings on heresy}}\nWell into the 20th century, Catholics defined Protestants as heretics. Thus, [[Hilaire Belloc]], in his time one of the most conspicuous speakers for Catholicism in Britain, was outspoken about the \"Protestant heresy\". He even defined [[Islam]] as being \"a Christian heresy\", on the grounds that Muslims accept many of the tenets of Christianity but deny the [[divinity of Christ]].\n\nHowever, in the second half of the century, and especially in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, tended to diminish the effects of [[Protestantism]] as a formal heresy by referring to many Protestants who, as material heretics, \"through no fault of their own do not know Christ and his Church\",<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/847.htm CCC 847]</ref> even though the teachings of Protestantism are indeed formally heretical from a Catholic perspective. Modern usage in ecumenical contexts favors referring to Protestants as \"separated brethren\".{{refn|group=note|In his book ''The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote that: \"The difficulty in the way of giving an answer is a profound one.  Ultimately it is due to the fact that there is no appropriate category in Catholic thought for the phenomenon of Protestantism today (one could say the same of the relationship to the separated churches of the East).  It is obvious that the old category of \u2018heresy\u2019 is no longer of any value.  Heresy, for Scripture and the early Church, includes the idea of a personal decision against the unity of the Church, and heresy\u2019s characteristic is pertinacia, the obstinacy of him who persists in his own private way.  This, however, cannot be regarded as an appropriate description of the spiritual situation of the Protestant Christian.  In the course of a now centuries-old history, Protestantism has made an important contribution to the realization of Christian faith, fulfilling a positive function in the development of the Christian message and, above all, often giving rise to a sincere and profound faith in the individual non-Catholic Christian, whose separation from the Catholic affirmation has nothing to do with the pertinacia characteristic of heresy.  Perhaps we may here invert a saying of St. Augustine\u2019s: that an old schism becomes a heresy.  The very passage of time alters the character of a division, so that an old division is something essentially different from a new one.  Something that was once rightly condemned as heresy cannot later simply become true, but it can gradually develop its own positive ecclesial nature, with which the individual is presented as his church and in which he lives as a believer, not as a heretic.  This organization of one group, however, ultimately has an effect on the whole.  The conclusion is inescapable, then: Protestantism today is something different from heresy in the traditional sense, a phenomenon whose true theological place has not yet been determined.<ref name=\"XVI1993\">{{cite book|title=The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood|year=1993|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=9780898704464|page=88|author=Pope Benedict XVI}}</ref>}}\n\nSome of the doctrines of Protestantism that the Catholic Church considers heretical are the belief that the [[Bible]] is the only supremely authoritative source and rule of faith and practice in Christianity (''[[sola scriptura]]''), that only by faith alone can anyone ever be lead to salvation and not by works (''[[sola fide]]''), that the [[Pope]] does not necessarily have universal jurisdiction over the whole Church by any divine right, that the Catholic Church cannot be \"the sole Church of Christ\", and that there is not a sacramental and ministerial priesthood exclusively received by ecclesiastical ordination, but rather that the only Christian priesthood can be a universal [[priesthood of all believers]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm Protestantism]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Catholic teachings on heresy]]\n*[[Christian heresy in the modern era]]\n*[[History of Christianity]]\n*[[Infallibility of the Church]]\n*[[List of movements declared heretical by the Catholic Church]]\n*[[List of people burned as heretics]]\n*[[Pelagius]]\n*[[Diversity in early Christian theology]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- V -->\n* {{Cite book | editor1-last=Gregory | editor1-first=Andrew |editor2-last=Tuckett | editor2-first=Christopher | year = 2015 | title =The Oxford Handbook of Early Christian Apocrypha |publisher = Oxford University Press }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Clifton |first=Chas S. |title=Encyclopedia of Heresies and Heretics |isbn=0-7607-0823-1 |year=1992 |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofhe00chas }}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Edwards|first=Mark|year=2009|title=Catholicity and Heresy in the Early Church|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9acTl-jAkAC}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Slade|first=Darren M.|title=Arabia Haeresium Ferax (Arabia Bearer of Heresies): Schismatic Christianity\u2019s Potential Influence on Muhammad and the Qur\u2019an|journal=American Theological Inquiry|date=January 2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=43\u201353|url=https://www.academia.edu/7928101/Arabia_Haeresium_Ferax_Arabia_Bearer_of_Heresies_Schismatic_Christianity_s_Potential_Influence_on_Muhammad_and_the_Qur_an|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202093241/http://atijournal.org/ATI_Vol7_No1.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-02|via=|df=}}\n{{Beliefs condemned by the Catholic Church}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heresy}}\n[[Category:Heresy in Christianity| ]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Sheldknight76", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy_in_Christianity"}
