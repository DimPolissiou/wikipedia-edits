It is written for a narrator, solo voices, chorus, and an orchestra including piano.\n\nIt was composed in [[Italy]] in 1831, often using previously written music, and first performed at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] on 9 December 1832 as ''Le retour \u00e0 la vie, m\u00e9lologue en six parties''. It was revised for a performance in [[Weimar]] at the request of [[Franz Liszt]] in 1855 and published the following year. According to David Cairns, ''L\u00e9lio'' had the most \"immediate impact\" of all Berlioz's works, yet the fashionable Romantic features and the mixture of declamation and music which appealed to early audiences have served to date the piece and it is rarely revived or recorded nowadays.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Berlioz - L\u00e9lio, piano dans l'orchestre.PNG|thumb|Berlioz - L\u00e9lio, piano dans l'orchestre]]\n''L\u00e9lio'' is a kind of sequel to ''Symphonie fantastique'' and makes use of the famous ''id\u00e9e fixe'' (the recurring musical theme symbolising the beloved) from that work. Both the symphony and ''L\u00e9lio'' were inspired by the composer's unhappy love affairs, the symphony by [[Harriet Smithson]], ''L\u00e9lio'' by Marie Moke, who had broken off her engagement to Berlioz in order to marry [[Camille Pleyel]], prompting the composer to contemplate suicide. ''L\u00e9lio'' is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and ''L\u00e9lio'' were about Harriet Smithson (she later became his wife). The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of [[opium]], leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of ''L\u00e9lio'' describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this [[unrequited love]] out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an [[orchestra]] to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully.\n''L\u00e9lio'' consists of six musical pieces presented by an actor who stands on stage in front of a curtain concealing the orchestra, chorus and solo singers. The actor's dramatic monologues explain the meaning of the music in the life of the artist. The work begins and ends with the ''id\u00e9e fixe'' theme, linking ''L\u00e9lio'' to the ''Symphonie fantastique''.\n\n==The music==\nThe six pieces of music are:\n#''Le p\u00eacheur. Ballade'' (''The Fisherman. Ballad'') A setting of a translation of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s [[ballad]] ''Der Fischer''.<br>\n\n\nHoratio (Singing)\n\nThe waters billow, the waters roll;<br>\nOn the bank is a young fisherman<br>\nThe charm of the lovely lake<br>\nStirs in his heart a peaceful languor.<br>\nHe hardly notes, he scarcely guides<br>\nHis roving line in the waves.<br>\nSuddenly from the limpid lake<br>\nArises a water nymph.<br>\n\n\nL\u00e9lio (interrupts)\n\nIt was five years ago that Horatio wrote\nthis ballad in imitation of Goethe and I\ncomposed the music. We were happy then.\nHis lot has not changed, but mine...! Five\nyears! How I have suffered since then!<br>\n\n\nHoratio (continuing)\n\nShe tells him: \"See the light!<br>\nLook deep into my azure waves.<br>\nSee in my waves Phoebe who delights<br>\nIn sparkling with a pure burst of light.<br>\nSee how the cloudless sky<br>\nReflects so beautifully in my waves.<br>\nSee, see!<br>\nAnd finally see your own true image<br>\nSmiling at you from the bottom of the water.<br>\nAnd finally see your own true image<br>\nSmiling at you from deep within the waters.\"<br>\n\n\nL\u00e9lio (interrupts)\n\nSiren! Siren!\nGod, my heart is breaking!<br>\n\n\nHoratio (continuing)\n\nThe waters billow, the waters roll,<br>\nAnd wet the feet of the fisherman.<br>\nHe listens to the voice that tempts him;<br>\nHe surrenders to her deceiving charms.<br>\n\n\nL\u00e9lio (interrupts)<br>\nYes, yes! I've heard that much to well!<br>\n\n\nHoratio (continues)\n\nShe speaks with a tender voice, <br>\nIn a tender voice she sings.<br>\nHelpless and defenseless,<br>\nHe follows the nymph \u2014 and vanishes.<br>\n\n\n#''Choeur d'ombres'' (''Chorus of Shades'') An evocation of the ghostly atmosphere of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'', this piece reuses music from Berlioz's [[cantata]] ''[[Prix de Rome cantatas (Berlioz)|La mort de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']].\n#''Chanson de brigands'' (''Brigands' Song'') A celebration of the freedom of life enjoyed by outlaws in [[Calabria]].\n#''Chant de bonheur - Souvenirs'' (''Song of Happiness - Memories'') A [[tenor]] hymn in praise of the artist's recovered happiness. The music was originally used in the cantata ''[[Prix de Rome cantatas (Berlioz)|La mort d'Orph\u00e9e]]'' (1827).\n#''La harpe \u00e9olienne'' (''The Aeolian Harp'') For orchestra alone, this is another reworking of music from the cantata ''La mort d'Orph\u00e9e''. The [[Aeolian harp]] was an important symbol of artistic inspiration in [[Romanticism]]. \n#''Fantaisie sur la \"Temp\u00eate\" de Shakespeare'' (''Fantasy on Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\"'') A piece of [[programme music]] based on Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'' for orchestra and chorus (singing in [[Italian language|Italian]]). \"The work marks the first appearance of the [[piano]] as an orchestral instrument.

The first floor is dedicated to courses relating to business studies, the [[arts]], technologies, and physical education. The second floor is devoted almost entirely to modern languages, social studies, and computer sciences, and is also home to the library and three computer labs. The third floor holds mathematics classrooms and science labs.\n\nThe school's main hallway is a large atrium which extends up all three stories, and has a large skylight which covers the entire ceiling. It is nicknamed \"The Street\" because of its planted trees, old-fashioned street lights, and the fact that the classroom windows on either side make it seem as though one is walking between two buildings.\n\nThe school has three primary staircases that go from the first floor up to the third, which are located in the center of \"The Street\" and at the front and back doors. There is also a staircase in \"The Street\" going directly to the second floor, and one in the back going from the second floor down to the football field on the east side of the building.\n\nThe school has eleven exits, which are located in the front and back entranceways, a Personal and Career Counselling (PCC) office, a daycare, a Communications Technology (CommTech) lab, two art rooms, an art hallway entrance, a cafeteria, and two exits to the field.\n\nThe school also has various concealed exits used during emergencies.\n\n==Facilities==\nFor recreation, Iroquois Ridge High School has a large gymnasium, a soccer/football field surrounded by a 400m track with a long jump pit, and a fitness centre.

There are also two baseball parks behind the school that are maintained by the Town of Oakville. A field hockey/soccer field and a tennis court are located adjacent to the school and are also maintained by the Town of Oakville.

This new format is available on both the Google Search Network and the Google Display network.

From January 16, 2018, certification exams moved from Google Partners to Google Academy for Ads.<ref>[https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/Academy-for-Ads/Academy-for-Ads-Your-New-Home-for-Ads-Education/ba-p/1617169# Academy for Ads- Your New Home for Ads Education], SpencerC, AdWords Communit, January 18, 2018</ref>\n\nIt replaced ''Google Advertising Professionals'' in April 2010, with updates ranging from amended criteria for entries and changes to the exam requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google launches additional tools for AdWords clients |url=http://archive.webpronews.com/2004/1112.html |publisher=Web Pro News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531035103/http://archive.webpronews.com/2004/1112.html |archivedate=May 31, 2013 }}</ref> The program continues to certify [[consultant]]s to help the increasing number of Google AdWords clients with AdWords campaigns. The program contains one fundamental exam and five advanced exams.\n\nIn order to be individually qualified, a person must pass the program exams. The AdWords qualifications received vary based on which advance exams the individual passes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3154326?hl=en-GB|title=About the AdWords certification - Google Partners Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> Google Partners must continue with their best practices by engaging with ongoing professional development. One accredited individual must be certified (two individuals for Google Premier Partners) and a minimum spend threshold of US$10,000 over 90 days must be maintained, with a higher spend threshold for Google Premier Partners.<ref>[https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9028815?hl=en How to earn the Google Partner badge], accessed December 28, 2018</ref>\n\n===Placement-targeted advertisements===\nPlacement-targeted advertisements (formerly Site-Targeted Advertisements) are a feature introduced in 2003 to the AdWords control panel. Using the AdWords control panel, advertisers can enter keywords, domain names, topics, and [[demographic targeting]] preferences. Based on this, Google places ads on relevant sites within the content network. If domain names are targeted, Google also provides a list of related sites for placement. Advertisers bid on a [[Cost Per Impression|cost-per-impression]] (CPI/CPM) or [[Cost Per Click|cost-per-click]] (CPC) basis for site targeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=113233 |title=How do CPC and CPM ads compete with each other? - AdWords Help |accessdate=February 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214161533/https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=113233 |archive-date=December 14, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith placement targeting, it is possible for an ad to take up an entire ad block instead of splitting the ad into two to four ads. This leads to higher ad visibility for the advertiser.\n\nThe minimum cost-per-thousand impressions bid for placement-targeted campaigns is 25 cents. There is no minimum CPC bid.\n\n===Remarketing===\n''Remarketing'' is an Google Ads feature that allows marketers to show advertisements to users that have previously visited their website. This feature also allows marketers to create different audience lists based on the behaviors of website visitors in order to serve relevant ads to these segmented audiences. Remarketing Lists for Search (RLSA) via [[Google Analytics]] became available in Google Ads in early June 2015, allowing for the use of standard GA remarketing lists to plan traditional text search ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=About remarketing lists for search ads - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2701222?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA more advanced subtype of remarketing is dynamic remarketing through which advertisers can show past visitors the specific products or services they viewed to further customize the ad experience. This subtype is especially used by [[e-commerce]] websites that foster a diverse range of products and services and need to have their remarketing messages relevant to users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6099158?hl=en|title=About dynamic remarketing for retail - Google Merchant Center Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile remarketing is a mainstream practice, it remains to be perceived as an intrusive one to many users as they might feel annoyingly stalked all over the internet. So, it is recommended for Google Ads advertisers to dive deep into optimization practices such as frequency capping so that their remarketing efforts won't backfire and build customer dissatisfaction and distress instead of brand awareness and sales.\n\n===Smart Shopping Campaign===\nGoogle Ads Introduced ' 'Smart Shopping' ' Ads by early 2018. This is sub campaign type of shopping campaign, this combines Standard Shopping and Display remarketing features and uses only in Automated bid strategy to promote products listed in Google Merchant Center. Necessary website tracking code configurations are required before running this campaign.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=About Smart Shopping Campaigns - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7674739?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis campaign works with Google Machine Learning and serves responsive ad in Google's Display Partner Websites, Google Network to drive the ROAS percent in the Campaign settings.\n\nYou need to follow certain best practices<ref name=\"auto\"/> in Feed file to deliver good results. This campaign type would take priority over standard Shopping and Dynamic Remarketing campaigns.\n\n===Ad extensions===\nAd extensions allow advertisers to show extra information with their ads, such as a business address, phone number, or web page links. Ad extensions are created to improve ad visibility and attract clicks. They appear with the Search Network, above search results, and at time on the Display Network.\n\nGoogle Ads shows extensions when it calculates that the extensions will improve the advertiser's campaign performance, or when an ad is ranked high enough for it to appear.\n\n====Manual extensions====\n* App extensions - Allow advertisers to provide a link below the ad text directing users to a mobile or tablet app.\n* Call extensions - Allow advertisers to include a clickable phone number in their ads.\n* Location extensions - Allow advertisers to show their business address, phone number, and map marker.\n* Affiliate Location extensions - Allows advertisers to show business information about retail chain stores that sell their products.\n* Review extensions - Allow advertisers to showcase positive, third-party reviews from reputable sources.\n* Sitelink extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional links below their ads.\n* Callout extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional descriptive text.\n* Structured Snippet extensions - Allow advertisers to add up to two predefined headers (product or service) like brands or degrees.\n* Price extensions - Allow advertisers to display prices for products or services.\n* Message extensions - Allows the ability to connect with advertisers via SMS apps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/182883/20161021/new-google-click-to-message-ads-extension-connects-consumers-to-companies-over-sms.htm|title=New Google Click-To-Message Ads Extension Connects Consumers To Companies Over SMS|last=Times|first=Tech|date=October 21, 2016|newspaper=Tech Times|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* Promotion extensions - Allow advertisers to highlight sales and promotions that a business has to offer.\n*Lead Form extensions - Allow advertisers to capture qualified leads directly in the SERP.\n\n====Automated Extensions====\nGoogle Ads creates and displays automated extensions when the system predicts they will improve performance. Automated extensions include:\n\n* Consumer Ratings\n* Seller Ratings\n* Previous Visits\n* Dynamic Sitelink Extensions\n* Dynamic Structured Snippets\n\n=== Google Click-to-Call ===\n''Google Click-to-Call'' was a service provided by Google which allowed users to call [[advertising|advertisers]] straight from Google search results pages. Users entered their phone numbers and Google would connect the call to the advertiser. Google paid for the calling charges. The service was discontinued in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/07/google-discontinues-click-to-call-and.html|title=Google Discontinues Click-to-Call and Related Links|last=Chitu|first=Alex|date=July 20, 2007|publisher=Googlesystem.blogspot.com|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> For some time, similar click-to-call functionality was available for results in [[Google Maps]]. In the Froyo release of Google's Android operating system, certain advertisements included a very similar functionality. In iOS, phone numbers are automatically recognized as such. Web developers can also provide direct links to the Phone application, providing similar functionality.\n\nGoogle now offers a mobile click-to-call function which allows searchers to call a business directly rather than going to their website.\n\n=== Google AdWords Customer Match ===\nDue to the influence of brand messaging on consumer purchasing habits, Google expanded AdWords to include a Customer Match service. Customer Match allows advertisers to show ads to customers based on data they share with Google, as well as allowing advertisers to bid and create ads tailored to customers.\n\n=== Google Ad Grants ===\n\nGoogle Ad Grants provide US$10,000 per month to eligible nonprofit organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/grants/|title=Grants for Nonprofit Organizations {{!}} Google Ad Grants \u2013 Google|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> The NGO can either use AdWords express or their Google Ads account to advertise their cause on the Google Search platform.\n\n'''Google Universal App Campaigns (UAC)'''\n\nGoogle launched a new style of campaign aimed at app developers looking to advertise their app on Google's vast ad network. On this campaign type advertisers don't get to pick who sees their ad and what their ad looks like. Rather the options are to chooses some text, images, a destination and a target bid and Google will do the rest for you. Using machine learning Google will try and figure out the best audiences for you using the budget set.\n\n== Technology ==\nThe AdWords system was initially implemented on top of the [[MySQL]] database engine. After the system had been launched, management decided to use [[Oracle database|Oracle]] instead. The system became much slower, and eventually, it was reverted to MySQL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|title=eldapo: Let's get a real database|last=Lembo|first=Phil|date=May 30, 2007|publisher=Eldapo.blogspot.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305152003/http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|archivedate=March 5, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Eventually, Google developed a custom distributed [[Relational database management system]] (RDBMS) known as Google F1 specifically for the needs of the Ad business, which requires strong consistency, high scalability across data centers, and powerful SQL queries.\n\nThe interface has also been revamped to offer better workflow with additional new features, such as Spreadsheet Editing, Search Query Reports, and better [[Conversion marketing|conversion]] metrics.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAll ads on AdWords are eligible to be shown on Google's search engine. Advertisers also have the option of enabling their ads to show on Google's partner networks. This \"search network\" includes [[AOL|AOL search]], [[Ask.com]], and [[Netscape]].\n\nThe Google Display Network (GDN), formerly referred to as the \"content network\", shows AdWords ads on sites that are not search engines. These GDN sites use [[AdSense]] and [[DoubleClick]], the other side of the Google advertising model. AdSense is used by website owners who wish to make money by displaying ads on their websites. Click-through rates on the display network are typically much lower than those on the search network and quality score for Display Network is calculated separately from Search network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?answer=140351|title=Quality Score: Definition - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\nFurther, Google automatically determines the subject of pages and displays relevant ads based on the advertisers' keyword lists. AdSense publishers may select channels to help direct Google's ad placements on pages to increase the performance of their ad units. There are many different types of ads that run across Google's network including text ads, image or banner ads, mobile text ads, and in-page video ads. In February 2016, Google began removing right-hand side ads from AdWords on a desktop in favor of only showing text ads above and below organic search results. Product Listing Ads and the Google Knowledge Graph were unaffected, and can still appear on the right-hand side.\n\n==Account management==\n[[File:Google Headquarters in Ireland Building Front Entrance.jpg|thumb|Google's headquarters in Ireland where all EU Google Ads account management takes place.]]\nTo help clients with the complexity of building and managing AdWords accounts, [[search engine marketing]] agencies and consultants offer account management services. This allowed organizations without advertising expertise to reach a global online audience. To help regulate Best Practices for AdWords Management, Google implemented the Google Partner Program and the Google Individual Qualification Program, both of which require individuals and agencies to meet benchmarks and pass exams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3125774?hl=en|title=About Google Partners - Google Partners Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref> Google also has its own in-house team of account managers who are assigned to clients to help optimize campaigns, increase returns and keep customers engaged in the platform. Smaller accounts will be assigned to a pool of account managers, whereas larger spending Google Ads users are given a dedicated account manager.\n\nGoogle also provides an offline account management software, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170322133444/https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/adwords-editor/ AdWords Editor].\n\nThe My Client Center feature is available to Google Professionals, regardless if they have passed the exam or budget parameters yet. With this feature, a Google professional has access to a dashboard summary of several accounts and can move between those accounts without logging into each account.\n\nThe [[Google Keyword Planner|Google AdWords Keyword Planner]], formerly the Keyword Tool, is a free AdWords tool which gives estimated traffic-per-month for the mentioned keywords. It provides a list of related keywords expected to be equally successful for a specific website or keyword.\n\nThe Google Display Planner is an AdWords tool to identify display network keywords, placements, and topics. It helps in expanding the reach of display campaigns while targeting relevant users for a business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3056153?hl=en|title=Display Planner: Definition - Google Ads Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\n==Costs calculation methodology==\n\nThe cost of a Google AdWords campaign depends on a variety of factors which include bidding strategies and organization goals. As a result, the amount that an organization needs to spend varies based on industry and the keywords on which they bid. Whenever a user conducts a search on Google, AdWords runs an auction to determine which search ads are displayed on the search results page as well as the ad's position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1704424?hl=en%7Ctitle=How|title=How costs are calculated in AdWords - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Factors===\n\nThere are four main factors that affect the cost and bidding factors of a Google AdWords campaign.\n\n* Your Bid - The maximum amount you are willing to pay for a click to your ad.\n*Keywords - Keywords that you target have great impact on the cost as well.  \n* The Quality of Your Ads - The relevancy and usefulness of your ad in contrast to the website it links to.\n* Extensions & Other Ad Formats - The relevance of your ad extensions or call outs and how frequently they are clicked.\n\n==Legal context==\nAdWords has generated lawsuits in the area of [[trademark law]] (see ''[[Google, Inc. v. Am. Blind & Wallpaper Factory]]'' and ''[[Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.]]''), fraud (see ''[[Goddard v. Google, Inc.]]''), and [[click fraud]]. In 2006, Google settled a click fraud lawsuit for US$90 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11734026|title=Google settles advertising suit for $90 million|publisher=[[NBC News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=March 8, 2006}}</ref> March 2010, Google was involved with a trademark infringement case involving three French companies that own Louis Vuitton trademarks. The lawsuit concerned if Google was responsible if the advertisers purchasing keywords violate trademark infringement. Ultimately, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Google AdWords were \u201cnot a breach of EU trade mark law, but that the content of some advertisements that are linked by Google keywords may well be in breach depending upon the particular facts of the case.\u201d <ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.mondaq.com|title= European Union: Google Adwords And Online Advertising: Trade Mark Infringement?

Although the Australian Sex Party amended its website to display tax deductibility information, Google continued to ban the ads. The ads were reinstated on election eve after it was reported in the media that the Australian Sex Party was considering suing Google. On September 13, 2012, the Australian Sex Party lodged formal complaints against Google with the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] and the Australian competition watchdog, accusing Google of \"unlawful interference in the conduct of a state election in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] with corrupt intent\" in violation of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/no-sex-party-please-were-google-20120913-25tn8.html No Sex Party please, we're Google] [[Sydney Morning Herald]] September 13, 2012</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in ''[[Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc.]]'' that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit [[trademark infringement]] when it purchased AdWords and other search advertisements using competitor [[1-800 Contacts]]' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging that its search advertising trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and is scheduled to appear before an FTC [[administrative law judge]] in April 2017.<ref>David O.

Prior to this, paid advertisements could feature different landing page URLs to that of what was being displayed on the search network.

This leads to higher ad visibility for the advertiser.\n\nThe minimum cost-per-thousand impressions bid for placement-targeted campaigns is 25 cents. There is no minimum CPC bid.\n\n===Remarketing===\n''Remarketing'' is an Google Ads feature that allows marketers to show advertisements to users that have previously visited their website. This feature also allows marketers to create different audience lists based on the behaviors of website visitors in order to serve relevant ads to these segmented audiences. Remarketing Lists for Search (RLSA) via [[Google Analytics]] became available in Google Ads in early June 2015, allowing for the use of standard GA remarketing lists to plan traditional text search ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=About remarketing lists for search ads - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2701222?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA more advanced subtype of remarketing is dynamic remarketing through which advertisers can show past visitors the specific products or services they viewed to further customize the ad experience. This subtype is especially used by [[e-commerce]] websites that foster a diverse range of products and services and need to have their remarketing messages relevant to users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6099158?hl=en|title=About dynamic remarketing for retail - Google Merchant Center Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile remarketing is a mainstream practice, it remains to be perceived as an intrusive one to many users as they might feel annoyingly stalked all over the internet. So, it is recommended for Google Ads advertisers to dive deep into optimization practices such as frequency capping so that their remarketing efforts won't backfire and build customer dissatisfaction and distress instead of brand awareness and sales.\n\n===Smart Shopping Campaign===\nGoogle Ads Introduced ' 'Smart Shopping' ' Ads by early 2018. This is sub campaign type of shopping campaign, this combines Standard Shopping and Display remarketing features and uses only in Automated bid strategy to promote products listed in Google Merchant Center. Necessary website tracking code configurations are required before running this campaign.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=About Smart Shopping Campaigns - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7674739?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis campaign works with Google Machine Learning and serves responsive ad in Google's Display Partner Websites, Google Network to drive the ROAS percent in the Campaign settings.\n\nYou need to follow certain best practices<ref name=\"auto\"/> in Feed file to deliver good results. This campaign type would take priority over standard Shopping and Dynamic Remarketing campaigns.\n\n===Ad extensions===\nAd extensions allow advertisers to show extra information with their ads, such as a business address, phone number, or web page links. Ad extensions are created to improve ad visibility and attract clicks. They appear with the Search Network, above search results, and at time on the Display Network.\n\nGoogle Ads shows extensions when it calculates that the extensions will improve the advertiser's campaign performance, or when an ad is ranked high enough for it to appear.\n\n====Manual extensions====\n* App extensions - Allow advertisers to provide a link below the ad text directing users to a mobile or tablet app.\n* Call extensions - Allow advertisers to include a clickable phone number in their ads.\n* Location extensions - Allow advertisers to show their business address, phone number, and map marker.\n* Affiliate Location extensions - Allows advertisers to show business information about retail chain stores that sell their products.\n* Review extensions - Allow advertisers to showcase positive, third-party reviews from reputable sources.\n* Sitelink extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional links below their ads.\n* Callout extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional descriptive text.\n* Structured Snippet extensions - Allow advertisers to add up to two predefined headers (product or service) like brands or degrees.\n* Price extensions - Allow advertisers to display prices for products or services.\n* Message extensions - Allows the ability to connect with advertisers via SMS apps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/182883/20161021/new-google-click-to-message-ads-extension-connects-consumers-to-companies-over-sms.htm|title=New Google Click-To-Message Ads Extension Connects Consumers To Companies Over SMS|last=Times|first=Tech|date=October 21, 2016|newspaper=Tech Times|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* Promotion extensions - Allow advertisers to highlight sales and promotions that a business has to offer.\n*Lead Form extensions - Allow advertisers to capture qualified leads directly in the SERP.\n\n====Automated Extensions====\nGoogle Ads creates and displays automated extensions when the system predicts they will improve performance. Automated extensions include:\n\n* Consumer Ratings\n* Seller Ratings\n* Previous Visits\n* Dynamic Sitelink Extensions\n* Dynamic Structured Snippets\n\n=== Google Click-to-Call ===\n''Google Click-to-Call'' was a service provided by Google which allowed users to call [[advertising|advertisers]] straight from Google search results pages. Users entered their phone numbers and Google would connect the call to the advertiser. Google paid for the calling charges. The service was discontinued in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/07/google-discontinues-click-to-call-and.html|title=Google Discontinues Click-to-Call and Related Links|last=Chitu|first=Alex|date=July 20, 2007|publisher=Googlesystem.blogspot.com|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> For some time, similar click-to-call functionality was available for results in [[Google Maps]]. In the Froyo release of Google's Android operating system, certain advertisements included a very similar functionality. In iOS, phone numbers are automatically recognized as such. Web developers can also provide direct links to the Phone application, providing similar functionality.\n\nGoogle now offers a mobile click-to-call function which allows searchers to call a business directly rather than going to their website.\n\n=== Google AdWords Customer Match ===\nDue to the influence of brand messaging on consumer purchasing habits, Google expanded AdWords to include a Customer Match service. Customer Match allows advertisers to show ads to customers based on data they share with Google, as well as allowing advertisers to bid and create ads tailored to customers.\n\n=== Google Ad Grants ===\n\nGoogle Ad Grants provide US$10,000 per month to eligible nonprofit organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/grants/|title=Grants for Nonprofit Organizations {{!}} Google Ad Grants \u2013 Google|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> The NGO can either use AdWords express or their Google Ads account to advertise their cause on the Google Search platform.\n\n'''Google Universal App Campaigns (UAC)'''\n\nGoogle launched a new style of campaign aimed at app developers looking to advertise their app on Google's vast ad network. On this campaign type advertisers don't get to pick who sees their ad and what their ad looks like. Rather the options are to chooses some text, images, a destination and a target bid and Google will do the rest for you. Using machine learning Google will try and figure out the best audiences for you using the budget set.\n\n== Technology ==\nThe AdWords system was initially implemented on top of the [[MySQL]] database engine. After the system had been launched, management decided to use [[Oracle database|Oracle]] instead. The system became much slower, and eventually, it was reverted to MySQL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|title=eldapo: Let's get a real database|last=Lembo|first=Phil|date=May 30, 2007|publisher=Eldapo.blogspot.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305152003/http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|archivedate=March 5, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Eventually, Google developed a custom distributed [[Relational database management system]] (RDBMS) known as Google F1 specifically for the needs of the Ad business, which requires strong consistency, high scalability across data centers, and powerful SQL queries.\n\nThe interface has also been revamped to offer better workflow with additional new features, such as Spreadsheet Editing, Search Query Reports, and better [[Conversion marketing|conversion]] metrics.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAll ads on AdWords are eligible to be shown on Google's search engine. Advertisers also have the option of enabling their ads to show on Google's partner networks. This \"search network\" includes [[AOL|AOL search]], [[Ask.com]], and [[Netscape]].\n\nThe Google Display Network (GDN), formerly referred to as the \"content network\", shows AdWords ads on sites that are not search engines. These GDN sites use [[AdSense]] and [[DoubleClick]], the other side of the Google advertising model. AdSense is used by website owners who wish to make money by displaying ads on their websites. Click-through rates on the display network are typically much lower than those on the search network and quality score for Display Network is calculated separately from Search network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?answer=140351|title=Quality Score: Definition - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\nFurther, Google automatically determines the subject of pages and displays relevant ads based on the advertisers' keyword lists. AdSense publishers may select channels to help direct Google's ad placements on pages to increase the performance of their ad units. There are many different types of ads that run across Google's network including text ads, image or banner ads, mobile text ads, and in-page video ads. In February 2016, Google began removing right-hand side ads from AdWords on a desktop in favor of only showing text ads above and below organic search results. Product Listing Ads and the Google Knowledge Graph were unaffected, and can still appear on the right-hand side.\n\n==Account management==\n[[File:Google Headquarters in Ireland Building Front Entrance.jpg|thumb|Google's headquarters in Ireland where all EU Google Ads account management takes place.]]\nTo help clients with the complexity of building and managing AdWords accounts, [[search engine marketing]] agencies and consultants offer account management services. This allowed organizations without advertising expertise to reach a global online audience. To help regulate Best Practices for AdWords Management, Google implemented the Google Partner Program and the Google Individual Qualification Program, both of which require individuals and agencies to meet benchmarks and pass exams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3125774?hl=en|title=About Google Partners - Google Partners Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref> Google also has its own in-house team of account managers who are assigned to clients to help optimize campaigns, increase returns and keep customers engaged in the platform. Smaller accounts will be assigned to a pool of account managers, whereas larger spending Google Ads users are given a dedicated account manager.\n\nGoogle also provides an offline account management software, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170322133444/https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/adwords-editor/ AdWords Editor].\n\nThe My Client Center feature is available to Google Professionals, regardless if they have passed the exam or budget parameters yet. With this feature, a Google professional has access to a dashboard summary of several accounts and can move between those accounts without logging into each account.\n\nThe [[Google Keyword Planner|Google AdWords Keyword Planner]], formerly the Keyword Tool, is a free AdWords tool which gives estimated traffic-per-month for the mentioned keywords. It provides a list of related keywords expected to be equally successful for a specific website or keyword.\n\nThe Google Display Planner is an AdWords tool to identify display network keywords, placements, and topics. It helps in expanding the reach of display campaigns while targeting relevant users for a business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3056153?hl=en|title=Display Planner: Definition - Google Ads Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\n==Costs calculation methodology==\n\nThe cost of a Google AdWords campaign depends on a variety of factors which include bidding strategies and organization goals. As a result, the amount that an organization needs to spend varies based on industry and the keywords on which they bid. Whenever a user conducts a search on Google, AdWords runs an auction to determine which search ads are displayed on the search results page as well as the ad's position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1704424?hl=en%7Ctitle=How|title=How costs are calculated in AdWords - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Factors===\n\nThere are four main factors that affect the cost and bidding factors of a Google AdWords campaign.\n\n* Your Bid - The maximum amount you are willing to pay for a click to your ad.\n*Keywords - Keywords that you target have great impact on the cost as well.  \n* The Quality of Your Ads - The relevancy and usefulness of your ad in contrast to the website it links to.\n* Extensions & Other Ad Formats - The relevance of your ad extensions or call outs and how frequently they are clicked.\n\n==Legal context==\nAdWords has generated lawsuits in the area of [[trademark law]] (see ''[[Google, Inc. v. Am. Blind & Wallpaper Factory]]'' and ''[[Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.]]''), fraud (see ''[[Goddard v. Google, Inc.]]''), and [[click fraud]]. In 2006, Google settled a click fraud lawsuit for US$90 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11734026|title=Google settles advertising suit for $90 million|publisher=[[NBC News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=March 8, 2006}}</ref> March 2010, Google was involved with a trademark infringement case involving three French companies that own Louis Vuitton trademarks. The lawsuit concerned if Google was responsible if the advertisers purchasing keywords violate trademark infringement. Ultimately, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Google AdWords were \u201cnot a breach of EU trade mark law, but that the content of some advertisements that are linked by Google keywords may well be in breach depending upon the particular facts of the case.\u201d <ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.mondaq.com|title= European Union: Google Adwords And Online Advertising: Trade Mark Infringement?

Although the Australian Sex Party amended its website to display tax deductibility information, Google continued to ban the ads. The ads were reinstated on election eve after it was reported in the media that the Australian Sex Party was considering suing Google. On September 13, 2012, the Australian Sex Party lodged formal complaints against Google with the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] and the Australian competition watchdog, accusing Google of \"unlawful interference in the conduct of a state election in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] with corrupt intent\" in violation of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/no-sex-party-please-were-google-20120913-25tn8.html No Sex Party please, we're Google] [[Sydney Morning Herald]] September 13, 2012</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in ''[[Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc.]]'' that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit [[trademark infringement]] when it purchased AdWords and other search advertisements using competitor [[1-800 Contacts]]' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging that its search advertising trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and is scheduled to appear before an FTC [[administrative law judge]] in April 2017.<ref>David O.

Prior to this, paid advertisements could feature different landing page URLs to that of what was being displayed on the search network.

The concern prompting the restriction change is believed to be the premise on which users clicked advertisements. In some cases, users were being misled and further targeted by AdWords advertisers prior to this change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2616010?hl=en|title=Display URL: Definition - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\nAs of December 2010, Google AdWords decreased restrictions over sales of hard alcohol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adwords.googleblog.com/2010/12/change-to-adwords-advertising-policy-on.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312104348/http://adwords.blogspot.com/2010/12/change-to-adwords-advertising-policy-on.html|url-status=dead|title=Change to the AdWords advertising policy on alcohol|archivedate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> It now allows ads that promote the sale of hard alcohol and liquor.

The municipal area comprises the [[Cadastral community|cadastral communities]] of Obervellach proper, Pfaffenberg, Lassach, and S\u00f6briach.\n\n==History==\nThe settlement of ''Velach'' was first mentioned in a 10th-century deed issued by the Bishop Abraham of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Freising]] (d. 993/94), a [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] missionary among the [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|East Alpine Slavs]] in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] (former [[Carantania]]), known for the Slovene [[Freising manuscripts]]. The name is probably derived from Slavic ''bela'' (\"white\"). The local church was mentioned as 'Freising basilica' in 1072, it later became the seat of a [[deanery]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Salzburg|Salzburg archbishops]].\n\nThe traditional [[gold mining|gold]] and [[silver mining]] area from the 12th century onwards was a possession of the comital [[House of Gorizia]] (G\u00f6rz); in 1164 their ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' took their residence at [[Burgruine Falkenstein (Oberfalkenstein)|Falkenstein Castle]] high above the valley. The Counts of Gorizia also held nearby [[Burgruine Groppenstein|Groppenstein Castle]], first mentioned in 1254. Obervellach market rights were attested in 1256. After an armed conflict over the inheritance of late Count [[Ulrich II, Count of Celje|Ulrich II of Celje]], in which the Count [[Leonhard of Gorizia]] and his brother [[John II, Count of Gorizia|John II]] were defeated by the forces of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], the area of Obervellach in 1460 finally was incorporated into the [[Inner Austria]]n possessions of the ruling [[House of Habsburg]].\n[[File:Obervellach - Oberbergmeisteramt.jpg|thumb|left|Mining authority building]]\nThe settlement remained an important mining area; the Habsburg emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] himself confirmed the market rights and in 1509 decided on Obervellach as the seat of the Inner Austrian mining authority (''Oberbergmeisteramt''). The present-day [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] church building was built around 1500, it was consecrated by Bishop [[Berthold of Chiemsee]]. A notable [[Renaissance]] altar was installed about 1520 at the behest of the Imperial captain [[Christoph Frankopan]] (Frangipani), brother-in-law of the Salzburg prince-archbishop [[Matth\u00e4us Lang von Wellenburg]]; it includes several pieces by the [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Dutch]] painter [[Jan van Scorel]] (1495\u20131562).\n\nIn the 17th century, gold and silver deposits were progressively depleted, they were replaced by new [[copper]] mines. When the travel writer [[Joseph Kyselak]] toured the region in 1825, he found Obervellach a still prosperous settlement. The Obervellach municipality was established in 1849, it then also comprised neighbouring Mallnitz, [[Flattach]], and the cadastral community of Penk (part of the [[Rei\u00dfeck]] municipality since 1973), which all became independent in 1896.\n\nThe Tauern Railway line was inaugurated in 1909, with a station near the village of Kaponig high above the Obervellach centre, which was accessible by a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] until 1975. The station was finally closed in 1999, today trains stop at the ''Tauernschleuse'' [[car shuttle train|car shuttle]] station in Mallnitz (''Mallnitz-Obervellach'').\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Obervellach - Gemeindeamt2.JPG|thumb|Town hall]]\nSeats in the municipal assembly (''Gemeinderat'') as of 2015 local elections:\n*[[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP): 7\n*''Mut f\u00fcr Obervellach'' ([[Independent politician|independent]]): 7\n*[[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6): 3\n*[[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6): 2\n\n==Twin towns==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Austria}}\nObervellach is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Freising]], Germany, since 1963\n*{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Dilbeek]], Belgium, since 1973\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Seltz]], France, since 1979\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Muggia]], Italy, since 1984\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Hemer]], Germany, since 1985\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Kreuzau]], Germany, since 1987\n*{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[15th district of Budapest]], Hungary, since 1997\n*{{flagicon|Slovenia}} [[Municipality of \u0160kofja Loka|\u0160kofja Loka]], Slovenia, since 1997\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Obervellach}}\n*[http://www.obervellach.gv.at/ Municipal website] {{in lang|de}}\n*[http://www.obervellach-reisseck.at/en/ obervellach-reisseck.at]\n\n{{Cities and towns in Spittal an der Drau (district)}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Spittal an der Drau District]]\n[[Category:Kreuzeck group]]\n[[Category:Goldberg Group]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Place in Carinthia, Austria}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name            = Obervellach\n| native_name     = \n| settlement_type = \n<!-- Images     -->\n| image_skyline   = Obervellach Hauptplatz 08042007 27.jpg\n| imagesize       = \n| image_caption   = Main square\n| image_shield    = Obervellach CoA.svg\n| shield_size     = 80x110px\n| shield_link     = \n<!-- Maps           -->\n| pushpin_map         = Austria\n| pushpin_mapsize     = 270\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location within Austria\n| image_map           = \n| mapsize             = \n| map_alt             =\n| map_caption         = Location within [[Spittal an der Drau District|Spittal an der Drau]] district\n<!-- Location    -->\n| coordinates       = {{coord|46|55|N|13|12|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type  = Country\n| subdivision_name  = [[Austria]]\n| subdivision_type1 = [[States of Austria|State]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Carinthia]]\n| subdivision_type2 = [[District (Austria)|District]]\n| subdivision_name2 = [[Spittal an der Drau District|Spittal an der Drau]]\n| parts_type        = \n| parts_style       = para\n| p1                = \n<!-- Leaders -->\n| leader_title  = [[Burgomaster|Mayor]]\n| leader_name   = Anita G\u00f6ssnitzer ([[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]])\n| leader_party  = \n| leader_title1 = \n| leader_name1  = \n<!-- Statistics -->\n| area_footnotes   = {{Austria population Wikidata|area_footnotes}}\n| area_total_km2   = {{Austria population Wikidata|area_total_km2}}\n| area_metro_km2   = \n| elevation_m      = 690\n| elevation_max_m  = \n| elevation_min_m  = \n| population_as_of = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_as_of}}\n| population_footnotes = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_footnotes}}\n| population_total = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_total}}\n| population_urban =  \n| population_metro =  \n| population_note  = \n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| established_title = \n| established_date  = \n| timezone          = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| timezone_DST      = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset        = +1\n| utc_offset_DST    = +2\n| registration_plate = \n| postal_code_type   = [[List of postal codes in Austria|Postal code]]\n| postal_code        = 9821\n| area_code_type = [[Telephone numbers in Austria|Area code]]\n| area_code      = 04782\n| website   = [http://www.obervellach.at www.obervellach.at]\n| footnotes = \n}}\n'''Obervellach''' ({{lang-sl|Zgornja Bela}}) is a [[market town]] in the district of [[Spittal an der Drau District|Spittal an der Drau]], in the [[Austria]]n state of [[Carinthia]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:PfaffenbergObervellach.jpg|thumb|left|M\u00f6ll valley with Obervellach (left) and Tauern Railway line]]\nThe settlement is situated in the valley of the [[M\u00f6ll]] river, on the southern slope of the [[High Tauern]] mountain range, where the [[Tauern Railway]] line descends from neighbouring [[Mallnitz]] and the southern [[Tauern Railway Tunnel|Tauern Tunnel]] portal.
